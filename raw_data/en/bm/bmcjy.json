To: The women who have sought my advice as a naturopathic physician and lent me their trust and condence The women in medicine The women who have made a difference in my lifeThis page intentionally left click hereThis page intentionally left blank FOREWORD ixI've long been a fan of the work of Dr. Tori Hudson, the foremost national leader in natur- opathic and botanical medicine specically forwomen. And unbeknownst to her, Dr. Hudsonhas been a guiding light for me in using botanicaland naturopathic approaches to women's healthproblems for many years. Long before herbal medicine enjoyed its current mainstream accept-ance, my patients who were interested in naturalapproaches to their gynecologic problems broughtme copies of Dr. Hudson's articles and even thetext that she wrote for her students to ll in theinformation gap about gynecology and naturalmedicines that existed in the naturopathic trainingprogram where she teaches. In this text, entitledGynecology and Naturopathic Medicine: A Treat-ment Manual , Dr. Hudson set down natural treat- ment protocols that she had used effectively foryears to treat the kind of women's health problemsthat I was seeing every day, ranging from irregularperiods and menstrual cramps to hot flashes. As a conventionally trained allopathic gynecologist, Iwas gratied to learn about and help my patientsapply some of Dr. Hudson's gentle, natural, andplant-based approaches. They were an excellentcomplement to the standard gynecologic care Iwas already practicing. So when Dr. Hudson called and told me about her new book, I was delighted. Here in onevolume is everything a woman needs to know tobegin applying gentle, natural, naturopathicsolutions to her health problems on her own,along with guidance about when she needs toseek professional help. Many of these solutionsare available at your local natural food store.Some are even available in your own kitchen.Many naturopathic approaches stand alone as a viable, safe, and effective treatment option.Others can be used in an integrative approachalong with conventional medicine. Some womenand situations will require the most conventionalof medical treatments. Dr. Hudson's book helpsto sort through these options. In general, thenaturopathic treatments outlined in this bookoffer safer and gentler solutions to many women'shealth problems that can be applied to helprebalance the body and restore it to health longbefore more serious conditions develop. Women have used the healing power of plants since the beginning of time. Now Dr. Hudsonbrings her years of scientic and clinical expertiseto the eld of natural, plant-based healing andhelps make it safer and more effective for womenthan ever before. This is a book that should be inevery woman's health library and every alternativepractitioner's library, and it is a resource for thenew breed of conventional practitioners open to amore integrative health-care system. \u2014Christiane Northrup, M.D. , author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom and The Wisdom of Menopause Copyright \u00a9 2008 by Tori Hudson.

This page intentionally left blank ACKNOWLEDGMENTS xiThroughout the course of writing the origi- nal book, and now the second edition, I have had overwhelming moments of gratitudefor all the people that have helped. I have reflected on those who helped me with the rst edition: Norman Goldnd, the original publisher. Dr. Susanna Reid, who worked withme from almost the very beginning when she wasstill a student at the National College of Naturo-pathic Medicine. If it were not for her, I wouldnot have learned to use a computer. Thanks toher weekly tutoring, I nally achieved at least afunctional level of competence. Susanna was crit-ically involved in the research of information forthe rst edition of the book and in planning itsorganization and format. I also want to thank Dr.Sandoval Melin for his expertise in the area ofexercise. Sandoval has elevated the role of exercisetherapeutics in the rst edition of the book andis responsible for its inclusion. I would also like to thank my editor of the second edition, Deborah Brody. She graciously accommodated my need for additional time anddistinctly improved the feel and readability ofeach chapter. Dr. Elizabeth Newhall generously gave of her time and expertise as an obstetrician and gyne-cologist for the rst edition. If it were not for hergenerous sharing of her conventional medicalknowledge over the last 14 years, my expertise inwomen's health would not have been complete. I am fortunate to have a very talented and supportive sister, Karen Hudson. Not manywomen have the good fortune to have a sisterthat knows everything they do not know. Beingin business together at our clinic, A Woman'sTime, is the perfect blend of what we each dobest. Our joint commitment of delivering health-care options to women is our work and our play.My family has been very supportive through- out my entire career. My mother, Pat Lawrence, has provided me with lifelong love, support, andtrust and has always made it clear that I am worthyand special. She's also the one that keeps me intouch with what the media are communicatingabout alternative medicine. Not everyone has her own clipping service from all the popular mag-azines and regular updates on what's happening on \"Oprah,\" \"20/20,\" and the rest. Her husband,Dick, who has now passed on, was my special proj-ect man. All the things I haven't had time for\u2014hanging the Christmas lights, cleaning the gutters,staining the deck\u2014what a guy! My real father, KenGuenther, made it possible for me to go back toschool and receive an education in naturopathicmedicine, and I thank him for providing the sup-port and resources that allowed me to pursue acareer as a naturopathic physician. My stepdad,Jack Hudson, who passed away at too young anage, gave me the gift of learning and doing all thethings normally reserved for boys. My niece, Jana,delights me with her spirit and resilience. Sometimes I cannot believe my good fortune to have Doug Stapf in my life\u2014trusted businesspartner at Vitanica, easygoing Texan friend,fellow basketball fan, the most excellent of menone could hope to know and work with. Having become a naturopathic physician in 1984, I am honored to be an alumna and facultymember of the National College of NaturopathicMedicine (NCNM) these last 24 years. TheNational College of Naturopathic Medicine isthe oldest college of naturopathic medicine inthe United States, and the expertise and experi-ence of its faculty in the eld of natural medicineare exceeded by no other college in the country. Ihonor the faculty, administration, and employeesof NCNM for their commitment and vision. Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. My naturopathic colleagues as a whole, and particularly the members of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, are anincredible community of individuals with anextraordinary commitment to living on thisplanet in a respectful, mindful way and healingthe humans of this planet in gentle ways that uti-lize the medicines of Mother Nature. I could not have succeeded in the generation and manifestation of two important projects (theInstitute of Women's Health and Integrative Medicine and the Naturopathic Education andResidency Consortium) without the years of sup-port, trust, and guidance three McFarland of T ransitionsfor Health/Emerita. Several other people have lent their profes- sional, business, academic, and personal supportand extended themselves in various ways: MichaelMurray, N.D., of Natural Factors; Don West,R.Ph., of Lloyd Center Pharmacy; Rick Liva, N.D.,and Jackie Germain, N.D., of Vital Nutrients;Ronnie Boyer, M.D., of The Center for Educationand Development in Homeopathy; Riley Liv-ingston; David Hanning of Thore-son Plummer, Ph.D., of Pharmax; KyleBliffert of Nordic Naturals; Ken Koenig, D.C., Woman Michael Schaeffer of Well-ness Naturals; Steve Wickham Metametrix;Brehan Griswold of Emerson Ecologics; and ShaneMcCamey of Boiron. I have a special place in my heart for the daily privilege I have in working with my associates atA Woman's Time. This group of women practi-tioners are extraordinary in their work and trulyan incredible pleasure to work with. I am grate-ful for their camaraderie and collaboration in allthat we do together: Barbara McDonald, N.D.,L.Ac.; Stephanie L.Ac. I would also like to thank our clinic staff, a formidable group of ne women who extendtheir skill, compassion, ethics, and care ofpatients and coworkers on a daily basis: Tamara,Kim, Whitney, Susan, Renee, and Audra. In order to practice an integrative medicine approach, I have had the guidance and support ofmany conventional practitioners in the Portlandcommunity. I can't possibly list them all, but hereis an important beginning list: Mike them fortheir open-mindedness and erce commitment totheir patients and medicine. When things are up and things are down, or even just content, my trusted friend, playmate, and condent Dee Packard is one of those specialbeings the universe has brought into my life. Iconsider myself fortunate to have the lovingfriendship and committed support of EileenStretch, Cindy Phillips, Holly Lucille, NiralaJacobi, Kate Krider, Patti Kohler, T racy Waters,Laurel Haroon, Steve Austin, Kathy Hitchcock,and Sidney Henry. I also thank my specialfriends Lupita and Jon McClanahan who teachand share with me the \"beauty way\" of theNavajo people. To K. C. Snellgrove, D.C., Ithank you for keeping my body going, despitelong hours at my desk, and I thank her able xiiACKNOWLEDGMENTScoworker, Lucille Gouge, who always seems to t me into the schedule for a treatment. To Bette Joram, Ph.D., I thank you for your intellect and remarkable insights, your contain-ment, your support, and your trustworthiness. And to Ann Kafoury, L.P .C., I thank you for your skill, your grace and compassion, your trustin me and trustworthy ways, and your commit-ment to me and my own healing. I also want to thank all the women I have treated over these last 24-plus years. I am a betterteacher, better physician, and better person because of you. For those with whom I've played, worked, nourished, and loved, you have brought aboutmy evolution as a human being. Finally, we all owe our gratitude to the women who seek safe, effective, respectful medi-cine and choices in their health care. You havechanged history on more than one occasion andprotected our humanness.xiiiACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis page intentionally left blank xvThe second edition of Women's Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine would not have been possible without the studious help of two col- leagues in particular: Leigh Kochan, N.D., L.Ac.,and Randi Ledbetter, M.D. Dr. Kochan is aformer resident and now an associate at our clinic,A Woman's Time, in Portland, Oregon. She hasspent countless weeks and months assisting me incompiling the scientic literature of the last sevenyears, particularly for updated research in herbaland nutritional therapies. Her efforts have keptme from feeling overwhelmed and made thisdaunting project of updating the book a real possibility. Dr. Randi Ledbetter is a gynecologistpracticing in Portland, Oregon, at The Meno-pause Clinic. She has generously offered her gyne-cological expertise to me and other alternativepractitioners these past many years and now hasextended that to helping me to rewrite and updatethe sections on conventional medicine. I considerthese sections of the book vital in the education ofpatients and fellow practitioners.My gratitude and appreciation for the contri- butions of Dr. Leigh Kochan and Dr. Randi Led-better are immense and will extend long into thefuture. Without their knowledge and assistance,this would have been a much longer and morearduous process.

T wo themes have been consistent: natural medicine and the health care of women. Alternative medicine has come to be the popular term used to distinguish natural, nonin-vasive therapies from conventional medicine.Whether the terms alternative medicine ,comple- mentary medicine ,natural medicine , or holistic medicine are used, they all reflect the transforma- tion that is occurring in health care: a focus ondisease prevention, the promotion of healthylifestyle habits, and the treatment of disease withnatural, nontoxic, and less invasive therapies. Atthe center of this transformation is a distinctsystem called naturopathic medicine. The roots of naturopathic medicine are seen in the healing traditions of Egypt, India, China,Greece, Germany, South and Central America,Africa, and native North America. The Europeanhydrotherapy tradition had a strong influence onthe development of naturopathy, and by the endof the nineteenth century, Benedict Lust, a physi-cian trained in the water-cure methods of Europe,came to America and began using the term natur- opathy to describe an eclectic combination of nat- ural healing principles and methods. The rst college of naturopathic medicine in the United States opened in New York City in 1902. It taught a system of medicine that included nutritional therapy, natural dietetics,herbal medicine, homeopathy, manipulation, ex-ercise therapy, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, andstress reduction techniques. Naturopathic medicine grew and flourished from the early 1900s until the mid-1930s. At thatpoint in history, the conventional medical profes-sion began to influence the health-care system inseveral ways. It abandoned some of its barbaricbloodletting therapies and toxic mercury dosingand replaced them with more effective and lesstoxic treatments. With therapies more acceptableto the public, subsidies from wealthy foundations,the support of the developing pharmaceuticalindustry, and political savvy and legislation in itsfavor, conventional medicine was able to restrictthe use of unorthodox doctors, midwives, herbal-ists, and others and gain a virtual monopoly onthe health-care system. Fortunately, alternative medicine and naturo- pathic medicine have seen a rebirth in the last 15to 20 years, and especially in the last 5. A publichungry for choices in their health care, an increased awareness about the role of diet andlifestyle in cancer and chronic disease, the aging ofthe baby boomer generation, and the failures ofcertain aspects of modern conventional medicineand the health insurance industry to deal withpeople and their health problems respectfully,carefully, fairly, and effectively have been responsi-ble for this resurgence. Conventional medicine hasbrought great insights, successes, and miracles ofwhat human intelligence can accomplish. Naturalmedicine has matured, particularly in the areas of scientic research, educational institutions,number of licensed practitioners, and profession-alism and is now poised to serve those who seek itsgentle ways. Naturopathic medicine is its own distinct healing art and is best dened by its principlesand therapies. Simply put in modern terms,naturopathic physicians are primary health-careproviders, family physicians who specialize innatural medicine. The following seven principlesare the foundation for naturopathic medicine: 1. The healing power of nature ( vis medica- trix naturae ).The body has the inherent ability Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. xviiiINTRODUCTION to establish, maintain, and restore health. The physician's role is to facilitate and augment thisprocess with the aid of natural, nontoxic thera-pies; to act to identify and remove obstacles tohealth and recovery; and to support the creationof a healthy internal and external environment. 2. First, do no harm ( primum no nocere ). Naturopathic physicians seek to do no harmwith medical treatment by employing safe,effective, less invasive, and natural therapies. 3. Identify and treat the cause ( tolle causam ).Naturopathic physicians are not only trained to investigate and diagnose diseases,they are also trained to view things more holisti-cally and look for an underlying cause, be itphysical, mental, or emotional. Symptoms areviewed as expressions of the body's attempt toheal but are not the cause of disease. The physi-cian must evaluate fundamental underlyingcauses on all levels, using treatment thatincludes addressing the root cause rather thanjust suppressing symptoms. 4. Treat the whole person. Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism, involvinga complex interaction of physical, spiritual,mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, andsocial/cultural/economic factors. The physicianmust treat the whole person by taking all ofthese factors into account. Homeostasis andharmony of functions of all aspects of the indi-vidual are essential to recovery from disease,prevention of future health problems, andmaintenance of wellness. 5. Physician as teacher ( docere ).The naturo- pathic physician's major role is to educate,empower, and motivate the patient to takeresponsibility for his or her own health. Thephysician educates about risk factors, hereditarysusceptibility, lifestyle habits, and preventivemeasures and makes recommendations on howto avoid or minimize future chronic healthproblems. A healthy attitude, diet, exercise, andother lifestyle habits serve as the cornerstone ofour recommendations.6. Prevention is the best cure. The ultimate goal of naturopathic medicine is prevention.This is accomplished through education andpromotion of lifestyle habits and through natu-ral therapeutic recommendations. The emphasisis on building health rather than on ghtingdisease. 7. Establish health and wellness. The pri- mary goals of naturopathic physicians are toestablish and maintain optimum health and topromote wellness. They strive to increase thepatient's level of wellness, characterized by apositive emotional state, regardless of the levelof health or disease. In addition to these seven principles, there are two principles that I believe are fundamental notonly to natural medicine, but to good medicinein general: the principle of resonance and theprinciple of choice. Let me explain. Resonance is basically an issue of compatibility. Whatapproach, what therapy, what herb, or what ofany substance is compatible with this particularpatient in this particular moment and set of lifecircumstances? The selection of the therapeuticapproach that is resonant with the individual isthe therapy that will create the most healingmomentum. Picture a child on a swing. Youstand behind the child pushing her forward soshe can achieve the most momentum, and herswinging becomes effortless. If you push her atthe right moment, your force is perfectly timedwith her body motion and the rhythm of theswing. The perfect timing sends her smoothlyand easily higher, and with the slightest effort shecan keep swinging forever. If you push her at thewrong moment, the swinging becomes jerky, sheloses speed and height, and the rhythm is dis-rupted. It then takes a great deal of effort toregain momentum. The perfect effortless swingcomes from the perfect timing and perfect force-fulness of the \"push.\" This is resonance. Theperson with the health problem is the child onthe swing. The person who pushes the swing isxixINTRODUCTION the physician and the therapy she uses. Any med- icine, natural or pharmaceutical, can be resonant.The art of medicine is to know when to use what,for whom, and for how long. I believe the mostprofound healing principle in the practice ofmedicine is the principle of resonance, notwhether the medicine is natural or synthetic, alter-native or conventional, or a naturopathic philoso-phy versus conventional allopathic philosophy.The healing method is the medicine that is rightfor that person. The true goal of a physician is to perceive what is resonant with that individual. Dr. John Bastyr was considered by most naturopathic physicians to be the modern patri-arch of naturopathic medicine. A whole newgeneration of naturopaths looked to him fortheir wisdom as the holder of true naturopathicmedicine. The story goes, a young naturopathicmedical student asked Dr. Bastyr, \"How are wesupposed to know what therapy to choose when there are so many different medicines andsystems to choose from?\" Dr. Bastyr calmly andquickly responded, \"Choose what works.\"Another question was posed to Dr. Bastyr: \"Howcan you tell an excellent physician from a goodphysician?\" Dr. Bastyr's answer: \"The results.\" My second guiding principle is that of choice. Each patient chooses what is right for her. Thedoctor's role is to educate about the health prob-lem, about the options, including their pros andcons, and to share resources. The goal is to providethe context in which the patient can make aninformed decision. The physician must be percep-tive and must listen, investigate, evaluate, educate,offer recommendations, and then create an envi-ronment where the individual can make a decisionfor herself. The individual seeking my help gets to choose. It may be black cohosh, or it may beestrogen. It may be a rigorous naturopathic health regimen, or it may be surgery. It may be an inte-grated combination, a \"complementary\" approachusing the best of two worlds. Choice is a powerfulforce\u2014the force of individual responsibility,empowerment, and self-direction. Choice fosterswill, desire, discipline, and motivation. Freedom of choice occurs in an environment of equalityand respect between physician and patient. These two principles, resonance and choice, are what motivates me toward the vision of anintegrative health-care model. I no longer believein a fractionated approach to health and healingwhere alternative medicine is on one side andconventional medicine is on the other. There is aspectrum of options that go from simple to com-plex, from the least intervention to the mostaggressive intervention, and from the most natu-ral therapy to the most synthetic or technologi-cal. We need all of it. Human intelligence hascreated incredible tools and techniques. Thephysician who is educated and aware of all theoptions and learns to understand how and whento best use all these choices on behalf of someonewho is ill and suffering is the true physician inmy book. An integrative model incorporates thenatural/naturopathic perspective and the con-ventional perspective and knows the strengthsand weaknesses of each in different circum-stances. When we can do something effectivelyand safely with nontoxic, natural medicines withfar fewer side effects, then what would stop us? Ifwe can't, or it's too risky to wait and nd out,then let's move up the ladder to more invasive,riskier medicines with more side effects that maywork better or be a more appropriate choicebecause the risk of the disease is greater than therisks of the treatment. Naturopathic and other alternative medicine disciplines have their strengths and their weak-nesses. Conventional medicine has its strengthsand its weaknesses. I encourage consumer andpractitioner alike to advocate for practitioners ofall disciplines to integrate their intelligence,experience, and energies to build cooperativeworking relationships with each other so thatthey can truly help people to choose what worksbest for them. In addition to recommendations on lifestyle, diet, and exercise, naturopathic physicians utilizexxINTRODUCTION a vast array of therapeutic tools to promote health and treat illnesses. Naturopathic physi-cians are trained in what is called the eclectic tra-dition. They have a broad range of therapies andtend to use a selected mixture of these therapieswhen treating their patients. Naturopathic thera-pies include dietary and lifestyle changes, clinicalnutrition (nutritional supplementation), botanicalmedicine (herbs), homeopathy, Chinese medicineand acupuncture, hydrotherapy, manipulation,physical therapies, psychotherapy, and minor sur-gery. We also recognize the judicious use of pre-scription medications when the benets exceedthe risks, integrated into a comprehensive naturo-pathic health-care plan. Some naturopathic physi-cians receive extra training and licensure topractice obstetrics and natural childbirth. And now for the second consistent theme in my life: the delivery of health care to women.Modern women are the rst women in history toenjoy the luxury of anticipating that their lives willbe healthy, long, and self-directed. This awarenessof opportunities and choices is leading them todayto seek the benets of natural medicine in ever-increasing numbers. More dominant and discrim-inating consumers of health care than men orchildren, and quicker to grasp the advantages of avitalistic, holistic healing art, their innate wisdomhas already led to many signicant changes in conventional medicine in recent years. Womeninsisted on natural childbirth, and now it is thegoal of most pregnant women and available every-where. They have too long felt the restrictions ofpaternalistic conventional medicine with its uni-formity and lack of individualization of healingapproaches and are therefore more than ready toembrace the natural principle of treating the indi-vidual. Moreover, the success of natural treatmentsin relieving disease and suffering has done much topromote their popularity. The now well-recognizedneglect of women in allopathic conventionalresearch and the failure to prioritize women'shealth in general have left a profound gap in healthcare that alternative medicine is well poised to ll.Women want safe, effective, affordable medi- cine. Women want to be educated about theirbodies and their health. Women want to makechoices in their health care that they have deter-mined are right for them. By philosophy, bydesign, and by commitment, alternative healingsystems have the package to offer women whatthey want. Beginning with the AMA's exclusion of women in the late 1800s, orthodox medicine'slack of respect for women both as healers andpatients has been all too obvious. Today, signi-cantly more empowered women have come toreject the dictums of orthodox medicine in greaternumbers. Women intuit the limitations of the biomechanical model to completely explain phys-iological processes. Despite the orthodox physi-cian's uniform advocacy for menopausal hormonereplacement therapy (HRT) for all, only a frac-tion, less than 20 percent of women, comply; 90percent of the women who begin HRT stopwithin the rst year of use. Partially a failure ofaccess, it is also a profound testimonial to theirlack of trust in conventional medicine's safety, ef-cacy, and commitment to their well-being. The creation of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s was unquestionably revolution-ary for women in that it suddenly allowed per-sonal life autonomy through successful fertilitycontrol and the elimination of the hot flashes andmood swings of menopause. Women's lives werechanged forever. However, with hormonescoming as they did on the heels of the \"miraclemedicine era\" in which antibiotics and vaccinesled the general public to believe medicine coulddo no wrong, the consequences of hormoneexcess and side effects were not anticipated orquickly recognized and dealt with. Up until2002, most conventional practitioners recom-mended a postmenopausal lifetime on HRT.This has recently changed, and the data havebegun to show that the risk of breast cancerincreases after ve years of use. Consequently,many women distrust and fear hormonal medi-xxiINTRODUCTION cine and their conventional physicians. Unfortu- nately, this fear and mistrust may lead to therefusal of a medicine that in some cases mayachieve more benet than risk. Here's where theintegrated wisdom and approach come in. Whileclearly not a panacea, hormones are not all badand have important uses for selected individuals.We can also use hormones in a form that mayenhance their benets and minimize their risks,or use a combination of a reduced dose of hor-mones along with soy and herbal medicines tobring about the most benet with the least risk. Women today are insisting on participating in their health-care decisions in a way conven-tional medicine is just beginning to recognize. I believe that the baby boomer menopausalwoman is having and will continue to have amore signicant impact on our health-caremodel than any other previous group of health-care consumers. Menopausal women today rejectthe notion of a single therapeutic modality beingessential for all women undergoing a naturalprocess. They reject the notion of taking a drugfor the rest of their lives, especially if they haveother options, especially if they can do otherthings to help prevent osteoporosis and heart dis-ease, and especially if that drug increases theirrisk of a life-threatening disease. Women are the biggest consumers of health care in America. A menopause supplement to OB-GYN , the journal of the American College of Ob-Gyn, states, \"Focus groups, involvingwomen age 40 to 60, reveal that women knowmore about herbal medicines than about estro-gen.\" That seems an impressive testimonial to thepower of alternative medicine in its alliance withthe natural wisdom of women to dene their ownhealth-care standards. It is an invitation to alterna-tive medicine to continue to provide women withthe wider, healthier options they seek. Fifty per-cent of American women will be menopausal bythe year 2015, and they will provide alternativemedicine the greatest opportunity yet to serve ourcommunities.In addition to practitioner-delivered natural health care, natural medicine offers safe andeffective self-care options for many commonconditions such as vaginitis, PMS, brocysticbreasts, menstrual cramps, menopause symp-toms, bladder infections, and more, furtherexpanding women's health-care autonomy. I support the self-care approach to healing. Much of the practice of medicine is not particu-larly difcult or complex. Education andresources can provide a lot of very practical infor-mation. One of the things I've tried to do in thisbook is not only to provide some self-care treat-ments for common female disorders but also toprovide guidelines about when self-care is notappropriate. Health care is a team approach: thepatient, the practitioner, the therapies. The teamcan include both the alternative and the conven-tional practitioner\u2014and, better still, those thattalk to each other on behalf of the patient. Choice in doctors and medical approaches, involvement in the health-care process, healthylifestyles, and safer, nontoxic natural therapies arerecognized by today's women as essential to healthand well-being. Women highly value the longertime spent in discussion with their alternativeprovider as well as the careful, complete, andrespectful collection of their history. They valueprocessing their options thoroughly and individu-ally. This unique quality of alternative health-caresystems is rare in conventional medicine and is oneof the chief reasons women seek alternative care. Naturopathic physicians and other providers of alternative medicine must seek to verify the\"scientic\" truth of their medicines wheneverpossible\u2014by research and by modifying themechanistic model when necessary to suit theirvitalistic philosophy. They must continue tostand by their tradition of resonance betweenpatient and therapy, ever seeking the resonancefor a particular woman with a particular problemat a particular time in her life. Last, alternative medicine must recognize that conventional medicine, while inadequate alone, isxxiiINTRODUCTION here to stay and offers important options and life- saving measures. Likewise, conventional medicinemust recognize that natural therapies are a funda-mental healing tradition of all cultures and thatmodern alternative medicine is also here to stay.The more practitioners make themselves aware ofthese options, the better they can guide women inselecting from all options, both naturopathic and conventional. A combined, well-thought-out coop-erative and integrative approach is often the bestthat medicine has to offer. Our open-mindednesswill be rewarded manyfold by the improved healthof women and their increased trustin their health-care ENCYCLOPEDIA ofNA TURAL MEDICINEThis page intentionally left blank 1OVERVIEW Change sin the amount of menstrual blood flow, duration, and pattern are among the most common health concerns that women face. Although these changes cause a lot of anxiety forwomen and do warrant a medical evaluation,most cases of abnormal bleeding are due tobenign and easily addressed conditions. Whetheralternative or conventional treatments are usedfor intervention, prompt evaluation is highly recommended. There are many causes of abnormal bleeding, but our main purpose in this chapter is to discussa benign hormonal cause of bleeding called dys-functional uterine bleeding (DUB), abnormaluterine bleeding without any demonstrableorganic cause. First, we need a little backgroundand overview on abnormal bleeding in general. A wide variety of clinical disorders can mani- fest as abnormal bleeding from the vagina. Whatis considered abnormal bleeding depends on theage of the patient. The bleeding can take manyforms, including heavy and/or prolonged postmenopausal are dened as vaginal bleeding that occursapproximately every 28 days (with a range of 21to 35 days) and lasts for 4 to 7 days. Abnormalbleeding is bleeding that occurs more frequentlythan every 21 days, less frequently than every 35days, lasts more than 7 days, is unusually heavy orlight, or occurs after menopause. In addition,vaginal bleeding is considered heavy if a womanloses more than 80 ml of blood per cycle (normalis 30 to 35 ml).Benign Abnormal Bleeding The causes of abnormal bleeding can be benign, premalignant, or malignant. Benign causes canbe further subdivided as either organic or hor-monal. Organic disorders are all benign causes of bleeding that are not hormonal. This mayinclude systemic health problems, abnormalpregnancy, foreign bodies, trauma, infections,and growths. Systemic diseases that are associated with problems in how the blood clots are called coag-ulopathies and can cause heavy vaginal bleeding.Heavy bleeding in a teenage girl may be causedby a coagulopathy called von Willebrand's dis-ease. In fact, 20 percent of teenage girls withsevere menorrhagia have a signicant coagulationproblem. A decrease in the number of bloodplatelets (thrombocytopenia) can also causeabnormal bleeding. Other systemic diseases, suchas hypothyroidism and severe liver diseases, canalso cause prolonged menses, heavy menses, orintermenstrual bleeding. An abnormal pregnancy is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding in womenwho are of reproductive age. Any type of mis-carriage can present with abnormal bleeding that is also often associated with cramping pains.Women with an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancyin the fallopian tubes rather than the uterus) canpresent with abnormal bleeding, as can thosewith a molar pregnancy (an abnormality of theplacenta caused by a problem when the egg andsperm join together at fertilization). Abnormal bleeding in children can be caused by foreign bodies that they may have placed intheir vaginas while playing. The most commonforeign body in women of reproductive age is an IUD, or intrauterine birth control device. 1ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDINGCHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

T rauma during intercourse can cause vaginal bleeding, for example in postmenopausal womenwho may have a dry vagina with thinning vaginaltissue. Just the friction of normal vaginal penetra-tion during sex may be traumatic to this sensitivetissue. T rauma may also be experienced in a violentsituation such as sexual abuse and rape. In childrenor adolescents, sexual abuse must be considered incases of traumatic vaginal bleeding. T raumaticbleeding may also occur after gynecological proce-dures such as biopsies and instrumentation. Occasionally, a uterine infection called chronic endometritis can present with abnormalvaginal bleeding or spotting. Other symptomsoften associated with this infection include avaginal discharge, fever, abdominal/pelvic pain,or lower back pain. Of the most common causes of abnormal bleeding are growths known as myomas, morecommonly referred to as uterine broids. Thesetend to be more common in women over the ageof 30, particularly women in their 40s. Differentkinds of broids are discussed in Chapter 19, butsubmucous broids tend to be the most trouble-some in terms of heavy bleeding. Fortunately, theyrepresent only about 5 to 10 percent of all broids. Endometrial polyps can also cause abnormal bleeding, but the bleeding is usually not heavy.Adenomyosis, a variant of endometriosis, mayresult in very heavy bleeding associated with men-strual cramping. Endometriosis itself can causeirregular changes in the menstrual cycle, but nottypically heavy menses. Finally, bleeding mayresult from cervical polyps or a simple inflamma-tion of the cervix called cervicitis. Cervical polypsand cervicitis tend to present with intermenstrualbleeding or spotting after intercourse. Malignant Abnormal Bleeding Now let us look at the premalignant and malig- nant causes of uterine bleeding. Vaginal canceraccounts for only 2 percent of malignancies ofthe female genital tract. Eighty-ve percent of the primary vaginal cancers are squamous cell(a particular cell type) carcinoma. The mostcommon symptoms of invasive squamous cellcancer include vaginal bleeding or foul-smellingdischarge. Pain is usually a late symptom. The tragedy of another cancer, cervical cancer, is that it is a preventable disease. It is pre-ceded by a prolonged precancerous state inalmost all cases and can be detected at its earlyprecancerous states by annual Pap smears. Theseearlier states of abnormal cells and cervical dys-plasias are easily treatable conditions. Cervicalcancer accounts for approximately 18 percent offemale genital cancer in the United States. Thepeak incidence of cervical cancer is from 35 to 39and 60 to 64 years of age. Vaginal bleeding aftervaginal sexual activity is the most commonsymptom occurring in cancer of the cervix. Inwomen with advanced disease, a foul-smellingdischarge may be present. Endometrial hyperplasia is an increased growth of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and asubsequent thickening. Most cases of endometrialhyperplasia revert to normal, either spontaneouslyor with hormonal treatment. Some may persist,and others can progress to endometrial cancer.Endometrial hyperplasia may occur in any agegroup but is most commonly seen in older women.Chronic lack of ovulation, as seen in the teenageyears, after menopause, and as a result of polycysticovary disease, is a condition where we may seeendometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasiacan be simple or complex, and either atypical,which is precancerous, or without atypia. Thesedistinctions are very important when it comes totreatment and management and can best be madewith a procedure called an endometrial biopsy.Pelvic ultrasound has improved to the point whereit can detect thickening of the endometrium. Oncethickening is observed, a biopsy will probably berecommended to further evaluate the situation. Some endometrial hyperplasias will progress to cancer of the endometrium, i.e., uterine3ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING cancer. As in cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer, endometrial hyperplasia is the precancer-ous state; its adequate treatment will prevent thedevelopment of endometrial cancer. Endometrialcancer is the most common malignancy of thefemale genital tract and accounts for approxi-mately 7 percent of all cancers in women. Theaverage age of patients with endometrial cancer is 59 years; the highest range for the incidence isage 50 to 59 years in postmenopausal women.The most common symptom associated withendometrial cancer is abnormal uterine bleeding.Typically, the bleeding is in the form of spotting,especially in postmenopausal women. Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) DUB can occur at any age but is most common at either end of the reproductive age span. Oneuses the term DUB when other causes for abnor- mal bleeding have been excluded (broids,polyps, and endocrine or other disorders). Ado-lescents account for about 20 percent of DUBcases after the rst menstrual cycle. These casesare due to the immature endocrine system, par-ticularly the immature function of the hypothal-amus. Perimenopausal women account forapproximately 50 percent of DUB cases due towaning ovarian function. As the ovary ages, itbecomes less efcient in completing the ovula-tory process. Initially there is a decrease in prog-esterone production, which causes shorter cycles.As the aging process progresses, ovulationbecomes less frequent, resulting in a variablelength of the menstrual cycle and a variation inthe duration of the flow. Eventually, the lack ofovulation puts women in an estrogen-dominantstate in the presence of too little progesteronebecause ovulation must occur in order to pro-duce progesterone. Women who are in a state ofchronic anovulation tend to have an excess ofestrogen in the body. This excess estrogen is whatdisrupts the normal pattern of menstruation. The remaining 30 percent of cases of DUB occur among women age 20 to 40, generally as aresult of polycystic ovarian syndrome, elevated prolactin levels, emotional stress, obesity, weightloss due to anorexia, or athletic training. The actual cause of DUB is not completely clear. One theory is that the fluctuating estrogenlevels seen in chronic lack of ovulation can causeintermittent estrogen withdrawal bleeding.Another theory is that the continuous estrogenstimulation leads to a thickening of the endo-metrium, which needs more estrogen in order tomaintain itself. Eventually, the need for estrogensurpasses the production and breakthroughbleeding results. Another theory is that someareas of the endometrium outgrow their bloodsupply, and subsequent bleeding occurs becauseof the lack of progesterone. There are also cases of DUB that are not due to anovulation but rather occur even thoughthere is regular monthly ovulation. OvulatoryDUB is dened as heavy menses in women whoovulate and who do not have a coagulopathy orany uterine abnormality. The cause of this formof DUB is not clear. DIAGNOSIS The key to accurate diagnosis of abnormal bleed- ing is the woman's medical history. Several perti-nent pieces of information will facilitate diagnosis: Previous menstrual patterns for the last three months The presence or absence of pain along with the bleeding Heaviness of the flow (number of pads or tampons per day and how often they arechanged when saturated) Contraceptive methods, if any Symptoms of pregnancy Dates and histories of past pregnancies Premenstrual symptoms Recent abdominal, pelvic, or vaginal trauma Clotting problems Easy bruising or bleeding Symptoms of systemic diseases4WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE History of taking estrogens without ade- quate progesterone/progestins History of sexually transmitted diseases Past gynecologic history A physical exam will involve visualizing the cervix, feeling the contour and size of the uterus,and general palpation of the pelvic area. Labora-tory testing may include: Pap smear Thyroid function tests Pregnancy test Complete blood count to rule out anemia Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) Liver function tests Prolactin levels Adrenal function studies Pelvic ultrasound to identify uterine broids or measure endometrial thickness Pelvic saline infusion sonohystogram Testing for sexually transmitted diseases Endometrial biopsy An endometrial biopsy may be recommended to test the tissue itself. This is a simple proceduredone in the practitioner's ofce in which the clini-cian inserts a small narrow plastic instrumentcalled a pipelle into the uterine cavity to extract asmall sample of tissue. It only takes about 30 to 60seconds, but women can experience mild to signif-icant cramping during that time. A local anestheticis usually not required, and the cramping generallysubsides very quickly once the procedure is over.Endometrial pipelle can determine thepresence of endometrial hyperplasia, uterinecancer, (endometritis), a disrupted hor-monal effect, a lack of estrogen as is seen in post-menopausal women, or a uterine polyp. If an endometrial biopsy is done at the right time, it can also be used to verify ovulation. If thebiopsy shows that the endometrium has prolifer-ated, when the woman's next bleeding episodeoccurs within 10 to 12 days, it generally indicatesa lack of ovulation. Tests such as saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS\u2014an ultrasound proce-dure that gives a three-dimensional view so as notto miss any portion of the uterine cavity), hys-teroscopy (a procedure that involves dilating thecervix so that a small lighted scope can be insertedto visualize the intrauterine cavity), or a dilationand curettage (D&C) may be recommended inaddition to or instead of the pelvic ultrasound andthe pipelle biopsy in selected cases to improveaccuracy of the results. KEY CONCEPTS Seek and utilize a health-care practitioner who will distinguish DUB from benign, premalignant, and malignant causes. If benign, is the causeorganic or hormonal? Workup will include a medical history and may include a physical exam and further laboratorytests, pelvic imaging, and/or endometrial biopsy. Do not self-treat unless assured that the cause is DUB. Practitioners can often presume a diagnosis of DUB temporarily and recommend a further workup depending on response to the treatment. PREVENTION Reduce stress. Avoid taking any form of estrogen without ade- quate progesterone or progestins. Engage in healthy lifestyle habits. Protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases. Use well-tolerated forms of contraception. Have regular medical visits, including an annual physical exam. Maintain optimal body weight. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS The goals of alternative treatment for DUB are the same as the goals of conventional treatment: con-5ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING trol the bleeding, prevent and treat anemia, restore an acceptable menstrual pattern, and preventendometrial hyperplasia/endometrial cancer. Repeated episodes of heavier and prolonged bleeding should be distinguished from acutehemorrhage. My general guidelines are as follows: If a woman is saturating a super tampon or heavypad every hour for six to eight hours or more shewill often need some form of prescription hor-mone intervention. Herbal/nutritional interven-tions can be tried, but if there is no change withintwo to four hours, then hormonal therapiesshould be utilized. Even heavier bleeding (i.e., sat-urating pads every half hour or less) will mostlikely require surgical intervention. Monitoringphysical symptoms, blood pressure, pulse, andhemoglobin and hematocrit levels will help todetermine management of these more semi-urgent and urgent cases. Use of high-dose oral bio-identical estrogens (estradiol) and bio-identicalprogesterone (oral micronized progesterone) maybe substituted in some cases of heavier semi-acutebleeding, although the net effect is the same aswhen using conventional hormones. In moststates, licensed naturopathic physicians can pre-scribe bio-identical hormones and conventionalhormones. They would approach these dramaticsituations with the same high degree of concernand astuteness as would a conventional practi-tioner and may integrate acute antihemorrhagicbotanicals or nutrients in combination with thehormonal therapies. Less dramatic cases that still involve heavy menstrual flow will be best managed with bothan immediate plan for the semi-acute bleedingepisode, which should slow down within a fewhours to 48 hours, and a comprehensive planthat should bring results with no further episodesin one to four months. A comprehensive planmay include the use of soy and flax products toregulate the menstrual cycle, herbal extracts toaddress immediate bleeding episodes, nutrientssuch as bioflavonoids and bromelain for theirnatural anti-inflammatory effect, herbal extractsfor their ability to bring about ovulation and orderly stimulation of ovarian function, andherbs for their tonifying and astringent effects. The concept of tissue tonication is a key fea- ture of the philosophy of herbal medicine. It isthought that gynecological conditions associatedwith bleeding may occur as a result of poor tissuetone of the mucous membranes, poor uterinetone, and a constitutional weakness of the tissuesthat presents as generalized lack of tissueintegrity, in this case the uterus. The astringents(herbs that slow the loss of body fluids, i.e., men-strual bleeding) are the herbs most likely to affecttissue tone, while the uterine tonics and theemmenagogues (herbs to promote menses) aremost likely to affect uterine tone. T raditionally,the ability of an astringent herb to stop bleedinghas been attributed to the tannin content of theplants. Uterine tone is related to the ability of theuterus to function as a smooth muscle. When theuterine tone is normal, there is a normalizationof menstrual flow. A hypertonic uterus can beassociated with a delayed menses and crampinguterine pains. A hypotonic uterus is frequentlyaccompanied by heavy bleeding and a feeling ofpelvic congestion. Stress reduction has an underappreciated but signicant influence on irregular menses andDUB. A disruption in the messages between thehypothalamus (which produces gonadotropin-releasing hormones) and the anterior pituitary(which releases FSH and LH, follicle-stimulatingand luteinizing hormones) brings about a mis-timing of the release of these hormones and asubsequent lack of ovulation and/or estrogen andprogesterone production by the ovaries. Thetiming of the release of these pituitary hormones,as well as of estrogen and progesterone, is whatdetermines a normal, regular menstrual cycle.This timing can be adversely affected by stress,and by the same token, the timing can beimproved by stress reduction. A third hormoneproduced by the pituitary, prolactin, also plays animportant role in the menstrual cycle. Increased6WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE production of prolactin can inhibit the matura- tion of ovarian follicles and induce menstrualabnormalities and sterility. Prolactin release isoften stress related. Nutrition Consume a whole foods diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, quality cooking oils(canola and olive), nuts, and seeds. Emphasizesh high in omega-3 oils (salmon, tuna, sardines,halibut, mackerel, herring) and reduce saturatedanimal fats (beef, chicken, butter, cheese) to pro-mote the preferred prostaglandin pathways thatare discussed in Chapters 9 and 13 (in the discus-sions of heart disease and menstrual cramps).These preferred prostaglandins will reduceinflammation and may thereby help to reduceheavy and profuse menstrual flows. Foods high in iron in particular should be incorporated into the general diet when heavyblood loss persists on a monthly basis. Renedbreads and cereals are the single greatest nutri-tional contributor to iron-deciency anemia.Although we do have iron \"enriched\" flour, it hasonly about one-third the iron content of wholewheat flour. Brewer's yeast and wheat germ areboth excellent sources of iron, supplying about18 and 8 mg respectively per half cup. Blackstrapmolasses is not only one of the richest sources ofiron but also of many other minerals. It suppliesabout 9 mg of iron per tablespoon; dark unre-ned molasses contains 1.5 mg of iron per table-spoon, and sugar, none. Single foods high in ironprobably cannot surpass the amount found inliver and kidneys. However, I do not recommendthese because it is very difcult to get organicproducts, and these organs accumulate manymetabolic wastes. Apricots and eggs are alsorather high in iron. We often think of dark greenleafy vegetables as high in iron, but iron is dif-cult to absorb in this form. Foods such as yogurtthat contain Lactobacillus acidophilus and sour fruits and citrus juices aid in the absorption ofiron because of their high vitamin C content.T wo foods stand out in their ability to regulate the menstrual cycle: flaxseed and soy protein.Flaxseed contains a group of phytoestrogenscalled lignans that have been wo specic lignans, are absorbed after formation in the intes-tinal tract from plant precursors particularlyabundant in flaxseed. The ingestion of flaxseed powder and its effect on the menstrual cycle was studied in 18 normallycycling women. 1Each woman consumed her usual omnivorous, low-ber diet for three cyclesand her usual diet supplemented with 10 gramsper day of flaxseed for another three cycles. Allwomen were instructed to avoid soy foods. Thesecond and third flax cycles were compared to thesecond and third control diet cycles. Threenonovulatory cycles occurred among the 18women during the control diet (36 total cycles)compared to none during the 36 flaxseed cycles.The ovulatory flax cycles were consistently associ-ated with about one more day in the luteal phase(second half of the cycle) when compared to theovulatory non-flax cycles. Only one day longerbefore you bleed and a slight increase in thenumber of ovulations may not seem like much.However, over a period of months and years, thecumulative effect not only has implications forregulating the menstrual cycle but may also play apositive role in reducing the risk of breast andother hormonally dependent cancers. The influence of a diet containing soy protein on the length of the menstrual cycle in pre-meno pausal women has also been studied. 2Sixty grams of soy protein containing 45 mg ofisoflavones (a phytoestrogen compound found inhigh amounts in soy; see Table 1.1) was givendaily for one month in a study lasting ninemonths. A signicant increase in the length ofthe follicular phase (rst half of the menstrualcycle) by an average of 2.5 days and/or delayedmenstruation was observed in the six womenwho consumed the soy protein. Again, as with7ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING flaxseed, soy protein has a role not only in con- tributing to the regularity and lengthening of themenstrual cycle, but adding 2.5 days per monthand lengthening the number of days from onemenses to another may in part contribute to alower incidence of breast cancer. 3 Nutritional Supplements Vitamin A. A deciency of vitamin A may contribute to menorrhagia in adult women. Vit-amin A deciency impairs enzyme activity andhormone production in the ovaries of animals, 4 and serum levels of vitamin A have been foundto be lower in women with menorrhagia than inhealthy women. 5In the latter study, vitamin A was used as a treatment in 40 women who haddiagnosed menorrhagia as a result of a diversearray of causes. In the group who received60,000 IU of vitamin A for 35 days, menstrua-tion returned to normal in 23 women (57.5 per-cent) for a period of at least three months. Asignicant decrease in the amount of blood or areduction in the duration of the menses or bothwas obtained in 14 women (35 percent). Thevitamin A was ineffective in 3 of the 40 women(7.5 percent). The overall result with vitamin Atherapy showed that 92.5 percent of the 40 cases of menorrhagia were cured or alleviated. It is important to understand that 60,000 IU of vitamin A given for long periods of time couldlead to vitamin A toxicity, but generally thiswould only occur if doses in excess of 50,000 IUwere used for several years. Smaller doses mayproduce toxicity symptoms if there are problemsin storage and transport of vitamin A. Theseproblems are generally found only in people withcirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, or malnutritionand in children and adolescents. However, for aperiod of only one month, as in this study, vita-min A toxicity is of virtually no concern, and Iwould not hesitate to use it for this amount oftime, or up to three months. Using lower dosesof 25,000 IU for longer periods of time shouldbe considered in those cases where ongoing treat-ment is necessary to control menorrhagia. Vitamin A 60,000 IU per day for 1-3 months 10,000-25,000 IU ongoing, if necessary, but be aware of potential increase in urinary calcium loss Note: Vitamin E improves vitamin A storage and utilization, and zinc is required to mobilizevitamin A. A deciency of zinc, vitamin C, pro-tein, or thyroid hormone may impair the conver-sion of carotenes to vitamin A. Provitamin Acarotenes such as beta-carotene require thesenutrients for their conversion to vitamin A. B Complex. There may be a correlation between a nutritional deciency of vitamin Bcomplex and menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. Ithas been shown that the liver loses its ability toinactivate estrogen in vitamin B-complex de-ciency. We know that some cases of heavy mensesand intermenstrual bleeding are due to an excessof estrogen. Therefore, supplementing with acomplex of B vitamins may restore the propermetabolism of estrogen and thus have a role intreating DUB. A study done over 50 years agoTable 1.1 Isoflavone Content of Soybeans Serving Isoflavones Food Size (mg) Textured soy protein granules14cup 62 Nutlettes breakfast cereal14cup 61 Roasted soy nuts14cup 60 Tempeh12cup 35 Tofu, low-fat and regular12cup 35 Soy beverage powders (varies with manufacturer) 1-2 scoops 20-50 Regular soy milk 1 cup 30Low-fat soy milk 1 cup 20Roasted soy butter 2 tbsp 178WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE was undertaken to determine if the B-complex vitamins were effective in the treatment of thesemenstrual conditions. Although the study, donein the 1940s, was not up to today's scienticstandards, a series of consecutive cases showedthat a B-complex preparation was effective in\"prompt\" improvement in both menorrhagia andmetrorrhagia. 6The B-complex preparations used orally in the study were usually given in dailydoses providing 3 to 9 mg of thiamin, 4.5 to 9mg of riboflavin, and up to 60 mg of niacin. Vitamin B-100 Complex 1-2 capsules daily of a B-100 combination Vitamin K. Vitamin K deciency is pretty rare, but its role in the manufacture of clotting fac-tors like prothrombin and clotting factors VII, IX,and X has obvious implications for women withheavy or prolonged menses. 7Even when the cause of the excessive bleeding is not a clotting disorder,it may be prudent to use vitamin K as part of acomprehensive treatment plan. Fat-soluble chloro-phyll is a good source of vitamin K and is found infresh green juices. Consider increasing the intakeof green leafy vegetables and/or supplementingwith 150 to 500 mcg per day of vitamin K. Vitamin K 150-500 mcg per day Vitamin C. Vitamin C helps to reduce heavy bleeding by strengthening the capillaries. In atleast one study, vitamin C was able to reduceheavy bleeding in 87 percent of the women. 8Vit- amin C also is an important supplement forwomen who have acquired iron-deciency anemiafrom menstrual blood loss. It helps to increase ironabsorption and can be used to prevent anemia aswell as to treat it. Vitamin C 2,000-4,000 mg per dayBioflavonoids. Like vitamin C, bioflavonoids have demonstrated a signicant ability to reduceheavy menstrual bleeding by strengthening thevessel walls of the capillaries in women with men-orrhagia. 8Bioflavonoids also can have an anti- estrogen effect on the uterus by occupying the estrogen receptor sites and thus limiting the estrogen-stimulating effect on the endometrium.This can help to reduce bleeding. Just as conven-tional medicine prescribes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories to reduce heavy bleeding, alterna-tive medicine has natural anti-inflammatories suchas bioflavonoids that can be used for the same pur-pose. Foods high in bioflavonoids (and vitamin C)include grape skins, cherries, blackberries, blueber-ries, and the pulp and white rind of citrus fruits. Bioflavonoids 1,000-2,000 mg per day Botanicals Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ).Chaste tree is probably the best-known herb in all ofEurope for hormonal imbalances in women.Since at least the time of the Greeks, chaste treehas been used for the full scope of menstrual dis-orders: heavy menses, lack of ovulation, frequentand infrequent menses, irregular menses, and acomplete lack of menses. Chaste tree has beenrepeatedly studied in Germany. Although thefruit was used traditionally, it is the seeds that aremainly used for medicine in Europe and in thiscountry. Consequently, most of the testing hasbeen done on the seeds. Chaste tree acts on thehypothalamus and pituitary glands. It increasesLH production and mildly inhibits the release ofFSH. The result is a shift in the ratio of estrogento progesterone and consequently a \"progesterone-like\" effect. 9The ability of chaste tree to raise progesterone levels is an indirect effect and not adirect hormonal action. 10Chaste tree has also been shown to inhibit prolactin release by thepituitary gland, particularly under stress. 119ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING The rst major study on chaste tree was pub- lished in 1954,12proving the herb's effectiveness for patients hyperplasia (excessive pro-liferation of the endometrium). Although thiscondition is not technically DUB, it is impressivethat chaste tree was able to bring about enough ofa progesterone effect to reduce the hyperplasia. Ina separate study, 126 women with menstrual dis-orders took 15 drops of a chaste tree liquid extractthree times daily over several menstrual cycles. 13In 33 women who had frequent menses (polymenor-rhea), the duration between periods lengthenedfrom an average of 20.1 days to 26.3 days. In 58patients with excessive bleeding (menorrhagia),the number of heavy bleeding days was decreased. As mentioned earlier, chaste tree has an ability to inhibit prolactin production. A double-blind,placebo-controlled study done in 2005 was able toexamine the effect of a chaste tree preparation on52 women with luteal phase defects due to elevated prolactin levels. 14The dose given was 20 mg chaste tree extract daily for three months.After three months of treatment, prolactin releasewas signicantly reduced in those taking chastetree. The shortened luteal phase was normalized as was the decrease in progesterone production. In another study examining the pharmacology of vitex (another term for chaste tree), serum prolactin levels were reduced via vitex's natural prolactin-suppressive compounds, namely diter-penes. These diterpenes have dopaminergic prop-erties and bind to the DA2-receptor protein,which, in turn, suppressed prolactin release. 15 Chaste tree is the most important herb to nor- malize and regulate the menstrual cycle. Chastetree is not a fast-acting herb; do not hesitate to useit over a long period of time. In fact, results maynot be achieved until after four to six months. It isnot an herb to be relied on for immediate relief,and it will not be effective in reducing semi-acutebleeding episodes. Human and animal studieshave determined chaste tree to be safe for mostmenstruating women. It is not recommendedduring pregnancy, although this is not an absolutecontraindication, and women should not worry if they become pregnant while taking chaste tree forthe rst trimester. Chaste tree is completely safeduring lactation, and there are no known interac-tions with other drugs, but theoretically, it mightinterfere with dopaminergic antagonists. Mini-mal, reversible side effects have included itching,occasional rash, nausea, headache, gastrointestinaldisturbance, menstrual disorders, acne, and possi-bly a lowered libido. 16 Note: Aucubin and agnuside are different marker compounds found in chaste tree, used tostandardize the product to assure an effective dose. Chaste Tree 30-60 drops liquid extract or 215 mg .6% aucubin standardized extract or 175 mg .75% extract per day Ginger ( Zingiber Ofcinale ).Ginger has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase17 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)18enzymes believed to be related to the altered prostaglandin-2 ratioassociated with excessive menstrual loss. 19Pro- staglandins are hormone-like substances, and anexcess of prostaglandin 2s can cause increased painand inflammation. The most potent constituentappears to be gingerol, the pungent ingredient inthe ginger. Inhibition of prostaglandin andleukotriene formation could explain ginger's tradi-tional use as an anti-inflammatory agent, and anti-inflammatories are effective in reducing the flowfrom heavy and protracted menses. Ginger 1-4 g dry powder per day for semi-acute blood loss or ginger root extract (5%) gingerols 100 mg per day Dietary Kelp or Bladderwrack ( Fucus Vesiculosus ).A very small study of three women demonstrated that dietary kelp may be effective innormalizing DUB by decreasing 17 beta-estradiol(one of the estrogens the body naturally produces)and increasing progesterone. These pilot data sug-10WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE gest that dietary bladderwrack may prolong the length of the menstrual cycle and exert anti-estrogenic effects in premenopausal women. 20 Traditional Astringent Herbs. Astringent herbs form a large category of tannin-containingplants that are used to reduce blood loss from the reproductive tract as well as from the bowel,stomach, respiratory tract, and skin. In the repro-ductive tract, the astringent herbs are used to correct uterine or cervical bleeding. The astrin-gents most effective in uterine blood loss areoften high in tannins, but other constituents alsoexplain their mechanism of action. The followingherbs are the major astringent and herb, high in tannic acid, was relied on by early American Indi-ans to treat diarrhea, dysentery, leukorrhea, andchronic menorrhagia, especially cases of prolongedbleeding. Cranesbill was used by early practition-ers of natural medicine (the eclectic physicians) toachieve prompt and predictable results in cases ofmenorrhagia without any unpleasant side contains saponins, choline, acetyl-choline, and tyramine, all likely to be helpful infemale reproductive health. 21Chemical analysis shows that it can coagulate blood.22Its best use is in combination with other astringent and hemo-static herbs for uterine bleeding, particularly whenthere is extremely heavy flow. Shepherd's purse isa good choice for both semi-acute situations and chronic recurring episodes of DUB. Uterine Tonics. In traditional herbal medi- cine, uterine tone determines the ease of menstrualflow. If the uterus is hypertonic, then it may be dif-cult to initiate menses in a timely manner. If theuterus is hypotonic, there may be heavy bleeding.In either case, improving uterine tone will tend tonormalize and regulate menstrual bleeding. T wocategories of herbs are said to have the most effecton uterine tone and therefore bleeding. Tonics That Regulate Uterine Tone. The fol- lowing are uterine tonics or amphoterics that reg-ulate tone (both reduce excess tone and increasetone in states of laxity): Dong quai ( Angelica potent a time- honored \"female regulator\" that has been usedconsistently in traditional herbal medicine formenstrual cramps, menorrhagia, suppressed men-struation, and other disturbances of the reproduc-tive tract. It is a classic uterine tonic that has beenused to tonify a soft, less-than-rm uterus, includ-ing laxity of the uterine ligaments. It adds toneand structure to the nervous and muscular struc-tures of the reproductive female organs and regu-lates the quantity of the monthly flow. Tonics That Stimulate Menstrual Flow. The following are uterine stimulants or emmenagogues(agents that stimulate menstrual flow) thatincrease tone or muscular activity and serve to ini-tiate the is a perennial herb that grows all over the United States, and it is the root orrhizome that is used medicinally. The chemicalconstituents include alkaloids, saponins, phyto-sterols, and many minerals. As an emmenagoguethat promotes the onset of menstrual flow, itwould seem odd to use it as a treatment for men-orrhagia. Yet, traditionally, blue cohosh, whenused with other astringent herbs, acts as a uterinetonic and in fact helps to regulate the menses andthe amount of flow. Astringent and uterine tonic herbs can be used in combination formulations and used forweeks to several months. Use as a tea, liquidextract, or powdered capsule. Traditional Herbs for Semi-Acute and Acute are made in a manufactur- ing laboratory and are derived from a compoundfound in either Mexican wild yam root or soy-beans. The diosgenin plant compound from Mex-ican wild yam or beta-sitosterol from soybeans isextracted from the plant and then used to make ahormone, in this case progesterone, that is bio-chemically identical to the progesterone in awoman's body. Sometimes these are called naturalhormones, and other times they are called bio-identical hormones.Natural Progesterone. Cyclic bio-identical or natural progesterone that is given 12 days outof the month (usually day 15 of the cycle to day26) can be used to correct infrequent menses,heavy menses, and sometimes intermenstrualbleeding. This therapy substitutes for what thebody is not producing due to the lack of ovula-tion. A woman must ovulate in order to produceadequate levels of progesterone. Because naturalprogesterone is biochemically identical to human Dosage for Botanicals The herbs listed in the text with an asterisk (*) may be toxic if given in inappropriate doses, so correct dosing is very important. Use a botanical reference toassure safe dosage. Essential oil of cinnamon: 1-5 drops every 3-4 hours Other herbs: Do not exceed 20 drops every 2 hours or 1 capsule every 4 hours if using a single herb.Several herbs may be used in combination, and in these cases it is important to consult a reference book or an herbal practitioner to know the doselimitations. *May be toxic if given in inappropriate doses. See the dosage guidelines in this section.Natural Bio-Identical Progesterone A dose of 200 mg is thought to be adequate to regu- late abnormal bleeding. Natural progesterone is sev- eral times less potent than a progestin (a syntheticsubstance). Even 400 mg per day of oral micronized progesterone may not work as well as 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). Oral dosage: 100-200 mg twice daily, given 7 to 12 days per month for infrequent menses, menorrha- gia, and, occasionally, intermenstrual bleeding Cream dosage: (product that contains at least 400 mg progesterone per ounce) 14-12tsp twice daily for 12 to 21 days per month for cases of mild men- orrhagia, infrequent menses, and, occasionally,intermenstrual bleeding Sublingual tablets: 50-75 mg twice daily for 12 to 21 days per month for cases of mild menorrhagia12WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE progesterone, it is generally very well tolerated by women. One study found that while traditionalprogestin treatments such as hor-monal benets without these side effects and is aviable alternative therapy in premenopausal bleeding disorders. 24You may want to read much more on bio-identical hormones in Chapter 12. The disadvantages to the natural hormone include a short half-life (three to six hours) thatrequires giving it two to three times a day.

Some cases may require a natural estrogen/natural progesterone formulation that requires more indiv idualized dosing.13ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING capsules or tablets, and topical creams. Dosing is dependent on the delivery system and the charac-teristic bleeding problems. When treating womenwith DUB, the amount of progesterone givenmust be adequate to convert the endometrium forcomplete sloughing to avoid endometrial hyper-plasia. Continuous progesterone can be effectivein controlling menorrhagia. Natural Estradiol. To control an acute bleed- ing episode, the use of natural estradiol should bejust as effective as one of the dosing regimens ofconjugated estrogens. These hormones are pre-scription items and should be administered by apractitioner qualied to use them. One high-doseregimen would be 2 mg of estradiol every fourhours for 24 hours, a single daily dose for 7 to 10days, followed by oral micronized progesterone,200 mg per day for 7 to 12 days. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH The goals of conventional treatment for abnor- mal uterine bleeding are to control bleeding, pre-vent endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, preventor treat anemia, and restore quality of life. Whenthe diagnosis is denitely DUB, it is preferable touse medical, not surgical, treatments. To control an acute bleeding episode, 10 mg of oral conjugated estrogens (or the equivalent)administered daily as 2.5 mg four times per day areusually effective. If bleeding is not controlledwithin the rst 24 hours, higher doses (20 mg) maybe effective. Once the bleeding has stopped, oralestrogen therapy is continued at the same dosagefor a total of 21 days; the addition of a progestin,such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10mg daily, should be added for the last 7 to 10 daysof those 21 days. Alternatively, 200 to 400 mgdaily of progesterone may be substituted for theMPA. At the end of 21 days, both hormones arestopped, at which time the patient should expect alight \"withdrawal\" bleed. At this time, a strategy forlong-term management should be developed.Oral contraceptives containing estrogen and progestin are also used to stop acute bleeding,although they may not be as effective as the highdoses of estrogen alone. Three tablets of an oralcontraceptive containing a progestin plus 35 mcgof estrogen taken every 24 hours (one tabletevery eight hours) will usually provide sufcientestrogen to stop acute bleeding while simultane-ously providing progestin. T reatment is contin-ued for at least one week after the bleeding stops.The practitioner can choose from a variety ofequally effective treatment regimens. The treatment of choice for chronic, stable anovulatory bleeding is a progestogen medication.Use either MPA or norethindrone (NE) in dosesof 5 to 10 mg daily or oral micronized proges-terone (either compounded or Prometrium) 200to 400 mg daily for 14 days starting on day 14 ofthe menstrual cycle. The patient can stop the med-ications if she has begun menstruating before theend of her progestogen. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also used to reduce blood loss,especially in women who have DUB but still have normal ovulation. When NSAIDs are taken duringthe episode of menorrhagia, the effect is a 20 to 50percent reduction in blood loss. The followinganti-inflammatories are usually given for the rstthree days of menses, or throughout the menstrualflow, and seem to have similar effects: 1. Ibuprofen: 600 mg every 6-8 hours 550 mg every 6-8 hours3. Mefenamic acid: 500 mg rst dose, then 250 mg every 8 hours 4. Meclofenamate sodium: 100 mg every 8 hours 5. Naproxen: 500 mg every 12 hours NSAIDs may be used alone in some cases or combined with an oral contraceptive or proges-togen. Other, more sophisticated medical regi-mens may be used to intervene, including GnRHagonists (Lupron), androgenic steroids (danazol),14WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE or an antibrinolytic agent. However, these options have signicant side effects, and their useis limited to women who fail to respond to othermethods of drug management and who do notwant surgery. Progesterone-releasing IUDs (Mirena) are gaining interest because of their lack of systemicside effects, duration of action of ve years, and 60 to 80 percent reduction in menstrual bloodflow. They also can suppress the growth of theendometrium in oligo-ovulatory patients, therebypreventing hyperplasia or uterine cancer. There are basically three surgical options that may be considered in individual diagnostic and therapeutic. A D&C is thequickest way to stop bleeding; therefore, it is atreatment of choice in women with DUB whosuffer from anemia due to heavy menstrualblood loss or who are acutely unstable. Theproblem with a D&C is that it is only tempo-rary in most cases and does not cure the prob-lem the majority of the time. One advantage,though, is that it can give the doctor tissue fordiagnosis. 2.Endometrial ablation is a procedure to destroy the endometrial tissue. It is highly pop-ular because of the ease of treatment, the suc-cess, and the low incidence of complications.There are several types of ablations now: theoriginal roller ball loop unipolar resection, method, a bipolarelectrical mesh, a balloon lled with dextrosewater that is heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit,free-flowing hot water, and a microwave andcryo probe technology as well. The methodused depends on practitioner preference andselect uterine characteristics. All ablationsrequire IV sedation or general anesthesia andmay not be well tolerated in an ofce settingbecause of the pain of the procedure. Ablation technology continues to advance with the hopesof developing a procedure that can be done inthe ofce. 3.Hysterectomy, surgical removal of the uterus, should be reserved for the woman withother indications for hysterectomy such as uter-ine broids, uterine atypical hyper-plasia. When a hysterectomy is done forbleeding problems there is usually no need toremove the ovaries. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Changes in the pattern or amount of menstrual blood flow is one of the most common health con-cerns of women. Even though many of these casesare of no serious concern, a woman with abnormalbleeding distinctly different from her familiar his-tory should do the cautious thing and be seen bya licensed health-care practitioner such as a natur-opathic doctor (N.D.), medical doctor (M.D.),osteopathic doctor (D.O.), nurse-practitioner(N.P .), or physician's assistant (P .A.). After a thor-ough medical history is taken, a physical exam and further laboratory testing and imaging may be requested not only to adequately diagnose thecause of the problem but also to determine ifexcessive blood loss has caused an anemic state. The most worrisome situation is an acute bleeding episode. As stated earlier, bleeding thatmeets or exceeds saturation of a super tampon orheavy pad every hour for six to eight hours ormore requires medical intervention. Bleedingthat is even more severe will require immediatemedical attention to assess the need for a surgicalintervention and management of the dangers ofacute blood loss. A licensed naturopathic physician may work in tandem with conventional medical colleaguesto cooperate on an integrated approach to opti-mize the patient outcome.15OVERVIEW Tr aditionally, amen orrhea (absence of menstrual bleeding) has been classied as either primary or secondary. Primary amenorrhea means that novaginal bleeding has ever occurred by the time ofexpected initial onset (usually age 16). Secondaryamenorrhea means that vaginal bleeding has pre-viously occurred but has now ceased\u2014for threemonths in a woman with a history of regularcyclic bleeding or for six months in a womanwith a history of irregular periods. In the UnitedStates, females normally experience the onset oftheir rst menstrual period between the ages of 9 and 18. It has been estimated that the prevalenceof amenorrhea in the general U.S. female popula-tion during the reproductive years is 1.8 to 3 percent, the prevalence in college-aged women is2.6 to 5 percent, and amenorrhea may be seen in20 percent of women reporting infertility. Determining the cause of amenorrhea is one of the most challenging tasks in gynecology. Causesof amenorrhea can be organized into four classi-cations: disorders of the vagina or uterus, disordersof the ovary, disorders of the anterior pituitarygland, and disorders of the central nervous system.The causes of primary amenorrhea are often verycomplex, and approximately 40 percent of all casesare due to a chromosomal defect. Absence of avagina is the second-most-common cause, fol-lowed by testicular feminization syndrome. Othercauses of primary and secondary amenorrhea areoften overlapping. The majority of amenorrheic young women have very low levels of estrogen, and a minoritywill have subnormal, noncyclic estrogen levelswithout progesterone due to a lack of ovulation.This distinction is important in considering thelong-term implications of amenorrhea. Amenor-rhea caused by low levels of estrogen, or hypo-estrogenic amenorrhea, is associated with loss ofbone mineral density and an increased risk laterin life of osteoporosis and fractures. Lipid levelsin the bloodstream are also negatively affected byprolonged hypoestrogenic states, and this is asso-ciated with an increased risk of cardiovasculardisease. Amenorrhea without ovulation is associ-ated with an increased risk of endometrial hyper-plasia and uterine cancer because of the lack ofprogesterone and the presence of what is called an \"unopposed\" estrogen state. Polycystic ovariansyndrome (PCOS) is an example type of amenorrhea. Characteristics of PCOS includeobesity, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), acne,infertility, hypertension, and diabetes. Evaluating and managing amenorrhea is best addressed with the medical knowledge of a quali-ed primary care practitioner. Sometimes a spe-cialist in endocrinology is necessary, to rule out orconsider an array of potential diseases and disor-ders of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries,thyroid, and/or uterus. THE NORMAL MENSTRUAL CYCLE Normal menstruation results from a complex chain of events initiated in the central nervous system: 1. The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) that regulatespituitary function. 2. produces luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating hor-mone (FSH) that govern ovarian function.The main action of LH is to stimulate syn-thesis of androgens by the theca cells in theovary and progesterone synthesis by thecorpus luteum. LH also induces ovulation, 2AMENORRHEA CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 16WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE which leaves behind the corpus luteum. The primary action of FSH is to stimulate thegranulosa cells in the ovary to produce estro-gen. Both the theca cells and the granulosacells are sources of androgens (such as testos-terone) and estrogen. 3. The ovaries respond to these gonadotropins by synthesizing the steroid hormones estradioland progesterone that affect uterine function. 4. The uterus has a cavity capable of endome- trial thickening and shedding according tothe levels of ovarian hormones in the blood(estrogen and progesterone), and an outflowtract (vagina) to allow the emptying of men-strual flow. Phases of the Menstrual Cycle The menstrual cycle can best be broken into three phases. 1. Menstrual phase (menstruation): days 1-5 Estrogen and progesterone withdrawn before onset of menstrual flow of endometrial lining2. Development in ovary of a mature graaan follicle containing a mature egg Secretion of increasing amounts of estro- gen by graaan follicle Suppression of FSH when estrogen becomes follicle releasing egg (ovulation) starts the secretory phase Movement of egg through fallopian tube to uterus Formation of corpus luteum at site of rup- tured follicle Production of progesterone by corpus luteum Stimulation by progesterone of endome- trial cell growth Signicant decrease in progesterone level if implantation does not occur; menstrualphase then begins again Figure 2.1 Normal Menstrual Cycle FSH & LHIU/L 20 500 10 18 9 16 400 8 14 712 300 610 5 8 200 4 63 4 100 2 24681 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 2 821 00 0Estradiol pg/nl EstradiolProgesterone 17-OHPng/ml FSHLH Progesterone Ovulation Menses17-OH Progesterone17AMENORRHEA DIAGNOSING AND EVALUATING AMENORRHEA A good history is the most important part of the medical evaluation to diagnose amenorrhea. Thehistory will include evaluating for pregnancy, men-strual history, emotional stress, weight gain or loss, alcohol use or abuse, dietary habits, exercisehabits, medications, narcotics, drug abuse, acute orchronic illnesses, accidents or injuries, infertility,metabolic disease, immune system abnormalities,tuberculosis, hot flashes, breast discharge, head-aches, and family history. A physical and pelvic exam will conrm the most likely causes as suggested by the history.During the pelvic exam, the practitioner willattempt to determine if there is an adequate estro-gen effect on the cervix and vagina, check for thesize of the ovaries, assure the normalcy of theuterus and vagina, and observe for the presence orabsence of secondary sex characteristics (such asbreasts and pubic hair). The thyroid gland will alsobe checked, and laboratory tests will be chosenselectively to document the suspected diagnosis. Due to the complexity of amenorrhea and the diverse array of causes, it is impossible to address each potential cause in this chapter. The guiding rule in the management of amenorrhea is to diag-nose before treating. The appropriate manage-ment depends not only on the diagnosis but alsoon the presenting problem. Each woman mustthen be treated according to the specic causativefactors involved. Consequently, in the discussionof alternative treatment, we will largely focus onfour of the most common causes of amenorrhea: 1. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The pituitary secretes elevated amounts of its hor-mones, but the ovary does not respond. Exam-ple: premature ovarian failure. 2. Hyperprolactinemia. The pituitary secretes too much prolactin. Examples: secretion of FSH and LH that results in failure of the ovarian follicle to develop and, KEY CONCEPTS Successful management of amenorrhea depends on an accurate diagnosis. Amenorrhea is a symptom, not a diagnosis. The absence of menses in itself has no deleteri- ous effect on health, but it may be a presenting symptom of an underlying disorder that requires treatment. A licensed primary health-care practitioner is needed to conduct a careful history, examina- tion, and indicated tests. The most common cause of secondary amenor- rhea is pregnancy. Prolonged amenorrhea that is hypoestrogenic (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or hypogo-nadotropic hypogonadism) prior to menopause is a risk factor for osteoporosis.PREVENTION Have adequate calories in the diet. Include adequate levels of dietary fat. Keep regular daily eating habits. Avoid being underweight. Avoid obesity. Avoid excessive exercise. Practice stress reduction and management. Women with hypoestrogenic amenorrhea must be vigilant about prevention of osteoporosis and coronary artery disease. Women with anovulatory amenorrhea must be monitored for endometrial thickening and the development of endometrial hyperplasia, a precancerous state, and endometrial cancer. Women who have been diagnosed with polycys- tic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the normogo-nadotropic anovulation state, must not only be treated for current problems related to the PCOS, but they need assertive prevention for diseasesfor which they are at higher risk, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, endometrial cancer, and possibly breast cancer.18WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE hence, a lack of secretion of estradiol by the ovaries. Examples: psychological stress, weightloss, genetic diseases. 4. Normogonadotropic anovulation. Normal and LH, but the cyclic thepulsed secretions is disrupted. The ovarian folli- cles develop and estrogen is produced, but atsome stage the follicles do not fully mature.Thus, there is no ovulation but there is no signof estrogen deciency; rather, there is a proges-terone deciency. Example: polycystic ovarysyndrome. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS A licensed alternative primary care practitioner such as a naturopathic physician must rst makean accurate diagnosis as to the cause of the amen-orrhea, utilizing a medical history, physical exam,and possible laboratory testing. Naturopathicphysicians often see patients who are on extremediets due to some other health concern; sometimesthese diets are inappropriate for that individualand are the cause of the amenorrhea. Insufcientcalories and insufcient dietary fat and cholesterolmay be the culprit in some of these cases. Otherhealth-conscious individuals may have becometoo thin with a combination of diet and exercise,and they may have acquired amenorrhea becausethey have too little body fat. It is unlikely thatoverexercise alone will cause amenorrhea; it usu-ally takes a combination of low body fat and heavyexercise to induce amenorrhea. In other cases such as polycystic ovarian syn- drome (PCOS), about 50 to 60 percent of womenwill be overweight. In these cases, a 10 percentweight loss can lead to ovulation and also decreaseinsulin resistance. A diet lower in starchy carbs andhigher in healthy protein is an important strategyfor women with PCOS, whether they are over-weight or not. A holistic approach to treatment requires exploring the mental, spiritual, emotional, andphysical aspects of the patient integrated with ameticulous medical approach employing mind- body-oriented perspectives. Specic dietarycounseling may be warranted, and practitionersmay nd themselves in the unusual position ofadvocating an increase in cholesterol and otherfats in the diet and counseling patients to gainweight or exercise less. Because stress disrupts themenstrual cycle, it is also important to provideguidance about stress reduction. The goal of a natural therapeutic treatment plan for amenorrhea is to address the specicunderlying cause as would conventional medi-cine, while also taking a more constitutional andholistic approach to treatment. Even in caseswhere something specic such as an elevated pro-lactin level may be the cause, the practitionerwould want to address the mental and emotionalcomponent, support the digestion, provide toni-fying and nutritive support to the reproductivesystem in general, and more. This organ-specicas well as constitutional approach is a commontheme in many alternative medicine disciplines,and especially naturopathic medicine. The natural therapies presented in this chap- ter deal with these four general states: 1. Premature ovarian failure (See Chapter 12 for more in-depth information and treat-ment.) 2. Hyperprolactinemia3. Inadequate estrogen production4. Chronic lack of ovulation, including poly- cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Keep in mind that causes such as thyroid disor- ders, tumors, systemic diseases, genetic disorders,and others will require therapies to specicallyaddress those underlying problems, which arebeyond the scope of this book. Nutrition Both weight loss and obesity can be associated with amenorrhea. A range of weight-loss prob-lems are associated with nervosa. Anorexia pri- marily in young white middle- to upper-classwomen under age 25, yet has also been known tooccur in young men and middle-aged women.The family situation of a young woman withanorexia is very often success-achievement-appearance oriented. The pattern usually startswith a diet to control weight and a fear of excessweight when in fact the weight being gained isdue to normal maturing. There is often a preoc-cupation with food that may manifest itself bylarge intakes of lettuce, raw vegetables, and otherlow-calorie foods. Other manifestations may bechaotic eating habits and eating times, radicaldiets, missed meals, and bingeing episodes. Bulimia is a syndrome of episodic and secre- tive binge eating followed by self-induced vomit-ing, fasting, or the use of laxatives and diuretics.Bulimic behavior is frequently seen in about halfof women with anorexia nervosa. Body weight in\"pure\" bulimics fluctuates but does not fall to thelow levels seen in anorexics. Teenagers with low body weight, amenorrhea, and overachievement (excellent grades and manyextracurricular activities) need astute evaluationfor an eating disorder. Psychological counseling,consistent support, and monitoring for calorieintake will be needed to break the established pat-terns. The earlier the recognition of the problem,the more successful the intervention. Familymembers, friends, and health-care practitionersshould pay particular attention to weight and dietin young women with amenorrhea. Obese women exhibit several abnormalities in their hormone prole. Elevated serum concen-trations of androstenedione, testosterone, andDHEA-sulfate are associated more closely withthe pattern of fat distribution (abdominal vs.hips, in particular) than to the body fat mass. 1 High levels of these hormones, called androgens,are known to be a cause of menstrual irregulari-ties including amenorrhea, hirsutism (abnormalbody hair growth), and other metabolic distur-bances. In addition, type 2 diabetes, elevatedinsulin, and glucose intolerance, conditions that often co-occur with obesity and polycystic ovar-ian syndrome, are associated with amenorrheaand oligomenorrhea (infrequent menses). 2, 3 Usually, oligomenorrhea and chronic anovula-tion caused by hormonal abnormalities is thecause of the menstrual irregularity in womenwith signicant amounts of excess body fat. 2A reduction in body weight by reducing calories,increasing physical exercise, and possibly otherweight-management interventions will result in benecial changes in the hormonal prole,including a marked reduction of androgenic hor-mones and their effects. 1A reduction of weight by even as little as 5 to 10 percent can not onlyrestore regular menses, but also improve fertility. 4 Some women may have low body weight but do not have an eating disorder or exercise-induced amenorrhea. This may be a metabolismissue, a hereditary factor, or a diet that is ex-tremely low in fat although not low in calories.Women who take in insufcient calories, such asstrict vegetarians who eat no animal products orothers with extreme diets, may have insufcientdietary fat and low cholesterol. Adequate choles-terol is needed to manufacture hormones. If nocholesterol is found in the diet and the liver isnot manufacturing adequate cholesterol, thesewomen may have amenorrhea due to insufcienthormone levels. Measuring the cholesterol levelcan be telling in such cases. If cholesterol is low(below 120), a change in vegetarian philosophywill probably be necessary so that some animalproducts can be included in the diet in order toraise the cholesterol levels. Sometimes it is difcult to nd the best nutri- tional program for one's body type and lifestyle.In these cases, nutritional counseling and nutri-tional analysis with a qualied practitioner canbe very helpful. No one diet plan is right foreveryone. Not everyone needs to eat from all thefood groups, not everyone can be a vegetarian,and not everyone responds well to a high-protein or high-complex carbohydrate diet.20WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE In addition to proper food choices, another basic general principle for good nutrition is reg-ularity. Just as going to bed and rising at regulartimes with a certain amount of sleep assures ade-quate energy and vitality, regular mealtimes andconsistency in eating habits lead to good diges-tion and absorption of nutrients necessary fornormal physiology. Not all advice on nutritional habits for women with amenorrhea is related to dietary fat, calories, body weight, or eating disorders.Some nutritional guidance is relevant to the pre-vention of osteoporosis, a potential consequenceof amenorrhea. Please see Chapter 14 for moreinformation on preventing osteoporosis. Supplements Vitamin A and the Carotenes. Carotenemia, an abnormal elevation of plasma carotene levels,may result from an excessive ingestion of carotene-rich vegetables, anorexia, and impaired ability ofthe body to metabolize carotenes. 5-7Carotenemia has been linked with menstrual dysfunction andamenorrhea in some women, generally in associa-tion with weight loss. In 1968, elevated carotenelevels were observed in 9 of 12 women withanorexia nervosa who did not ingest excessiveamounts of carotenes. 8An additional study also found that patients with amenorrhea and weightloss had carotenemia. 9Another group of re- searchers found elevated serum carotene levels inwomen with anorexia nervosa, but not in womenwith normal or abnormal menstrual function. 7It is thought that mobilization of fat stores second-ary to weight loss might be responsible for hyper-carotenemia in women with anorexia nervosa. In 1971, a small study examined six women with elevated serum carotene levels who hadexcessive intake of carrots or pumpkins. 10The researcher described what he called \"goldenovaries\" and noted that amenorrhea developed inthe two younger patients and irregular menstrualbleeding in the four older patients. For sometime it was thought that exercise-induced amen-orrhea in long-distance runners was associated with hypercarotenemia, but that association wasdisproved, and no difference in carotene levelswas observed. 11 I found no reference to amenorrhea or men- strual irregularities associated with taking carotenesupplements, and, as of this writing, I don't believeamenorrhea has been reported as a side effect ofbeta-carotene ingestion. However, I will probablyencourage women who are experiencing signi-cant weight loss and amenorrhea to eat lesseramounts of carotene foods for the time being. Iwould also be inclined to reduce their vitamin Aand carotene supplementation if they were onhigh doses for some other medical reason. Calcium. One of the serious long-term con- sequences of amenorrhea due to premature ovar-ian failure or lower production of estrogen(hypothalamic amenorrhea) is a lower bone den-sity and an increased risk for osteoporosis andfractures later in life. Even when calcium intakeis the same between amenorrheic women andwomen who menstruate normally, there is adecrease in calcium absorption and an increase incalcium excretion in estrogen-decient women.There is ample evidence that a lack of estrogenincreases the daily calcium requirement. 12As a result, I recommend a higher-than-normal dailyintake (1,200 to 1,500 mg per day) of either cal-cium carbonate or calcium citrate to maintaincalcium balance in low-estrogen states in womenof reproductiv e age. (For more information on osteoporosis, please see Chapter 14.) Calcium Carbonate or Calcium Citrate orCombination 1,200-1,500 mg per day Additional Vitamins and Minerals. Many other minerals and nutrients affect bone densityand are relevant to the prevention of osteoporo-sis in amenorrheic women. Magnesium, man-ganese, zinc, copper, boron, vitamin K, vitamin21AMENORRHEA D, and other nutrients determine bone health, each in their own way. In Chapter 14, I discussthis in detail. Botanicals Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ).Chaste tree is probably the best-known herb in all ofEurope for hormonal imbalances in women. Sinceat least the time of the Greeks, chaste tree has beenused for the full scope of menstrual disorders,including amenorrhea. Chaste tree acts on thehypothalamus and pituitary glands by increasingLH production and mildly inhibiting the releaseof FSH. The result is a shift in the ratio of estro-gen to progesterone, in favor of progesterone. 13 Chaste tree stimulates ovulation, which in turnproduces progesterone. Thus, chaste tree indi-rectly raises progesterone levels, 14an effective treatment for some cases of amenorrhea. If we were to give progesterone hormone for several days, stop, and then a menses occurs, thisindicates an intact reproductive system that lackscyclicity and ovulation, or at least regular cyclicovulation. It suggests that the body is producingenough FSH to stimulate the ovaries and that theovaries can develop follicles. Furthermore, itindicates that follicular production of estrogen issufcient to cause the lining of the uterus (endo-metrium) to grow and that the sloughed endo-metrium is able to pass through the cervicalopening and the vagina. This tells us that theproblem most likely is a dysfunction in the hypo-thalamus or pituitary. The ability of chaste tree tomodulate the hypothalamus or pituitary thenmakes this herb an obvious choice. The rst major study on chaste tree was published in 1954. 15Subsequent studies have continued to prove its effectiveness. In a studypublished in 1990, 20 women with secondaryamenorrhea were admitted to a six-month studyusing chaste tree liquid extract at 40 dropsdaily. 16At the end of the six-month study, 10 out of the 15 women had menstrual cycles. Testingshowed that values for progesterone and LHincreased, and FSH values either did not change or decreased slightly. Chaste tree also inhibits prolactin release by the pituitary gland, particularly when elevatedprolactin is caused by stress, by binding dopa-mine receptors and then inhibiting prolactinrelease in the pituitary. 17, 18 Since elevated pro- lactin levels cause some cases of amenorrhea,chaste tree is also indicated for these cases. Adouble-blind, placebo-controlled study examinedthe effect of a chaste tree (vitex) preparation on 52women with luteal phase defects due to hyperpro-lactinemia (elevated prolactin levels). 19The daily dose of the extract was 20 mg, and the studylasted for three months. Prolactin release was sig-nicantly reduced in the vitex group. The shortluteal phase (second half of the cycle) was normal-ized, and the decreased progesterone productionwas normalized. No side effects were noted, andtwo women became pregnant. When using chaste tree, don't expect immedi- ate results. It's not the same as giving proges-terone, even natural progesterone. Chaste tree ismore of a medium-range plan; usually it beginsto take effect after three or four months whengiven daily. Chaste Tree 40 drops tincture or 175 mg .6% aucubin standardized extract per day Black Cohosh ( Cimifuga Racemosa ).Black cohosh has become one of the most signicantwomen's herbs in all of botanical medicine. Alsoknown as snakeroot or rattleroot, this plantbelongs to the buttercup family and is indigenousto the eastern part of North America. The nativepeoples of Canada and America used black cohoshfor many different indications, such as uterinepains during menses and childbirth, rheumatism,rattlesnake bites, and general malaise. Blackcohosh was introduced to Western gynecology inthe middle of the eighteenth century in the treat-ment of menopausal symptoms. 2022WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE The exact mechanism of how black cohosh works has yet to be elucidated. We attribute mostof its gynecological effects to its \"estrogen-like\"action, yet recent research has shown that blackcohosh does not contain phytoestrogens, nor doesit change hormone levels such as estradiol, LH,FSH or prolactin. 21-23The primary triterpene glycosides, interfere withpituitary gland receptors and the hypothalamus.Other characteristic constituents are the flavo-noids, resins, volatile oils, fatty acids, tannins,alkaloids, cimicifugin, and salicylic acid. Althoughthe constituents in black cohosh may be able tobind to receptors in the pituitary or hypothala-mus, these constituents do not seem to be able to bind to receptors in target organs. Olderresearch showed the effects of a black cohoshpreparation on LH and FSH secretion in meno-pausal women. After a treatment of two months,LH (but not FSH) levels were signicantlyreduced in the black cohosh-treated group. 24 There have been many studies using black cohosh preparations in menopausal women.These studies and the further use of this plant inmenopausal women will be discussed in muchdetail in Chapter 12. For women who have amen-orrhea due to hypoestrogenic states, a state similarto menopause, black cohosh will be important inrelieving some symptoms. Recent studies evenindicate that black cohosh may decrease risk fac-tors associated with menopause such as osteoporo-sis and cardiovascular disease and may even beeffective in preventing bone loss. 25-27 Black Cohosh 40-80 mg standardized extract twice daily Rhodiola. Rhodiola, also called golden root, has enjoyed centuries of use in Eastern Europe,Scandinavia, and Asia. T raditionally, this herbwas used in folk medicine to increase physicalendurance, work productivity, longevity, resist-ance to high altitude sickness, fatigue, depres- sion, anemia, impotence, gastrointestinal ail-ments, infections, and disorders of the nervoussystem. The folklore surrounding rhodiola led tothe rst investigations in its phytochemistry inthe early 1960s, when scientists identied adap-togenic compounds in its roots. These adapto-gens, believed to help the body adapt to stress bysupporting the adrenal glands and endocrinesystem, as well as the antioxidant and stimulatingcompounds that were later discovered in rhodi-ola, are responsible for its medicinal properties. Animal studies looking at the effect of rhodi- ola on thyroid function, adrenal function, andovarian egg maturation have raised interest inrhodiola for endocrine problems in humans.Forty women suffering from amenorrhea (loss ofmenstrual cycles) were given 100 mg of rhodiolatwice daily for two weeks or an injection for 10days. Remarkably, normal menses were restoredin 25 women, 11 of whom became pregnant. 28 Physicians have reported cases of women whohad failed to conceive with standard fertilitydrugs, who then became pregnant within severalmonths of beginning Rhodiola rosea extract. For treatment, look for extracts that are standardizedto contain 3 percent rosavin. Rhodiola (3% Rosavin) 200 mg per day daily) Maca ( Lepidium Peruvianum ).Maca is a root vegetable, in the same family as turnips andbroccoli, which grows at high elevations, native tothe high Andean plateaus of Peru. It has been usedtraditionally by native Peruvians as both a foodand medicine. It has historically been used for avariety of purposes, including hormone balancing,thyroid function, sexual function, PMS, meno-pause, and as a tonic for healthy aging. A recent study proved maca's effectiveness in treating women with amenorrhea due to hypo-estrogenic states, and especially premature ovarianfailure. In a study of 20 healthy menopausal23AMENORRHEA women in the early phase of their menopause, maca (2,000 mg per day) was given for up toeight months and was shown to lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (higher levels ofFSH are a measure of low estrogen productionfrom the ovaries) and increase luteinizing hor-mone (LH) (elevated LH is necessary to stimu-late ovulation), resulting in increases in bothestrogen levels and progesterone levels. 29These results would seem to suggest that maca, depend-ing on the length of use, could act as a hormonal toner and stimulate the production of estrogenand progesterone.

Uterine stimulants or emmenagogues increase tone or muscular activ-ity and serve to initiate the onset of menses andstimulate reproductive function. Most importantare the herbs that cause shedding of the endo-metrium and stimulate normal menstrual cyclesin the a medical journal of 1846, Dr. Thomas Ogier, a surgeon and obstetrician,published an herbal approach for amenorrhea. 31 He maintained that administering a tincture ofwater pepper successfully treated a case of obsti-nate amenorrhea. Exactly how the water pepperworks is not known.Phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens are by and large nonsteroidal hormone-like constituentsfound in over 300 medicinal and edible plants.With the currently available evidence, soybeansare probably the richest edible source of phyto-estrogens. Some plant compounds, such as lig-nans, found in flaxseed, are not phytoestrogensbut are converted to estrogens in the intestines.There are many herbs that contain phytoestrogencompounds and have a role in amenorrhea. Theysupport the reproductive cycle and relieve meno-pausal symptoms in women who are appropri-ately menopausal (see Chapter 12) as well aswomen who are amenorrheic and prematurelymenopausal. sarsasapogenin can be converted in the labora-tory to various hormones, including proges-terone, which in turn can be converted to adrenalsteroids and then to testosterone or estrogens.Even though diosgenin from plants is used bypharmaceutical companies to synthesize varioushormones, there is very little scientic informa-tion on diosgenin-containing plants and theirrelationship to Syndrome.For PCOS, include herbs that will increase *Important caution: Do not use essential oil of pennyroyal internally in any situation.24WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE sex-hormone-binding globulin.

Nettle root Green teaS o y Flaxseed Other herbs and nutrients can improve insulin sensitivity and PCOS: Chromium Fenugreek powder Vitamin C Bitter melon Licorice can lower serum testosterone in women and saw palmetto can inhibit the conversion oftestosterone to dihydrotestosterone (a strongerform of testosterone). By inhibiting this conver-sion, we can maybe modestly decrease testosterone-induced hair loss and acne. Licorice Saw palmetto Bio-Identical Hormones Bio-identical, also known as natural, proges- terone can be used for both diagnosis and treat-ment of amenorrhea. Progesterone-inducedmenses indicates that there are adequate estrogenlevels and that anatomical problems causingobstruction of the outflow of blood are not pres-ent. In these instances, the progesterone chal-lenge is an effective means of diagnosis. The progesterone challenge test is considered positive if uterine bleeding (even a few days ofspotting) occurs and correlates with a serumestradiol level of 40 g/mL or higher. Onset ofmenstruation after intramuscular injection of150 mg of progesterone in oil suggests thatanovulation is the most likely explanation of theamenorrhea. Oral micronized progesterone(OMP) (also called oral natural progesterone)administered for seven days at 400 mg per daywill induce complete secretory changes in the endometrium and induce a menses in a womanwhose uterus has been adequately stimulated byestrogen. Lack of vaginal bleeding after the prog-esterone challenge suggests either inadequatepriming of the endometrial lining, absence of anendometrial cavity, or some kind of obstruction. If no withdrawal bleeding occurs after the progesterone challenge, then it is important to usea birth control pill\u2014generally one that contains atleast 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, for 21 days. Atthe end of these 21 days, withdrawal bleedingshould occur within 14 days; even spotting is suf-cient to count as withdrawal bleeding. Absence of uterine bleeding under these circumstancesindicates uterine end-organ failure that may resultfrom congenital malformation of the uterus andvagina or from distortion of the endometrial cavityby intrauterine adhesions due to tuberculousendometritis, also called Asherman's syndrome. Ifbleeding does occur after the oral contraceptivepill, then the likely diagnosis is hypothalamicamenorrhea, after excluding a pituitary tumor. The woman who is hypoestrogenic and is not a candidate for induction of ovulation requireshormone replacement therapy. In young women,especially those in their 20s and 30s, the bestapproach is most likely to take oral contracep-tives (OCs). Hormone replacement therapy,whether bio-identical hormones or conventionalhormone replacement, could potentially be usedin the usual doses for normal-aged menopausalwomen. However, these doses are considerablylower than the body's normal level in a youngreproductive-aged woman and considerablylower than the dose of hormones in oral contra-ceptives. As these lower doses may not be ade-quate for bone protection at this young age, myrecommendation is to use a 20 to 30 mcg oralcontraceptive pill for women in their 20s and 30swho have hypothalamic amenorrhea or prema-ture ovarian failure. (Smokers older than 35 willneed to consider other options, most preferablyto stop smoking.)25AMENORRHEA Younger women who insist on using alterna- tive medicine need to fully understand their risksin premature states of insufcient hormone pro-duction. If the herbal, nutritional, and lifestyleinterventions are not sufcient to stimulate themenstrual cycle, they must understand that boneloss in amenorrheic women shows the same pat-tern over time as that seen in postmenopausalwomen. 32The loss is most rapid in the rst few years, emphasizing the need for early treatment. If bio-identical hormones are your choice as an alternative to OCs, then the following pre-scription, called bi-est (for bi-estrogen), would be considered estriol2 mg/estradiol 0.5mg/progesterone 100 mg; onepill twice daily, for three weeks on and one weekoff. Beginning medication on the rst of everymonth establishes an easily remembered routine.Some practitioners use a tri-estrogen formulationinstead of the bi-estrogen formulation. In thiscase, estriol 2 mg/estradiol0.250 mg/estrone 0.250 mg/progesterone 100mg; one pill twice daily, for three weeks on andone week off. Menstruation generally occurs within three days after the last pills, the 28th day of eachmonth. Bleeding that occurs at any other timemay indicate that the body's own function hasreturned. The natural hormone replacement pro-gram should then be discontinued and thepatient monitored for the return of ovulation. Natural progesterone creams may be used in selected cases to help maintain a monthly cycle in women with anovulatory amenorrhea. Somewomen only need this monthly lower-dose hormone support during the second half of amonthly cycle. The typical dosing recommenda-tions are from one-quarter to one-half teaspoonapplied to the palms, inner forearms, and chesttwice daily from day 15 to day 26. This cycle canbe repeated. In the event that menstruation doesnot occur, it may be necessary to return to theestrogen/progesterone plan and/or herbal/nutri-tional therapies that induce ovulation such as chaste tree extract. Exercise Amenorrhea in the female athlete is associated with reduced caloric intake and strenuous exer-cise, which leads to low estrogen and is associatedwith stress fractures, osteoporosis, and a potentialincrease in the risk of premature cardiovasculardisease. 33 Most cross-sectional studies suggest that female competitive athletes, whether runners34-39 or bodybuilders,40, 41 have increased incidence of menstrual cycle disturbance, shorter lutealphases, and amenorrhea than do sedentary con-trols. Because of subject self-selection and conse-quent oversampling, results of these studies mustbe interpreted with caution. 42Prospective studies have found no hormonal changes in women fol-lowing one year of endurance training 43and, up to 1994, had not detected induction of second-ary amenorrhea by exercise alone. 42 In her excellent review, Bonen states that sec- ondary amenorrhea \"is difcult to induce by exer-cise alone.\" 42She concludes that some of the factors thought to be associated with exercise-inducedamenorrhea\u2014type, duration, intensity of exercise,age of menarche, training before menarche, andtraining history\u2014remain speculative and that, infact, little is known about the true incidence of secondary amenorrhea in athletic populations. The higher incidence of secondary amenorrhea detected in competitive athletes appears related tometabolic factors. In weight lifters and body-builders, the appearance of luteal-phase distur-bances and oligo- or amenorrhea is directly relatedto drastic reduction in caloric intake prior to com-petition combined with increases in strenuousexercise. For example, Sandoval found that femalebodybuilders, examined for a period of 48 hoursbefore competition, achieved a degree of leannesssimilar to their male counterparts. 44Kleiner found in female bodybuilders, competing at the 1988National Physique Committee's Junior USA26WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Bodybuilding Championships, a 9.8 percent body fat (males, 6.0 percent).45In a group of female bodybuilders studied for one month pre- and post-competition, Walberg-Rankin detected a twofoldincrease in caloric intake and a tenfold increase infat intake postevent as compared to pre-event. 41 Furthermore, these unhealthy practices are fol-lowed by college-age women who compete inbodybuilding events. 46In this context, it is not surprising that in Walberg's study, 86 percent offemale competitive bodybuilders not on birth control pills reported menstrual dysfunction, andin Kleiner's, 81 percent of female elite body-builders had contest-related amenorrhea for one ortwo months precontest. The picture is similar for competitive female runners whose caloric intake is inadequate orfalls below the constant energy demanded bytheir sports. Time and again, menstrual cycle dis-turbances in these populations have been shownto be related to inadequate caloric intake com-bined with strenuous, abrupt increases in run-ning distances. 34, 42, 47-49 Amenorrhea usually is not seen in athletes with a high percentage ofbody fat. 49Since the cause of amenorrhea and other menstrual disturbances is linked to energydeciency, there is no justication for fears thatexercise itself is unhealthy for women. 50 As mentioned earlier, amenorrheic athletes show dangerous reductions in mean trabecularbone density as compared to eumenorrheic coun-terparts (42 percent). 51Exercise may intensify these effects48as well as low calorie intake itself. The effects of insufcient caloric intake on bonemineral density likely represents an for bone loss; exercise-associated amenorrhea alters additional hormonesthat play an important role in modulating boneturnover and bone mineral density in thesewomen. 52A study of amenorrheic ballet dancers treated with estrogen plus progesterone replace-ment demonstrated that there was no signicantimprovement in bone mineral density even in thosethat resumed menses. 53The hypoestrogenic state that predisposes postmenopausal women to cardiovascular diseaseis similar to that of the amenorrheic athlete and,therefore, so is the cardiovascular risk. Speci-cally, amenorrheic athletes have been shown tohave elevated LDL and total cholesterol,impaired endothelial function, and increasedlipid peroxidation. 54, 55 Though this phenome- non warrants further study, present data suggeststhat the risk of premature cardiovascular diseasedeserves attention in monitoring and treatment of these women. Finally, as shown by Bonen, menstrual distur- bances are quite common in the general popula-tion of sedentary women. Different factors\u2014weight change, starvation, crowding, travel, com-munal living, exercise, and severe stress of anykind\u2014have been implicated in altered menstrualcyclicity. 42Ronkainen and colleagues found increased abnormalities in the menstrual cyclesof women during the short sunlight days of fall. 56Thus, amenorrhea appears to have multiple etiologic relationships. Inappropriate exercise isonly one of them. Exercise Recommendations. If a woman has documented secondary amenorrhea not due topregnancy, a careful history of eating and exercis-ing habits is critical. In addition, her body weightand percentage body fat should be ascertainedand compared to the normal ranges for her bodybuild and age. For those women with amenor-rhea due to hypoestrogenic states, a bone densit-ometry test, called a DEXA scan, particularly ofthe lumbar spine and proximal femur, is highlydesirable. In cases where the history and tests recom- mended indicate inadequate calorie consump-tion, a bone mass density below normal range,and body fat less than 15 percent, the recom-mended course is as follows: Adapt diet to individual needs; particularly emphasize protein, calcium, magnesium,vitamin D, zinc, copper, and chromium. 5727AMENORRHEA Reduce or stop intensive training, particu- larly running, until cycling resumes. Modify type of exercise. Instead of running, do moderate walking (30 minutes per day)and add a regular program of moderateweight lifting for 30 minutes, three timesper week. Avoid competition in sports, on the job, and elsewhere. For those women who have PCOS and are overweight, regular and preferably almost dailyaerobic exercise in the range of two and a half tove hours per week is necessary to improve insulin resistance and lose weight. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Successful management of amenorrhea depends on an accurate diagnosis. A careful history and exami-nation and simple laboratory investigations willmost likely yield a diagnosis that allows one to offerappropriate treatment in the majority of cases. Aphysical exam should assess the signs of secondarysexual characteristics (such as breast developmentand the presence or absence of normal or abnormal Sample Treatment Plans for Amenorrhea See the Resources section for formulation sources. Premature Ovarian Failure Diet: A whole foods diet using plenty of grains, beans (especially soybeans), fruits, vegetables(especially dark leafy greens), nuts and seeds (especially flaxseed), and sh (salmon, tuna, hal- ibut, sardines) Exercise: Regular aerobic and weight-bearing exer- cise 30 to 60 minutes, 4 to 7 days per week; weight/strength training 2 days per week Mineral supplementation: Calcium/magnesium/ boron/vitamin D/other trace minerals and nutrients (see Chapter 14) Consider oral contraceptives with 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol: Estriol 2 mg/estradiol 0.5 mg/ OMP 200 mg; 1 pill twice daily, 3 weeks on and 1 week off Consider bio-identical hormones: Estriol 2 mg/ estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg; 1 pill twice daily, 3 weeks on and 1 week off Consider short-term trial (less than 6 months): Black cohosh extract: standardized extract, 40-80 mg twice daily Maca: 2,000 mg per day Rhodiola: 3% rosavin, 200 mg per day Polyglandular products: To stimulate the hypothala- mus/pituitary/ovarian feedback mechanisms, use bovine extracts of combinations of pituitary, thy-roid, adrenal, and ovarian tissue.

Pelvic ultrasound might be helpful in determining whether the ovaries are enlarged withsmall, peripherally and thyroid function may be used to helpdetermine the diagnosis. On the basis of this information, women with amenorrhea can be classied into the fourgroups mentioned earlier in chapter, withtreatments follows: 1. hypogonadism. Hor- mone therapy with second-ary sexual characteristics in girls with primaryamenorrhea. Estrogen in combination with cyclicprogestins will prevent osteoporosis, endometrialhyperplasia, or cancer. The hormone therapymedications and regimens are discussed earlier in this chapter and also in Chapter 12. Oral contra-ceptives may also be used and may even be anoptimal choice because of the higher dose ofestrogen for relieving symptoms, ease and cost, orcoverage for contraception in case the amenor-rhea is temporary and the women wants preg-nancy protection. 2. Hyperprolactinemia. T reatment with dopa- mine agonists the pituitary gland. When prolactinis elevated, a CT or MRI should be done to dis-tinguish between overactive pituitary produc-tion by a microadenoma versus an actual tumor(macroadenoma). The large tumor can be asso-ciated with headaches or vision changes andrequires surgical resection, but it is very rare.Sample Treatment continued ) Mineral supplementation: Calcium/magnesium/ boron/vitamin D/other trace minerals and nutrients (see Chapter 14) Oral contraceptives with 30 mcg of ethinyl mg (not 200 mg); 1 pilltwice daily, 3 weeks on and 1 week off Consider short-term trial (less than 6 months): Black cohosh extract: standardized extract, 40-80 mg twice daily Maca: 2,000 mg per day Rhodiola: 3% rosavin, 200 mg per day Polyglandular products: To stimulate the hypothala- mus/pituitary/ovarian feedback mechanisms, use bovine extracts of combinations of pituitary, thy-roid, adrenal, and ovarian tissue. (Each woman is unique and requires an indiv idualized approach.) Chronic Anovulation Due to PCOS Diet: Reduce carbohydrates (80 g per day) and increase protein in the diet (60 mg or more per day). Diets such as the Zone Diet can be very help-ful in this situation to reduce the hyperinsulinemia and provide better weight management. Increase soy foods and flaxseed. Emphasize whole grains,fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, sh (salmon, tuna, sardines, halibut), organic low-fat meats (chicken, turkey, beef, buffalo, elk, deer), low-fat dairy products, eggs, and beans.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In the majority of women with this classication, noorganic disease can be identied in the hypothala-mus, or ovary. Management ofhypothalamic amenorrhea associated with weightloss must focus primarily on trying to correct theunderlying cause of the weight loss. Amenorrheafrom anorexia, bulimia, and exercise-inducedweight loss requires prompt diagnosis and treat-ment. Some women will require hospitalization ina controlled environment for their malnutrition.Dietary counseling, psychological counseling, andadvice about exercise could all help to correct theproblem and restore ovarian function. If amenorrhea persists for more than 12 months, then osteoporosis should be excludedwith bone density testing, or some form ofestrogen therapy should be considered to pre-vent bone loss. Women with hypothalamicamenorrhea who wish to become pregnant aretreated by administering GnRH medications ina pulsatile manner via a portable programmablepump that releases the medication every one totwo hours, simulating the body's pulsatile secre-tions. Women with rare disorders such as thepituitary disease Sheehan's syndrome are givenhormones FSH and LH. 4. Chronic anovulation and polycystic ovary syndrome. About 30 percent of women with secondary amenorrhea have concentrations ofFSH, LH, and estrogen within the normalrange. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is acommon cause of this type of amenorrhea.Many women with this type of amenorrheaactually present with irregular menstrual pat-terns more often than amenorrhea. Thesewomen do not have estrogen butrather to continuedexposure to estrogen unopposed by proges-terone. The buildup of the uterine lining causedby the continuous estrogen can cause endome- trial hyperplasia or cancer. Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with clinical symptoms such as obesity, hirsutism,anovulation, and irregular bleeding. The rangeof problems that women with polycystic ovarysyndrome have varies greatly from woman towoman. There are signicant differences interms of the amount of acne, hair growth, men-strual irregularity, infertility, hypertension, anddiabetes. There is no current known treatmentfor the disease, so treatment by conventionalmedicine is aimed at individual patient goals andsymptom relief. Obviously, the health concernsof hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetesneed to be addressed in terms of lifestyle changesand periodic monitoring of blood pressure,lipids, and blood sugar. For the woman who hasvery infrequent menses, the prevention of uter-ine hyperplasia or cancer is most important.However, most women with PCOS haveuncomfortable side effects that can be improved. If a woman has very infrequent menstruation, she should either use birth control pills for regularmenstrual withdrawal or at least quarterly pro-gestogens that cause withdrawal bleeding. Theprogestogens that have been used include Proveraor Cycrin daily or compounded 400 mg daily for seven days; Aygestin(norethindrone acetate), 5 mg daily for seven days;and Megace (megestrol), 20 mg daily for sevendays. Most of the progestogens have similar symp-toms of nausea, bloating, moodiness, and oily skinin varying degrees, but they are usually tolerablefor a few days or a week. Hirsutism can be with treated topically with Vaniqa, which reduces the transformation oftestosterone to dihydrotesterone at the hair folli-cle, reducing the growth, or at least the size andcolor, of the hair. This product needs to beapplied once to twice daily in the areas of hair30WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE growth and works while it is being used. There is no permanent effect, so it has to be used daily.Also, electrolysis and laser hair removal are veryeffective permanent hair removal treatment. Spironolactone, an antiandrogen medication with minimal side effects, can reduce acne andhair growth. The recommended does is 50 to 200mg once daily. There has been some concern ofvery rare cases of hyperkalemia (abnormally highpotassium levels) with this product, so patientsneed to warned of cardiac arrhythmias andmuscle cramping. Metformin, an insulin-receptor-improving medication used for diabetes, has been touted todecrease weight gain and stimulate ovulation inwomen with PCOS. However, many studieshave shown minimal effect on weight gain, and ithas signicant side effects of nausea, vomiting,and diarrhea, as well as uncommon but seriousliver enzyme problems. Most practitioners useonly it for treatment of diabetes or as an adjunctin infertility. Metformin usage, along with clomi-phene and/or Pergonal, seems to improve ovaryreceptiveness and ovulation. Encouraging weightloss can help the situation tremendously, butwomen with polycystic ovary syndrome and obe-sity seem to be very resistant to standard weight-loss programs. It is possible to lose weight, butthey need to be persistent and have a good sup-port system, possibly even some help frombariatric medicine (obesity doctors). The treatment that achieves the best symp- tom control is oral contraceptives. Oral contra-ceptives can reduce hair growth, reduce acne,cause regular menstrual sloughing, suppressluteinizing hormone (LH) and ovarian cyst pro-duction, and are very widely prescribed forwomen who also need contraception. Antiestrogens such as clomiphene are some- times given to induce ovulation and may restorefertility in women seeking pregnancy. However,PCOS can be resistant to normal ovulationinduction and often requires the help of an infer-tility specialist. Sometimes metformin is added to help aid clomiphene in induction of ovula-tion, or the patient is given more intense ovula-tion induction medications such as Pergonal. Probably the most important treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome is recognition of theproblem. When counseling the patient, the focusshould be on the management of her lifelongsymptoms. We need to inform women that thisdisease comes in all shades and that there will bedifferent treatment regimens for different womenrather than one treatment for all. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) All women with amenorrhea should be evaluated by a licensed primary care practitioner (naturo-pathic doctor, medical doctor, osteopathic doctor,nurse-practitioner, or physician's assistant) becauseof the diverse array of potential diseases and disor-ders. Some of these conditions are rare, such asAsherman's syndrome, Cushing's disease, Sheehan'ssyndrome, and pituitary-secreting tumors. Othercauses are more common but can be complex, suchas malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, hyperthy-roidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and example, hypothyroidism, strenuous exercise,pregnancy, and stress-related amenorrhea. Fortunately, most women with amenorrhea have relatively simple problems that can be man-aged easily by primary care physicians, whetherthey are alternative medicine practitioners, con-ventional practitioners, or a team approach usingthe best choices of each. After an evaluation hasbeen done and a cause diagnosed, natural thera-pies can be administered as the primary therapyor integrated with the conventional treatment.Conventional treatments may be necessary inmany cases of amenorrhea, but dosing regimensmay be lower when natural therapies are used aspart of an integrated plan.31OVERVIEW Over the past four decades, cervical cancer rates have dropped dramatically in most developedcountries. This improvement in our health isattributable to the commonly available Papsmear, whereby early premalignant lesions can befound and treated, most often with fairly simpleofce techniques. Cervical cancer presently ranksthird in cancer deaths of American women,although it remains the leading cause of deathfrom cancer among women in developing coun-tries who do not enjoy the same access to diagno-sis and early treatment. 1In the United States, approximately 9,710 cases of cervical cancer werediagnosed in 2006 and about 3,700 women diedfrom it. Worldwide, human papilloma infectioncauses almost 500,000 cases of cervical cancerand 280,000 deaths each year. Squamous cell cervical cancer is virtually always preceded by cervical dysplasia, which is100 percent treatable in its noninvasive stage.(Cervical cancer of the glandular cells, adenocar-cinoma, is more problematic and requires moreaggressive treatment.) Human papillomavirus(HPV) is the most common sexually transmittedinfection in the United States, 2and about 75 percent of the U.S. adult population has beenexposed to HPV. 3Fortunately, the majority of genital HPV infections don't cause any symp-toms and go away on their own. The others goon to cause abnormal cells, including cervicaldysplasia and/or cervical cancer. Cervical cancer and dysplasia, genital warts, and condyloma are caused by the human papillo- mavirus, which is sexually transmitted. Virtually100 percent of cervical dysplasias and cervicalcancer is caused by HPV. This association is reflected in a simple rating system, in use since1988, of low- and high-grade (precancerous)lesions or, more specically, low-grade lesions referred LSIL and HSIL, respectively.In the new terminology, low-grade SIL replaces dysplasia andCIN 1 (cer- vical intraepithelial with humanpapillomavirus. High-grade SIL includes moder- ate and severe dysplasia, formerly classied asCIN 2 andCIN 3 . Both the newer and tradi- tional terms are used in this chapter and in themedical literature. What exactly is dysplasia? The mucous mem- brane that covers the cervix changes in adolescencefrom more bumpy columnar cells, like those thatalso line the uterus, to squamous cells, like thosethat line the mouth, through a normal processcalled metaplasia. Squamous cells make up all ofour external body surfaces that are characteristi-cally smooth, like our skin, for example. Wherethese two types of cells meet is called the squamo-columnar junction\u2014and it is here that our cellsare most susceptible to premalignant transforma-tion. The Pap smear samples cells from this area toexamine microscopically. The very bottom layer of squamous cells are called basal cells. They are the largest and round-est with the biggest nuclei. As the cells progresstoward the surface, they become smaller, flatter,and ultimately lose their nuclei before they get tothe top. In mild dysplasia, the basal cell layer isthicker, up to one-third the total thickness of thetissue; in moderate dysplasia, they occupy thebottom and into the middle third; in severe dys-plasia, they extend to the top third. Carcinoma\"in situ\" is not an invasive malignancy, but ratherthe extension of the immature basal cells to the3CERVICAL DYSPLASIACHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

While it does carry a higher risk of conversion to true cancer, ittoo is completely treatable. The possibility of progression to cervical cancer increases with the severity of the dysplasia.Mostly, though, it is a slow process, occurring over about 10 to 15 years in most women who areuntreated. Currently, more than 100 HPV sub-types have been identied, numbered, and catego-rized. More than 30 types can infect the genitalarea. The progression of dysplasia to cancer variesaccording to which HPV subtype one is infectedwith. The low-risk types (6 and 11) are generallyassociated with external genital warts but do notcause cervical cancer. The most aggressive or high-risk types are HPV 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35,39, 45, 51, 51, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, and 82.These can transform susceptible tissue into cancerin about 18 months, but this is the exceptionrather than the norm, and dysplasia typically takesmore than 10 years to progress to cervical cancer.In the United States, HPV 16 accounts for morethan 50 to 60 percent of cervical cancer cases, fol-lowed by HPV 18 (10 to 12 percent) and HPV 31and 45 (4 to 5 percent each). A recent study conrmed that lesions of the cervix persist longer and progress more quickly inwomen with the aforementioned oncogenic HPVtypes, known as the higher risk types, than inwomen with nononcogenic types or withoutHPV. 4However, it is important to remember that most women with the human papillomavirusnever get dysplasia at all. On the other hand, somewomen with normal Pap smears, but showinginflammation, may indeed harbor the oncogenicHPV types 16 and 18, 5suggesting women with chronic inflammation may benet from high-riskHPV screening. Some estimate that as many as 70percent of women are or have been infected intheir lifetime. On the other hand, only about 10women per 100,000 get cervical cancer. In addition to eliminating dysplasia through treatment, there can be a signicant amount ofspontaneous regression of even the most severeforms, thanks to our well-functioning immune systems. Spontaneous regression of CIN 1 andCIN 2 has been documented to be as high as 50percent to 40 percent respectively, with numbersimproving the longer women are followed (usu-ally one to three years). Almost 70 percent reso-lution of HPV alone was observed. 6 Other studies conrm this, and the majority of untreated mild dysplasias were shown to regress tonormal within two years. A critical review of theliterature on the natural history of CIN was done over a span of over 40 years. 7The author con- cluded that approximately 60 percent of CIN 1regressed to normal, 30 percent persisted, 10 per-cent progressed to CIN 3 (a high-grade lesion),and only about 1 percent progressed to cervicalcancer. CIN 2 regressed in 40 percent of the cases,persisted in 40 percent, progressed to CIN 3 in 20percent, and progressed to cervical cancer in lessthan 5 percent of cases. CIN 3 regressed in 33 per-cent of the cases and progressed to cervical cancerin more than 12 percent. A recent study demonstrates that the risk of progression from mild to severe dysplasia orfrank cervical cancer was only 1 percent per year,but the risk of progression from moderate dys-plasia was 16 percent within two years and 25percent within ve years. 8 Mild dysplasia is detected in about 1 percent of women visiting their private gynecologist andabout 14 percent of women who visited desig-nated sexually transmitted disease clinics. 6 Besides HPV, other risks include early age at rstintercourse, giving birth before age 22, cigarettesmoking, low socioeconomic status, number oflifetime partners, and possibly, although not con-clusively, oral contraceptive use. Women withve or fewer lifetime heterosexual partners hadhigher rates of regression of untreated CIN 1 andCIN 2 than did women with more than ve part-ners, independent of barrier contraceptionmethod use (condoms or diaphragms). 9It is dif- cult to separate out the effects of sexual activitywithout barrier protection from that conferred33CERVICAL DYSPLASIA by ingesting hormonal contraception. For what- ever reason, women who used these barrier meth-ods had less dysplasia. In fact, condom use wasassociated with higher rates of CIN regressionand clearance of cervical HPV infection inwomen as well as protection from genital wartsand invasive cervical cancer. 10-12 Evaluation of an abnormal Pap smear result is done by a method called colposcopy, which is alot like using binoculars to view the cervix. Thecolposcope magnies the cervix, and white vine- gar is applied to make the abnormal areas showup. Tiny biopsies are taken of these areas, a fewmillimeters at most. These are examined by thepathologist and graded into mild, moderate, orsevere as described previously. One of the most important points I am sure to explain to my clients is that cervical cancer isa sexually transmitted disease, greatly promotedby smoking, but one that usually grows slowlyover years from its precursor, dysplasia, and istreatable in all of its earliest forms. Atypia Another possible Pap smear result is atypia\u2014which is really a kind of fence-sitting cell. The cells are notchanged enough to warrant being labeled as abnor-mal, but they are not quite normal either. Usuallyatypia is either an early abnormal change or evi-dence of tissue repairing itself, for example follow-ing a birth or vaginal infection. These Pap tests areusually just repeated, but if atypia persists, thewoman should be evaluated. Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Signicance (AGUS). AGUS may be the most difcult diagnostic challenge of all the Pap smearabnormalities. AGUS represents a signicantlygreater risk of cervical cancer than atypical squa-mous cells of undetermined signicance (ASC-US, discussed later in this chapter) or low-gradesquamous intraepithelial lesions. The good news isthat AGUS is not a common diagnosis and onlyrepresents 0.13 to 0.8 percent of all Pap smears.Fortunately, there are benign changes that result in an AGUS Pap smear. These includechronic which is often women with AGUS havehigh-grade Thecomplicating problem is that AGUS cells mayalso come from the upper genital tract, such astubal or ovarian cells, or even metastasis from the pelvis. Risk Factors for Cervical Dysplasia and Cervical Cancer Smoking. Women who smoke are about twice as likely to develop cervical cancer. Human immunodeciency virus (HIV) infection. Immunocompromise results in increased risk forHPV infections. Chlamydia infection. Recent or past positive test results for chlamydia may lead to greater risk forcervical cancer. Poor nutrition. Diets low in fruits and vegetables may increase the risk for cervical cancer. Multiple heterosexual partners. Having three or more partners in a lifetime increases risk of cervi- cal cancer. Obesity. Overweight women are more likely to develop cervical cancer. Oral contraceptives. Although the research is mixed, long-term use of oral contraceptives mayincrease the risk of cervical cancer. Low socioeconomic status. Poor access to ade- quate health care, including Pap tests and treat-ment of precancerous lesions, leads to higher riskfor cervical cancer. Family history of cervical cancer. Recent studies suggest that women with a mother or sister withcervical cancer are at higher risk for developing cervical cancer. First intercourse. Women at highest risk of test- ing positive for HPV are those in the rst few years after rst intercourse. Age.HPV risk prevalence declines with age.34WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE When the report says AGUS \"favor neopla- sia,\" this is of great concern, because 50 to 100percent of patients with this test result have a signicant cervical lesion. These could include ahigh-grade CIN, adenoma carcinoma in situ, oradenocarcinoma. Even though more than 50 per-cent of women with AGUS will be found to benormal, we cannot predict this, and a normalfollow-up Pap smear may be falsely normal, orwhat is called a false negative. Therefore, a prac-titioner must carefully evaluate AGUS. Evaluation may include and in some cases a Ifthere is adenomacarcinoma in situ on biopsy, acervical Cervicalconization for any woman with AGUS \"favorneoplasia,\" adenocarcinoma in situ, or adenocar-cinoma is recommended for most women. Ifthere is frank invasion detected by biopsy, moreextensive surgery is recommended. A Note About New Technologies Most women are familiar with the Pap smear. Cells are scraped from the cervix and placed on a slide forexamination in a laboratory. There is now a newliquid-based technique in which the cervical cellscollected by scraping the cervix are placed in liquid.In the laboratory much of the mucus, blood, andinflammatory cells are removed from the cellsample. Liquid-based methods are more expensivethan conventional Pap tests but have a higher sensi-tivity for detection of lower-grade squamous celllesions and can be used to test for inwomen with atypical squamous cells of methods:the Sure-Path system and the ThinPrep Pap test. Reporting of Abnormal Pap Results About 5 to 10 percent of Pap tests performed in the United States each year are abnormal.Abnormal cells include the following: ASC-US: atypical lesions.Women with ASC-H are at greater risk forCIN 2 or CIN 3. For this reason, andbecause detection of high-risk types of HPVis much more common with ASC-H, therecommendation is that getcolposcopy and biopsies. LSIL: squamous intraepithelial lesion\u2014early changes in size, shape, andnumber of abnormal cells. Lesion refers toan area of abnormal tissue, and intraepithe-lial means that the abnormal cells are pres-ent in the surface layer of cells, not thedeeper glandular layer. This is considered recommended. HSIL: high-grade squamous intraepithelial There may be a few, or there may bemany. This is obviously more severe andserious and has a higher likelihood of pro-gressing to cervical cancer. Colposcopy andbiopsies are recommended. ASC-US and ASC-H: HPV testing is recommended. LSIL and HSIL: These are generally not tested for HPV typing, as it does not alterthe course of treatment. If the results of the Pap smear are ASC-H, LSIL, or HSIL, the clinician should perform orrecommend a colposcopy and biopsies. This is theonly certain way to evaluate the abnormal cells anddetermine the appropriate course of treatment. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Cervical dysplasia is an excellent example of what preventive medicine can accomplish because, inalmost all cases, it is a preventable disease. Through35CERVICAL DYSPLASIA lifestyle habits, dietary factors, nutritional supple- mentation, and regular Pap smears, most cases ofcervical dysplasia and its consequence, cervicalcancer, could be avoided. Natural medicine perspectives on cervical dys- plasia are consistent with conventional medicine'sunderstanding that the human papillomaviruscauses virtually all cases and that this virus is sexu-ally transmitted. Many cofactors serve as cocar-cinogens in the development of cervical dysplasia,including smoking, nutrient deciencies, immunedeciency, and possibly oral contraceptives. Wherenatural medicine diverges in its approach is inadvising patients what they can do about thesecofactors. In addition, there are nutrients that canbe used in supplement form both to prevent theprogression of cervical dysplasia to cervical cancerand to reverse some cases of dysplasia.Recommendations for Pap Smear Testing For women up to age 29: annual Pap with con- ventional smear, or every two years using liquid-based smear For women 30 years and older: if three consec- utive normal Paps, may go to every two tothree years unless history of DES or HIV or immunocompromised Note: Despite these recommendations, consider that all women should have annual Paps; this is to ensurethat they also get an annual exam. Begin Pap smeartesting approximately three years after onset of vagi-nal intercourse, no later than 21 years of age. Stop screening: for women 70 years or older who have had three or more consecutivenormal Paps after age 60 Women with ASC-US and ASC-H can receive HPV testing to determine low-risk high-risk HPV subtypes Women with ASC-H, LSIL, and HSIL should get a colposcopy and biopsies KEY CONCEPTS Cervical dysplasia is a sexually transmitted dis- ease transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Condoms do not fully protect because HPV extends onto skin beyond the condom, but theymay impart some protection and may enhancepossibility of regression of low-grade lesions to normal. The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes virtually all cases of cervical dysplasia, although most women exposed to HPV actually never get dysplasia. Cervical dysplasia is classied as either low-grade or high-grade and, if left untreated or if the body is not able to reverse it on its own, can progressto cervical cancer, especially if a person is infected with the oncogenic strains of HPV. Cervical cancer of squamous cells is a preventable disease. Pap smears are screening tests, not diagnostic tests.PREVENTION Annual Pap smears are the single most impor- tant factor in preventing cervical cancer and in detecting earlier grades of cervical dysplasia. The use of condoms during intercourse is a sig- nicant tool in preventing exposure to HPV, reducing the risk of chlamydia and HIV, andreducing the risk of cervical dysplasia. Reduce sexual risk factors: multiple partners, sexual exposure to men who have genital warts, sexual exposure to men sexually exposed towomen with genital warts or cervical dysplasia, and intercourse prior to age 18. Avoid smoking. Eat a healthy whole foods diet rich in green, yellow, orange vegetables and lignans. Use folic acid supplementation if using oral contraceptives. HIV-positive women and women who are immunosuppressed because of kidney dialysis orimmunosuppressive medications are at higherrisk for cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer and need more frequent screening. Consider contraceptive options other than oral contraceptives.36WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Cervical dysplasia is both a local problem in- volving the cervical tissue immunity and healthand a systemic problem involving generalimmune health and resistance to viral exposure.The overriding goals of natural treatments are toreduce exposure to the human papillomavirus,reduce cofactors, correct nutrient insufciencies,improve local immune response, strengthen gen-eral immune health, and prevent the progressionto cervical cancer. NUTRITION Cervical cancer has been studied in relationship to many dietary factors. In general, diets high in vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin E, selenium,and other substances found in fruits and vegetableshave been found to be protective in at least somestudies. 13-17A recent study found that higher levels of vegetable consumption were associated with a54 percent decrease in risk of HPV persistence.Also, a 56 percent reduction in the persistence ofthe virus was observed in women with the highestplasma cis-lycopene concentrations comparedwith women with the lowest plasma cis-lycopeneconcentrations. These results suggest that veg-etable consumption and circulating cis-lycopenemay be protective against HPV persistence. 18 Another report revealed that the risk of chronicHPV infection was lower among women reportinghigher intake of the following foods: carotenessuch as beta-cryptoxanthin (found in eggs, yellowand orange fruits and vegetables), lutein and zeax-anthin (eggs, dark green vegetables), vitamin C,and, specically, papaya. 19 In the treatment sections of this chapter, I emphasize a vegetarian diet, one that is high infruits and vegetables, especially yellow-orange oneslike carrots, yellow squash, cantaloupe, peaches,and corn. In China, consumption of both animalfoods (including meat, eggs, and sh) and greenvegetables was signicantly correlated with a lowerdeath rate from cervical cancer. 20One study among white women showed that risk of cervicaldysplasia and cervical cancer was not affected byincreased consumption of vegetables, yellow- orange vegetables, fruits, or legumes. 21Nonethe- less, there is enough evidence to support a diet richin benecial vegetables. Phytoestrogens may also play a role in lowering premalignancies of the cervix. A recent studydemonstrated that plasma levels of equol andenterodiol, two isoflavonoids, were positively asso-ciated with a lower cervical dysplasia risk, and inaddition found a nonsignicant positive associa-tion with enterolactone, a lignan. Consistent withthese results, dietary sources of lignans, includinggarlic, onions, grapefruit, seeds, seaweed, and taro,were positively associated with lowered CIN risk. 22 Indole-3-carbinol, found in cruciferous veg- etables such as broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts,cauliflower, and kale, has the potential to preventand treat several cancers. Eating these foods altersestrogen metabolism in such a way as to reducethe carcinogenic metabolites of estrogen metabo-lism. Women with CIN 1 or 2 have altered estro-gen metabolism and have higher 16-alphahydroxyestrone, a potent carcinogen, and fewer 2-hydroxyestrogen metabolites than women with noabnormal cells of the cervix. Supplements cervi-cal cells plays an etiologic role in the develop-ment of cervical dysplasia. 24In addition, a signicant decrease in plasma beta-carotenelevels is found in women with either cervical dys-plasia or cancer of the cervix. 25 It has been suspected that carotenes like lycopene, found in tomatoes, are more responsi-ble for an improvement in dysplasia than is beta-carotene or the other carotenes. 26In fact, recent studies have found that high serum levels oflycopene and alpha-carotene are associated with adecreased risk cervical dysplasia, 27and increas- ing serum levels of lycopene to37CERVICAL DYSPLASIA increase clearance of oncogenic HPV infections by over 50 percent.28, 29 My own research study investigating natural treatment methods for cervical atypia, cervical dysplasias, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix used beta-carotene supplementation as one part ofa multifactorial supplementation and local treat-ment protocol. I found a high success rate using this combination protocol. Most of the women weregiven supplements of 150,000 units of mixed natu-ral carotenes daily for a minimum of three months.Of 43 women studied, 38 patients returned tonormal, 3 patients had partial improvement, 2 stayed the same, and none of the patients pro-gressed to a worse state of dysplasia during thecourse of the natural treatment protocol. 30, 31 The full treatment protocols for each degree of dysplasia are described in the treatment plans inthis chapter. Overall, my approach has been to rec-ommend increased sources of carotenes in the dietas well as supplementation. There are potentialconcerns about using beta-carotene by itself, espe-cially in women who are at higher risk for lungcancer. As a precaution, I avoid beta-carotene sup-plementation in women at high risk for lungcancer (smokers), and for everyone else, I only rec-ommend products that have mixed carotenes andnatural carotenes. Careful label reading is essential.If the label doesn't say \"natural,\" then the producthas synthetic beta-carotene. Do not be alarmed if your skin turns an orange tint when supplementing with high amounts ofcarotenes. It is merely a pigment and is not a signof liver toxicity. Carotenes are not toxic. Carotenes Mixed, natural carotenes, 75,000 IU twice daily 25,000-50,000 IU for prevention (see treatment plans) Vitamin A. Studies have shown that dietary vitamin A protects against cervical cancer. Womenwith lower serum levels and dietary intakes of totalvitamin A are signicantly more likely to have dysplasia or carcinoma in situ than women with ahigher intake of these nutrients. 32-34 Another study showed that the rate of progression fromdysplasia to cervical cancer was nearly ve timeshigher in women with lower serum retinol levelsthan those with higher serum retinol levels diets rich in vitamin A and high-retinol foodsmay reduce risk of in-situ and invasive cervicalcancer. 36In addition, in vitro studies conrm that vitamin A and its analogues inhibit the prolifera-tion of HPV infection through apoptosis (celldeath) and inhibition of cell growth rates. Such therapy is promising in decreasing the progressionof early cervical lesions to cancer. 37-39 Topical vitamin A is an important form of treat- ment as well. In one study of 301 women, topicalvitamin A (retinoic acid) increased the completeregression rate of moderate dysplasia from 27 per-cent in the placebo group to 43 percent in the treat-ment group. Women with severe dysplasia failed torespond. 40An earlier, well-known study on topical vitamin A and dysplasia on the exocervix (externalsurface of the cervix) at the University of Arizonahad comparable results, eliminating the disease in10 of the 20 women. Five of the 10 had mild dys-plasia, and 5 had moderate dysplasia. 41Too few patients had severe dysplasia to evaluate. This nd-ing was replicated recently in a study of three differ-ent doses of topical retinoic acid in women withCIN 1 and 2. 42In my own research, vitamin A sup- positories were applied topically as part of a multi-factorial systemic and local treatment plan. (Theprotocol is described later in this chapter.) Vitamin E. Low levels of serum vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk of allstages of CIN and cervical cancer and high levelsassociated with a decreased risk. 43-46Low levels of vitamin E combined with decient levels of vita-min A have been associated with an increased riskof oncogenic HPV infection. 47One study demon- strated a greater than 50 percent inhibition of proliferation of HPV-infected cells in vitro. 48In addition, vitamin E is a potent antioxidant and,therefore, may mitigate the oxidative damage asso-38WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ciated with cervical dysplasia and cancer.49In a recent study, women with CIN or cervical cancerwere found to have low levels of vitamin E andother antioxidants\u2014like glutathione, vitamin C,and CoQ10\u2014were found to be low, while mark-ers of lipid peroxidation were found to be high,both corresponding to severity of disease stage. 50-52 Vitamin E can help in the treatment of cervi- cal cancer as well by improving the efcacy ofradiation therapy and enhancing tumor responseand chromosomal damage of cancer cells while concurrently protecting normal cells. 53 Vitamin C. The possible role of vitamin C in preventing cervical dysplasia is of special interestbecause vitamin C is involved in collagen synthe-sis, detoxies chemical carcinogens, interferes withthe formation of chemical carcinogens, and mod-ulates the immune system. It has been demon-strated in more than one study that there is asignicant decrease in vitamin C intake as well asplasma levels of vitamin C in patients with cervi-cal dysplasia. 54, 55Vitamin C supplementation has not been studied by itself as a treatment for cervi-cal dysplasia. It was a part of the comprehensivetreatment protocol in my research study. Vitamin C 2,000-6,000 mg per day 1,000-2,000 mg per day for prevention (see treatment plans) Folic Acid. There have been several studies using folic acid supplementation in women withmild and moderate cervical dysplasia, with con-flicting results. In one study, women with mild ormoderate dysplasia received 10 mg daily of folicacid supplementation or placebo for threemonths. All of these women had used oral con-traceptives for at least six months and continuedto do so. The results showed signicant improve-ment or normalization of Pap smears and biop-sies at the end of the treatment period. 56 In patients with folic acid deciency, changes in the cells of the cervix (called megaloblastic abnormalities) and low blood levels of folic acid have been associated with a moderately increasedrisk of invasive cervical cancer. 57, 58Deciency has been observed more often in women who aretaking oral contraceptives. In another study,women taking 10 mg of folic acid daily for threeweeks (while continuing oral contraceptives)showed a striking reversion of the megaloblasticchanges toward the normal, 59with a regression-to- normal rate of 20 percent in this study and 100percent in another. 60Folic acid supplementation may be effective in preventing dysplasia from pro-gressing as well. Theoretically, folic acid may actby decreasing homocysteine, which, when ele-vated, has been associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. 61, 62 It should be noted that a recent study demonstrated the difculty of gettingadequate folate via diet and, therefore, additionalsupplementation is warranted. 63 When doses as high as 10 mg of folic acid per day are given, two points must be kept in mind.The rst is that most retail natural foods storeshave folic acid available only in capsules up to800 mcg (less than 1 mg, which is equal to 1,000mcg). Higher doses of folic acid are available onlyby prescription from your medical doctor orlicensed alternative practitioner. A prescriptionliquid form is available for which one drop isequal to 5 mg, which is very cost effective. Thesecond issue is that high doses of folic acid canmask a vitamin B 12anemia. To avoid this, take either a multiple vitamin-mineral, B-complex, orB 12supplement along with the daily folic acid. Folic Acid 2.5-10 mg per day 800-2,400 mcg per day for prevention (see treatment plans) B Vitamins. B vitamins, specically ribo- flavin, thiamine, and B 12, have an inverse corre- lation with risk for CIN, leading someresearchers to promote the protective role theymay play in cervical cancer, reducing the risk by39CERVICAL DYSPLASIA as much as 50 to 90 percent for the upper limits of intake.64Women with the highest levels of serum B 12were less likely to have a persistent infection.65Serum B 12levels should be evaluated and deciency corrected. As with folic acid, B 12 may act by decreasing homocysteine, which,when elevated, has been associated with anincreased risk of cervical cancer. 66, 67 Vitamin B 12 1,000 mcg per day Botanicals Green Tea. One of the most exciting advances in the treatment of cervical dysplasia is theresearch that has been published on green tea. Inboth laboratory and clinical studies, constituentsof green tea, namely polyphenol E (poly E) andepigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have beeneffective against HPV-infected cervical cells andlesions. The mechanisms involved appear to beapoptosis, cell cycle arrest, modication of geneexpression, and antitumor effects. 68, 69 A clinical study conrms these ndings in patients throughthe use of either topical application via a poly Eointment and/or oral ingestion via a poly E or anEGCG capsule. All treatment groups improvedcompared to placebo (50 to 75 percent versus 10percent), but the topical treatment groupsimproved the most signicantly compared to oralalone (75 percent versus 50 to 60 percent). 70 Green Tea Green tea extract (95% polyphenols, 80% catechins, 55% EGCG, day orally Green tea suppositories: insert one twice weekly (see treatment plans) Indole-3-Carbinol/Diindolylmethane (DIM). Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a sprouts, cauliflower, and kale. I3C isconverted in the stomach to a variety of com-pounds including diindolylmethane (DIM). It has been suggested that I3C can act in several ways toprevent abnormal cell growth and prevent tumorprogression. Recent studies indicate that I3C hasthe ability to prevent and maybe even treat somecommon cancers, especially those that are estrogenrelated, 71by altering the pathway of estrogen metabolism.72-74 Women with CIN 2 and 3 have altered estro- gen metabolism; higher 16-alpha hydroxyestrone,a potent carcinogen; and fewer 2-hydroxyestrogen metabolites than normal. 75One therapeutic goal of treatment, then, is to increase the 2-hydroxylation of estrogen and decrease the 16alpha-hydroxylation. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 30 women with CIN 2 orCIN 3, 764 of 8 patients in the 200 mg group and 4 of 9 in the 400 mg group had complete regres-sion of their CIN compared to none of theplacebo group. A laboratory study of human cer-vical cancer cells determined that I3C and DIMcould induce apoptosis (cell death) of human cer-vical cancer cells and HPV-16-infected cervicalcells of mice. 77It appears DIM is preferred over I3C due to increased bioavailability and the factthat it increases the protective 2-hydroxyestrogenwithout increasing another harmful metabolite,the 4-hydroxyestrogens. Diindolylmethane (DIM) 200-400 mg per day Additional Botanicals. T raditional herbal medicine includes the use of many plants for systemic immune support. No plants (exceptgreen tea) have been studied by themselves inrelationship to the human papillomavirus andcervical dysplasia that I am aware of, althoughmany plants are known both to act as immunemodulators and to be antiviral in their activity. This concept of immune support is an important part of preventive medicine as well asin reversing and preventing the progression ofcervical dysplasia. Since up to 80 percent of the40WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE U.S. sexually active adult population carries the human papillomavirus and less than 5 percenthave a visible lesion or abnormal Pap smears, it iscommon sense that most people's bodies have theability to prevent the virus from causing an actualdiseased state. Specically, their immune systemsare doing a better job at keeping them healthy.This is true for women both systemically and inthe vagina. There is local immune tissue in thecervical epithelium, and the immune status ofthis tissue is in part responsible for resistance tothe virus. This is the background logic for both systemic immune support and local immune support. Aspart of the research protocol, you will see the useof a systemic botanical formula including thuja, echinacea, ligusticum, and goldenseal. You willalso notice herbal manytraditional herbs for immune support, yarrow. Recent evidence supports the use of cur- cumin in the prevention of cervical cancer due toits ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation and down-regulate HPV virus. 78-80 Curcumin 350-500 mg once to twice daily Criteria and Guidelines for Treatment Selection Note: Not all of the treatments described in this chapter are appropriate for self-care. Some, such as the escharotic treatment, need to be administered by a licensed health-care practitioner trained inwomen's health. In addition, not all cases of cervi-cal dysplasia are appropriate for the natural treat- ment protocols. Licensed practitioners familiar with diagnosing and treating cervical dysplasias shouldbe consulted to assist in making appropriate and safe decisions. For practitioners reading this book, the following criteria may be helpful in determiningthe appropriate treatment: Criteria for Naturopathic Protocol 1. ASC-US. 2. ASC-US with documented HPV.3. ASC-H: endocervical curettage is Low-grade squamous ASC-H: endocervical curettage is positive with a satisfactory colposcopy, but the patient is at lowrisk for more serious disease or has low-risk HPV typing, or at the colposcopy, but the patient is at low riskfor more serious disease or has low-risk HPVtyping, or at the discretion of the practitioner. 8. High-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia: endocervical curettage is positive colposcopy, but the patient is at lowrisk, or at the discretion of the practitioner and considered carefully after colposcopy, biopsies, and careful follow-up. 9.

The escharotic treatment is a topical caustic treatment of thecervix used to remove abnormal cells. It involvesthe use of zinc chloride mixed with a botanical,Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot). I have usedthe escharotic treatment for more than 24 years,and at one time I conducted a small study usingit as a treatment along with suppositories andherbal/nutritional supplementation in sevenwomen with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 30 After one year, four of the women remained dis-ease free, one woman improved to atypia andthen reverted to mild dysplasia, and two womenhad partial improvement. In a follow-up study,similar protocols were used including the escharotic treatment with some of the moresevere cases. I discussed this in more detail in thesection of this chapter on carotenes. Indicationsand directions for use of the escharotic treatmentare given later in this chapter. Botanical Formula I Red clover: 1 oz Dandelion root: 112oz ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE LIFESTYLE HABITS Sexuality Early age at rst intercourse (before age 18) with unprotected sex and/or multiple heterosexualpartners with unprotected sex are associated withan increased risk of cervical dysplasia and cervicalcancer. As nearly all cases of cervical dysplasiainvolve HPV, women can best protect themselves by using condoms during intercourse. Even if amale partner does not have visible genital warts,he can have nonvisible genital warts and can alsocarry the virus. If the partner is female, it is more difcult to contract the virus and cervical dysplasia, but notimpossible.

It is consideredvery low risk for the virus alone to be transmittedbetween women, although it is theoretically pos-sible. Both heterosexual and homosexual womenask about the risk of transmitting or contractingthe virus through oral sex. Again, this is theoret-ically possible, and there are conditions when the HPV virus may lodge in the larynx and oralcavity. However, these cases are extremely rare,and so it is left to each person to make that judg-ment on her own. If one of the partners isimmunocompromised (HIV-positive, a trans-plant patient, or has chronic hepatitis), then she44WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE is more vulnerable to contracting HPV, and pre- cautions are denitely warranted. Smoking Probably the single most important cofactor in the development of cervical dysplasia and cervicalcancer is smoking. Smokers have a two- to threefold increase in the incidence of cervical dysplasia.81 Some studies indicate that the incidence comparedto nonsmokers is even greater than that. Nicotine isactually concentrated in the glands of the cervix,where it then acts as a carcinogenic compound.Sample Treatment for Moderate Dysplasia (CIN 2, High-Grade SIL) See the Resources section for information on the con- tents of and resources for the suppositories and other products included in these treatment plans.

In addition, no form of hormonal contraception, be it oral or injec-tion, was found to be associated with an increasedrisk for developing dysplasia. 84While hormonal contraception is not implicated in HPV-related dys-plasia, condoms should still be used concurrently.Three large, well-controlled studies looked at invasive cervical cancer and OC use and did notnd statistically signicant associations comparedwith women who never used OCs. 85-87There was no overall change in risk of invasive cervicalcancer.

The denition of long-termuse is not always consistent, but some dene it asmore than ve years of use. T wo other recent stud-ies assessed OC use and risk of cervical dysplasia,and neither of these found any statistically signi-cant associations. 88, 89 One disturbing nding with OC use is an association with an increase in the incidence of arare cancer of the cervix called adenocarcinoma, avariant of squamous cervical cancer. The incidenceof this disease has increased over the past severaldecades, while the incidence of invasive squamouscervical cancer has decreased since the pill wasintroduced. T wo recent studies 86, 90found a modest but statistically signicant increased risk of inva-sive cervical adenocarcinoma in OC users withover 12 years of use. However, it is important toremember that the cause of cervical cancer is thesexually transmitted human papillomavirus. PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS The association between psychosocial factors and cervical dysplasia has been the subject of severalinvestigations. Signicant life stressors werefound to be correlated, including low copingstyle, pessimism, a high degree of social alien- ation, high anxiety states, and feeling threat-ened. 91, 92Life stressors with negative impact over the previous six months showed a direct, positiveassociation with level of dysplasia, while copingstyle showed a less prominent effect. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH The degree of aggression used to combat simple human papillomavirus waxes and wanes throughthe years and from provider to provider. WhileHPV can be dormant for decades, recurrence isalways possible. Some practitioners recommendobservation alone through the acute viral phaseof cervical infection in low-risk patients. We haveseen this work at least as often as not. Many doc-tors give patients the option, considering theirlifestyle, other risk factors, prior history, andimmune system status. Most everyone in the conventional medical community agrees on how to manage moderateand severe dysplasia: remove it. There is someongoing controversy about the treatment of milddysplasia. Since recent studies have shown that 70to 80 percent of mild dysplasia will revert tonormal tissue before one year, there is an equallycompelling recommendation to just repeat the Papsmear in one year and avoid further treatmentunless the condition progresses. If it is still milddysplasia at 12 months, then repeat the colposcopyand biopsies to exclude more signicant lesions. Inother words, mild dysplasia can be observed evenlonger, as long as close follow-up occurs. When treatment is needed, the procedures generally used are cryotherapy; a conization witha scalpel or laser; laser ablation; or loop electro-surgical excision procedure, referred to as LEEP .All of them remove the dysplastic cells and allownew cells to replace the old. They all workupward of 90 percent of the time when used cor-rectly. Cryotherapy is reserved for mild dysplasia(CIN 1), because of the lesser depth of penetra-tion. The other procedures are recommended forSample Treatment Plan After LEEP , Conization, or Cryotherapy Wait for 3 weeks after the procedure (described later in this chapter), and then begin the following plan. See the Resources section for information on the con- tents of and resources for the suppositories and otherproducts used.

Tissue destruction beyond the dysplastic lesionsoccurs in all of these procedures to varyingdegrees to help prevent recurrences. Recurrencesare usually due to new infection, reactivation ofthe virus because of immune system changes, orinadequate prior treatment with residual cells that then persist and regrow. Cryotherapy is the oldest and cheapest of these procedures and is a simple ofce procedure per-formed with a blunt probe applied to the cervixand tubing that supplies concentrated nitrousCervical Escharotic Treatment The escharotic treatment is especially indicated for moderate dysplasia and severe dysplasia, both high- grade lesions, but only when there is a satisfactory colposcopy performed by a clinician. In addition, theuse of the escharotic treatment, rather than a LEEP or conization, needs to fall within the guidelines as out- lined in the criteria for naturopathic protocol. Pleasealso read the section in this chapter clarifying when a conization or LEEP is a more appropriate treatment. The escharotic treatment is best done twice a week with two full days between treatments. The zincchloride (ZnCl) solution will have to be made by a compounding pharmacist, by prescription. Instructions for the Practitioner Before beginning the treatment, you will need the following items: 1 cup distilled water A cup containing 2 powdered bromelain cap- sules or tablets. Remove the powder from thecapsules or crush the tablets to powder. 14tsp ZnCl 2solution (90 g ZnCl/60 ml sterlized water) bottle with 34tsp sanguinaria tincture 13cup calendula succus 1. Insert speculum and visualize the cervix. 2. Blot the cervix dry with large cotton swab or cotton ball on the end of a ring forceps. 3. Dip a large cotton swab into the distilled water and then squeeze out the water. Place the damp swab into the bromelain and thickly cover theface of the cervix with the powder, repeating asneeded to cover the cervix completely. Applythe powder in the endocervical canal using small, dampened cotton tip applicators (use a new applicator each time).4. Leave the bromelain on the cervix and in the endocervical canal for 15 minutes. Place a GYNlamp facing the vagina to provide gentle heat during this portion of the treatment. 5. Now remove the bromelain by placing a large cotton swab in the calendula succus and thenapplying it to the cervix, thus washing off the bromelain. Repeat with a small cotton tip appli- cator to the endocervical canal. Be liberal;repeat washing two to four times. Take a drylarge swab and absorb the washings that have pooled in the vagina. 6. Now soak a large swab in the ZnCl 2/sanguinaria mixture that you prepared earlier. Apply this to the cervix once. Repeat this procedure with asmall cotton tip applicator inserted in the endo-cervical canal. Leave on for one minute. If thiscauses pain, wash the cervix with a small amount of distilled water. Avoid contact of the ZnCl 2/sanguinaria mixture with the vaginal wall. 7. Wash off the ZnCl 2/sanguinaria mixture with swabs of calendula succus. Wash the endocervi- cal canal as well with a cotton tip applicator.Absorb the liquid that has pooled in the vaginawith a dry cotton swab. 8. Insert two Vag Pack suppositories. Instruct the patient to leave the suppositories in place for 24 hours, using a sanitary napkin as needed forleakage. 9. After the last escharotic treatment, use the fol- lowing treatment plan: Week 1: vitamin A suppository nightly for 6 nights Week 2: herbal vaginal suppository nightly for 6 nights, or in cases with HPV, use condyloma suppository Week 3: vitamin A suppository nightly for 6 nights Week 4: herbal vaginal or papilloma suppository nightly for 6 nights49CERVICAL DYSPLASIA oxide to cause the probe to get very cold. Tissue penetration is several millimeters. This proceduretakes approximately two to three minutes and isassociated with cramping at the time, whichresolves quickly and is rarely present for more thana day. The devitalized tissue is sloughed as a waterydischarge over the next 10 to 14 days. The cervixis usually well healed within a month. Conization is employed primarily for endo- cervical dysplasia. A cold-knife procedure is per-formed in the operating room under anesthesiaand employs a scalpel to remove a cone-shapedpiece of cervix and cervical canal. Conization hasthe advantage of more clearly evaluating the mar-gins, because there is no thermal artifact. Laserablation of the transformation zone can be per-formed in the operating room or the ofce andallows for precise management of lesions butdoes not provide tissue for pathology. Laserconization obtains tissue similar to the cold-knifecone procedure, with some thermal destructionat the margins, and is signicantly more expen-sive than LEEP . The most common current treatment of endocervical or cervical dysplasia of moderate-to-severe degree is a LEEP procedure, which isgenerally performed in the ofce with cervicalanesthetic and is usually well tolerated and verycost effective. LEEP can be used to remove theendocervical canal and/or the transformationzone. It also has thermal degradation at the mar-gins. When LEEP or laser is used, the tissuebeyond the cut margin is heated and destroyedfor another 1 to 2 mm of penetration. Even whenthe dysplasia is seen all the way to the margin ofthe biopsy, there is still usually complete treat-ment of the lesion because the heat destructionpenetrates into the tissue beyond the surgical site. Women treated by LEEP are more likely to convert to HPV-negative status within one to twoyears after the procedure and do so signicantlysooner than those who are merely watched with-out treatment. The LEEP can reduce cervicalmucus and can occasionally cause a stenosis of theopening to the cervix. The advantage of LEEP is that it can be done in the ofce, is well tolerated,and is minimally expensive. These techniques are all relatively safe and effective for preventing future cervical cancer.However, their effects on future fertility and preg-nancy outcomes are unclear. Some say that doneproperly, none of these procedures affects fertility,sexuality, or pregnancy. There is no adequate datafrom randomized controlled trials to evaluatethese potential effects. In one analysis of 27 obser-vational trials comparing the fertility and preg-nancy of women who underwent ablation orexcision of CIN lesions to women who were nottreated with these therapies, LEEP and cold-knifeconizations were both associated with signicantlyincreased risk for preterm delivery. LEEP was asso-ciated with an increased risk for preterm ruptureof membranes, and the cold-knife cone was asso-ciated with an increased risk for cesarean section.The laser cone and the laser ablation had no asso-ciation with any signicant change for any of theoutcomes. None of the treatments had any signif-icant association with perinatal mortality, compli-cation for the infant, or fertility. Follow-up recommendations may vary depend- ing on your overall case history and your practi-tioner's perspective. Some patients treated with anyof these conventional treatments are advised tohave three-month Pap smears for the rst year andsix-month Pap smears for the next year. Others willhave the recommendation of annual Pap smearsfollowing the conventional treatment. Prevention: The HPV Vaccine The newest approach to conventional medical treatment of dysplasia is prevention. After a clini-cal trial done in 2002 initially showed that anHPV-16 vaccine reduced the incidence of bothHPV-16 infection and HPV-16 cervical dyspla-sia, 93continued research has lead to the reality of an HPV vaccine to reduce the incidence of cervi-cal cancer. The FDA approved a quadrivalent vac-cine in June 2006. It vaccinates women against50WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE strains 6 and 11, which cause venereal warts, and 16 and 18, which are the most common strainsfound in cervical cancer. The intended recipientsof this vaccine will be pubertal girls who have notyet had intercourse. However, the vaccine has beenrecommended up to age 26, because it will alsohelp prevent venereal warts in women who arecurrently sexually active. In one study young women without histories of HPV infection or abnormal Pap smears whowere given the type 16 and 18 vaccine were sig-nicantly less likely to develop HPV type 16 or18 infections or abnormal cervical cells duringthe two-plus years of follow-up. 94In another study, the 6, 11, 16, and 18 vaccine decreased theincidence of infection by 90 percent in youngwomen compared to placebo. 95 SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARYHEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Accurate and adequate diagnosis and evaluation is the key to knowing which is the most appro-priate treatment for your case. Colposcopy (mag-nication) and cervical biopsies are the specicdiagnostic methods for evaluation. Pap smearsare not diagnostic; they are screening tests. When your licensed practitioner (naturopathic doctor,medical doctor, osteopathic doctor, nurse-practitioner, or physician's assistant) recommendsthat you need a colposcopy and biopsy, this isgood advice. They are not recommending treat-ment; they are recommending accurate diagnosis. Decisions regarding treatments such as a LEEP , cone biopsy, or cryotherapy versus one ofthe natural protocols require a medicalhistory, Pap smear report, colposcopy report,biopsy/pathology report, and a working knowl-edge of the advantages and disadvantages of eachof the treatments. If your conventional practi-tioner is not aware of the research on the naturaltreatment protocols or is biased without knowl-edge, then he or she may not be the most appro-priate person to help you make the rightdecision. Likewise, if your alternative practi-tioner is not aware of the clinical indications forthe conventional treatments as distinguishedfrom the clinical indications for the safety andefcacy of the alternative treatment plan or isbiased without knowledge, then he or she toomay not be the most appropriate person to helpyou make the right decision.51OVERVIEW Around the same time suffragettes were securing the right to vote, other women, most notablyMargaret Sanger, desperately sought to providewomen a means of \"family limitation,\" 1later called birth control. The political struggle tolegitimize contraception and bring it into themedical arena was long and erce. Sanger wasjailed on obscenity charges more than once andnally fled the country rather than face a trial sheultimately won years later. Any public discussionof reproduction was judged obscene under theprevailing Comstock Law. Although women fre-quently died in childbirth or struggled to feedfamilies of six to ten or more, they were forbid-den information concerning fertility regulationthat was literally lifesaving. Although diaphragmsand condoms gradually became more readilyavailable (the rst diaphragms in use in Americawere smuggled from Europe through Canada bySanger and her husband), it was not until theSupreme Court decision Griswald v. Connecticut in 1966 that married women's rights to accessbirth control became assured. While we modern women lament the absence of a perfect fertility control option, the mere factthat the birthrate has fallen so drastically these past50 years illustrates both women's desire to havefewer children and the efcacy of the combinedmethods in achieving that goal. Nevertheless, evenwith the current availability of contraception, fully57 percent of American pregnancies today areunintended. 2Perhaps our difculty with the issue relates to our prudish roots. Safe, effective birthcontrol does exist, although failures, whetherhuman or methodological, occur with each. Thebest we can do is choose wisely and minimizehuman error. In addition to natural family plan-ning or fertility awareness methods (oftendescribed as the rhythm method), there are threegeneral categories\u2014hormonal contraception, bar-rier contraception and the intrauterine devices,and abortion\u2014that complete the list of birth con-trol methods. Sterilization, the most commonmethod of fertility control, is a safe surgical proce-dure for either men or women. This method isused by about 20 percent 3of couples; yet it, too, has a failure rate of about 1 in 400.4CONTRACEPTION CHAPTER KEY CONCEPTS Consult your health-care practitioner to deter- mine the effectiveness, health benets, and health risks of each contraceptive method. Consult your health-care practitioner about cau- tions and contraindications for each method. Smokers older than 35 should not use hormonal contraceptive methods. The choice of contraception method is based on benets, risks, effectiveness, cost, side effects,ease of use, and personal choice. The key to the contraceptive benet is proper use and compliance with the chosen method. Pregnancy itself carries considerable health risks. These must also be considered when choosing a method of contraception. Regular annual health exams are required for users of hormonal contraception. Report any side effects that you think are related to your method of contraception to your health-care practitioner. FERTILITY AWARENESS Many couples successfully rely on this drug-free and device-free method that depends on identi-fying a woman's fertile periods and abstainingfrom intercourse during those times. However, to Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

The average pregnancy rate with most who use thismethod is 20 percent, clearly less than the 85percent rate experienced with no method at all.More pregnancies result from taking chancesduring fertile times than from difculty deci-phering the methods. 4These methods work best when women have a predictable cycle length.Ovulation is then predicted most accurately, andintercourse is restricted for the least amount oftime. Barrier methods can be combined with thecalendar method pretty effectively during therestricted time, but spermicide can obscure thecervical mucus method. All variations of thismethod assume that an ovulated egg can be fer-tilized for up to 24 hours and that sperm can sur-vive in the female reproductive tract for aboutthree but possibly up to seven days. 4Amazingly, one might become pregnant up to a week afterthe last intercourse! So much for romanticallyplanning conception location or dating a preg-nancy simply from the timing of sex. Combining all the methods somewhat prob- ably works the best; for example, many womenare quite good at predicting when they ovulatefrom a variety of symptoms (such as pelvic painormittelschmerz ), but this is only something you notice after the fact. To successfully avoid preg-nancy, you have to be able to predict ovulationabout ve to seven days in advance or else avoidexposure completely during the rst half of thecycle. Obviously noncoital activities are permissi-ble at all times; this method does not requireactual abstinence, just avoidance of intercourse. Calendar Methods Rhythm, the oldest of birth control schemes, relies on a woman having a regular 28-day cycle,with ovulation occurring on day 14\u2014exactlymidcycle. Intercourse must be avoided for at leastthree days before and three days after ovula-tion\u2014days 11 through 17 at least, and optimally seven days before and at least four days after. If awoman's cycle is not this regular, another calendar method is useful that takes into accountcycle variance. First gather information aboutcycle length over enough time to gure out howwide the range is. You must know the longest andthe shortest cycle length you experience\u2014day 1being the rst day of menses and the last daybeing the one just before menses resumes. Sub-tract 20 from the shortest cycle to get the rstfertile day (day 4 in a 24-day cycle). Subtract 10from the longest cycle (day 22 in a 32-day cycle)to get the last fertile day. Thus, a woman withcycles ranging from 25 to 30 days avoids inter-course days 5 through 20 (25 /H1100220/H110055 and 30/H1100210/H1100520). (Read through this paragraph two or three times to make sure you understand it.) Cervical Mucus This method uses the recognition of \"fertile mucus\" to predict ovulation. It depends on thephysiological fact of the presence of slippery thinmucus at the cervical orice around ovulation.You can easily learn to discern fertile mucus byexperimenting with egg white, which resemblesfertile mucus. Use your index nger to gathermucus from as close to the uterine opening aspossible. Fertile mucus stretches between thumband index ngers as they are separated, just likeraw egg white, without breaking in the middle.Nonfertile mucus is tackier and breaks aparteasily at short distances between the ngers.Experiment with an egg white, then try room-temperature butter\u2014you will see the difference.Imagine the sperm swimming easily betweenlong slippery parallel strands of mucus aroundovulation, which is thought to ease transport intothe uterus and may also modify the sperm so thatit is capable of fertilizing the egg. Ovulation usu-ally occurs in the middle or toward the end of thefertile mucus time; thus it is best to determineyour length of fertility in advance a few cyclesbefore relying on this method. Obviously semen,53CONTRACEPTION spermicides, vaginal creams, or lubricants can adulterate the mucus and make this assessmentunreliable. Experiment. Basal Body Temperature Basal body temperature is measured by taking one's temperature the very rst thing in themorning before getting out of bed and before anyactivity at all. Wake up, reach over, take the tem-perature, record. Plotting these numbers dailyover a few months will show a nice pattern ofovulation. The temperature may drop a bit (usu-ally around half a degree) just before ovulation,and then goes up about a degree from there (nowhalf a degree over baseline) just after ovulation.Release of the egg probably occurs the day before the elevation, 3which persists until menses. Ele- vation longer than the expected 12 to 14 daysusually indicates pregnancy. A digital thermome-ter will help you demonstrate this rise more accu-rately, but you can use any thermometer if youare willing to precisely plot the points. BARRIER METHODS Barrier methods include anything that imposes a barrier between egg and sperm and includecondoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, and any ofthe spermicides. Only the condom physicallyprevents sperm from reaching the egg. Thediaphragm and the previously available cervicalcap are both methods of holding spermicideagainst the cervix; they don't really keep the eggfrom meeting sperm. The new FemCap doescover the cervix but doesn't hold the spermicideagainst the cervix. Rather, it contains a groovefacing the vaginal opening to store and deliverspermicide or any microbicide. Without spermi-cide, these methods are not highly effective.Most condoms are impregnated with spermicidethese days, because of the presumed protectionnonoxynol-9 provides against sexually transmit-ted diseases. Nonoxynol-9 kills gonorrhea,herpes, trichomonas, syphilis, and HIV in vitro, 4 which may or may not translate into reducedtransmission of these diseases between humans. Because some organisms, such as HIV, are intra-cellular, they may not get exposed to the spermi-cide during sexual intercourse, and thereforeprotection may be compromised. In fact,nonoxynol-9 is rather irritating to some, and theirritation may result in vaginal mucosa (thelining of the vagina) that is more susceptible tothe AIDS virus. It is safe to use nonoxynol-9unless it irritates you; in that case, don't. Condoms should obviously be used with any new sexual partner to protect against many, butnot all, sexually transmitted diseases. Alone as amethod of birth control, they can be reasonablyeffective. If used consistently and properly, fail-ure rates are reputed to be as low as 3 percent,although actual use failure rates are closer to 10to 14 percent. Using condoms with an intravagi-nal spermicide provides about 96 percent safetyfrom pregnancy with typical use. This combina-tion is the best over-the-counter method. Healthy noninfected couples that choose condoms may prefer the comfort of lambskincondoms; the pores of these condoms are too big to protect well against viral-size organisms,but they do just ne in keeping out sperm. Con-doms, a very old tried-and-true method, areenjoying a surge in popularity. Caps and diaphragms work similarly; both cover the cervix and hold spermicide eitheragainst the cervix or facing the entrance to thevagina. The suction-based cervical cap is cur-rently not available in the United States due to abusiness decision by the European manufacturer.This had nothing to do with safety or effective-ness. What is now available, perhaps the newestmethod of birth control, is the FemCap. TheFemCap is made of nonallergenic, latex-freematerial and is designed to cover the cervix. Ithas a groove facing the vaginal opening thatstores and delivers spermicide. It is available byprescription only but does not require a technicaltting session and measurement by the health-care provider. A FemCap must be applied before54WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE arousal and should be kept in place for at least six hours after the last intercourse. A backupmethod is recommended while you are learningto use it. FemCaps have the advantage of beingable to be left in with ongoing efcacy for as long as 48 hours. A FemCap comes with aninstructional video. (Information is available atwww.femcap.com.) A diaphragm is a latex shield that covers the cervix. Diaphragms come in several sizes, and thecorrect size must be determined as part of a pelvicexam by a health-care practitioner. Spermicidemust be placed in the diaphragm, which is thenplaced up against the cervix. The diaphragm mustbe left in for at least six hours after intercourse,and any additional intercourse during that sixhours must be preceded by the addition of anapplicator of spermicide. Diaphragms with sper-micide have an effectiveness rate of approximately94 percent. The contraceptive sponge was originally introduced in 1983 and remained on the marketuntil January 1995. It was taken off the marketbecause the manufacturer chose not to modern-ize the manufacturing and hygiene standards. In2005, the Today sponge returned to the market-place with a new manufacturer. The sponge is aconvenient, disposable, one-size-ts-all vaginalcontraceptive that can be purchased over thecounter at most drugstores. It is used with a sper-micide and offers an 82 to 92 percent effective-ness rate. INTRAUTERINE DEVICES Intrauterine devices are in a contraceptive class all by themselves, and they may arguably be the leastinvasive and highest efcacy form of birth control.Rumors persist that Cleopatra had a gold ring inher uterus that prevented pregnancy and allowed ahealthy, active love life. And the camel drivers inthe same era are said to have put small rocks intheir camels' uteruses to prevent pregnancy on thelong roads they traveled. These may just be goodstories, but for those women who are good candi-dates, IUDs are simple, cheap, highly effective, reversible, and have a minimal impact on underly-ing physiological processes. Modern IUDs became popular with the introduction of the Lippes Loop in the early1960s, when as many as 10 percent of womenwho used contraceptives chose this method. Thefailure rate was about 2 percent, although theexpulsion rate (coming out with the menstrualflow) was reported to be as high as 12 to 20 per-cent. 3Lippes Loops are still available and in use around the world, although not available in theUnited States. IUDs are used much more commonly in Europe than in the United States, largely becauseof the persistent fear American women andproviders still harbor from the Dalkon Shielddebacle during the 1970s. Unfortunately, thisdevice traumatized the cervix on insertion, andthe string was made of a material that was a perfect conduit for bacteria to ascend into theuterus. An infection called pelvic inflammatorydisease (PID) increased dramatically in DalkonShield users, essentially due to the prevalence ofsexually transmitted diseases that ascended intothe uterus and/or fallopian tubes; many womenacquired serious infections and in many, infertil-ity resulted. Yet the company did not recall thedevice for 10 years\u2014at least 5 years after theproblems were known. The reputation of theIUD was tarnished forever, and a good contra-ceptive method is all but lost to women whomight well benet from it today. There are presently very few IUDs in the United States because manufacturers don't want totake a chance on a device that has become sounpopular. Copper was added to IUDs to increaseeffectiveness in the 1980s, which allowed smallerand better-tolerated devices to be used. The Para-gard copper T fails less than 1 percent of the time 4and lasts for at least 10 years. Fertility is unchanged over baseline in women who do notcontract sexually transmitted diseases. The devicecomes in only one size, and so is better tolerated in55CONTRACEPTION a uterus that has carried a pregnancy. It can be put in during nursing for excellent carefree contracep-tion that will not interfere with lactation. Themechanism of action is now fairly well docu-mented as a inflammatory response in the uterinecavity. It is not felt to be an abortifacient (a sub-stance that induces abortion). IUDS can make menstrual flow heavier and with more cramping. For those women with mod-erate or light menses, however, it is a method that requires no mess or loss of spontaneity, andIUDs can be used for years without loss of efcacy.Even at a cost of $600 to $700, this is a minimalexpense if used over a 10-year period. Women who are in monogamous relation- ships, have given birth, and are not at risk for sexually transmitted infections are perfect candi-dates for IUD use, if their periods are normal.Again, though, IUDs can increase the amount ofthe menstrual flow and increase cramping. Theexception is the newer IUD called Mirena. Itcontains (Levonorgestrel) on thestem, which anddecreases menstrual flow and cramping. It canreduce the normal flow by 80 percent and causesa lack of menses in 15 percent of patients. TheMirena lasts 5 years, and the progestin staysactive inside the uterus. It is thought that in themajority of women and in the majority of thetime, the progestin is conned to the uteruswithout systemic absorption. However, clinicianswill report cases of patients who appear to havehad systemic progestin side effects from theMirena. The Mirena is an important option incontraception\u2014a method that provides 99 per-cent protection and decreases menstrual pain andheavy flows. Insertion of an IUD must be done in a prac- titioner's ofce. Most women report nothingmore than light cramping. STI testing forchlamydia and gonorrhea should precede inser-tion. Infections caused by the insertion itself arerare and may occur approximately 1 percent ofthe time, within 30 days of insertion. An antibi-otic can be utilized to prevent infection. If you do become pregnant, the IUD should beremoved. Pregnancies will be interrupted by theIUD, and a miscarriage can occur about half thetime. If desired, ultrasound can be used to iden-tify the IUD before removal to minimize disrup-tion of a wanted pregnancy. BIRTH CONTROL PILLS (BCPS) Never has there been a more perfect love/hate relationship than that between women and hormonal contraception or birth control pills(BCPs), also called oral contraceptives (OCs). In1951, Margaret Sanger is credited with convinc-ing Gregory Pincus (who ultimately synthesizedthe rst oral contraceptive) that his research infertilization could be used to create an oral contraceptive. Available for the rst time in the1960s, oral contraceptives were truly a revolu-tionary medical option for women. Womenreadily embraced the option of having fewer children, and the dramatically lower birthratethat resulted has persisted, undoubtedly due tothe pill's continued widespread use. Women'smaternal burden was lifted for the rst time inhistory. That's the good news. Unfortunately, the hormonal content of early birth control pills\u2014estrogen and progesterone\u2014was much higher than today's pills, and morewomen smoked then. Both factors affected whatis always the course of any new medicine\u2014thedownside became obvious only with mass use. Itsoon became apparent that cardiovascular dis-ease, including heart attacks, strokes, blood clots,and pulmonary emboli, was more frequent inwomen who used birth control pills. But eventhough \"more frequent,\" these diseases are stillexceedingly rare in the healthy population ofyoung women who are the usual pill takers. It isalso true that these risks are dose related and havefallen measurably as the estrogen and progestincontent of pills has fallen 4 and 10 times respec-tively since their initial use. The FDA-approvedpackage insert states the following:56WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carriedout in patients who used oral contraceptiveswith formulations containing 0.05 mg [50mcg] or higher of estrogen. The effects oflong-term use with lower-dose formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remain to be determined. The birth control pills in common use today have 20 to 35 mcg of estrogen, and only one ortwo formulations containing 50 mcg are evenavailable. Moreover, the studies documentingthese higher risks in the earlier days did not con-trol for other risk factors such as smoking, highblood pressure, obesity, and so forth\u2014all knownto independently increase a woman's risk of car-diovascular disease. I like the way the late Dr.Felicia Stewart, who dedicated much of her lifeand career to designing research and policies thatmake safe, effective contraception and abortionaccessible to women, describes pill risk: 4 If you were to draw a line 215 meters high (the height of a 70-story building) to repre- sent 100,000 young nonsmoking pill users,and then draw a line beside it to representthe number of pill users in the United Stateswho die each year from complications relat-ed to higher-dose pills, that second linewould be about 0.5 centimeters high [aboutone-fth of an inch]. In comparison, theline representing the number of U.S.women who would die of pregnancy-relatedproblems would be just under 2.5 centime-ters high [about an inch]. A line represent-ing maternal mortality in developing coun-tries would be 25 centimeters to 1.5 meterstall [10 inches to just under ve feet]. Risks attendant to birth control use must be measured against the risk of the pregnancies theyprevent. We are fortunate to live in the time ofthe lowest maternal mortality ever\u2014and still therisk of oral contraception we all worry about isone-fth that of pregnancy. If we can manage to avoid pregnancy in other ways, presumably theyare safer than the pills. There are some signicant health benets attributable to the pill\u2014for example, an 80 per-cent reduction in ovarian cancer and a 50 percentreduction in uterine cancer with about a decadeof use. 3Assessing an individual's risk/benet ratio requires individualization based on healthstatus, family history, and so forth. If one's risk ofcardiovascular disease doubles with use (it does), that sounds worrisome. But if doubling one's riskmeans going from a risk of 1 in 10,000 to 2 in10,000, that doesn't sound so bad. This is justanother way of looking at the same fact. Inciden-tally, this risk is not even close to the risk we takedriving our car to work or school. Smokers older than 35, however, should not use the birth control pill. Most other women athigher risk of heart disease, like those with dia-betes, hypertension, or elevated cholesterol,should consider other options as well\u2014but evenin these conditions, pills are usually safer than anundesired pregnancy. Blood pressure needs to befollowed in all pill takers, and, if elevated signi-cantly by use, another birth control method mustbe chosen. Breast Cancer and the Pill Much attention has been given to the relation- ship between the pill and breast cancer, andslowly some answers emerge. The Centers forDisease Control (CDC) conducted a study in the1980s called the \"Cancer and Steroid HormoneStudy\" that looked at nearly 5,000 cases of breastcancer and 5,000 healthy control women andconcluded that there was no increased risk ofbreast cancer in women who had used the pill. 3 Another signicant study evaluated a pooledanalysis from 54 studies involving 53,297women with breast cancer and over 100,000controls and concluded that there is a slight butmeasurable increase in the relative risk of breastcancer for current BCP users that declines57CONTRACEPTION shortly after stopping the pill and disappears within 10 years.5By age 50, there is no difference in the risk of breast cancer in women who haveever used oral contraceptives versus those whohave never used them. Also, the increase in riskduring use (1.24 relative risk) translates differ-ently in a 20-year-old woman versus a 40-year-old woman. If the risk of breast cancer at 20 is 1in 5,000 (or less), then a relative risk of 1.24increases it to 1 in 4,000. However, if a womanis 40 and the risk of breast cancer is about 1 in250, a relative risk of 1.24 increases her risk to 1in 200. Thus, the increase is clearly more signi-cant in an older woman. In this age group, of1,000 40-year-old women who take the pill, onewill contract breast cancer as a consequence.Only about 15 percent of breast cancers occur inwomen younger than age 45, 6which is when most of us take oral contraceptives. A very recent meta-analysis that revisited oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer, pub-lished in October 2006, concluded that oral con-traceptives do increase the risk of premenopausalbreast cancer. 7Thirty-four case-control studies of oral contraceptives and premenopausal breastcancer during or after 1980 were identied. Analy-sis of the data from these studies showed that therisk of breast cancer was slightly increased for bothnulliparous (having never given birth) and parous(having birthed one or more times) women. Innulliparous women, the longer duration of use ofthe pill did not signicantly affect risk. In parouswomen, the increased risk was more substantialwhen the oral contraceptives were used before therst-full term pregnancy. The risk was highest inparous women who had used the pill for four ormore years before their rst full-term pregnancy.There are many limitations of this kind of reviewbecause there are so many variables, including race,possible recall bias, difference in the age of rstusing the pill, and poor information on when thepills were last used. Taking oral contraceptivesmust be decided based ultimately on the benetscompared to the risks for each woman.The cancers in former users are generally of a less advanced stage than the cancers of nonusers,and benign breast disease (cysts, brosis, breastpain, swelling) is generally improved by BCP use.Overall, there appears to be no evidence of anysignicant increase in the lifetime risk of gettingbreast cancer among women who have used oralcontraceptives. Before deciding for or against BCPs, consider your risk for breast cancer (although mostwomen who get breast cancer are not at risk, andmost at risk don't get it), 6whether pregnancy poses a risk, and any other health risks and ben-ets related to BCP use. Other Health Benets of Birth Control Pills Several years ago, the FDA began to require that, in addition to risks, pill manufacturers list bene-ts, because they are so signicant. Some womenactually take birth control pills for the healthbenets they offer. Oral contraceptives protectfrom uterine and ovarian cancers in the generalpopulation, but we aren't sure yet about those infamilies with a higher incidence. They protectfrom pregnancy nearly 100 percent of the time,although even with perfect use, there is stillabout 1 pregnancy in 1,000 women per year, andwith common human error, a 2 percent failurerate is more accurate. As a bonus, they reduceheavy, painful periods in everyone. About 80 to 90 percent of functional ovarian cysts (those related to ovulation, the mostcommon type) are eliminated in women whotake birth control pills. 4Those who suffer from endometriosis can frequently reduce their ongo-ing pain by suppressing the disease with oral contraceptives. Women with polycystic ovarysyndrome and abnormal male pattern hairgrowth can decrease hair growth with oral con-traceptives because they measurably reduce themale hormones known as androgens in thesewomen. Interestingly, because of the thickeningin cervical mucus that birth control pills induce,58WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE it is less likely that women who take them will get pelvic inflammatory disease if they areunlucky enough to get gonorrhea or chlamydiain the cervix. Fertility is spared in this way. Several recent studies have shown that a seven- day hormone-free interval causes more of a rise infollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which causesovulation. Continuous daily regimens or shorterdrug-free intervals (three or four days only) pre-vent ovulation. Suppression of ovulation reducesthe cyclic symptoms some women have on thetypical 21 days on and 7 days off pill regimens.There is also less breakthrough bleeding and adecrease in pregnancy rates with these shortertime-off regimens. More and more women areusing their birth control daily, or for three monthsat a time. Many oral contraceptives are beingrepackaged with only three or four days of hor-mone-free pills, and we will likely see more of thisin the future. Nutritional Supplements for Pill Users Apart from their hormonal effect, the hormones in birth control pills have been shown to affectmetabolic and nutritional factors. Women on oral contraceptives may want to take nutritional sup-plementation to adjust for some of the biochemi-cal alterations caused by the pill. Women on BCPshave a higher requirement for folate, 8and this may be especially true for women who have had cervi-cal dysplasia (precancerous abnormal cells of thecervix). The frequent ingestion of the steroidsfound in BCPs have been shown to depress levelsof riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin B 12, ascorbic acid, and zinc.9Hormones can also affect breast tenderness, increase risk of blood clots, and inducean array of side effects in some women, and theyare metabolized in the liver. Providing selectivenutritional support, supporting breast health, andenhancing hormonal metabolism and detoxica-tion pathways may optimize the experience ofusing hormonal contraception. Riboflavin deciency may occur with long periods of oral contraceptive (OC) use. 9It maybe that OCs interfere with gastrointestinal absorption or with metabolism or binding. Thereseems to be general consensus in the literaturethat consumption of oral contraceptives con-tributes to pyridoxine (vitamin B 6deciency).9It has been estimated that the majority of womenon OCs for longer than six months manifestabnormal tryptophan metabolism. Vitamin B 6 can normalize tryptophan metabolism. Although not consistent, some research has shown that OCs disturb folate metabolism.Anemia, the gastrointestinal and genital tracts,bone and heart health, and mental function areall affected by folic acid deciencies. For thisreason, folate is an important nutrient to supple-ment for women taking the pill. Oral contracep-tion users have also been reported to havereduced levels of vitamin B 12.9This may be related to malabsorption, increased renal excre-tion, and enhanced tissue acidity. A woman mayor may not acquire an anemia associated with aB 12deciency, but long-term use of the pill may lead to this, or at least may compromise nervefunction, mood, mental function, and the healthof the digestive system. Carotenoids are alsoincluded in this formula to protect the cervix.Oral contraceptives have shown mixed results inincreasing abnormal changes in the cervix thatcan lead to cervical cancer. Beta-carotene de-ciency in the cervical cells may be a cofactor inthe development of cervical dysplasia, 10and decreases in plasma beta-carotene levels is foundin women with either cervical dysplasia or cancerof the cervix. 11 Reduced levels of ascorbic acid have also been observed in those who take oral contraceptives.9 It is possible that the steroids of oral contracep-tives increase the breakdown of ascorbic acid,decrease absorption, and/or change tissue distri-bution. Limited research in animals has shownthat oral contraceptives lower blood levels of vita-min E. 9Vitamin E is the premier antioxidant for lipids, protects structures against toxic com-pounds, and is important in immune function.59CONTRACEPTION Most investigations have shown a reduction in plasma zinc levels following the administrationof OCs. 9Decreased absorption, increased uri- nary excretion, and a decrease in albumin, animportant carrier of zinc, may account for this.Zinc is essential to good health and is involved inmany enzyme and body functions. Immunefunction; wound healing; the nervous system;maintenance of vision, taste, and smell; and skinhealth are dependent on adequate levels of zinc.Zinc competes with copper for absorption, there-fore adding a small amount of copper is also sug-gested to avoid any problems. Borage seed oil is high in gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is important in maintainingpain-free breasts. GLA decreases abnormal sensi-tivity of breast tissue to normal hormone levels.The proposed mechanism of GLA's action is thatit normalizes the balance of fatty acids containedwithin the cell membranes. The steroid receptorsin the breasts then have a reduced afnity forestrogen, dramatically reducing breast sensitivity. Oral contraceptives can increase the risk of blood clots, although this risk has been consider-ably reduced since the lower-dose pills havebecome the norm. However, these concerns stilldeserve our attention. Bromelain has a very favor-able effect on inflammation of a vein. In research,bromelain has been shown to reduce all the symp-toms of inflammation in those who had developedacute thrombophlebitis. 12Garlic preparations have been shown to promote brinolysis, whichcan offer benet in prevention of strokes and otherclotting events. 13, 14 Excessive clumping together of platelets is linked to heart disease and strokes.Garlic and its volatile oils can inhibit plateletaggregation and thereby improve circulation. 15 Finally, women taking hormonal contracep- tives can experience changes in vaginal pH, whichcan lead to changes in the balance of organisms inthe vagina. Lactobacillus species are fundamentalto maintaining a healthy ecological vaginal envi-ronment, which helps to prevent yeast and vaginalinfections. It may be possible to favorably alter thisvaginal ecology by taking lactobacillus in the form of a nutritional supplement. Additional considerations may include liver support to aid in the metabolism of the steroids.There are many options here, including alipotropic supplement and herbs such as dande-lion root, burdock root, and milk thistle. Little information is available about any interactions between botanicals and birth controlpills. For now, my only real caution is with Saint-John's-wort. A few case reports, as well as twocontrolled clinical trials, indicate that Saint-John's-wort can cause breakthrough bleeding andinterferes with the metabolism of the hormonesin the pill. These observations lead me to thinkthat the effectiveness of oral contraceptives maybe reduced when taken in conjunction withSaint-John's-wort. 16-18 Other speculations have been made about the possibility of other herbsand nutrients interfering with the effectiveness ofbirth control pills. However, hypotheses aboutchaste tree, indole-3-carbinole, soy, dong quai,and others have no documentation to supportthese concerns. Side Effects Many women prefer not to take birth control pills because they see them as an unnatural formof birth control. Others are concerned, rightly so,about some of the issues that have been raisedhere, but some women just plain don't feel goodon them. Some women have bloating, breast ten-derness or pain, headaches, mood swings, depres-sion, weight gain, nausea, lowered libido, andbreakthrough bleeding. Other women may expe-rience signicant, more serious side effects suchas complete hair loss, blood clots, high bloodpressure, heart attack, and elevated liver enzymes. There are many kinds of birth control pills today, and fortunately they are signicantly lowerin dose and cause far fewer side effects than in thepast. The pills vary in their estrogen and progestindosages and contain different kinds of estrogensand progestins. A woman may tolerate one pill60WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE poorly and another very well. If you struggle with feeling good on \"the pill,\" you should work with ahealth-care provider who knows the products well.Many side effects come from the progestin, andthere are currently six different progestins found invarious birth control pills. Merely switching to apill with a different progestin can result in feelingnormal while on the pill. There are pills with dif-ferent estrogen doses as well. Overall, women need to assess how they feel on oral hormonal contraceptives. Some womenare moody, some are less so. Some women lovethe regularity of their periods and their reducedpain; others feel nauseous and bloated. Some lovethat their acne improves; others fret about breastcancer. Some women feel great and have lowrisks for most diseases; for them, the hormonescan t into a healthy life. The pill is not a natural form of birth control, but for some women the benets outweigh thedownside. If you do choose to use birth controlpills, remember that one of the advantages to barrier methods of contraception (diaphragm,FemCap, condoms) is the reduced incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especiallypelvic inflammatory disease. Oral contraceptivesdo not signicantly protect against most STIs.Condoms are the best method of contraceptionthat also offers a \"safer sex\" method. Diaphragmsand caps do not provide for safer sex, but theymay help stop sexually transmitted infectionsfrom ascending into the uterus and pelvic region.These are important considerations when choos-ing your method of contraception. Emergency Contraception Emergency contraception refers to using birth control pill hormones to prevent pregnancy afterintercourse has occurred. The only emergencycontraceptive pill (ECP) that is currently avail-able is a progestin-only pill called Plan B. T wopills, taken 12 hours apart, reduce the risk ofpregnancy by 75 percent if initiated within 72hours after unprotected intercourse. The effectappears to result primarily from an inhibition or delay of ovulation and does not disrupt analready established pregnancy. It is also possible to use more pills of a birth control pill that you might already have on handfor emergency contraception. OTHER FORMS OF HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION There are other hormonal contraceptive options available, in addition to the familiar estrogen/progestin pills. There are progestin-only hormonepreparations\u2014pills, injections, and implants.These options can have many of the same nui-sance side effects of combination pills\u2014weightgain, irritability, and depression. Progestin-onlybirth control pills are used by women who arebreast-feeding or who have a contraindication toestrogen, such as hypertension. The injection(Depo-Provera) and the new implant (Implanon)have a lower failure rate because compliance is notrequired on a daily basis\u2014only once every threemonths for the Depo-Provera shot and every three Emergency Contraception Take 4 of one of the following pills within 72 hours after unprotected sex, and take 4 more pills 12 hours later: Cryselle LevlenLevora Lo/Ovral Another option: take 5 of one of the following pills within 72 hours after unprotected sex and take 5more pills 12 hours later: years for the Implanon. Both work by suppressing ovulation to an extent, neither as completely as thecombination birth control pill, but this mecha-nism is augmented by even thicker cervical mucusthat impedes the sperm at the cervix. They aren'tas good for cyst suppression because of the incom-plete suppression of ovulation. Implanon boaststhe lowest systemic hormone dose of any hor-monal method because it is released at such asteady low dose by the implant. As a consequence,menses are irregular in up to 40 percent ofwomen. This tends to improve over time and istolerated better by some than others. Depo-Provera, on the other hand, suppresses menses entirely by one year of use, and it can take5 to 18 months for fertility to return. There is con-cern that inadequate estrogen will be available forbone density protection as a consequence of theestrogen suppression. There is reversible bone lossover time on Depo-Provera, and the FDA hasrequired the company to do a prospective study ofbone density in users. Because both the shot andthe implant cannot be immediately reversed oncethey start, I encourage women to try the pill rst,unless they can't remember to take a daily pill orcan't tolerate the estrogen. There is also a vaginalring, Nuvaring, that contains both estrogen andprogestin and lasts three weeks, which is popularwith women who forget their daily pill. T ransdermal combined estrogen/progestin can be delivered in a contraceptive patch and isavailable as Ortho Evra. It was approved by theFDA in 2002 and delivers 20 mcg of ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg of norelgestromin, anactive metabolite of norgestimate. The regimen isto apply a patch once weekly for three consecu-tive weeks, followed by a patch-free week. It hasa side effect prole similar to the oral contracep-tives, although recent concerns have been raisedabout higher blood levels of estrogen in womenon the patch than on the birth control pill. Thenewer estrogen patch is associated with about 60percent higher blood levels of estrogen than theequivalent version in an oral pill. This increase inestrogen levels can expose women to a higher risk of clotting. Clearly, this issue needs to be dis-cussed with your health-care practitioner. STERILIZATION Sterilization for men and women is still a widely used form of birth control. For men, this is a vasec-tomy. For women, there is now an alternative to atubal ligation, called Essure. Tiny springs areinserted into the openings of the fallopian tubesfrom the cavity of the uterus, so no surgery is done.It can be provided in an outpatient setting. Adoctor uses a speculum, dilates the cervix, inserts aflexible ber optic scope to see inside the uterus,then threads the springs into the tubes. You must have a tubal dye x-ray test three months after insertion to check that tissue grewinto the springs and blocked the tubes, indicat-ing a successful sterilization. ABORTION Unfortunately, all methods of birth control can fail. Humans make mistakes. Women have sexagainst their wills. For all these reasons and more,abortion will always be with us, and it bears amention in a discussion of fertility control.Women practiced abortion long before they prac-ticed birth control, because that's what was avail-able to them. The last measurable drop inmaternal mortality in the United States occurredwith the legalization of abortion in 1973. Abor-tion has never been safer, with mortality at 0.25deaths per 100,000 women\u2014about 20 times saferthan childbirth. 19Unfortunately, the political fracas around abortion\u2014and the real risk to work-ers and patients of clinic violence\u2014has madeaccess to abortion more rather than less difcult inrecent times. We must recall that the battle forbirth control was nearly as emotional; perhapssomeday we will see this struggle resolved as well. In the interim, if you choose an abortion, con- sult your regular provider rst. Gynecologists andfamily doctors need to realize how many women(1.5 million per year) in all walks of life need this62WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE service and how judged they feel\u2014most obviously by \"pro-life\" practitioners, but also by their pro-choice doctors who send them across town to aclinic just because it's easier for that doctor. If yourgynecologist won't help, go to one of the wonder-ful women-run and supported clinics that providethe service out of love and respect for women.Their doctors are very experienced, with extremelylow complication rates. Emergency contraceptioncan be obtained at most clinics as well, althoughemergency contraception is now available over thecounter for women over the age of 18.Rather than a surgical abortion, medical abor- tion with a drug called mifepristone (Ru-486) is agood option for early pregnancies, and it offers amethod of abortion that aligns much more natu-rally with our bodies. The medical abortion is justlike a miscarriage. There is more bleeding andcramping than a period, but it occurs within a 4-to 24-hour period, and 98 percent of the timeavoids surgery altogether. The infection rate islower, and the chance of signicant uterine injury,already miniscule, is further lowered. Manywomen are quite pleased with this method.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis (infec-tion of the bladder) and recurrent cystitis are twoimportant categories of urinary tract infectionsin adults. Distinguishing between uncomplicatedand complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs)is important because they may require differentevaluation tests and procedures, as well as differenttypes and duration of treatment plans. A compli-cated infection is associated with a condition thatincreases the risk of urinary tract infections or isassociated with an increased likelihood of treat-ment failure such as HIV, diabetes, or having acatheter. An uncomplicated infection is one thatlasts less than one week, is unaccompanied by afever, and presents itself in low-risk individuals,such as nonpregnant, otherwise healthy women. Symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis include painful and frequent urination, the urge to uri-nate even though the bladder may be nearlyempty, and pressure and pain in the pelvic area.Acute cystitis is generally uncomplicated but maybe complicated if the individual has a catheter oralso has a stone in the bladder. It is not alwayspossibly to classify someone as having a compli-cated or uncomplicated UTI based on urinarytract symptoms alone. However, there are factorsthat suggest the presence of a complicated UTIin women. These include: Being elderly or young Having a hospital-acquired infection Pregnancy Having a urinary catheter Having had a recent procedure involving urinary tract instrumentation Recent use of antibiotics Symptoms that have lasted longer than seven days Diabetes Immunosuppression (HIV, immunosuppres- sive medications) Simple, short-duration therapies may not beappropriate for these situations. It is reassuring that most of the acute UTIs that occur are uncomplicated. Health-care practitionerscan generally assume that a premenopausal, sexu-ally active woman who is not pregnant, has notbeen recently treated with antibiotics, and doesnot have a history of a genitourinary tract abnor-mality has uncomplicated cystitis or difcult urination), or urgency. It is even likely thatmost postmenopausal women who do not have agenitourinary tract abnormality have uncompli-cated UTIs. A narrow spectrum of microbes are responsible for the infections in young women with acuteuncomplicated cystitis: Escherichia coli (80 per- cent), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5 per- cent), and occasionally Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis , or other microorganisms. Bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is more common in womenwho are sexually active, and certain forms of con-traception are associated with urinary tract infec-tions. Sexual intercourse, diaphragm withspermicide, spermicides used alone, oral contracep-tives, delayed postcoital urination, and a history ofa recent urinary tract infection all increase the riskof initial and recurrent infection. Sexual inter-course is the strongest risk factor for UTIs, inde-pendent of contraception influences. As many as30 percent of women with cystitis symptoms mayhave subclinical upper urinary tract involvement. 5 CYSTITIS CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 66WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Young women who present with acute pain with urination or difcult urination usually also involve dysuria. These prob- lems can usually be differentiated on the basis ofsymptoms, physical exam, and urinalysis. A urineculture and vaginal cultures may also be needed. Pregnancy is also a risk factor for UTI. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists (ACOG) recommends that all pregnantwomen be screened for bacteriuria, even withoutsymptoms. However, not all major authorities rec-ommend this. Screening involves an initial urineculture in all women who are pregnant. If a preg-nant woman has classic symptoms of an acute anduncomplicated cystitis and no previous history ofbacteria in the urine without symptoms, some cli-nicians would go ahead and treat for cystitis, whileothers would do a urine culture before treating. Recurrent infections, dened as more than three infections in six months or six to seveninfections in a year, occur in about 20 percent ofyoung women that have experienced a previousepisode of cystitis. Over 90 percent of recur-rences in young women are episodes of reinfec-tion from exogenous sources that typically occurmonths apart. Recurrences due to a persistentfocus of infection in the urinary tract or toanatomical or functional abnormalities are lesscommon. Cases of recurrent cystitis should becultured and documented at least once. Somewomen may need not only treatment but alsocontinuous prophylaxis (preventive measures) orpostcoital prophylaxis. Postmenopausal women may also have fre- quent reinfections, which are often due to resid-ual urine retention after voiding or to a lack ofestrogen, which can cause marked changes in thevaginal and bladder microflora, including loss oflactobacilli and increased colonization by E. coli . Vaginal estrogen treatments are a key in restoringnormal vaginal and bladder flora.Diagnosis of a bladder infection can be based on symptoms and physical exam alone, a urinedipstick, urinalysis, and/or a urine culture. Basingthe diagnosis on symptoms alone is consideredreliable when the episodes are infrequent or occurless than three times per year. The urine dipsticktest is a simple test performed in the practitioner'sofce that uses a dipstick of the urine to test forleukocyte esterase with or without urinary nitriteand pyuria (the presence of pus in the urine).There are problems with the sensitivity and speci-city of the test, and it may be incorrectly negativeif bladder bacteria have not had enough time to produce a sufcient amount of nitrite to bedetectable. The accuracy of the test is also alteredif the individual is eating a vegetable-free diet or isusing a diuretic. The nitrite tests on the urine dipare frequently negative, even in the presence oftwo bacteria, S. saprophyticus and Enterococcus species. The leukocyte esterase test is more accu-rate than the nitrite test. The urinalysis is a macroscopic and micro- scopic analysis of urine performed at the practi-tioner's ofce or the lab. The urine is examined forcolor and cloudiness, then examined under themicroscope for white blood cells, red blood cells,epithelial cells (looking especially for an increasednumber or some sloughing down from the kid-neys), bacteria, yeast, and crystals. The urine dip-stick test is also done in a complete urinalysis. A urine culture is often done after a history and physical exam suggests something other than anacute, uncomplicated UTI. If a recent UTI has justbeen treated and now the symptoms are recurring,a culture would identify the possibility of a resist-ant pathogen. Worrisome symptoms such as fever,malaise, and back pain over the kidney regionsuggest that the infection may have ascended theurinary tract and warrant a urine culture. Other diagnostic evaluations of UTI such as a cystourethroscopy, ultrasound, or intravenouspyelogram should be considered in women whohave recurrent UTIs. Even though these moresophisticated studies should be considered, it is also67CYSTITIS important to realize that some women may report symptoms that may sound like an infection, butare actually symptoms from an overactive bladder,interstitial cystitis, or a pelvic-floor problem such asa cystocele or uterine prolapse. Keep in mind thatsome recurrent UTIs are caused by anatomic fac-tors such as a shorter urethra-to-anus length orbirth defects in the urinary tract. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS For most bladder infections, a natural approach is usually very effective and the infection resolvesquickly without recurrence or complications. Theprimary goals of a natural therapeutics approachare to: Enhance the individual's internal defenses against the infection by providing immunesupport Restore vaginal and bladder microflora, enhancing the flow of urine Promote a proper pH by acidifying the urine Prevent bacteria from adhering to the blad- der lining Simple goals, such as increasing the urinary flow, are easily accomplished by increasing thequantity of liquids. Water and herbal teas related to the treatment goals are the most logicalchoices. Sixty-four ounces of liquids per day isthe common recommendation. Urinating afterintercourse is also an important bladder hygienepractice that can prevent recurring UTIs. The lactobacilli species are an especially effec- tive means of alternative treatment for a couple ofreasons. For one, they defend against E. coli , which causes the majority of urinary infections. A healthyvaginal ecology is dominated by lactobacillispecies, 1bacteria that defend against both UTIs and infectious vaginitis. Studies have shown thatwomen who have recurrent UTIs have a prepon-derance of uropathogens on the introitus and inthe vagina. 2Lactobacilli adhere to the uroepithelial cells and inhibit the adherence of pathogenicorganisms such as E. coli to the cells, thereby pre- venting proliferation. In addition, the H 2O2- producing lactobacilli that are most commonlyfound in the normal bladder flora ( Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus jensenii ) can help to keep the bladder in its preferred acidic state. 3 Nutrition Since most UTIs are caused by E. coli , and this resides predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract,KEY CONCEPTS UTIs are most commonly caused by the organism E. coli. UTIs are most common in young heterosexually active women. Sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for a UTI. Spermicides, diaphragms, and hormonal contra- ception all increase the risk for UTIs. Pregnant women and postmenopausal women are also at risk for UTIs due to the effect of hormones on the flora of the vagina, urethra, and bladder. Common diagnostic tests include the urine dipstick and the urine culture.PREVENTION Increase fluid intake. Urinate when you have the urge. Maintain bathroom hygiene. Wear cotton undergarments. Urinate after intercourse. Consider a different contraceptive method if you are getting recurring UTIs. Drink fresh juices, especially berry juices includ- ing cranberry and blueberry. Eat fermented milk products containing probi- otic bacteria. Reduce dietary bladder irritants such as alcohol, chocolate, citrus fruits, coffee, black tea, toma-toes, vinegar, and sugar.68WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE it seems reasonable that the risk for infection might be altered by dietary influences and diges-tive health. In fact, the risk for infection changeswith dietary modications. 4The dietary and lifestyle habits of 139 women university studentswith a diagnosis of an acute UTI were comparedwith those of 185 age-matched women with noUTIs in the last ve years. It was found that fre-quent consumption of fresh juices, especially berryjuices, and fermented milk products containingprobiotics was associated with a decreased risk of recurring UTIs. Consuming fermented milkproducts three or more times per week was betterthan less than one time per week. In this samestudy, frequency of intercourse was associated withincreased risk of UTI as well. Common probiotic-containing fermented milk products include lactobacillus acidophilus and ker. Increasing garlic and onions in the dietmay also be helpful due to their antimicrobialactivity. They have been shown to inhibit thegrowth of E. coli ,Proteus ,Klebsiella pneumonia , Staphylococcus , and Streptococcus . 5-7 Other logical dietary considerations for women with recurring infections are to avoidexcess sugar consumption, assess and avoid foodallergens, and eat a diet that promotes healthydigestive function, including complex carbohy-drates, high ber, fermented dairy products, andhealthy oils such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds. Large amounts of fluids are highly recom- mended for preventing UTIs, as they literallyflush out the urinary tract and dilute the concen-tration of disease-causing bacteria. Drink approxi-mately 64 ounces (two liters) per day , including 16 ounces (500 ml) of unsweetened cranberryjuice (see section on cranberry) and 8 ounces ofblueberry juice (250 ml) daily. Nutritional Supplements Cranberry. No natural approach to cystitis would be complete without mention of cran-berry. Women have used cranberry juice as ahome remedy for decades. Several studies haveshown that cranberries and cranberry juice are effective in women with active urinary tractinfections. 8-9In a large randomized, controlled study, 300 ml (10 ounces) of cranberry juice wasgiven to 153 elderly women with conrmed bac-teruria. 10The level of bacteria in the urine and the frequency of recurring infections was dramat-ically decreased. In another study, 500 ml per day (17 ounces) of cranberry juice was shown tobe helpful in 73 percent of the individuals withactive UTIs. 11In an older study, 16 ounces of cranberry juice daily was effective in 73 percentof individuals with an active infection. This effectiveness is commonly attributed to cranberry juice's hippuric acid content, antibac-terial effect, and acidity. However, studies haveshown that components in cranberry juicereduce the ability of E. coli to adhere to the lining of the bladder and urethra. 12-15 Often, women prefer cranberry extracts instead of cranberry juice as unsweetened cran-berry juice is unpalatable and sweetened cranberryis more challenging to the immune system. Cran-berry extracts are available in capsule form andhave been studied for prevention of UTIs. Cran-berry extracts were compared with cranberry juicein a one-year randomized, controlled trial in 150sexually active women of diverse ages. 16One tablet was given twice daily to women in one group, and250 ml of cranberry juice was given three timesper day to the other group. Both decreased thenumber of individuals who had at least one infec-tion per year. Antibiotics were also used less inboth the extract and the juice group, comparedwith the placebo group. Cranberry extracts are less expensive than cranberry juice. Another advantage of theextracts is the concern that the oxalates in cran-berry juice could contribute to kidney stone formation. While logical, no studies have yetdemonstrated an increase in kidney stones afterdrinking cranberry juice. Cranberry extracts can also be found in numerous combination herbal/nutritional for-69CYSTITIS mulations is for preg-nant and lactating women. Cranberry Extract Acute infections: 400 mg 3 times daily or more Chronic, recurring infections: 400 mg 1-2 times daily Lactobacilli. Probiotics, especially lacto- by speciespredominate the vaginal ofhealthy premenopausal Women whohave recurring UTIs have an imbalance of theirflora, and if we restored the flora, we could go along way to prevent the infection-causing organ-isms from dominating. A recent review was done of all studies on the role of lactobacilli and UTIs in 2006. 17From the studies that are available, probiotics appear to be benecial for preventing recurrent UTIs inwomen. The Lactobacillus rhamnosus andreuteri (previously called L. fermentum ) strains were found to be the most effective. The hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli are critical in maintaining acidity and inhibitingpathogenic bacteria from adhering to both thevaginal and bladder walls. In addition to consum-ing fermented dairy products with lactobacilli,vaginal suppositories and oral supplementation are good means of administering lactobacilli. In asmall study, women with recurrent urinary tractinfections were treated with Lactobacillus casei species topically and via suppository twiceweekly. 18Each patient had infection-free periods ranging from four weeks to six months. Lactobacilli species are safe for pregnant and lactating women. Vitamin C. The benecial effects and functions of vitamin C are numerous and critical to optimalhealth. Vitamin C is involved in the manufactureof collagen, the main protein substance in the body,which results in its role in wound repair, connectivetissue structures, vascular wall integrity, skin elastic-ity, healthy gums, and more. It is also critical toimmune function, the absorption and utilization ofother nutrients, and the manufacture of numeroushormones and nerve conduction substances, and itis an antioxidant. As early as the 1960s, ascorbicacid (vitamin C) was shown to be an effectiveurinary acidifying agent, 19a successful means of treating urethra and bladder infections. While some of these functions help maintain normal tissue health of the bladder and urethra,vitamin C has some additional effects when itcomes to treating UTIs. During a UTI, nitratesare often generated by bacteria in the urine.Acidifying nitrite forms nitric oxide along withother reactive nitrogen oxides are toxic to ahost of organisms, including cystitis-causing bac-teria. A study examining the effects of ascorbicacid on nitrite in the urine and bacterial growthfound that acidifying the urine, even mildly, gen-erated large amounts of nitrous oxide, which wasincreased by larger amounts of ascorbic acid. Asa result, the growth of three common bladderpathogens, E. coli ,Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus saprophyticus inhibited. provide a good ration- Lactobacilli Species Acute infections: 24 billion organisms or more per day for active treatment Chronic, recurring infections: 8-16 billion organisms per day Prevention: 2-8 billion organisms dailyVitamin C Acute infections: 500-2,000 mg every 2 hours for 2 days, then 500-2,000 mg 3 times daily for 5-10days Chronic, recurring infections: 1,000-3,000 mg daily Prevention: 500-1,000 mg daily70WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ale for the benecial effects of vitamin C for both prevention and treatment of UTIs. Vitamin C is likely safe for pregnant and lactat- ing women in controlled amounts: up to 2,000 mgper day in women over age 19 and up to 1,800 mgper day for women 14 to 18. D-Mannose. D-mannose is a naturally occur- ring simple sugar contained in cranberry juice thatis helpful in treatment of UTIs. D-mannose adheresto the bladder epithelium, interfering with the abil-ity of the E. coli to adhere 21and cause infection. It is likely safe for pregnant and lactating women. Mannose Powder Acute infections:12-1 tsp 3 times daily Chronic, recurring infections: 1 ( Arctostaphylos Uva-Ursi ).One of bladder infection is uva-ursi ( Arctostaphylos its arbutin content. Uva-ursi is espe-cially active against E. coli and has diuretic proper- ties. Uva-ursi has also been used with recurrentbladder infections and was proven effective in adouble-blind study of 57 women. 22After one year, 5 out of 27 women in the placebo group had arecurrence of cystitis, while none of 30 womenhad a recurrence in the uva-ursi group. Historically, many herbalists have taught that herbs with arbutin work best in an alkalineenvironment. That would appear to present aproblem given that acidifying the urine is a funda-mental concept in the successful treatment ofUTIs. This potential issue has not been a factor inthe great success I've witnessed in treating UTIs byacidifying the urine with vitamin C while simulta-neously using uva-ursi and other botanicals. Because of its potential irritating and inflam- matory effects on the urinary tract mucous mem-branes, uva-ursi is best used in combination with other botanicals. It is not safe for use by pregnantwomen and unknown whether or not it is safefor lactating women. Uva-Ursi Acute infections: 1-112tsp tincture or 300 mg dried herb capsule every 3 hours for 2 days, then 1-112 tsp 3 times daily for 7 days Chronic, recurring infections: best not to use more than 5 or 6 times per year; use in combination withsoothing botanicals such as marshmallow Prevention: best not to use for long term Pipsissewa ( Chimaphila umbellata ).Pipsis- sewa, a andalso known as chimaphila, bitter wintergreen, orground holly, is a traditional remedy for urinaryinfections. As with uva-ursi, its antiseptic/mildlyantimicrobial effects are attributed to its arbutincontent. It has mildly diuretic, astringent, and anti-spasmodic properties as well, all important mecha-nisms in treating UTIs. Due to its arbutin content,this herb is best used for shorter-term use, or occa-sional use (up to four or ve times per year), as foruva-ursi. It is unknown whether or not pipsissewais safe for pregnant and lactating women. Pipsissewa Dried root: 1-2 g per day Tincture: 1-112tsp per day Best used in combination with other botanicals, for both acute and chronic recurring infections themost important herbs for bladder infections due totheir antimicrobial properties. Berberine, an alka-loid constituent found in and root ofthese plants, has demonstrated antibacterial species, Staphy- lococcus , and Pseudomonas species. 23, 24Berberine is effective against many bacteria and is also able to71CYSTITIS ght infections by inhibiting the bacteria from adhering to the host cell.25It is unsafe for pregnant women and best not used by lactating women. Goldenseal Freeze-dried root: 1-112tsp per day Additional Botanicals. Other botanicals have been traditionally used for bladder infec-tions with positive effect. The water-solublemucilage herbs are known to be soothing to theirritated uroepithelium and reduce inflamma-tion. These include corn silk for its soothing andcooling effect on the urinary tract; marshmallow root due to its content of mucilage, which canform a protective layer on the lining of the blad-der; and even plantain leaf with its high percent-age of mucilage and allantoin. Additional antimicrobial herbs for the bladder include bucchu, myrrh, and juniper berry.Numerous immune echinacea, osha, and wild indigo root.Bladder tonics stimulate the flow of blood andnutrients to the urinary tract and may be usefuladjunct herbs. herbs effects andincrease the flow of urine to help flush the bacteria. Sample Treatment Plans See the Resources section for sources of herbal products. Acute UTI Cranberry juice: 16 oz daily Increase water: 8 or more 8-oz glasses daily Vitamin C: 2,000 mg every 2 hours for 2 days, then 2 g 3 times daily for 7-10 days Combination herbal product such as cranberry, Oregon grape root, bucchu, uva-ursi, pipsissewa, marshmallow root: 2 capsules every 2 hours for 2days, then 2 capsules 3 times daily for 5-10 days D-mannose: 12-1 tsp 3 times daily for 5-10 days Chronic, Recurring UTI (3- to 6-Month Plan) Premenopausal Women Urinate upon urge and after intercourse. Use condoms for intercourse. Increase fluids. Take the following supplements: Combination herbal product: 1-2 capsules daily if needed Postmenopausal Women Urinate upon urge and after intercourse. Use condoms for intercourse. Increase fluids. Take the following supplements: Combination herbal product: 1-2 capsules daily Cranberry extract: 8-16 oz if needed Intravaginal estriol (1 mg/g): insert 1 g twice daily for 2 weeks, then twice weekly asmaintenance dose; or estriol suppositories (1 mg): insert 1 daily for 2 weeks, thentwice weekly as maintenance dose Consider oral hormone therapy. With these prevention and treatment strategies, it will rarely be necessary to use antibiotics foracute, chronic, or recurring UTIs. Please consultwith your practitioners about use of these products in pregnancy and lactation or if you are taking medications.72WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Intravaginal Estriol. In postmenopausal women, other influences are important to con-sider for chronic recurring UTIs. Lower estrogenstates result in fewer lactobacilli in the vagina andbladder. Fortunately, vaginal estrogens are a very safe and effective solution. Intravaginalestriol effectively treats recurring UTIs in post-menopausal women 26by restoring the normal vaginal flora and reducing the risk of vaginal E. coli colonization. Other, more commercially available vaginal estrogens are also used for thissame purpose. Intravaginal Estriol For chronic, recurring infections and for prevention: intravaginal compounded estriol: 1 mg/g, insert 1 g twice daily, long term This is a prescription item. Discuss the issue of using a progestational agent with your licensed primary care practitioner, although most women will not need such an agent when using this low dose of vaginalestriol. CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL APPROACH The diagnosis of UTI in conventional practice is the same as that for alternative medicine. Conventional treatment, however, relies prima-rily on antibiotic therapy. For uncomplicated urinary tract infections, especially those follow-ing sexual intercourse, culture and sensitivitytesting are not mandatory, and any antibioticexcept penicillin will likely be effective. (Mostgram-negative bacterial isolates are resistant topenicillin.) The most commonly used agents arenitrofurantoin macrocrystals (100 mg twice a day), trimepthoprim -sulfamethoxazole double- strength (twice a day), or a fluoroquinolone suchas ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day). Cephalexin (500 mg three or four times a day) is another reasonable choice, but the dosing sched-ule may be onerous for most patients. The currentrecommendation is for three days of oral therapy. Ifthree days of therapy does not result in resolution of symptoms, a culture is recommended and theantibiotic changed pending sensitivities. Mostpractitioners, in such a circumstance, will treat fora longer period, usually seven days. Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infec- tions, particularly in young, sexually activewomen, may require what is called prophylactic(prevention) therapy to allow the bladder'sdepleted defenses to regenerate. This involveseither a single dose of antibiotic daily, a singledose of antibiotic following intercourse, or oneor two doses of antibiotic at the onset of earlysymptoms prior to a full-blown UTI. Women who have structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities or who are immuno-compromised develop complicated UTIs andrequire more aggressive evaluation and treat-ment. The workup will depend on the nature ofthe symptoms and the clinical situation. Generally, complicated infections are treated for 7 to 21 days. A \"test-of-cure\" culture should bedone approximately 5 to 7 days after completingtherapy. In rare cases, when the response to theantibiotic does not occur, surgery may be requiredto drain or remove the focus of infection. Conventional medicine has also borrowed freely from the naturopathic community, com-monly employing prophylactic regimens of cran-berry preparations and acidophilus. Blueberriesalso abundant proanthocyanidins and are,therefore, recommended as well. Current litera-ture discourages the use of vitamin C, as it hasnot proven to be of benet. In the postmeno-pausal population, topical estrogen therapy hasalso been shown to prevent infection. Due to the prevalence of UTI among women, there is a great impetus to develop new,non-antimicrobial preventative therapies. Themost promising current work involves vaccinesdelivered transvaginally. Multiple applications ofthe vaccine are required to confer resistance toinfection. In the recent past, bacteriophages,viruses that invade bacteria, were developed by73CYSTITIS the Russians to treat resistant pathogens. This technology was brought to the United States andtested briefly, but further development wastabled because the bacteria rapidly became resist-ant to the treatment. Scientists therefore con-tinue to seek more ideal means of preventing anderadicating infection. In the meantime, we are barely able to keep one step ahead of the bacteria. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) There are some denite situations as to when a licensed practitioner should be consulted. Cer-tainly, this list includes women with urinary symp-toms who are pregnant, have catheters, have had symptoms for longer than seven days, are immunocompromised (immunosuppressive drugs,HIV), or have chronic kidney disease or diabetes.Women who have recurring infections should probably be evaluated for underlying causes as wellas more sophisticated treatments. In addition, ifyou have symptoms of a bladder infection, plus afever, this warrants a practitioner visit right away, asit may indicate that the infection has traveled tothe kidneys. Blood in the urine is another signwhen one should see a practitioner. It is important to keep in mind that sexually transmitted infections due to chlamydia, gonor-rhea, or herpes simplex cause similar symptomsto bladder infections, as do yeast or bacterialvaginal infections. Making an accurate diagnosisis a key to successful treatment. A thorough his-tory, physical, and laboratory test are the mainways a practitioner can diagnose UTIs. Whetherit's alternative or conventional treatment, self-care should be limited to simple, uncomplicated,acute bladder infections that occur only once ortwice per year.This page intentionally left blank 75OVERVIEW Endometriosis, one of the most common yet misunderstood diseases, affects 10 to 15 percentof menstruating women between the ages of 24 and 40 years. In some cases, symptoms begin with the onset of menstruation. In others,symptoms begin later and progressively becomeworse until menopause. The triad of symptomsincludes dysmenorrhea (pain with menses), dys-pareunia (pain with vaginal intercourse), andinfertility. Acute pain occurs before menses andcan last for a day or two during menses orthroughout the month. This pain can be a life-disrupting experience, affecting a woman's socialrelationships, work, school, and well-being. Forsome women, vomiting, diarrhea, and faintingcan occur along with intense labor-like pains.Other pain is described as chronic bearing-downpain and pressure on the lower back and pelvis,sometimes radiating down the legs. Other lesscommon complaints include pain with urinationand bowel movements and bleeding from thenose, bladder, and/or bowels. Endometriomas,enlarged areas of ectopic endometrial involve-ment on the ovaries, are found in two out ofthree patients with endometriosis. 1 Early research as to the source of infertility initially led to the concept that endometriosiswas a \"working woman's disease.\" Women whodelayed pregnancy until later in life and werefound to have endometriosis were told to \"justget pregnant.\" Current research does not supportthis concept. However, research as to alteredimmune action within the pelvic cavity and thepossibility of antibody reactions to sperm hasprompted recognition of an immunological basisfor endometriosis. Other studies suggest thatinfertility is a cause of endometriosis, due to the unruptured follicle, rather than a result. 2 Whether endometriosis causes infertility or infer-tility causes endometriosis, tubal scarring, adhe-sions, and unruptured follicles are common withwomen having endometriosis and infertilityproblems. The main risk factor for endometriosis is heredity. The likelihood for a woman who has arst-degree relative with severe endometriosishaving endometriosis is six times higher thanthat for relatives of women without the disease. 3 Women with menstrual cycles that are shorter intime between cycles and longer in length havebeen found to be at higher risk for endometri-osis. 4Increased or altered estrogen levels, lack of exercise from early age, a high-fat diet, and use ofintrauterine devices have also been found to berisk factors. Even natural red hair color wasfound in one study to be a factor in the develop-ment of endometriosis. 5 Baboons who developed endometriosis in cap- tivity were found to have higher stress levels and adecreased ability to react to stress compared tothose in the wild, suggesting a stress factor. 6Indi- viduals who exercised consistently from an earlyage reported a decreased risk for endometriosis,while those who began an exercise program lateron experienced less painful periods. Although notall women with endometriosis have a childhoodhistory of abuse, a greater number of individualswith adhesions and/or endometriosis havereported abuse in their history. 7Additional possi- ble risk factors include prenatal exposure to highlevels of estrogen and pelvic contamination withmenstrual products, although these issues arelargely theory and research is needed.

Endometrialtissue can be found on surgical scar tissue, in thevagina, and on the cervix. Physical examinationduring the rst or second day of menses high-lights tender areas in the septum between therectum and vagina, most likely correlated withdeeply inltrating endometriosis. 8 An ultrasound study can determine the con- sistency of the endometriomas (areas of cysticendometriosis within the ovary). Evidence ofendometriosis other than on the ovaries cannotbe seen on the ultrasound. Although magneticresonance imaging (MRI) can detect endometri-omas, cost prevents widespread use. A blood testcalled a CA-125 can have positive results inendometriosis. The problem is that a high CA-125 cannot completely differentiate endometri-osis from uterine broids, cancerous growths,and normal tissue. High levels of CA-125 havebeen found in stages III and IV of endometriosis,which are the diagnoses for more advanced endo-metriosis. 9The CA-125 test may, however, help in monitoring treatment and progression onceendometriosis has been conrmed. However, thistest is not used by many practitioners. Denitive diagnosis of endometriosis can only be accomplished with a biopsy using either of thefollowing two surgical procedures. A laparoscopyis a surgical procedure in which the surgeon insertsa scope through one of two very small pelvic inci-sions. More invasive, a laparotomy consists ofmajor pelvic and/or abdominal surgery. Endometrial implants or lesions are known to have similarities to uterine tissue\u2014featuringendometrial glands, endometrial stroma, andhemorrhage into adjacent tissue. Growth of thistissue may be stimulated by estrogen. Therapeu-tic treatment aimed at manipulating the body'sown level of hormones as in menopause or preg-nancy has had a positive effect. In some individ-uals, the implants have their own cycle, with an ebb and flow that differ from the estrogen bind-ing during the menstrual cycle. 10 Although the most commonly accepted theo- ries of origin today vary and sometimes seemcontradictory, they all have their place in holisticapproaches to the treatment of endometriosis.The predominant theory rst proposed by Dr.John Albertson Sampson in 1927 is the theory ofretrograde flow\u2014that during menses, bloodflows backward and becomes seeds of implants inthe pelvic cavity. 11This theory and research showing that over 90 percent of menstruatingwomen without endometriosis have retrogradeflow have raised questions as to the biochemicaland immunological differences causing implan-tation within the pelvic environment. 12Endome- trial implants from women with endometriosiscompared with normal women have been foundto be biochemically different. 13Other studies suggest that cells may only implant in womenwith altered cell immunity. 14As implants are found in the nose, lungs, and other organs farfrom the uterus, transportation through lym-phatic channels and blood vessels has been sug-gested. Still other researchers believe the implantsto be of embryological origin, pieces of the uterusleft behind during development, which, whenactivated, secrete a chemical causing the nearbycapillaries to bleed. 15Research on baboons with endometriosis suggests activation by environ-mental toxins that mimic estrogens. 16 Whether implants are caused by retrograde flow, decreased immune function, genetic fac-tors, environmental influences, or embryologicaldevelopment or are stimulated by high estrogenlevels from the environment or within the body,the worsening of symptoms prompts individualsto seek medical help. There is not necessarily acorrelation between pain and the extent of thedisease. Women with xed ovaries and largeendometriomas may only report mild discom-fort, while those with visibly smaller lesions mayreport severe and chronic pain. Upon surgery,77ENDOMETRIOSIS these lesions are found to extend more deeply; they are possibly more influenced by circulatingestrogens. 17Research has found that the severity of symptoms is correlated with the depth of thelesions rather than the number of lesions. 18 The abnormalities found in women with endometriosis and the conditions that may pre-dispose them to it are complex. Some discussion,however, will help guide us toward more effectivemanagement and a better understanding of treat-ment options. Genetic Factors Groupings of endometriosis within families has been found in clinical studies, 3, 19populations- based studies,20and even studies of twins.21-23 Several analyses of the locations on the genes thatare shared by siblings indicate abnormalities indetoxication enzymes. This would lead to sus-ceptibilities to environmental exposures to sub-stances that could then lead to the increase in thedisease. Other insights have included that thegenes involved are associated with tumor sup-pressor genes. If these tumor suppressor genes areaffected, there is susceptibility to abnormal tissuegrowth, such as the endometriosis. Aberrantlyexpressed genes can also occur during the time ofimplantation, which may be an explanation forsome of the cases of endometriosis-associatedinfertility. Other genetic errors may occur inmultistep fashion involving both the develop-ment and the progression of the disease. 24 Environmental Factors Information about environmental influences on endometriosis in humans has been gleaned byobserving the negative effects of environmentalexposures to rhesus monkeys. Radiation exposureand dioxin exposure have lead to higher fre-quency of developing endometriosis in mon-keys. 25, 26 It would seem plausible to extend this consideration to environmental effects onwomen, especially when it was reported that thehighest dioxin pollution in the world was in Belgium, which also has the highest incidence of severe endometriosis. 27In two studies since, however, one in Belgium found no signicantlyincreased risk with dioxins or polychlorinatedbiphenyls, 28and in Italy, no signicantly in- creased risk of endometriosis was seen in womenwho had high levels of dioxin in their blood. 29 Currently, there is no epidemiological study denitively linking any one class of chemicals tothe risk of endometriosis, although there appearsto be some suggestion of a link with estrogen-like compounds in the environment 30called xeno- estrogens, which can disrupt estrogen and estro-gen metabolism. Substances that have beenshown to have estrogenic effects in the bodyinclude polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), weedkillers, substances that line cans, plastics, deter-gents, and household cleaners. 31 Despite this lack of identication of a deni- tive link between chemical exposures and endo-metriosis, we do know that women are exposedto a multitude of chemicals in utero, in child-hood, peripubertally (the time around theappearance of secondary sex characteristics suchas pubic hair), and as adults. We can identifychemicals in cosmetics, nail polish, plastics,household cleaners, dry cleaning, and foods. Asurvey by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (the National Report on HumanExposure to Environmental Chemicals) is cur-rently underway, which monitors 145 chemicalsin 2,500 people in the United States. 32 I would assert that the roles of toxic chemicals in reproductive health should not be underesti-mated, and that scientic investigations that\"suggest a correlation\" should be motivationenough to reduce the toxic exposure to chemicalestrogen-like compounds that disrupt our ownbodies' hormone-receptive tissues. The Immune Connection Increasingly, we are nding evidence that a lack of proper surveillance by the immune system inthe pelvic area is the cause of endometriosis, and78WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE alterations in other aspects of the immune system are involved in the progression of the disease.33 In studies on the immunological functions of baboons with spontaneous (noninduced) endo-metriosis, researchers have found a correlationbetween suppressed immunity and a highernumber and greater area of lesions. 34Both types of immunity, cell mediated and humoral, havebeen implicated in endometriosis, with immuno-logical defects present even in the mildest formsof the disease. 35Macrophages (a kind of white blood cell) that scavenge other microbes, debris,and aberrant tissue are found in greater numbersin the early stages of endometriosis. 36This increase in macrophage activity may correlatewith decreased fertility and possible reaction tosperm perceived by the woman's body as for-eign. 37In the peritoneal fluid (fluid aspirated from the area behind the membrane lining theabdominopelvic wall) of women with severeendometriosis, natural killer cell activity has beenfound to be suppressed. 38, 39 Natural killer cells release cell toxins and thus help keep tumor andother abnormal cells in check. By a decrease innatural killer cells, the immune defense againstthe growth of tissue is decreased. Interestingly,studies suggest a correlation between high estra-diol levels and decreased killer cell activity. 40 Humoral immunity is the component of the immune system that produces antibodies, morespecically immunoglobulins, which are pro-duced by B lymphocytes. These immunoglobu-lins provide protection to the body by theirattachment to foreign substances called antigens.Patients with endometriosis have been found tohave high levels of immunoglobulins IgG andIgM when compared with normal controls. 41 Higher than normal amounts of immunoglobu-lins cause destruction of the body's own tissue, asseen in autoimmune conditions. Evidence ofhigh levels of autoantibodies against ovarian andendometrial cells is consistent with the nding ofindividuals who have both endometriosis andautoimmune diseases. 42, 43Numerous changes in the makeup of the peritoneal fluid are also evident in women withendometriosis. Immune cells that mediate theinflammatory reaction such as cytokines, macro-phages, T lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factorshave all been found to be increased in concentra-tion in the peritoneal fluid in women with endo-metriosis, 44-46 and their increase correlates with the severity of the disease. Growth factors, angio-genic factors (increasing blood supply to areas ofendometriosis tissue), and lipid peroxidation in the peritoneal fluid may stimulate the endometrialcell growth. Targeting these proinflammatorycompounds and blocking their action with antiox-idants and other compounds provide a goodrationale for new treatment strategies, both con-ventional and with natural compounds. As mentioned earlier, irregular cycles are common among women with endometriosis.Anovulatory cycles (lack of ovulation), premen-strual spotting (very light bleeding before theonset of the menstrual flow), luteal phase defects(abnormal length of the second half of the men-strual cycle), and salivary progesterone secretionare altered in women with endometriosis. 47Since higher estrogen levels are implicated in endome-triosis, it is not surprising that heavy smokershave a decreased risk for endometriosis if theybegan smoking earlier in life, as smoking isknown to decrease estrogen levels. 48In addition, an increased body fat placement indicative ofincreased estrogen levels was also found to becorrelated with a higher incidence of endometri-osis. 49Since estrogens are known to stimulate endometrial implants, women on hormonereplacement therapy have been known to experi-ence a recurrence of endometriosis. 50 The Role of the Liver and the Gut in Hormone Metabolism The liver has the enormous task of breaking down estrogen and secreting metabolites through thebile into the large intestine. Whether hormonesare produced naturally within the body, are pro-79ENDOMETRIOSIS vided through medication, or enter the body as substances from the environment that mimicestrogen, optimal functioning of the liver is imper-ative in maintaining a healthy balance. 51Inappro- priate breakdown of estrogen can result in localliver damage, continual recycling of estrogens, andalterations in immune function. Since the liver isinvolved in breaking down 80 to 90 percent of thehormones in the body, it follows that optimal liverfunction can be of benet in treatment. The large intestine, which contains different types of microflora or gut organisms, has a uniquerole in the excretion and recycling of estrogen. Theliver inactivates moleculeand excreting this substance with the bile. Some\"unfriendly\" bacteria in the large intestine, how-ever, secrete an enzyme called beta-glucaronidasethat breaks down these bonds, releasing a strongestrogen that is then recycled back through thebody. In order to produce this enzyme, these bac-teria feed on fat taken in by the body. However,the balance can be restored by greater numbers of the \"friendly\" bacteria that feed on ber and crowd out the \"unfriendly\" bacteria. With abalance of the \"friendly\" bacteria in the largeintestine, a higher amount of inactivated estrogenmetabolites leave the body through the largeintestine, preventing their reactivation and move-ment back through the body. 52 Endometriosis is a complex disease with a variety of interconnecting influences. Enhancingthe immune system, the body; and providing optimal healthin the large intestine represent innovative andeffective approaches to the treatment of endome-triosis. Considering the long-term consequencesof endometriosis\u2014pain, disability, and disrup-tion in personal, family, and work activities\u2014innovative approaches that treat the whole bodyand remove the cause promise a light at the endof the tunnel.OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS While analgesics, anti-inflammatories and estrogen- blockers temporarily relieve symptoms, the needfor a long-term denitive treatment that involvesremoval of the cause is imperative. A systemicapproach to treatment that takes into considera-tion a multifaceted cause with long-term andacute symptomatic relief is the goal of alternativetherapy. While late-stage endometriosis may only be addressed by radical surgery, early treat-ment, in the form of stimulation of the body'sinherent ability to heal through enhancing theimmune system, restoring proper inflammatoryresponses, balancing hormones, and aiding in the KEY CONCEPTS A gynecological checkup is imperative with any type of pelvic pain to rule out any pelvic or abdominal abnormality. Provide symptom relief for acute pain. Provide removal of cause (endocrine, immune, environmental, liver). Create a plan for treatment of the chronic problem. Optimize nutritional intake and avoid environ- mental toxins. PREVENTION Eat nutritious whole foods. Include foods known to reduce inflammation such as sh, curries, andgarlic and high amounts of fruits and vegeta-bles, whole grains, and legumes. Reduce red meat, especially grain-fed meat. Get regular exercise. Avoid pesticides, chemicals, solvents, and heavy metals. Eat organic foods. Drink puried water. Maintain good digestion and regular bowel habits. Avoid alcohol.80WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE liver's ability to break down environmental and naturally occurring estrogen, is worthy of consid-eration. Certain foods and supplements aid in enhanc- ing the body's ability to mount a natural immuneresponse. Optimal liver function involves enhanc- ing the liver's ability to detoxify hormones, excessmedicines, and toxins through two main phases,called phase I and phase II detoxication. Individ-uals who have decreased function of the rst path-way continue to recycle hormones, toxins, andother products harmful to the body. If the seconddetoxication pathway is dysfunctional, the meta-bolic products of the rst pathway build up andcan become even more toxic, decreasing immuneresponse and accumulating as oxygen free radicals.These metabolites can cause tissue injury and for-mation of adhesions. 53Healthy elimination of these metabolites assures that the body doesn't geta chance to reabsorb them. Nutrition, exercise, and healthy lifestyle prac- tices play a preventive role in providing immunesupport and a healthy body's response to addedstressors and imbalances of hormones. Womenwho exercise and eat less fat and sugar produce lessestrogen. Vegetarian women excrete two to threetimes more estrogen in their feces and have half asmuch estrogen in their blood as meat-eaters. 54 Additional approaches in the area of mind-bodymedicine recognize that belief systems and emo-tional health affect optimal physical health. Nutrition The goods news is that there are numerous nutri- tional influences related to endometriosis. Thismeans we can take an active part in preventionand management of the condition. A recent retrospective study of over 500 women with endometriosis concluded that therewas a signicant decrease in risk of developingendometriosis with a greater consumption ofgreen vegetables and fresh fruit, and an increasein risk was associated with high intake of beefand other red meat. 55Foods high in ber are associated with opti- mal transit time in the intestines and an optimalbalance of friendly microorganisms within thelarge intestine. 56These microorganisms, better known as gut flora, crowd out the other types offlora that play a role in metabolizing estrogen.Studies suggest that an intake of less protein andhigh ber or a vegetarian diet lead to a decreaseof biologically active estrogens in blood plasma. 54 While higher protein diets are found to provideenzymes for the detoxication pathways of estra-diol, 57vegetarian diets are of greater value due to their lower fat content. Animal protein diets,especially egg yolks, poultry, and red meat, con-tain large amounts of arachidonic acid, whichpromotes inflammatory prostaglandins and thusinflammation and pain. By enhancing your dietwith vegetable protein, soy, almond and othernut butters, and salmon, you tip the inflamma-tory pathway toward anti-inflammatory pro-staglandins that inhibit tumor growth\u2014andpossibly endometrial growth. Interestingly, arecent study in Japan demonstrated that moder-ate isoflavone intake from soy was signicantlyassociated with a decreased risk of premeno-pausal hysterectomy. This data led the authors toconclude that moderate soy intake may decreasethe risk for diseases like endometriosis, whichcommonly precipitate premenopausal hysterec-tomies. 58Another study of 50 women with endo- metriosis examined the effect of dietary changes,specically the reduction of glycemic carbohy-drates, the addition of omega-3 and omega-9fatty acids, and the elimination of foods with caffeine and tyramine, and found a signicantreduction in symptoms after eight weeks. 59 By increasing intake of vegetables, specically those that enhance liver function, the buildup oftoxins and metabolites that produce cell damageis prevented. Liver-friendly foods to increase arecarrots, kale, and the cabbage family vegetablesdue to their known help in phase II of the liver'sdetoxication pathway. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C),found in broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, active of andleeks thatenhance the immune system and induce enzymesthat detoxify the liver. In addition, they containthe bioflavonoid quercitin, which is known tostimulate the immune response, protect againstoxidation, block the inflammatory response, andinhibit tumor growth. 61By eating as many of your vegetables as possible in an organic form, you cutdown on your intake of pesticides that may alsomimic estrogen. Use seasonings such as turmeric (curcumin) that protect against environmental carcinogens,decrease inflammation, and increase bile secretion.Ginger is helpful with many types of inflamma-tion\u2014and helps with liver detoxication. Adding atablespoon of soaked and ground milk thistle seedseach day can also help with liver function. Grind atablespoon of fresh flaxseeds and place on cereals orsalads. The increase in lignans from these seeds aidsin providing ber as well as an oil that helps in theanti-inflammatory pathway. Seasoning with fucus(a seaweed) helps stimulate T cell production andabsorb toxins. 62 Foods to omit or decrease include sugar, caffeine, egg yolks, poultry, red meat, and alco-hol. Sugar is known to increase estrogen levels in men; presumably the effect is similar inwomen. 63Endometriosis is found to be corre- lated with caffeine consumption. Women con-suming 5,000 to 7,000 mg of caffeine per monthhad a 1.2 times greater incidence of endometri-osis, while those consuming over 7,000 mg permonth had a 1.6 times increase. 64One cup of coffee contains 120 mg of caffeine; one cup of black tea contains 60 mg; one cup of decaf-feinated contains about 2 mg of caffeine. The Environmental Protection Agency esti- mates that 90 percent of human dioxin exposure isthrough food, primarily meat and dairy prod-ucts. 65Egg yolks, meat, and poultry cause the lipidpathway to be tipped toward prostaglandins and leukotrienes that cause inflammation, smoothmuscle contraction, and vascular constriction.Alcohol use depletes stores of B vitamins in theliver and also has estrogenic effects on the body. Nutritional Supplements Before beginning the discussion on nutritional supplements, it is important to explain the con-cepts of free radicals, antioxidants, and free radi-cal scavengers. There are several ways to dene afree radical, but a denition I like is, \"an atom orgroup of atoms that has at least one unpairedelectron and is therefore unstable and highlyreactive.\" Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E,selenium, carotenes, and others are moleculesthat defend the body from cellular damage byending the free radical chain reaction before vitalmolecules are harmed. These are often referred toas \"free radical scavengers.\" Vitamin C. Studies using vitamin C show increase in cellular immunity and decreases inDietary Recommendations Eat a high-ber diet. Eat a high-protein vegetarian diet. Increase intake of vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Use turmeric, ginger, milk thistle, and flaxseeds. Omit or decrease alcohol, dairy, red meat, sugar, and caffeine. Eat cold water sh (salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, herring) 2 or 3 times per week. Eat organic foods. Vitamin C Take 6-10 g in divided doses daily, starting with1,000 mg a day, then add 1,000 mg every 4 or 5 days until the stools become loose. At this point, back down to the previous dose of vitamin C so that thestools are normal in consistency.82WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE autoimmune progression and fatigue.66In addi- tion, vitamin C enhances immunity and decreasescapillary fragility and tumor growth, all of whichare involved at various levels in endometriosis.Studies on autoimmune progression indicate theeffectiveness of high levels of vitamin C. 67 Beta-Carotene. Beta-carotene helps enhance immunity. Recent research shows that retinoidscan help decrease IL-6, an inflammatory media-tor, which has been implicated in endometri-osis. 68In addition, studies show that use of beta-carotene increased T cell levels after sevendays. 69Beta-carotene was also shown to be pro- tective against early stages of tumor growth.70 Impairment of phagocytosis (the engulng ofmicroorganisms, other cells, and foreign particlesby white blood cells) is seen in vitamin A-decient states. 71Although vitamin A was used in this study, one-third of beta-carotene is convertedto the active form of vitamin A, retinol. Additionalstudies suggest that immune function is due tocarotenoids rather than vitamin A. 72 Beta-Carotene 50,000-150,000 IU daily Vitamin E. Recent research demonstrates that free radicals may contribute to the inflam-mation and excessive growth of endometrialtissue seen in endometriosis, and in these circum-stances, antioxidants such as vitamin E and N-acetyl cysteine can act to inhibit this abnormalproliferation. 73, 74 Vitamin E also helps to correct abnormal progesterone/estradiol ratios in patients withmammary dysplasia (increased growth of cells). 75 Since parallels have been found between abnor-mal tumor growth in cancer and abnormalgrowth of lesions in endometriosis, vitamin Esupplementation may be advantageous. Whilesecondary dysmenorrhea is usually involved withendometriosis, studies on the use of vitamin Ewith primary dysmenorrhea 76show benet per-haps through the arachidonic lipid pathway. Inhibiting the arachidonic path-way helps prevent the release of chemicals thatwould normally cause edema, inflammation, andsmooth muscle contraction. Vitamin E 400-800 IU daily Essential Fatty alpha-linolenic acid (flaxseed, canola, pump-kin seed, soy, and walnut oils) help decrease theinflammatory response on the tissue level throughpathways that produce prostaglandins in the body.Depending on one of three main pathways ofprostaglandin production, the effects can be help-ful or harmful to the body. Animal fats produce apathway of prostaglandin products that increaseinflammation, muscle constriction, and edema.However, gamma-linolenic acid and alpha-linolenic acid produce the opposite effects. Thesefatty acids taken in supplemental form can pro-duce the prostaglandins that are involved ininhibiting tumor growth, dilating smooth muscle,and decreasing inflammation. 77Since endometri- osis tissue, called implants, are thought to secretechemicals that cause leakage from nearby capillarybeds, decreasing the permeability of these vesselscould help control the tissue destruction andadhesions, decreasing irritation in the pelvis.Recent research demonstrates that having a higheromega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio may have asuppressive effect on the in vitro survival ofendometrial cells, leading the authors to concludethat omega-3 fatty acids may be useful in the man-agement of endometriosis by decreasing inflam- Essential Fatty Acids Eicosapentaenoic 1,080 gamma-linolenic acid: 300 mg daily83ENDOMETRIOSIS mation.78In an animal model, sh oils were found to decrease prostaglandin production and inhibitthe growth of endometrial implants. 79 B Vitamins. B vitamins help the liver to inac- tivate estrogen. Studies suggest that supplemen-tation of B vitamins may cause the liver tobecome more efcient in processing estrogen. 80 B Vitamins 50-100 mg B-vitamin complex; B 6should not exceed 200 mg daily Selenium. Selenium aids in the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes responsible for detoxica-tion reactions within the liver. In addition, sele-nium stimulates white blood cells and thymusfunction. 81Individuals with decreased selenium levels have suboptimal cell-mediated 200-400 mcg daily Lipotropics. Lipotropics aid in liver function and detoxication reactions.

The herbs appropriate for acute pain relief in endo-metriosis are the same herbs used for menstrualcramps. Valerian, crampbark, black cohosh, andother helpful herbs are discussed in Chapter 13.A recent study of a cyclic administration of twoJapanese herbal formulas of peony and licorice (Shakuyaku-kanzo-to) and peony and dong quai(Toki-shakuyaku-san) was found to decreaseendometrial pain in all patients studied and waseven reported to promote ovulation. 84Another study reported both hormonal and inflammatorymodulation that led to decreased volume ofendometrial implants in an animal model ofendometriosis through the use of Tripterygium wilfordii , another Chinese herb. 85 Traditional Herbal Therapies Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ).Chaste tree has traditionally been used as a treatment forhormone imbalances in women. Through actionon the pituitary gland, chaste tree has a proges-terone Useful for broids, premenstrual syn-drome, perimenopause, and various menstrualcycle disorders, it also has an indication in endo-metriosis, perhaps because less estrogen is avail-able detoxify-ing herbs. It works principally on the liver andgallbladder to help remove waste products. Bysupporting the liver, excessive estrogens andtoxins can be deactivated. Researchers in Japanhave found a link between dandelion and antitu-mor activity. 87In addition, dandelion leaf con- tains vitamins A, C, and K and calcium, as wellas choline, a lipotropic substance. Prickly Ash ( Xanthoxylum Americanum Prickly ash is known for its specic action oncapillary engorgement and sluggish circulation.Through its stimulation of blood flow through-out the body, prickly ash helps enhance the trans-port of oxygen and nutrients and the removal ofcellular waste products.

T urska's formula is a favorite old naturopathic treatment for decreasingaberrant cancer cell growth. A tincture of this for-mula is useful in treating endometriosis due to thesimilarities of cancer to cell growth found in the pelvis. This formula that have been knownto disrupt the assembly of microtubules that even-tually help in the formation of cells that differen-tiate and give rise to connective tissues, blood, lymphatics, bone, and cartilage. Quite possibly,these herbal alkaloids interfere with the induction of abnormal ectopic lesions within the pelvis (con-sistent with the theory of cells left behind inembryonic development). Bryonia is also knownto provide antitumor effects.

Poke root also has anti-inflammatory properties. Due toits potential toxicity, however, this tincture can beprovided only by a licensed health professional. Turska's Formula 5 drops 3 times daily See Resources section for sources. Natural Progesterone Progesterone has been known to modify the action of estradiol by decreasing the retention ofreceptors, causing a fall in serum estradiol levels.Women without enough progesterone are unableto balance out estrogen, leading to problems that result from a relative excess of estrogen. Inaddition, progesterone has the effect of sedatingpainful uterine contractions. Chapter 13 dis-cusses in more detail how progesterone inhibitsuterine contractions and reduces pain. It is possi-ble that this uterine sedative effect extends topain relief in the pelvic region in general. I havenot used natural progesterone alone as a treat-ment for endometriosis, but it has been myobservation that progesterone is an importantpart of a comprehensive treatment plan. Natural progesterone creams can be applied in various regimens. For some women I recom-mend 14teaspoon two times a day for three weeks on and the week of menses off, or applytwice daily from day 15 of the cycle to day 26.Other women just need to use it the week beforetheir menses is due. Still other cases requirehigher doses of natural oral micronized proges-terone in a cyclic dosing pattern. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Conventional medical treatment for endometri- osis usually involves diagnosis plus medical orsurgical treatment. Because one cannot feelendometriosis most of the time or detect it byultrasound or CAT scan, laparoscopy (a surgical procedure to view the interior of the abdomenand pelvis) remains the standard for diagnosis.Studies have repeatedly shown that 78 to 82 per-cent of women with chronic pelvic pain of morethan six months' duration that does not respondto nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or oral con-traceptives have endometriosis. A recent develop-ment in the treatment of endometriosis istreatment of presumptive disease without laparo-scopic proof. Some physicians now offer thisoption, and if no response is seen in six months,they then proceed with laparoscopy. Often, women with chronic painful periods or pelvic pain are initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication such asibuprofen, naproxen, or meclofenamate. Assymptoms progress, patients usually resort toprescription analgesics and/or hormones. Sinceestrogen is known to stimulate the growth ofendometriosis, treatment is aimed at suppressionof estrogen synthesis. By achieving states ofpseudopregnancy (through birth control pills) orpseudomenopause (through cessation of thebody's own production of estrogen and proges-terone), women have found signicant symptomrelief. Benet from birth control pills is thoughtto be due to reduced menstrual bleeding, anovu-lation, and lesion regression. However, stimula-tion of a lesion does occur, possibly due to adecrease in concentration of progesterone recep-tor sites and lesions. In the past, danazol was regarded as a highly effective drug because of its suppression of thepituitary and inhibition of estrogen and adrenalhormone production. Relief quite possibly is dueto reduction of endometriosis associated withautoimmune abnormalities. However, male pat-tern hair growth, irreversible low voice, hotflashes, depression, weight gain, acne, reducedbreast size, muscle cramps, fatigue, and othersymptoms related to the medication have causeddanazol to become a less popular alternative, andit has mostly fallen out of use.86WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Prescription drugs called gonadotropin- agonists (GnRH agonists),such as Lupron, Synarel, and are used toproduce a menopausal state. Upon stimulation ofthe receptors of the brain by these hormones, adecrease in production of LH (luteinizing hor-mone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) is achieved and causes the individual to have alow estrogen state. This causes dramatic relief of symptoms within two to three months. Sideeffects due to low estrogen, similar to thoseaccompanying natural menopause (insomnia,hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and osteoporosis) do occur. Current add-back therapy with low-dose estrogen or a progestin reduces symptoms without reducing effectiveness. Higher doses of hormone therapy such as oral contraceptives may make the lesions grow, so very low doses ofhormones are recommended. After the GnRHagonist is discontinued, recurrence of endometri-osis frequently occurs, so ovarian suppressionregimens like oral contraceptives or Depo-Provera injections are commonly used followingGnRH therapy. T reatment with progestins helps endometrial tissue to atrophy. However, side effects includenausea, weight gain, fluid retention, breakthroughbleeding, and sometimes depression. Combinations of estrogen and progestin such as those found in low-dose birth control pills sup-press FSH and LH. isachieved because the body's own estrogen produc-tion is decreased. In addition, since the volume ofmenstrual flow is also decreased, less blood is theo-retically available for reflux into the pelvic cavity. Current research shows promising results in the use of the antiprogesterone Ru-486 due tothe regression of endometriosis and possible min-imal side effects. Clinical trials are underway. Useof medications that enhance the immune systemare also being studied. Laparoscopic surgery has the advantage of extensive use of microscopic imaging so that sur-geons can view lesions in greater detail. In addi-tion, laparoscopy allows for a shorter recuperation time when compared to a laparotomy. During alaparotomy, the surgeon makes a larger incision inthe abdomen, allowing for larger endometriomasor adhesions to be excised. Surgery has produced cure for some individ- uals, while it has proved to be disappointing to others. Whether laparotomy or laparoscopy,surgical treatment varies as to type of surgery,technique, and surgeon experience. Conservativesurgery removes supercial endometriosis lesionsand/or endometriomas while leaving the uterusand ovaries intact. Recurrence rates vary from 5to 20 percent per year, with a rate of 40 percentafter ve years. Differences in recurrence rateswith surgery may be due to the method of endo-metriosis implant removal and the skill of thesurgeon. Laser surgery is able to penetrate deeply,but without the possibility of biopsy (provingendometriosis), while excision by electrocautery,which allows for meticulous biopsy, takes timeand additional effort. The knowledge and experi-ence of the surgeon are important in the identi-cation of the implants, since color, consistency,appearance, and location of the implants can bevariable. In addition, some surgeons remove theclear peritoneal covering, as they believe thatendometrial implants reside in this tissue. The disease frequently recurs unless a woman has had a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterus and bothovaries and fallopian tubes). Aggressive surgeryconsists of removing implants, ovaries, anduterus, and sometimes, even more aggressive sur-gery involves removing the peritoneum as well.While surgery removes implants that adhere tothe ovaries, uterus, and other pelvic organs, theeffects of ovary removal and the resulting abruptcessation of hormone production have to betaken into consideration. While benecial forsome individuals, medical or surgical manage-ment is not effective in all circumstances. Physicians have seen an increase in endo- metrioid cancer in endometriosis implants. And87ENDOMETRIOSIS endometriosis can grow into bowels or cause bowel obstruction or stulas. Therefore, ndinga health-care provider who is very experiencedwith endometriosis treatment is very important. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) As with any pain of unknown origin, a licensed primary health-care practitioner should be con-sulted to rule out other causes of pain before extensive use of analgesic medications, botanicalformulas, or supplements. The cultural bias thatmenstrual periods are supposed to be painful\u2014aswell as a reluctance to seek help due to past abuse,trauma, or fear\u2014can be a detriment to healing.Although the norm is changing, in the past manywomen with endometriosis were told that the pain was \"in their head\" or psychosomatic. Anincreased understanding of the pain, pattern ofsymptoms, and loss of quality of life for those whoexperience endometriosis has drawn attention andresearch to this disruptive problem. Abnormal bleeding, pain that increases in intensity, continued pain with or without menses;lower back pain; or pain with urination, bowel movements, and vaginal intercourse should bebrought to the attention of your health-carepractitioner, who will listen to your symptoms,take a medical history, and do a pelvic exam. Thisphysical exam is valuable in determining whetherthere are masses, areas of sensitivity, or abnormalndings suggestive of endometriosis. Dependingon the exam, an ultrasound, MRI, and/or bloodwork may be recommended. In addition,depending on these results, further recommenda-tions may be made (such as a laparoscopy thatcan diagnose and potentially treat the endometri-osis at the same time). If you are reluctant to seek out help due to past trauma or just a feeling of discomfort, it isessential that you nd a health-care practitioneryou can trust. Have a friend (or even therapist)come with you to the ofce and even to theexam room to hold your hand, ask questions,and be there for you. Since the key to preventionof further pain is early diagnosis, prompt med-ical intervention can lead to more effective assis-tance in supporting your body's own ability toheal itself.This page intentionally left blank 89OVERVIEW Virtually all knowledgeable health-care providers agree that the terms brocystic breast disease orbro- cystic breast condition should be abandoned in favor of a more accurate, physiologically based descrip-tion. First of all, the benign breast conditions thatare present in almost all of us to some degree shouldnever have been given the \"disease\" label in the rstplace. 1Moreover, the widespread misconception that women with painful or lumpy breasts are atincreased risk of breast cancer borders on the tragic.Unfortunately, our health-care system requires adiagnostic code to reimburse services, and \"bro-cystic breast disease\" has one, even though the med-ical literature is replete with reasons why itshouldn't. This reinforces misinformation and fearand obscures the safe and simple means that existfor obtaining relief and reassurance. Tender or lumpy breasts are one of the most common reasons why women consult their gyne-cologists for assessment and treatment. Sincepainful breasts are not always lumpy, and lumpybreasts are not always painful (and neither situa-tion is usually abnormal), it is useful to createdescriptive categories of symptoms and condi-tions to replace the generic term brocystic . Physiological, Cyclical Pain and Swelling Many women notice painful or sensitive breasts just prior to menstruation. This has been attributedto a more prominent estrogen than progesteroneeffect on breast tissue at this time. Sometimes lessprogesterone is made late in the cycle, as in irregu-lar ovulation (inadequate luteal phase). Otherwomen may have average amounts of progesteronebut increased tissue sensitivity to estrogen withrelated fluid retention. Most of us tolerate this wellenough once reassured it is normal, and the symp-toms always resolve with menses. Women who takeexogenous estrogen, such as oral contraceptives orestrogen replacement therapy during menopause,may be similarly affected. Mastalgia Mastalgia refers to any breast pain severe enough to interfere with the quality of a woman's life,causing her to seek treatment. Physiological,cyclical mastalgia is this severe about 15 percentof the time and comprises the bulk of this group.Women who suffer from noncyclical pain aremore rare, and the pain is less likely to be hor-monal in cause. Pain may be due to old trauma,acute infection, or sometimes something relatedto the chest wall. In contrast, breast cancer occursas a unilateral painful rm lump only about 5percent of the time. Painful swellings that fluxwith the cycle and do not change over time arenot worrisome as cancer signals. Breast Nodularity or Diffuse Lumpiness Breast lumpiness\u2014the most worrisome category in most women's minds\u2014may be either cyclic ornoncyclic, and might or might not include pain.The distinction between these and normalbreasts is often simply a matter of degree.Normal breasts are irregularly textured becausethe tissue they are made of is not homogeneous.It is a mix of glands, fat, and connective tissue.Glands can be more or less prominent and moreor less obscured by fat or fluid, so all breasts feeldifferent. Symmetry is important; nding amirror-image thickening in the opposite breastindicates a normal condition. 7FIBROCYSTIC BREASTS CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 90WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Nondominant Masses Even densities that are not symmetrical are largely due to benign nonprogressive causes, butthey do require careful distinction from domi-nant masses. When careful palpation around theedges of a nonsymmetrical lump reveals that thedensity merges in one or more places with thesurrounding breast tissue, it is considered non-dominant and may be comfortably observed forchange over time. When these lesions are biop-sied or, preferably, a sample of cells is taken in theofce using a needle to be looked at microscopi-cally (ne-needle aspiration), some 70 percentwill show nonproliferative changes (adenosis,brosis, show proliferative changeswithout atypia\u2014mostly epithelial hyperplasia.None of these conditions places one at increasedrisk for cancer, and all are self-limited. Only afraction, roughly the 5 percent that show atypi-cal hyperplasia, carry a signicantly increased riskof breast cancer (relative risk at 4 percent), espe-cially when coupled with a positive family his-tory (relative risk at 9 percent). 2It was this tiny subgroup that led to the original cancer scareattached to brocystic breasts. The most useful tool a woman can bring to her own breast health is her knowledge of andfamiliarity with the architecture of her ownbreasts, particularly as it varies over time. Noth-ing is more helpful in avoiding an unnecessarybiopsy than a self-knowledgeable woman whohas observed the monthly variation in her ownbreasts and knows which tissue thickens cycli-cally. Think of the self-exam as a familiarizationprocess, not a diagnostic one. The majority ofbreast cancer occurs in women over age 60, andmost women don't get breast cancer at all. We allhave plenty of time to learn our textures so thatour own hands are the most sensitive to anychanges that may occur. This will occur effort-lessly over time with regular self-exams.Dominant Masses These outright noncyclical unilateral lesions are clearly distinct on all sides from the surroundingbreast tissue. They persist over time, and exceptin the very young demand some kind of assess-ment. Most commonly they are either broade-nomas or gross (obvious) cysts. A broadenomais a rubbery, smooth, benign brous tumorcommon in younger women. In women underage 25, it can be observed over time. Fibroadeno-mas generally do not grow bigger. Large cysts aremore common in women aged 25 to 50\u2014an agegroup when cancer just begins to appear. Theyare softer, usually squishier, and can be made todisappear by draining them through a needle inthe ofce; unless they recur frequently, no furthertreatment is necessary. Recurrent large cysts havebeen shown to slightly increase cancer risk insome studies but not in others; 3, 4broadenomas do not. Unfortunately, noncyclical unilateraldominant masses can sometimes be cancerous. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Women with brocystic tissue causing breast pain, discomfort, and lumpiness will nd comfort in analternative perspective on their situation. Giventhat this condition is not really a disease, a womancan direct her energies toward relieving symptomsand optimizing breast health, as well as increasingher motivation toward general health practicesand self-care. KEY CONCEPTS Practice monthly breast self-exams; know your breasts; be able to detect new and unusual changes, thickenings, and lumps. Have a yearly breast exam by a licensed physician. Relieve symptoms of pain and tenderness. Have changes, if any, evaluated by a physician.91FIBROCYSTIC BREASTS The liver is the primary site for estrogen clear- ance or estrogen metabolism. Compromised liverfunction can lead to a state of estrogen domi-nance, contributing to texture and density changesin the breast. To assure that estrogens are beingmetabolized properly, it may be necessary to pro-vide nutritional and herbal support for the liver. Digestion and elimination are fundamental fac- tors involved in hormone-related health problems.Women having fewer than three bowel movementsper week have a risk of brocystic breasts four tove times greater than women having at least onemovement per day. 5The longer it takes food to move through the colon, the more waste productspass into the bloodstream, creating a potentiallytoxic physiological environment. Bacterial flora inthe large intestine, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus , improve the transit time of bowel toxins, as well asimproving the excretion and detoxication of estro-gens. Women on a vegetarian diet excrete two tothree times more detoxied estrogens than womenon an omnivorous diet. Nutrition Epidemiological evidence supports a diet rich in whole fruits and vegetables in the prevention ofbrocystic breast conditions. A recent studydemonstrated that a reduced risk of proliferativeand atypical breast lesions was associated withconsumption of fresh fruits and vegetables,whereas a small but signicant reduction of riskwas associated with soy consumption, possibly bydecreasing cellular proliferation in the breasttissue. 6Another study examined the effect soy consumption has on breast tissue via direct imag-ing using breast enhanced scintigraphy (a nuclearmedicine diagnostic imaging test). After one yearof daily soy consumption, the researchers reporteda number of promising subjective and objectiveresults: patients and their physicians reported areduction in both breast tenderness and brocys-tic changes; a small but statistically nonsignicantdecrease in both the average and maximal countbreast activity on scintigraphy; and a signicant reduction in the variability of tissue activity. 7 Maybe somewhat surprisingly, another studyshowed a decrease in benign breast changes withalcohol consumption. 8Since alcohol slows down the metabolism of estrogen, it is not clear why thisstudy demonstrated these results. Avoid Methylxanthines (Caffeine). Removal of caffeine from the diet, an idea that originatedwith Ohio surgeon Dr. John Minton, is probablythe most well-known alternative treatment forbrocystic breasts. Of the 20 uncomfortablewomen who followed his advice to stop all caffeineintake, 13 said their breasts felt better as a result. 9 Dr. Virginia Ernster conducted the rst ran- domized study of a larger number of women, inwhich for four months 158 women eliminatedcaffeine (coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate) fromtheir diets as well as caffeinated medications(theophylline and theobromine). She found asignicant reduction in clinically palpable breastndings in the abstaining group compared withthe control group, although the absolute changein the breast lumps was quite minor and consid-ered to be of little clinical signicance. 10 Several other studies have been done, leaving us with mixed reports: three studies show noassociation between caffeine or other methylxan-thines and benign breast disease, 11-13 and two studies show a correlation with caffeine con-sumption. 14, 15 Such is the way of science.PREVENTION Avoid caffeine (black tea, coffee, decaffeinated coffee, cola, chocolate, and medications with caffeine). Even decaffeinated coffee has othermethylxanthines, caffeine-like chemical compounds. Assure regular, daily bowel movements. Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, soy foods, and whole grains. Decrease dietary fats, especially saturated fats.92WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE In clinical practice, I always recommend avoiding caffeine for women with painful/lumpybreasts. Many women gain mild to dramaticresults with this simple approach, and somewomen receive no benet. A fair experimentwould be to completely abstain for three monthsand observe any changes in the pain, swelling,and discomfort. A decrease in the nodularity willgenerally take longer, as long as eight months ofcomplete abstention. Dietary Fat. How dietary fat affects the human breast is still controversial, although someresearch has looked at low-fat diets in womenwith brocystic breasts and at how low-fat dietsaffect the hormone levels in these women.Reducing the fat content of the diet to 16 per-cent of total calories (in contrast to the averageAmerican diet of 40 percent fat), while increasingcomplex carbohydrate consumption, has beenshown to reduce the severity of premenstrualbreast tenderness and swelling, as well as reduc-ing the actual breast swelling and nodularity in some women. 16Reducing the dietary fat intake to 20 percent of total calories results in signi-cant decreases in circulating estrogens in womenwith benign breast disease. 17 Since brocystic breasts are a result of estro- gen dominance, it is logical that decreasing estro-gen in the body or its influence on breast tissuewould improve the symptoms of breast pain andswelling. However, a slight reduction in fatintake has repeatedly showed very little, if any,effect on breast problems, including breastcancer. A more rigorous approach to lowering theamount of fat in the diet is clearly needed. The simplest way to accomplish the necessary levels of fat reduction is to avoid animal fats in allforms; a vegan diet (vegetarian, without anyanimal products at all, including dairy or eggs) isnaturally a very low-fat diet. Of course, vegetari-ans, and even strict vegans, can succumb to fat inother forms like french fries, potato chips, andother greasy fried foods. A vegan diet rich in wholegrains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts,olives, and seaweed that is enriched with oils forstir-frying and in salad dressings results in a dietthat derives about 15 to 20 percent of its caloriesfrom fat. Nutritional Supplements Vitamin E. For more than 35 years, clinicians have used vitamin E in the medical managementof benign breast disease. This practice was initiallybased on positive reports from small numbers ofpatients as far back as 1965 and from subsequentstudies in 1971, 1978, and 1982. 18-21When largerCaffeine Content of Common Items Beverage Caffeine (mg) Coffee, drip (8 oz) 150 Coffee, perk (8 oz) 60-120Coffee, instant (8 oz) 70Coffee, decaffeinated (8 oz) 2-5 Tea, black, 5-minute steep (8 oz) 60-100 Tea, green (8 oz) 20Hot cocoa (5 oz) 2-10 Coca-Cola (12 oz) 34 Food Caffeine (mg) Milk chocolate (1 oz) 1-15 Bittersweet chocolate (1 oz) 5-35Chocolate cake (1 slice) 20-30 Over-the-Counter Drugs Caffeine (mg) Anacin, or Midol 130NoDoz (2) 200 Aqua-Ban (2) 200 Dexatrim (1) 200Dietary Recommendations Avoid caffeine.

Increase soy foods.93FIBROCYSTIC BREASTS numbers of women were studied, vitamin E did not fare so well, showing no signicant effectseither subjectively or objectively, 22, 23 and the ear- lier results have never been duplicated. However, this is not to say that some women don't nd symptom relief from taking vitamin E.T wo studies demonstrated that vitamin E is clin-ically useful in relieving pain and tenderness,whether cyclical or noncyclical. 21, 24 The studies have been done with varying dosages: 150, 300,or 600 IU daily. In clinical practice, practitioners generally recommend from 400 to 800 IU of D-alpha tocopherol with a minimum trial period oftwo months. Since vitamin E in these dosages iscompletely safe to use, this is a simple and appro-priate self-treatment method for a benign breastcondition. Vitamin E (Natural) 400-800 IU daily Omega-6 Fatty Acids. The pain and tender- ness of benign breast disease associated with cyclicmastalgia have been alleviated with evening prim-rose ( Oenothera biennis ) oil, the only one of the many essential fatty acids to be scientically stud-ied in relation to brocystic breasts. The evening primrose plant has been com- monly known as tree primrose and sun drop.Evening primrose can be found in many parts of North American and is native in the NorthTemperate Zone, especially at high altitudes. Thenative peoples of North America, as well as theEnglish and Pilgrims, were well aware of the heal-ing properties of the leaves and bark as an astrin-gent, nervine (an herb that affects the nerves andincludes relaxants, tonics, and even stimulants),and sedative. It was often used for stomach andliver complaints, coughs, and female reproductiveproblems. Even the roots were eaten as a veg-etable. The seeds were recommended as a coffeesubstitute in wartime and have a strong flavorsimilar to poppy seed oil. The therapeutic value ofthe seed oil is a more recent discovery. It is thisseed oil and its essential fatty acid content that holds the most interest today in maintaininghealth and preventing disease. Evening primrose oil is rich in essential fatty acids\u2014polyunsaturated fats that are as essentialas vitamins and minerals for the maintenance ofgood health. The oil contains 74 percent linoleicacid (LA) and 9 percent gamma linolenic acid(GLA). Although other oils such as borage oiland black currant oil contain higher amounts ofGLA, evening primrose oil is by far the mostpopular and familiar source of this fatty acid.Evening primrose oil also contains 11 percentoleic acid, 6 percent palmitic acid, and 2 percentstearic acid. Under ideal conditions, the body uses LA to produce GLA. In turn, GLA is used to producebenecial hormone-like compounds pro-staglandins. Specically, prostaglandins such as prostaglandinE1 (PGE1). Prostaglandins affect the function of virtually every system in the body. These molecules areused in the regulation of inflammation, pain,blood pressure, fluid balance, and blood clotting.Prostaglandins also affect hormone productionand function. The key to understanding the important need for supplementing with oils rich in GLA,such as evening primrose oil, is that many of uscannot convert LA to GLA efciently. Dietarydeciencies, disease conditions, processed oils,trans-fatty acids, heated oils, alcohol, aging, viralinfections, and sugar consumption block, slowdown, or interfere with the enzyme that catalyzesthe conversion of LA to GLA. The result is thatvirtually all North Americans are decient inGLA. Supplementing with evening primrose oilcan enrich prostaglandins supplementation withevening primrose and conditions. Benets for94WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE health problems supported and/or suggested by scientic trials using evening primrose oil includepremenstrual syndrome, brocystic breast pain,eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, heart dis-ease, osteoporosis, and ulcerative colitis. Otherconditions for which it may provide benetinclude menopause and pregnancy. The pain and tenderness of benign breast dis- ease associated with premenstrual breast pain andbrocystic breasts has been alleviated withevening primrose oil in more than one scienticstudy. In 1985, when 291 women took threegrams per day of evening primrose oil for three tosix months, almost half of the 92 women withcyclic breast pain experienced improvement com-pared with one-fth of the patients who receivedthe placebo. For those women who experiencedbreast pain throughout the month, 27 percent(just over one-fourth of the 33 women) respondedpositively to the evening primrose oil, comparedto 9 percent on the placebo. 25Another 73 women with breast pain with or without lumpiness ran-domly received three grams per day of eveningprimrose oil or placebo. After three months, pain and tenderness were signicantly reduced inboth cyclical and noncyclical groups, while thewomen who took the placebo did not signicantlyimprove. 26In the course of treatment, it has been detected that women with breast pain have unusu-ally low concentrations of GLA and metabolitesfrom GLA. When patients receive supplements ofevening primrose oil, the concentration of GLAmetabolites increases and the concentration of sat-urated fats in the breast decreases. This may alsohave long-term implications for prevention ofbreast diseases such as breast cancer. Although symptom relief can be achieved through the use of evening primrose oil, it shouldnot be relied on to actually reduce the number ofdeveloping cysts. Other omega-6 fatty acids that may have ben- ecial effects but have not been studied in relationto brocystic breasts are flaxseed oil, black currantoil, and borage oil. Borage oil and black currantoil contain higher amounts of GLA, so poten- tially, one could take fewer capsules to achieve thesame benet. For example, borage oil contains 23percent GLA versus only 9 percent in the eveningprimrose oil. That would mean instead of the 6capules of evening primrose oil it would take toachieve the 3,000 mg of evening primrose oil thatwas used in the study, you could conceivably useat half as many capsules of borage oil. Evening Primrose Oil (Omega-6 Fatty Acids) 1,500 mg twice daily Vitamin A. Basic science research supports the use of vitamin A by demonstrating the pres-ence of specic retinoid receptors in breast tissuethat can modulate our genetic predisposition,thereby decreasing the risk for both benign andmalignant breast changes. 27 In a study of patients with brocystic breast disease, 12 women were treated with 150,000 IUof vitamin A daily for three months, and 5 of the9 women who completed the study showed com-plete or partial response. 28Some of the patients experienced mild side effects of vitamin A toxic-ity, including dryness of the skin and mouth. Although the potential toxicity of vitamin A in doses this high makes it an impractical approach tobrocystic breast disease, it is possible that beta-carotene could be substituted, since it has a similaractivity without the side effects of vitamin A, or adiet high in yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. Beta-Carotene 50,000-150,000 IU daily Iodine/Thyroid Hormone. It has been known for a long time that for the thyroid glandto secrete thyroxine (its hormone), it requiresiodine. Prescription thyroid hormone replacementwith low or even normal thyroid function mayresult in improvement of brocystic breasts. 29, 30 These results suggest that iodine deciency may bea causative factor in brocystic breasts.95FIBROCYSTIC BREASTS Although the exact mechanisms of action on breast tissue are not known, the breast has anafnity for both thyroid hormone and iodine.The only areas of the breast in which iodine canbe found are in the terminal and interlobularduct cells, which are also the areas primarilyinvolved in cystic changes. Without iodine, thebreast tissue becomes more sensitive to estrogenicstimulation, which in turn produces microcystshigh in potassium. The potassium is believed tobe an irritant that produces brosis and eventu-ally cyst isolation. Four types of iodine have been studied in the treatment of brocystic breasts, only one ofwhich has been truly effective and free of sideeffects on the thyroid gland. According toresearch by Dr. William Ghent, although allforms of iodine relieve subjective clinical symp-toms, the brocystic breast reacts differently tothese different iodide, caseinatediodine (protein-bound), and aqueous Symptom relief varied a deal withthe different iodines, but only the aqueous ordiatomic iodine achieved both symptom relief in74 percent of the women and also objectivereduction in nodules and resolution of brosis in65 percent of the patients, without adverseeffects on the thyroid gland. 31 Women get different amounts of iodine in their diet, depending on the iodine content ofthe soil and water, as well as the types of foodthey prefer to eat. Plant foods grown in the so-called goiter belt areas of the country (the GreatLakes region, the Midwest, and the Intermoun-tain states) lack iodine because the soil and waterare iodine decient. Today, iodine deciency isconsidered rare in the United States due to thewidespread distribution of foods from areas ofthe country sufcient in iodine and due to theavailability of iodized salt. Certain foods, such asseafood and seaweeds, are naturally high iniodine and might be used to supplement a dietlow in iodine.Aqueous Iodine 3-6 mg daily (prescription item) Additional Supplements B-complex: 10 times the recommended daily dietary allowance Methionine: 1 g per day Choline: 1 g per day Lactobacillus acidophilus :1 tsp 3 times per day Flaxseed oil: 1 tbs per day Botanicals Herbal therapies for addressing the symptoms of breast pain, swelling, and cystic nodules in thebreast are largely arrived at from traditional usesof herbal medicines and from observational expe-rience in clinical practice. Herbal diuretics areuseful in decreasing breast swelling and the dis-comfort associated with it. The most effective ofthese is dandelion ( deplete potassium; instead, it actually con-tains a high percentage of potassium. However,since potassium is possibly implicated in brosisand potential cyst isolation, dandelion may notbe the ideal diuretic cana), an herb used in traditional naturopathic medical practices, can be applied as an oil to thebreasts and rubbed in like a lotion, reducingpainful lumpiness and nodularity. Herbal support for the liver improves how the liver metabolizes hormones. In this case, ourgoal is to encourage the normal pathways for themetabolism, excretion, and recirculation of beet root.96WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Additional Natural Therapies Natural Progesterone. Once we agree that brocystic breasts are, at least in part, due to ahigh-estrogen/low-progesterone problem, then it is logical to use progesterone therapy as a treatment. Specically, many practitioners andwomen patients have experienced that the appli-cation of natural progesterone in a cream or gelform routinely resolves the problem. Dr. JohnLee, the leader in the use of natural progesterone,states that he cannot recall a single case in hisown practice in which the results were not posi-tive. 32Lee suggests using the natural proges- terone cream or gel as prescribed by a health-carepractitioner until the cysts are gone and thenreducing the dose to the smallest amount that isstill effective, to be continued monthly as neededthrough menopause.I cannot conrm the effectiveness or safety of this practice, and the research is not yet clear onthe safety of long-term natural progesterone andbreast health. There is more information aboutthis in Chapter 12. Natural Progesterone Cream 14-12tsp applied to breasts and palms twice a day from ovulation to menses CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Conventional medical literature has tended to focus more on pathologic descriptions of diseaseand on verifying or disproving related cancer riskrather than on exploring therapeutic options forsymptom relief. In spite of conflicting data in the1980s, many women added vitamin E and elim-inated coffee from their diets with noticeablesubjective improvement and no side effects otherthan those imparted by caffeine withdrawal.Low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diets canreduce cyclical pain, and the results of studieswith evening primrose oil have been mixed. Cyclic breast pain and swelling are felt to be hormonal, so treatment is aimed at hormonalmanipulation, usually by suppression. More oftenthan not, oral contraceptives help to relieve mildor severe premenstrual pain, although for smallernumbers of women the pain is worsened by thistreatment. This paradox is explained by the factthat oral contraceptives suppress ovarian produc-tion of hormones and replace this with an averagesynthetic dose of both estrogens and progesterone.If the replacement level is higher than the naturalone, sore breasts may result; usually, the replacedlevel is lower, and then the pain is relieved. Con-tinuous oral contraceptives (no placebo break)seem to help better than cyclic regimens. Many so-called effective conventional treat- ments cause such serious side effects that it is hardto imagine any cases that would warrant their use.Danazol, which LH 14-1 tsp per day Phytolacca oil: apply to breasts nightly for 2 weeks, then reduce to 3 times per week Sample Treatment Plan for Fibrocystic Breasts Three-Month Period Avoid caffeine and other sources of methylxanthines.

Vitamin E: 400 IU twice per day Evening primrose oil: 1,500 mg twice per day If there is no change after three menstrual cycles, then incorporate a more assertive approach utilizing some of the other therapies listed, or see a naturo- pathic physician for indiv idualized recommendations and, especially, prescription aqueous iodine.97FIBROCYSTIC BREASTS from the pituitary gland, was once touted as the most effective breast pain reliever. However, it is amale hormone and can cause facial hair, voicedeepening, and other androgenic changes, quiteunacceptable side effects for most women, and itcan cost more than $200 per month. It is nolonger used to treat brocystic breasts. Similarly, GnRH agonists work at the hypo- thalamic level to eradicate estrogen via a tem-porarily induced menopausal condition. Thisclass of drugs may make danazol obsolete, butthey again do not present a good long-term solu-tion due to the side effects, including reversiblebone loss, and they cost even more money. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, has been used to treat breast cancer and can help cyclic breastpain, up to a 90 percent reduction in pain. How-ever, it causes menopausal side effects, its long-term effects are unknown, and it increases theincidence of endometrial cancer. On the otherhand, it has been shown to reduce breast cancerrisk in women who are at higher risk, includingthose women who have atypical hyperplasia ofthe breast, which is determined only by a biopsy.For benign breast disease, it is difcult to imag-ine a situation where the benets of tamoxifenwould outweigh the risks and side effects. Bromocriptine is a nonhormonal drug ther- apy that lessens the levels of prolactin, the hor-mone that manages lactation changes, and seemsto work well, although it is often not toleratedbecause of nausea or dizziness.The side effects of most of the expensive drugs used to eliminate breast pain and lumpi-ness are probably too extreme to warrant theiruse for most women until the simpler remedieshave proven inadequate. If elimination of caf-feine, adding vitamin E, and switching to a low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diet do not bringresults, the next logical step for a conventionalpractitioner would most likely be a trial of oralcontraceptives. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) A woman might decide to see a licensed health- care practitioner because she needs a breast examor wants to determine the exact nature of herbreast pain/tenderness or lumps. The practi-tioner will ask about her symptoms as well asother pertinent factors in her medical history andwill perform a physical examination. If the practitioner considers it necessary, she or he might recommend a mammogram and/orultrasound to determine the nature of a speciclump and may encourage aspiration of a mass todetermine whether it is cystic or solid. The prac-titioner will no doubt recommend that highlysuspicious lumps be surgically biopsied. A lump that is new or one that is increasing in size, or a lump that does not change over the courseof the menstrual cycle, are all causes for concernand might lead to a professional evaluation.This page intentionally left blank 99OVERVIEW Genital herpes is the most prevalent sexually trans- mitted infection (STI) in the United States.1-3 Data about the prevalence of genital herpes in theUnited States has been collected from theNational Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-veys between 1976 and 1980 (NHANES II) andfrom 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III). According toNHANES III, 45 million Americans over the ageof 12 are infected with Herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2 or genital herpes). The prevalence increased 30 per-cent between 1988 and 1994, with the greatestincrease among teenagers, and quintupled amongwhite teenagers and doubled among whites intheir twenties. Some 25.6 percent of women and17.8 percent of men test positive for the virus intheir blood, and blacks have a higher prevalence(45.9 percent) than do whites (17.6 percent). 4 Testing positive in the blood is different thanhaving a genital herpes eruption history. In fact,only 10 to 20 percent of seropositive individualshave had a genital herpes lesion, showing us thatthe majority of cases are subclinical or undetected. There are six members of the herpesvirus family that are known to infect humans: HSVtype 1 (HSV-1) and HSV type virus, and herpesvirus type 6.Today, HSV-2 is the leading cause of genitalulcer disease in the United States. As many as onein ve Americans is believed to be infected withHSV-2\u2014the virus type more closely associatedwith genital herpes. Another virus type, HSV-1\u2014the type more closely associated with infectionsof the mouth, lips, pharynx, and eyes earlier inlife through oral/genital contact\u2014is believed tobe responsible for 10 to 50 percent of new casesof genital herpes. 5About 80 percent of peoplewith their rst episodes of genital herpes are 18to 36 years of age. The highest annual incidenceof genital herpes among women occurs at 20 to24 years of age and is estimated to be 210 per100,000 women. The diagnosis of typical genital herpes is fairly straightforward most of the time butinvolves local and systemic signs. There are threedistinct syndromes: rst-episodenonprimary atypical manifestations, and theseare the ones that are not so straightforward. The severity of symptoms varies in extent and duration according to whether the episode is the patient's rst infection with either HSV-2 orHSV-1, called primary herpes; initial genital infec-tion in a woman who has already had an infectionwith the other HSV type (initial, or rst-episodenonprimary herpes); or a recurrence of a genitalinfection with either type. A woman's rst episodeof genital herpes (primary herpes) is usually themost severe form of the disease. Symptoms usuallystart appearing within a week after infection, ifthey are going to appear at all. However, symp-toms can start one day and up to 26 days afterexposure to the virus. Typically, infection is char-acterized by extensive, multiple clusters of painfullesions involving the genitals, anus, perineum, orsurrounding areas. Symptoms and lesions of pri-mary genital herpes vary in severity, extent, andduration. Initial symptomatic episodes of HSVnot only tend to be more severe but are followedwithin the rst year of a greater likelihood of clin-ical recurrences as well as shedding of the viruswithout any symptoms (also known as subclinicalshedding, when the outer layer of the skin or tissueharbors the virus without symptoms and thensheds, transmitting the virus). These subsequent8GENITAL HERPES CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infect the skin and/or mucosal tissue of the genital area and themouth, and once this occurs, the virus infects thesensory and autonomic nerves and then ascendsto the nerve ganglia in the spinal cord where itestablishes a lifelong home where it can be peri-odically reactivated. With this episodic reactiva-tion, the virus migrates from the ganglia alongthe sensory nerves to the target site, which resultsin either an actual outbreak or a shedding with-out an outbreak or with atypical symptoms,called subclinical shedding. 1, 3In fact, the major- ity of primary infections with HSV-1 and HSV-2are subclinical. This presents a great difculty insexual transmission, because the virus can betransmitted to another, even when you do notknow you are infected or have ever been infected.Men are more likely to have asymptomatic HSV-2infections than women. 6 The classic herpes lesion begins as a red papule, evolving within two to three days to avesicle containing clear fluid, and then progress-ing to a pustule. When the surface breaks open,a tender ulceration occurs that may explain thesymptomatic burning pain. Lesions ulceratemore rapidly in moist areas than on dry skin, sothat painful genital ulcerations are more apt tooccur on the external vulva area. Several succes-sive lesions may appear in the rst three to fourweeks of primary herpes. The lesions of primaryherpes may heal in one to six weeks. In more than two-thirds of women, primary herpes is accompanied by systemic symptomsthat may include fever, malaise, body aches,headaches, and nausea. Meningitis-like symp-toms, such as stiffness of the neck and sensitivityto light, are also common. Nearly three-quartersof women will also suffer from herpetic cervicitis,with vaginal discharge and intermenstrual spot-ting. Swollen lymph nodes in the groin area are also common. Discomfort with urination is alsocommon, sometimes as a result of herpes in theurethra and in other cases because the urinecomes into contact with lesions on the labia. Diagnosis A practitioner can best make a diagnosis of herpes based on the medical history, inspectionof the area, and a laboratory test to provide con-rmation. The focus of the history is the onsetand clinical course of the genital lesions. Eventhough very personal, it is important that thepractitioner know the following details of thewoman's sexual history: 1. Pregnancy history 2. Currently sexually active or not3. Sexually active with men, women, or both4. If birth control is used, what kind5. Knowledge about partner or partners' sexual history 6. Condom use for protection from sexually transmitted infections 7. Types of sexual activity: oral sex with part- ner, mutual oral sex, penile/vaginal sex,penile/anal sex The practitioner also needs to know whether the lesions started as blisters or pimples and whetheror not they were painful. Knowledge about anysystemic symptoms of both partners is importantas well. The physical examination involves inspecting the lesions, examining the genital area thor-oughly, including the anal area and the inguinallymph nodes (those in the groin). Inspecting thevaginal area with a speculum requires carefulexam of the vaginal wall and the cervix. If sys-temic symptoms such as fever, headache, or neu-rologia symptoms are present, a more thoroughneurological examination needs to be performed. The information gleaned from a good history and physical help to distinguish a genital HSVinfection from other possible problems, dermatitis, a heat rash, a rash from shaving thepubic area, a drug reaction, or a secondary infec-tion from something like scabies. Laboratory testing to conrm the diagnosis is indicated for most people who are having theirinitial genital eruption, even in women with atypical clinical symptom picture. Some lesionsare classic in appearance, and perhaps a clinicianwill make a judgment that a laboratory test is notnecessary. However, viral cultures are the mostsensitive test for conrming the diagnosis of gen-ital herpes. Determining the virus type has valuefor future considerations. For example, individu-als with genital HSV-1 (as many as 30 percent ofwomen with primary herpes) have a much lowerrisk of symptomatic recurring outbreaks. In addi-tion, women with primary genital herpes are atincreased risk for other STIs and should possiblybe for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, andHIV infection. The 2002 STD guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) state that isolation of HSV in a cell culture and then immuno-fluorescent staining can differentiate HSV-1from HSV-2 and is the preferred viral test inwomen who have an active genital lesion. Thereare a few problems with these tests: transportinga cell culture can be difcult, the sensitivity ofthe tests declines as lesions heal, and the test is farmore accurate for initial episodes than for recur-ring lesions. If the cell culture is used, then test-ing the blood is used to conrm the results. 1-3 Other testing methods include direct immuno- antibody (DFA) test, direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent tests. the DFA antigen testcan distinguish HSV-1 infection from HSV-2.The most genital infectiondetection are type-specic serologic assays for theHSV antibodies. The most serious and feared complication of genital herpes is the transmission from an infectedpregnant mother to her newborn child. Consulta- tion with a health-care practitioner during thepregnancy is advisable both in women with recur-rent genital herpes and in women who mayuncommonly acquire their primary infectionduring pregnancy. Viral cultures late in the preg-nancy may be advised, and consultations about adelivery by cesarean section may be justied.Other complications for the infant include menin- KEY CONCEPTS Genital herpes is most commonly associated with HSV-2. Risk factors for HSV-2: female, African-American, Mexican-American, older, low education level, poverty, cocaine use, a history of two to four or more lifetime sexual partners, unprotected sex,having a sexual partner with genital herpes,living in the southeastern United States (higher rate of seropositive indiv iduals). The majority of primary genital herpes infections are asymptomatic or unnoticed. All HSV infections establish latency and are con- sidered incurable. The present infection mayactually be a recurrence of an asymptomatic infection acquired some time in the past. Systemic symptoms are more common with pri- mary infections, and symptoms are generally more severe in women than in men. Seek the advice of a health-care practitioner in diagnosing an initial genital lesion; differentiateherpes from other causes of genital ulceration. Recurring eruptions are common and are gener- ally less severe than initial episodes. Treating acute episodes can reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of the eruption. Immune supportive therapy and antiviral therapy can reduce the frequency of recurrences and can reduce symptoms in acute episodes. The individual with herpes, the sexual partner, and the health-care practitioner all need to real- ize that genital herpes is a sensitive issue. Open communication, trust, and respect are essentialfor an informative dialogue and effective man- agement of genital herpes.102WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE gitis, urinary or rectal dysfunction, infection in the eye, and erythema multiforme (a skin disease). The impact of genital herpes on a person's psychological and sexual health can be quite intru-sive and profound. Many people withdraw frominterpersonal relationships because of stress relatedto their infection or because of fear of spreadingthe disease to others. Disruption of one's sexual life can also manifest as signicantly reduced sexualpleasure and a strong sense of sexual inhibition.Many people also worry that they will be rejectedby future partners and are pessimistic about thepossibility of establishing normal sexual relation-ships. Since many people become emotionallyupset upon learning of the diagnosis, a health-careprovider can be extremely valuable in helping todeal with anger, guilt, or anxiety. Education andcounseling include information about the natureof HSV infection, most importantly prevention of its transmission. It is important that patientsalso understand that the primary infection mayhave been asymptomatic and that even an initialoutbreak may be a reactivation of an infectionacquired months or even years previously. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS A susceptible host plus exposure to the herpes simplex virus add up to acquiring the disease.Improving the health of the host and enhance-ment of the immune system is essential in pre-venting and controlling herpes. There is someevidence that a defect in the immune system ispresent even in otherwise healthy individualswho have recurrent HSV infection. Support ofthe immune system, dietary factors, stressors,skin health, and preventing and treating othernon-herpes infections are all avenues for usingnatural therapies in reducing the likelihood ofcontracting herpes and in reducing the frequencyand intensity of recurrent herpes infections. Nutrition A health-supportive diet is fundamental to good health and an optimal immune system. Althoughbiochemical differences may require that some ofus eat more of some foods and less of others,health-supportive diets are based on the guide-lines listed below. A dietary approach for preventing recurring herpes outbreaks that reduces high-arginine foodsPREVENTION Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. Education about recognizing the disease and its prodromal symptoms of itching, numbness, andtingling and protection during sexual contact or abstaining during outbreaks are important in preventing transmission. The virus can shed; thus, transmission of the disease to another indiv idual is possible even without symptoms. The use of barrier methods is recommended for any person who has evidenceof prior infection with HSV-2. The safest method of protecting yourself and a sexual partner is to use some sort of barriermethod to prevent contact. The use of male con- doms, female condoms, dental dams, or house- hold plastic wrap are all recommended options. Informing one's sexual partner of a history of herpes is the responsible thing to do. Before having sexual contact with a new partner, askquestions about his or her past sexual history,history of sexually transmitted infections, and past habits and lifestyle that may have exposed the partner to the virus and other sexuallytransmitted infections. A willingness to practice \"safer sex\" techniques is an important health issue to discuss with asexual partner. One should understand that HSV infection can be spread by oral-genital contact as well as genital-genital sexual contact. Transmission from one body site to another is possible, and infected areas should be patted, rather than wiped, dry. Be especially careful about transmitting the infection from anotherpart of the body to the eye. Enhance the immune system. Some individuals may need to consider prophy- lactic suppressive antiviral medication.103GENITAL HERPES and increases high-lysine foods has become quite popular. This concept arose out of two ndings.First, we know that the replication of the herpessimplex virus requires the manufacture of proteinsrich in arginine, and arginine itself may be a stim-ulator of HSV replication. Second, laboratoryresearch has shown that lysine has antiviral that an arginine-decient environment suppresses HSV replication.8 Thus, theoretically, reducing one's intake of arginine and increasing one's intake of lysineshould be effective in reducing HSV replication.In fact, many people do observe an increased susceptibility to outbreaks if they eat chocolate or peanuts, foods that are high in arginine. Otherhigh-arginine foods include almonds, cashews,and sunflower seeds. Foods high in lysine includemost vegetables, beans, sh, turkey, and chicken. Nutritional Supplements L-Lysine. Scientic studies on the effective- ness of lysine supplementation have not shownconsistent results, and a least one study citesdietary variability of lysine and arginine intake asa possible confounding factor that is often dif-cult to control and is not often assessed in stud-ies. 9One study that did show positive results was done in 52 patients with recurrent infections(oral, genital, or both). Test subjects received L-lysine (one gram three times daily) or a placebo.They also avoided nuts, chocolate, and gelatin.After six months, the treatment was rated as effec- tive or very effective by 74 percent of those receiv-ing the lysine, compared to 28 percent of thosereceiving placebo. The mean number of herpesoutbreaks was 3.1 in the lysine group comparedto 4.2 in the placebo group, and lysine-treatedpatients reported milder symptoms. No signi-cant side effects were reported in either group. 10 Another experimental study was done with 41patients who took a daily dose of 1,248 mg oflysine. This demonstrated a decreased recurrencerate and a decreased severity of symptoms duringrecurrences, but not a reduced healing time. 11 For people who want to rely on lysine supple- mentation alone, my recommendation is to takeone gram daily for maintenance and one gramthree times daily during acute outbreaks. Lysinecan also be found in topical ointments to beapplied directly to herpes eruptions. These may behelpful in reducing symptoms but have not beenadequately studied to prove their effectiveness. Lysine Acute: 1 g 3 times daily Maintenance: 1 g daily Vitamin C and Bioflavonoids. Supplementa- tion with vitamin C may have therapeutic value inthe treatment of recurrent external genital herpeseruptions. Using 600 mg of vitamin C and 600mg of bioflavonoids three times daily for threedays after the initial onset of symptoms (in theprodromal phase) was found to be the optimaldosage for the most rapid disappearance of symp-toms. 12In addition, in vitro evidence supports the use of ascorbate in combination with copper toinactivate HSV-2. 13In women with active lesions, a randomized double-bind, placebo-controlledclinical trial was done on the topical use of awater-based solution of Ascoxal, an ascorbicacid-containing formulation, in the treatment ofrecurrent mucocutaneous herpes. A solution-soaked cotton pad was applied to the lesion threetimes for two minutes with 30-minute intervalsDietary Recommendations Maximize your intake of vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fruit. Drink 4 to 8 glasses of water daily. Reduce fat intake. Eliminate rened sugar and chocolate. Avoid food additives, coloring agents, pesti- cides, and herbicides. Reduce salt and alcohol intake. Reduce or avoid almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, and peanuts.104WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE on the rst day only. Both subjective and objective accounts demonstrated decreased symptoms andhealing time. In addition, viral culture after therst day yielded HSV signicantly less frequentlywhen compared to placebo. 14 Vitamin C and Bioflavonoids Prodromal period: 600 mg vitamin C with 600 mg bioflavonoids 3 times daily for 3 days Vitamin E. Applying topical vitamin E to a lesion may provide pain relief.15Although clinical observations have been made of only four pub-lished cases (in oral primary herpes, not genital), itwould seem logical that vitamin E applied to gen-ital eruptions may provide a similar benet. Drythe area around the lesion with warm air andapply vitamin E oil with a cotton swab. Leave inplace for 15 minutes. After the 15 minutes, painrelief should be evident. Repeat as needed. Further evidence for the use of vitamin E was found in an animal study that employed a patentedcombination antioxidant cream including vitaminE, sodium pyruvate, and membrane-stabilizingfatty acids. It demonstrated that the ingredientsworked synergistically to reduce genital HSVlesion development, duration, and severity signi-cantly when compared to placebo or acyclovir. 16 Vitamin E Apply vitamin E oil to dry area around lesion; leave in place for 15 minutes. Repeat as needed. Zinc. A number of zinc salts have been shown to have antiviral activity against HSV. Invitro 17and animal studies have supported use of zinc topically with genital infection.18-20 Supple- mentation with zinc has been observed to reducethe frequency, duration, and severity of genitalherpes eruptions. A compound of zinc (25 mg)and vitamin C (250 mg) was given twice daily forsix weeks. In some cases, the eruption was com-pletely suppressed, and in others the eruptionsdisappeared within 24 hours of their onset. 21Zinc and Vitamin C 25 mg zinc with 250 mg vitamin C twice daily for 6 weeks Botanicals Lemon Balm ( Melissa Ofcinalis ).Lemon balm ointments have been used topically in Ger-many for oral cold sores, and products are nowavailable in the United States. Laboratory evi-dence demonstrates the anti-HSV-2 activity ofMelissa at nontoxic concentrations in vitro. 22, 23 The German cream Lomaherpan is a concentrate of 70:1 lemon balm extract. Several clinical stud-ies have shown impressive results. One studydemonstrated that when the lemon balm creamwas used on patients with an initial oral herpesinfection, or cold sore, not a single recurrenceoccurred. Not one patient using the cream devel-oped another cold sore. The cream was alsoshown to be effective in reducing the healingtime in cases of genital herpes. 24 Another study, a double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized trial, used a standardizedtopical cream (active ingredient: 1 percent Lo-701\u2014dried extract from Melissa ofcinalis L . leaves) in 66 patients with a history of recurrentherpes labialis of at least four episodes per year.With applications four or ve times a day, subjectsnoted shortening of the healing period, preventionof infection spreading, and rapid relief of the typ-ical symptoms of herpes. The authors also con-cluded that the intervals between the periods withherpes might be prolonged with this treatment. 25 The cream should be applied two to four times a day during an active eruption. No sideeffects have been observed. Lemon Balm Apply topically 2 to 4 times a day. Licorice ( Glycyrrhiza Glabra ).Licorice and other the body's immune system andto defend against the effects of disease-causingviral infections. Laboratory studies demonstrate acomponent of Glycyrrhiza glabra root, cyrrhetinic acid, is active viruses, speci-cally in HSV where it inhibits the growth,activity, and ability to replicate, irreversibly inac-tivating the herpes simplex virus. 26In clinical practice, I have observed that topical prepara-tions of licorice containing glycyrrhetinic acid have helped to reduce both healing time anduncomfortable symptoms associated with genitalherpes. Apply the ointment or gel several timesdaily. If used daily over several weeks or months,licorice may cause fluid retention and therebyraise blood pressure in certain individuals. Licorice Apply ointment or gel several times daily. Siberian Ginseng ( Eleutherococcus Sentico- sus).A randomized double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of a standardized extract of eleuthe-rococcus showed a decrease in severity, duration,and frequency of outbreaks when used for at leastthree consecutive months. Although not com-monly used by alternative practitioners for thetreatment of herpes, this study supports eleuthero'srole in suppression of herpes outbreaks. 27 Siberian Ginseng Dried root: 500-3,000 mg dried root capsules Tincture (herb and alcohol or herb, alcohol, and water): 1 tsp 3 times per day Fluid extract: 12-1 2-3 per day Extract (33% alcohol extract): 40-120 drops 1-3 times per day Solid extracts made from dried, powdered root (at least 1% eleutheroside F): 100-200 mg 3 times per day Bee Propolis. Propolis is a resinous substance that bees make by combining substances fromplants with waxes and glandular secretions. They use this resin for the construction and repair oftheir hives. It is also placed at the entrance to thehive where the worker bees brush up against it asthey enter the hive. This sterilizes the bees frominfection. The composition of propolis variesdepending on the plants in the area that the beesvisit. Some propolis may be higher in flavonoids,other propolis may be higher in diterpene com-pounds. both antibacterial andantiviral properties against a variety of microor-ganisms, including HSV. 28-30 T wo of my favorite natural topical therapies for herpes lesions are honey and bee propolis. A smallstudy comparing topical application of honeyversus acyclovir cream found a statistically signi-cant shorter duration of episodes and faster healingtime when using honey compared to acyclovir. 31 Another larger, randomized, single-blind studyshowed that more subjects' lesions healed after 10days of treatment with a 3 percent propolis oint-ment than with placebo or acyclovir. 32 Bee Propolis Apply 3% bee propolis ointment several times per day. Aloe Vera. Aloe vera is a cactus, and the gelat- inous substance inside the leaf is known to havemany benecial properties. It's not surprising thatsome research shows some effects for the herpesvirus, and mucosal epithelial tissue appears to bea good site for the medicinal effects of aloe. Invitro data suggests that chemical constituents ofaloe vera inactivate HSV-2 both alone and syner-gistically with acyclovir. 33, 34Human clinical trials on men support its use topically as a 0.5 percent Aloe Vera 0.5% cream, apply 2-4 times daily106WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE hydrophilic cream, but not as a gel, to shorten healing time and decrease symptoms.35, 36 am not aware of any research studies using myrrh and gold- enseal for genital herpes eruptions, but the tradi-tional use of both of these herbs is longstanding.As an antiseptic and as an anti-inflammatory for inflammations and sores of the mucous mem-branes, these two herbs have been very reliableand may go a long way not only toward improv-ing the health of the epithelial tissue of themouth and genital region but also stimulating animmune response locally in that tissue. Myrrh Oral tincture: 10-30 drops 3 times per day Goldenseal Oral tincture: 10-30 drops 3 times per day Additional Botanicals. Many botanicals have the ability to provide immune supportthrough various mechanisms. Other plants havevery specic antiviral properties as well. The antiviral activity of Saint-John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum ) has been demonstrated. Laboratory studies have shown that two con-stituents in Saint-John's-wort, hypericin andpseudohypericin, exhibit strong antiviral activityagainst herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 as well asinfluenza types A and B, in addition to a virus inthe mouth that causes vesicular stomatitis. 37 Momordica charantia , or bitter melon, has been shown to have antiviral activity against bothHSV 1 and 2 such that its effectiveness in vitro isnot only greater than acyclovir, but it is alsoeffective against acyclovir-resistant strains. 38 Medicinal mushrooms are known for their antimicrobial activity against a number ofmicroorganisms. Recent in that fromPleurotus tuber-regium exerts its antiviral effect bybinding to the virus, thereby preventing the infection of the host cells. 39 Echinacea has shown in vitro antiviral activ- ity against HSV-1,40but a human study did not demonstrate any statistically signicant reduc-tion in recurrent genital herpes. 41 Viracea, a proprietary benzalkonium chloride and derivatives from Echinacea pur- purea , was found to have anti-HSV-1 and -2 activity in vitro, even on strains that to acyclovir. 42 Chapparal ( Larrea tridentate ), leaf resins, have been shown to have signicantantiviral activity. The natural ingredients in theleaf resin appear to the inhibit replication of thevirus. 43Preparations are available in either cap- Sample Treatment Plan for Genital Herpes See the Resources section for formulation sources. During an Acute Episode Apply ice, preferably during the prodrome stage during symptoms of itching, numbness, or tin- gling or even after the eruption has appeared,for 10-minute applications several times during the day. This limits the discomfort and swelling and can keep an outbreak from fully erupting. Apply lemon balm ointment several times per day. Apply licorice gel (glycyrrhetinic acid) twice per day. Lysine: 1,000 mg 3 times per day Vitamin C: 600-800 mg with 600-800 mg bio- flavonoids 3 times per day Zinc: 25 mg per day Prevention Follow a diet that is high in lysine foods (veg- etables, beans, sh, turkey, and chicken) andavoid foods high in arginine (chocolate, allnuts and seeds).

One or two capsules daily of the leaf resin may reduce the frequencyof outbreaks, and the topical lotion, whenapplied at the rst sign of a tingling sensation,may prevent the outbreak from used by naturopathic physicians, herbalists, and otherhealth-care practitioners to support the body'simmune system and to defend against the effectsof disease-causing viral infections. These herbsare typically administered in liquid extracts, cap-sules or tablets, or teas. Lomatium may cause atemporary skin rash if used in an improper dose. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Many patients prefer to use antiviral therapy to suppress infections and to reduce recurrentepisodes. The primary goals of antiviral therapyare to limit the severity of the infection and togive the patient a sense of control over the diseaseprocess. Antiviral therapy is offered to normalimmunocompetent patients with either primaryor nonprimary genital herpes. In the vast major-ity of cases, oral antiviral therapy is sufcient,although more severe cases may require hospital-ization and intravenous acyclovir. Episodic therapy appears to work best for women who have a clearly identiable prodrome.Patients who desire continuous suppressive therapyneed to discuss with their physician the advantagesand disadvantages of this regimen. Medical consid-erations, psychosocial needs, and cost are all factorsinfluencing the wisdom of such a regimen. The advent of herpes viral testing accuracy and knowledge of the asymptomatic carrier hasled to an increase in the use of antiviral herpestreatments. The meds used to treat the virus areessentially the same as they have been for the past10 to 20 years, but recommendations for usage and dosing have changed. The three meds mostcommonly prescribed and famciclovir. rstFDA-approved drug for treatment of herpes andis available as capsules, tablets, oral suspension,topical ointment and cream, and sterile powderfor IV infusion. Valacyclovir (Valtrex) comes in500 and 1000 mg caplets, famciclovir (Famvir)in 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg tablets. The sideeffect prole of all of these meds is the same. Theside effects are uncommon, but those reportedare nausea, vomiting, and headache. They seemto be dose-dependent. There does not appear tobe any long-term harm with the use of thesemeds, and there are few, if any, drug interactions.Essentially, this is a very safe medication class. These meds are used for episodic treatment and for prevention. We now know that 5 to 10 percentof people are asymptomatic herpes shedders, sosuppressive daily therapy is recommended for: 1. A person with an initial herpes outbreak 2. A person who is known to be an asympto- matic shedder 3. Patients with oral or genital herpes who have more than four episodes a year The recommendation is for a year or more, depending on the patient's interest. The usualrecommendation is for a year following the rstepisode of herpes, and longer if there are othercofactors. The dosing has also changed from the origi- nal recommendations. Acyclovir, which is avail-able generically, is recommended as follows:Ointment for genital topical therapy used severaltimes a day until the lesions have resolved andcream for oral lesions with the same dosing.Orally, it is now 400 mg twice daily for 10 daysfor an initial episode, then 400 mg twice daily for5 days for recurrences. 400 mg once daily is thesuppression dose. Valacyclovir has a variety of dosing recom- mendations: For an initial outbreak of genitalherpes, use 1,000 mg three times a day for 10days. For recurrent outbreaks, use 500 mg twice108WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE daily for 5 days. For suppression, use 500 mg per day. For oral herpes, the recommendation is 2 gin the morning and 2 g in the evening on one dayonly. For recurrent outbreaks, many practitionersprescribe the 1,000 mg caplet and suggest thatpatients cut it in half for economic reasons andtake one half caplet twice daily. Famvir is dosed at 125 to 250 mg twice daily for 10 days for the initial episode and 125 to 250 mg twice daily for 5 days for the recurrentepisodes. The suppression dose is 250 mg oncedaily. It is interesting that with this product, thesuppression dosing is greater than the activetreatment dosing, because the drug is more rap-idly taken up by the virus when it is in its activereplication phase. Hence, more drug is neededfor suppression than for active treatment. The drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, so one may need to reconsider dosing in patientswith renal impairment. The drugs are approvedthroughout all ages of pediatric use, and theywould need to be specically dosed by a pediatri-cian. So far, no resistant strains are reported. The most important treatment remains pre- vention. Condoms do not prevent the spread ofHSV genitally. Health practitioners continue tosuggest that patients refrain from sexual activity,including oral sex and kissing, when an activelesion is present. We now recognize that 5 to 10percent of people with a history of herpes doshed virus without an active lesion. Talking toyour partner about his or her sexual history andsafe sex practices are pr obably the most important steps in dealing with herpes. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) The most appropriate method for accurate diagno- sis of a genital lesion is to see a licensed health-carepractitioner qualied to perform a gynecologicalexam. Accurate diagnosis of genital lesions is notonly an important key to effective and appropriatetreatment but also a key to determining sexual behavior and habits with sexual partners. Labora-tory testing using viral cultures and blood tests forantibodies are the most common methods thatmay be recommended by your practitioner. A qualied health-care practitioner can be extremely helpful in providing education andcounseling to the person who has newly acquiredherpes. Education includes information about thenature of HSV infection, various treatmentoptions, effect on pregnancy, and prevention oftransmission. Counseling includes helping patients to deal with fears, shame, guilt, and feelings ofsocial isolation as well as developing strategies forcommunicating with present and future sexualpartners. Women who are pregnant need to inform their practitioner of their history of herpes. Anyoutbreaks during the pregnancy should berecorded and reported so that appropriate testing,treatment, and management can be done duringthe pregnancy and delivery. Whether your practi-tioner is a midwife, alternative practitioner quali-ed to perform home births, obstetrician, orfamily physician, she or he needs to know yourinfection status to make appropriate recommen-dations for your health and your baby's. Women with recurrent genital herpes infec- tions may need to seek more aggressive or indi-vidualized care from an alternative practitionerthan the therapies discussed in this chapter.Homeopathy, additional herbal/nutritional com-bination products, or Chinese herbal medicinemay be more effective in an individual case. Some women may choose to use conven- tional pharmaceutical antiviral therapy, althoughthis is not usually medically necessary. There arecases of primary or nonprimary genital herpes,however, when antiviral therapy is indicated forimmunocompromised individuals. Cases wheresymptoms and complications are severe enoughto warrant hospitalization may require intravenousantiviral therapy.109OVERVIEW Most of us are aware that heart disease is a pri- mary affliction for men, but cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also the leading cause of deathin women. More than 500,000 women die ofcardiovascular-related causes annually in theUnited States. 1Taking into account other athero- sclerotic disorders resulting from damaged andnarrowed arteries, such as strokes, almost 4 ofevery 10 women will die of these diseases,approximately 100,000 prematurely (before theage of 65). 2Starting at age 50, more women die of cardiovascular diseases than of any other con-dition, 3and women younger than 55 years old who have a heart attack have a worse prognosisand higher incidence of heart attack-relateddeath than do men of the same age who have aheart attack, as well as a greater chance of havinganother heart attack. 4, 5Cardiovascular disease is also a major cause of disability in older women.For black women, the risk of heart-related death istwice as high as for white women. 6 Even though heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women, the rates ofcoronary disease (but not necessarily death) at virtually every age are higher in men than inwomen. 7When women are in their thirties and forties, the difference between men and women isfour- to vefold. After that, the difference shrinkswith increasing age. Coronary artery disease(CAD) is less common in premenopausal women,and the incidence of CAD tends to be about 10 to15 years later than men, until the age of 70. 8 Overweight women and those with the apple fat distribution (with abdominal fat) are atgreater risk for developing coronary artery dis-ease than are slim women and those with thepear fat pattern (fat stored around the hips). 9Abdominal obesity also increases the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes and may lowerthe HDL (good) cholesterol level and raise thetriglyceride level. A desirable waist-to-hip ratiofor middle-aged women is less than 0.8. To getyour waist-to-hip ratio, measure your abdomenat the largest point and divide it by your hipmeasurement. Overall weight, usually calculated in terms of body mass index (BMI), is also an important toolfor assessing one's risk for coronary artery disease.To calculate your body mass index, divide yourweight in kilograms by the square of your heightin meters. You can also refer to the height andweight chart in Appendix B to help you to deter-mine your body mass index. A desirable bodymass index is less than 25. The Nurses' HealthStudy found that women with a BMI of 29 ormore had triple the risk of coronary artery diseasecompared with women who were lean and witha BMI of less than 21. 10Women with a BMI of 25 to 28.9 had almost double the risk. As manyas one-third of white women and one-half ofblack women are 20 percent or more over theirdesirable body weight. Between the ages of 30 and 60, and in each of the decades in this age group, women who havehad either surgical or natural menopause havetwice the rate of CAD compared to women intheir age group who still have premenopausalovarian function. 11Women who have had both ovaries removed have a higher rate of CAD at anearlier age than women who undergo naturalmenopause. 12The explanations for this are multi- ple, but the estrogen produced by the ovaries helps to maintain higher HDL levels, which pro-tect the cardiovascular system, keep the LDL levelslow, and slow the aging of the arteries.

Formore than thirty years, observational researchstudies on HRT consistently reported signi-cantly reduced rates of cardiovascular disease inwomen who used either estrogen alone or estro-gen plus progestins, 15and HRT was routinely prescribed for primary prevention of cardiovascu-lar disease. Then, in 1998, the Heart and Estro-gen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) 16 found that the hormones did not protect womenwho already had evidence of cardiovascular dis-ease from heart attacks, and moreover, that morewomen treated with HRT died of heart disease inthe rst year of the study than those given aplacebo. This study was followed soon after, in2002, with one called the Women's Health Initia-tive, 17which found that conventional HRT (Pre- marin and Provera) was not associated with adecrease in heart disease, but actually with a slightincrease. It was also associated with a slightincrease in strokes and clots. As researchers con-tinued to study the women in the estrogen-onlygroup (Premarin), they did not nd an increase inthe risk of heart disease, but still did nd a slightincrease in strokes and clots. 18In addition to the estrogen plus progestin HERS study and theestrogen-only WHI study, numerous other ran-domized controlled trials have been done sincethe HERS trial. No benecial effects of estrogenon heart disease risk were observed in either theestrogen in the prevention of reinfarction trail(ESPRIT) 19or in the women in the Papworth HRT atherosclerosis study (PHASE).20 Most recently, studies show that HRT might in fact be benecial if taken during peri-menopause or very early menopause, 21, 22 offer- ing a window of cardioprotection if started in theearly menopausal years. Estrogen has favorableeffects on several LDL uptake of LDL in blood vessels,binds to vascular estrogen receptors, reduces inhibitor, anddecreases fasting blood glucose and insulin. 23 As you can see, the last 9 or 10 years in par- ticular have seen a flurry of trials on the subjectof HRT and heart disease, and with all of thesestudies, commentaries, confusions, contradic-tions, controversies, questions, and opinionsabound. Despite the more recent reassuring newsabout the effects of HRT when given early,women and their physicians are still left with noconsistent clear message or guide as to what tothink regarding HRT and cardiovascular disease.Because of this inconsistency, it is important toassess each woman individually to determinewhether HRT is right for her. In addition, physi-cian advisory organizations no longer recom-mend that HRT be used to reduce the risk ofheart disease. The question really is, does hormone replace- ment therapy benet women, and, if so, whichhormones, in what form, in what dose, and inwhom is it benecial? In determining the best plan of action, it is important that each woman is individuallyassessed for her heart disease risk. Utilizing acomprehensive medical history, physical exami-nation, and selected laboratory and heart func-tion testing, it is possible to assess a woman's riskfor coronary artery disease and the risk of heartattacks. Based on this assessment, a strategy canbe put in place utilizing lifestyle changes, nutri-tional and botanical supplements, and in somecases prescription medications to prevent andtreat cardiovascular disease. To assess eachwoman individually and comprehensively anduse a holistic integrative therapeutic plan is a111HEART DISEASE long overdue approach in the management of heart disease in women. What Is Heart Disease? Before we go too far, let's clarify what we mean by cardiovascular disease. Generally, when werefer to the risk of heart disease in menopausalwomen we mean coronary artery disease, includ-ing coronary artery atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndromes, andangina. These conditions are intimately related to hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The termheart disease is most often used to describe coro- nary atherosclerosis, hardening of and depositionof plaque in the arteries of the blood vessels thatsupply the heart. Other forms of heart diseaseinclude congestive heart failure, arrhythmias,mitral valve prolapse, and cardiomyopathy, butthese are unrelated to issues of menopause andhormones. The focus of this chapter is the pre-vention and treatment of coronary artery disease(CAD) and atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia, and myocardial infarction. Risk Factors for Heart Disease Major risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) include high blood pressure, abnormalcholesterol prole (dyslipidemia), and diabetes.Optimal levels of lipids are LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) less than100 mg/dL, triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL,non-high-density lipoprotein lessthan 130 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)over 50 mg/dL. Updated guidelines from the2001 National Cholesterol Education Program(NCEP III) expert panel on detection, evalua-tion, and treatment of high blood cholesterol inadults (called the adult treatment panel, or ATPIII) are more complex than just this and empha-size more aggressive lowering of elevated LDLlevels, especially in women with higher risk fac-tors for heart disease. If you have peripheral vas-cular disease, coronary artery disease, abdominalaortic aneurysm, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome,discuss testing and management with your prac- titioner as well as all available options, includingexercise, weight management, dietary changes,aspirin, drug treatment, and nutritional supple-ment interventions. T riglycerides are an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women, but especiallywhen increased triglycerides are present in associ-ation with low HDL levels. If the triglyceridelevel is greater than 400 mg/dL and HDL choles-terol is less than 50 mg/dL, the risk of heart dis-ease is signicantly increased. 24Patients with elevated triglycerides and a family history forheart disease most likely have familial hyperlipi-demia. T riglyceride levels from 200 to 400mg/dL are considered elevated but borderline.Weight loss alone can return elevated triglyceridelevels to normal. Smoking, dietary simple carbo-hydrates, obesity, and lack of exercise are allrelated to elevated triglycerides. When determining one's risk for heart disease, there are some critical things to look for. Womenwhose father had a heart attack or stroke beforeage 50, or mother before age 65 (unrelated to cig-arette smoking), are at a genetic disadvantage. It'simportant for these women to work harder in theareas of prevention because they are at increasedrisk just by virtue of their family history. Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in older women and a signicant riskfactor for stroke, congestive heart disease, andkidney disease. Beginning at age 50, hyperten-sion is more common in women than in menand even more so in black women. See Table 9.1for new blood pressure guidelines set in 2003.Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP of 160mm Hg or greater) or combined hypertension(systolic BP of 160 or greater and diastolic BP of90 or greater) is directly related to increaseddeath rates from cardiovascular disease. Impaired tolerance to glucose is another risk factor for heart disease. Women with higher thannormal blood sugar or who are clinically diabeticare at increased risk. The diabetic woman has three112WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE to seven times the risk of cardiovascular disease and of dying prematurely from atherosclerosisthan a nondiabetic woman. 25Diabetes is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease inwomen than in men. 26Women are more prone to suffer unrecognized or \"silent\" events related toischemia. In addition to these risk factors, there are two syndromes, both called syndrome X, associatedwith heart disease risk. The rst one was named byDr. Harvey Kemp of Harvard in 1967 to describewomen with normal coronary angiograms whohad angina-like chest pain with or without posi-tive treadmill tests. 27Some of these women turned out to have abnormal circulation in the smallcoronary arteries, and their coronary flow didn'tadjust itself appropriately. The second syndrome X, also called Reaven's syndrome or metabolic syndrome, 28was coined in 1988 by Dr. Gerald Reaven of Stanford Univer-sity. It is a syndrome of increased truncal (midsec-tion) obesity\u2014a waist-to-hip ratio greater than1:1\u2014and is dened as a cluster of symptoms thatappear to occur secondarily to cellular resistance toinsulin. Individuals who secrete larger amounts ofinsulin because the normal insulin action isimpaired are predisposed to glucose intolerance,hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperten-sion. The relationship between resistance toinsulin, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,hypertension, and cardiovascular disease has beenextensively documented. 29Evidence suggests that hyperinsulinemia may be seen in as many as 25percent of the nondiabetic population. As many as 50 percent of individuals with high blood pressuremay have syndrome X. 30Overweight individuals are more susceptible to this condition, but asmany as 50 percent of hyperinsulinemic patientsmay be of normal weight. 31Individuals who have glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia shouldeat a diet lower in carbohydrates, whether simpleor complex. A diet that is 40 percent carbohy-drates, 30 percent fat, and 30 percent protein mayhelp to correct the hyperinsulinemia. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease and evaluation of the potential for risk of cardiovas-cular disease (CVD) are fundamental steps toimprove women's health and decrease their risk ofacquiring and dying from cardiovascular disease.Screening tests, noninvasive diagnostic testing,and testing to help determine risk and prognosisoffer the opportunity to identify women atincreased risk, begin proactive prevention strate-gies, and provide the basis for treatment options. For women who do not have symptoms of CAD, the goal is to identify risk factors for devel-oping CAD. Risk prediction charts are available,and one risk chart, the Framingham risk score(FRS), includes traditional risk factors for CAD,including age, smoking history, blood pressure,obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and cholesterolvalues. 32From this score, it is determined if the risk is low, intermediate, or high. This is then cor-related with expected rates of death or heartattack. Prevention strategies are then determinedfor each woman. In general, the risk of heart dis-Table 9.1 Blood Pressure Guidelines Blood Pressure Systolic Pressure Diastolic Pressure Category (mm Hg) (mm Hg) Normal less than 120 less than 80 Prehypertension 120-139 80-89Stage 1 hypertension 140-159 90-99 Stage 2 hypertension 160 or higher 100 or higher113HEART DISEASE ease and heart events are low in premenopausal women and therefore screening is less importantuntil menopause. Important exceptions to this arewomen who have diabetes, women with periph-eral arterial disease, and overweight women withpolycystic ovarian syndrome. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screen-ing in adults who are low risk for CAD. 33For those at higher risk (a history of a nonfatal heartattack, older age, high blood pressure, smoker, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, andbeing sedentary), appropriate testing is veryimportant to prevent future cardiac events. It isimportant to make a distinction between routinescreening and tests done for individuals who aresymptomatic or who are suspected to have CAD.For women who have a normal resting electro-cardiogram (ECG) and who have good exercisetolerance, a r outine exercise treadmill test with ECG is recommended as the initial test to evalu-ate suspected CAD. For women who have anundetermined or intermediate risk exercise ECGtest, cardiac imaging is recommended. Again, dia-betic women merit special attention and will needto be evaluated more assertively due to their eight-fold higher risk of cardiovascular death comparedto women who are not diabetic. For women who are symptomatic\u2014for example with angina pains\u2014and are intermedi-ate or high risk, noninvasive cardiovascular riskscreening, including exercise ECG testing, stressechocardiography (an ultrasound imaging of the heart called echocardiogram, done whileexercising), and cardiac imaging looking for ath-erosclorosis are recommended. Stress echocardio-graphy can provide important information aboutthe function of the left ventricle of the heart,valvular disease, and any stress-induced ischemiaor previous infarction. This particular test hasbecome an important tool in testing women,because it is more specic and accurate than stan-dard exercise ECG in women. An abnormal exer-cise stress echocardiography test is associatedwith an increased risk of future cardiac events in women, and a normal test is associated with alow risk of cardiac events. Even in symptom-freewomen who are suspect for CAD, stress echo-cardiography is a cost-efcient and better testthan an exercise ECG, particularly in womenwho are at intermediate risk for coronary arterydisease. Cardiac imaging tests include what is called currentlythe most commonly performed stress imagingtest in the United States. However, it may havelimitations in women, possibly due to theirsmaller heart and the interference of the breasttissue. Different nuclear isotopes and pharma-ceuticals can be used to enhance the diagnosticvalue of the SPECT test. Whichever SPECTtechnique is used, these tests are able to furtherevaluate and/or predict cardiac disease, and thisinformation can be used to determine the extentof the treatment intervention that is needed toimprove their symptoms and future health. Several new imaging technologies have emerged in the detection of subclinical CAD:computed tomography (CT), magnetic reso-nance (IMT). Consultation with a cardiolo-gist is important in determining the value orneed for such tests. Increasingly, blood tests for cardiovascular biomarkers, which may serve as markers forCVD, are being done in healthy women. Testsfor lipoprotein protein, brino-gen, homocysteine, and subfractions LDL-C are a few of the more frequentlyused. It is difcult to say with certainty, at thistime, in whom and how often these should bedone. Currently, the scientic community hasnot agreed on guidelines for their use or whethersuch testing ultimately does a better job than thetraditional physical exam with cholesterol panelsand blood glucose testing. In my practice, for114WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE women who have had one regular lipid panel with abnormalities, I am inclined to order theseadditional, more sophisticated blood tests. Themore risk factors they have, such as obesity, diabetes, and others, the more eager I am to eval-uate them in as comprehensive a manner as pos-sible. These additional blood tests can be easilydone to serve that purpose. There are heart disease risk factors unique to women. These include oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, having had both ovaries removed, and premature menopause. Additional risk factors notrelated to gender include increased body fat, espe-cially if it is in the abdominal area; history of smok-ing; being sedentary; diabetes mellitus; high bloodpressure; poor lipid ratios; and family history. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Conventional and alternative medicine practition- ers agree that, in most cases, atherosclerosis andcardiovascular disease are directly related to dietand lifestyle. While family history and genetic predisposition play an important role in cardiovas-cular disease, risk factors such as cigarette smok- ing, exercise, dietary habits, and stress can be mod-ied to reduce a person's risk. In fact, a recentstudy found that the following factors are to becorrelated to increased hypertension: excessivesodium intake, low potassium intake, physicalinactivity, low intake of sh oil, low calciumintake, low magnesium intake, excessive coffeeconsumption, and excessive alcohol intake. 34 Dietary and lifestyle changes are the founda- tions of heart disease prevention and treatment.Dr. Dean Ornish and his team of researchersconducted the rst signicant clinical trial todetermine whether comprehensive lifestylechanges affect coronary atherosclerosis. Dr. DeanOrnish's landmark study, called the LifestyleHeart T rial, published in 1990, found thatlifestyle changes (a low-fat vegetarian diet, mod-erate aerobic exercise, stress management, smok-ing cessation, and group support) 35changed serum lipids as much as cholesterol-loweringdrugs. After one year in the program, patientsalso showed signicant overall regression of theircoronary atherosclerosis. These results have beenreplicated in several recent studies. 36-38It is inter- esting to note that patients who made less com-prehensive changes in lifestyle showed signicantprogression of their atherosclerosis, suggestingthat the conventional 30 percent-fat diet recom-mendation made to patients with cardiovasculardisease is not low enough. See the nutrition anddietary factors section for more about the DeanOrnish low-fat diet. Smoking is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and heart attacks, even inpremenopausal women. Smokers have three tove times the risk of coronary artery disease asnonsmokers, and smoking accounts for one-fthof CVD deaths. 39, 40 Even smoking only one to four cigarettes a day doubles a woman's risk ofCVD. Smoking a pack or more per day maydouble to quadruple that. 41Tobacco smoke con- tains chemicals that damage the lining of thearteries, raise the cholesterol level, promote theRisk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease Medical Conditions Hypertension Diabetes mellitusHyperlipidemia/lipid abnormalitiesSyndrome X (insulin resistance) Obesity and/or excess abdominal and upper body fat (apple shape) Lifestyle Sedentary lifestyleHigh-fat dietCigarette smokingAlcohol\u2014more than two drinks per day Stress Family History Coronary artery disease115HEART DISEASE ability of platelets to clump together, elevate levels of brinogen (a clot-forming protein), andelevate the blood pressure. Smoking is especiallyproblematic in women who use oral contracep-tives. This combination increases the risk ofCVD by up to 39 times due to blood clots. 42The good news is that women who stop smoking canreduce their risk of CVD to that of a nonsmokerwithin two years of quitting. Exercise is a vital part of a lifestyle routine that can have lifelong benets in preventing heartdisease and strokes. Regular exercise lowers cho-lesterol levels, improves the blood supply andtherefore the oxygen delivered to the heart,increases the strength of the heart muscle andthus improves the volume of blood it can move,reduces blood pressure, helps to inhibit blood clots, reduces overall body fat, and minimizesdamage from stress. In many women, stress is the major cause of their high blood pressure. Relaxation techniquessuch as deep breathing, biofeedback, meditation,yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and hypnosishave all been shown to have some value in lower-ing blood pressure. 43Many recent studies on var- ious stress reduction techniques have also shownimprovement in blood pressure and other meas-KEY CONCEPTS Determine your indiv idual risk for cardiovascular disease; make an appointment with a knowl- edgeable health-care practitioner for medicalhistory, physical exams, and tests. Monitor blood pressure regularly. Monitor fasting levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, cholesterol/HDLratio, triglycerides, and blood glucose. Consult with your health-care provider regarding at what age to start and how frequently ECGs, stressECGs, stress echocardiograms, and cardiac or carotid artery imaging may be needed on an individual basis depending on symptoms andsuspicion of CVD. More sophisticated testing as needed or desired: homocysteine, alpha-lipoprotein (a), brinogen,C-reactive protein, HDL subfractions, LDL subfractions. Heart disease, and especially heart disease ear- lier in life, is a preventable disease; appropriatediet and exercise, emotional balance and stress management, and herbal and nutritional supple- mentation may substantially reduce CVD risk. Benets and risks of hormone replacement ther- apy need to be discussed with a health-care provider familiar with up-to-date research onthis topic.PREVENTION Prevention of Heart Disease Get regular aerobic exercise for 30 minutes, 5-7 days per week. Increase sh, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and nuts and seeds intake. Eat lean meats and poultry without the skin. Eat low-fat or fat-free dairy (preferably organic). Decrease consumption of foods high in saturated fats, cholesterol, sugar, and simple carbohydrates. Work toward or maintain a healthy body weight. Do not drink more than one alcoholic beverage per day. Stop smoking and avoid secondhand cigarette smoke. Prevention of Hypertension Limit sodium intake to less than 2,400 mg per day. Practice stress management techniques. Work toward or maintain a healthy body weight. Exercise daily for 30 minutes or more. Prevention of Hyperlipidemia Decrease consumption of saturated fats and high-cholesterol foods. Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise daily for 30 minutes or more. Increase consumption of olive oil, nuts, and seeds.116WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ures of CVD, including decreased mortality and oxidative stress.44-49 A fundamental tenant of alternative medicine is that lifestyle changes that include smoking cessation, appropriate exercise, diet, and the useof dietary ingredients, nutritional supplements,and herbal extracts can prevent or reduce risksand treat cardiovascular disease. Considerablescientic research exists that demonstrates theeffect of these natural therapies and interventionsin lowering cholesterol, improving blood lipidratios, lowering blood pressure, preventing clotsand strokes, inhibiting brinogen, loweringhomocysteine levels, strengthening the cardiacmuscle, and preventing the oxidative damage tovessel walls, all of which are implicated in cardio-vascular disease risk. Ingredients such as ber,soy, antioxidants, folic acid, vitamins B 6and B 12, magnesium, sh oils and flax oil, garlic, haw-thorn berry, and others are just some of the manynatural therapies that give alternative practition-ers a great deal of condence in their ability tohelp women to prevent and treat heart disease.Most alternative practitioners employ a diverse,holistic health plan in their approach to prevent-ing and treating CVD. Recent research supportsthe use of supplements like sh oil, oat bran, andplant sterols in combination with diet and exer-cise interventions as a way to favorably effect alllipid parameters, 50and diets focused on decreas- ing cholesterol have long-term success on parwith statin therapy. 51 Nutrition and Dietary Factors Dietary habits are a fundamental area where we can exert a great deal of influence on our hearthealth. Fats. Lowering the level of dietary fat has been in the news for a long time now. The Amer-ican Heart Association says that 30 percent orless of our total calories should be from fat. Manyalternative practitioners advise even lower intakesbecause of some of the additional benets, suchas reduction of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer risk. In addition to amount of fat, the type of fat is also important. Understanding the harmfuleffects of some fats and the benecial effects ofothers can be confusing. A little explanation ofterms and concepts may go a long way in clarify-ing the issue. Fats are the most concentratedsource of food energy. Each gram of fat provides9 calories, compared with only 4 calories pergram for carbohydrates or protein. All fats aremade from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Theseelements are arranged in molecules called fattyacids. The three major classes of dietary lipids aretriglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols (such ascholesterol). Ninety-ve percent dietaryfats are triglycerides. A triglyceride is a glycerolmolecule with three fat molecules attached.These fat molecules are called fatty acids. Lipaseenzymes, found in our bile, break apart thetriglyceride molecules. The triglyceride is con-verted into a monoglyceride, which the body canthen absorb, along with the individual fatty acidsand the glycerol. Fatty acids and monoglycerides are absorbed and transported by lipoproteins. These lipopro-teins are the very low-density lipoproteins(VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), andhigh-density lipoproteins (HDL) that we havediscussed earlier in the chapter. VLDL and LDLtransport the fats from the liver to the cells in thebody, and HDL returns the fats to the liver. Ele-vations of LDL or VLDL are associated with anincreased risk for atherosclerosis (narrowing ofthe arteries), which compromises blood flow tothe heart, which can cause a heart attack, andcreates an artery prone to releasing a blood clot,which can lead to a stroke. Elevation of the HDLis protective and is associated with a lower risk ofheart attacks. Types of Fatty Acids. A distinction should be made between different types of fatty acids. Sat-urated fatty acids are solid at room temperature117HEART DISEASE and are typically animal fats (found in beef, lamb, butter, cheese, and lard). Saturated fats ingeneral are not good for the heart; they con-tribute to LDL cholesterol and should be eatenin sparse amounts for a heart-healthy diet. Atriglyceride is a saturated fat when the carbonmolecules in the fatty acids are saturated withhydrogen molecules and can't carry any more.When some of the hydrogen molecules areremoved, what remains is an unsaturated fattyacid, or unsaturated fat. Unsaturated fats areliquid at room temperature and, therefore, arecalled oils. Most vegetable oils contain mainlyunsaturated fats. These are not as bad for you assaturated fats, and they contain healthy essentialfatty acids (discussed later), but they aren'thealthy in large quantities. Polyunsaturated fattyacids contain more than one double bond alongthe fatty acid chain. Replacing saturated fattyacids in the diet with polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) from vegetable oils will lower both totalcholesterol and LDL levels and decrease bloodpressure. 52However, it may also lower HDL. The third general type of fat is monounsatu- rated fat. These fats contain one double bond.Monounsaturated fatty acids, as found in oliveoil, show either no effect on HDL or an increasein HDL, thereby promoting a better effect thaneither PUFAs or saturated fats. Of all the types of fat, monounsaturated is the healthiest for your heart. An omega-9 oil, such as oleic acid (found in olive oil), is a monounsaturated fat that has theunsaturated bond at the ninth carbon moleculeon the chain. Monounsaturated oils like canolaand olive are ideal for cooking as they are madechiefly of oleic acid that is more resistant todamage from the heat from cooking and lightfrom storage. The high content of oleic acidmake these two oils far superior to the highlypolyunsaturated oils like corn, safflower, and soythat are easily damaged by heat and light andaren't as heart-healthy. The fatty acids in theseless desirable oils are changed to lipid peroxideswith cooking, which have a toxic effect on theinside of the arteries. In a healthy cardiovascularprevention regime, one would, therefore, prefer-entially eat the seeds and fruits that containmonounsaturated oils; use canola, sesame, andolive oil for cooking; and leave the rest of the oilson the supermarket shelves. (See Table 9.2 for thefatty acid composition of different dietary oils). 53 We don't hear a lot about sesame oil, but a number of studies have proven its cardiovascularbenets. One study showed a signicant decreasein blood pressure measures in patients after 45 Table 9.2 Fatty Acid Composition of Various Dietary Oils % GLA % LA % ALA % Oleic % Saturated Oil (Omega-6) (Omega-6) (Omega-3) (Omega-9) Fat Flax 0 14 55 20 9 Safflower 0 75 0 13 12 Soy 0 50 9 26 15 Olive* 0 8 0 76 16Coconut 0 3 0 6 91 Corn 0 59 0 24 17 Canola 0 30 7 49 7 *Is especially high in the preferential monounsaturated fat, oleic acid.118WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE days of using sesame oil and an increase in meas- ures when patients reverted back to other oils. Inaddition, sesame oil decreased weight, body massindex, waist and hip measurements, blood sugar,hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, LDL, and tri-glycerides. 54Another study found that sesame oil was superior to sunflower and nut oils in its abil-ity to decrease oxidation of lipids, improve lipidparameters, and decrease blood pressure. 55 Olive oil, with a monounsaturated fatty acid rich in oleic acid, is especially heart-healthy. Mostof the benecial effects of olive oil, especially thericher virgin olive oil, are attributed to its highmonounsaturated fatty acid content. However, italso has other components that may help explainits cardiovascular benets. Virgin olive oils havemore phenols, which appear to provide the great-est benets by increasing HDL cholesterol levelsand reducing the oxidative damage on lipids. Phe-nols are a class of naturally occurring compoundsfound in fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine, andgrape juice that are in essence antioxidants. Thesecardioprotective phenols included flavonoids,resveratrol, and curcumin. A daily 25 ml dose ofany type of olive oil has been shown to reducelipid cardiovascular risk factors 56by decreasing oxidative damage on lipids, increasing HDL cho-lesterol levels, and improving the glutathione bal-ance that protects against oxidative stress. Hydrogenated oils (an unsaturated oil that has been made into a saturated fat) should beavoided for cardiovascular health. Hydrogenatedoil raises LDL, lowers the protective effects ofHDL, and can in fact increase the incidence ofheart disease. Foods such as margarine, cakes,cookies, candies, and doughnuts often containpartially or totally hydrogenated oils. This is alsotrue of many oils sold in supermarkets; in orderto prolong their shelf life, hydrogenated fats areused in many so-called cooking oils. Another important fat classication, and one that's come under a good bit of scrutiny lately forbeing especially unhealthy, is trans fats. T rans fatsare made during the process of hydrogenating oils by chemically modifying a natural oil in a processthat converts some of the cisunsaturated fatty acids to the trans form. When we metabolize trans fat, it behaves similar to saturated fat, leading to ahigher risk of heart disease and other chronic dis-eases. T rans fats have adverse effects on HDL-Cand LDL-C. T rans fatty acids also have an adverseeffect on cell membranes, making them stiffer, andin general are associated with increased inflamma-tory and oxidative damage. T rans fatty acid levels are determined by the amount of hydrogenated oils in a food. Foodssuch as doughnuts, french fries, margarine, mostcookies, and any food that contains \"partiallyhydrogenated oils\" contain trans fats. Soybeanoils, corn oils, and safflower oils contain rela-tively high amounts of oleic and linoleic acids,which can convert to elaidic acid during thehydrogenation process. Elaidic acid is the mostcommon form of trans fatty acids because of itsproduction by hydrogenation of our mostcommon dietary oils. Elaidic acid is found inamounts as high as 60 percent in hard margarine.Being armed with a bit of knowledge about transfats and the foods that contain them and know-ing what to look for on labels will help you tosteer clear of the damaging effects of trans fats. Many women are fearful of eating more nuts due to their fat and calorie content, but nuts actu-ally contain healthy fats, as does olive oil. Higheramounts of nuts are associated with cardioprotec-tive effects. Increased intake of walnuts in particu-lar, with their alpha-linolenic acid content,appears to have a triglyceride-lowering effect. 57In addition, benecial oils in nuts help to decreaseinflammatory markers associated with CVD risk,such as C-reactive protein (CRP). 58Nuts and seeds to increase in the diet in addition to walnutsinclude almonds, lberts, sesame seeds, pumpkinseeds, and flaxseed. Cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in animal tissue. It is produced by the liver119HEART DISEASE (about 1,000 mg per day) and is a component of all cell walls. Blood-circulating cholesterol is suppliedby the liver and the intake of animal foods. Dietsthat are high in cholesterol and saturated fats (beef,pork, lamb, butter, cheese, palm oil, coconut oil)contribute to poor lipid ratios and elevated choles-terol. Lowering the cholesterol in the diet will lowerthe blood cholesterol in most individuals. 59 Essential Fatty Acids. The body can make most of the fatty acids it needs from the carbon, hydro-gen, and oxygen provided by food. These havebeen arbitrarily classied as nonessential fatty acids.(This is a most unfortunate classication. It tendsto mask the fact that the so-called \"nonessential\"fatty acids are as critical to cellular life and metab-olism as are the so-called \"essential.\" The nonessen-tial fatty acids are manufactured by the cells fromraw materials. The others must be supplied byfood. We cannot survive without both.) Essentialfatty acids (EFAs) are polyunsaturated fats thatmust be obtained from foods. The two essentialfatty acids are linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.Linoleic acid is the main omega-6 fatty acid.Alpha-linolenic acid is the main omega-3 fattyacid, which the body can convert to eicosapen-taenoic acid (EPA) and docahexaenoic acid(DHA). Linolenic acid has been found to decreaseatherosclerotic plaques, systolic blood pressure, andrelated mortality in that high dietary consumptionis related to low incidence of atherosclerosis. 60-63 The body uses the omega fatty acids to create eicosanoids. One of the most important classes ofeicosanoids is the prostaglandins. Prostaglandinsexert a local hormone-like effect on target cellsand tissues. For example, in the cardiovascularsystem, they affect dilation or constriction ofblood vessels and clot formation. The omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid groups each produce separate, distinct prostaglandins.Both types of fatty acids are needed, but in theright ratio. There is some disagreement as to theright ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fattyacids. Our early ancestors probably ate roughlyequal amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids. In the modern industrialized coun-tries, most people eat from 10:1 to as high as30:1 omega-6 to omega-3. ratio of 4:1. Thisratio of fatty acids will produce a favorable production of the friendly prostaglandins, series1 and series 3, and a limited amount of theunfriendly series 2 prostaglandins. Overall, wewant to reduce omega-6 fats and increase omega-3 fats in our diet. Increasing dietary sh, flaxseed,and walnuts and decreasing saturated fats willhelp to improve this ratio. The eicosanoids from eicosapentaenoic acid are also associated with cardioprotective effects.EPA has been shown, in particular, to decreasesystolic blood pressure, in part due to its effectson intracellular sodium transport, 65while doca- hexaenoic acid has been shown to increaseHDL. 66In animal studies, dietary sh oil has been shown to improve vascular function anddecrease oxidative stress. 67 Fish oils contain EPA and DHA. Cold-water sh such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, andhalibut in particular are excellent sources ofomega-3 fatty acids. Fish oils prevent clots,inhibit inflammation in the vessel walls, causevasodilation, and promote a regular cardiacrhythm. Similar to aspirin, sh oils block theproduction of thromboxane A2, which is apotent vasoconstrictor and promoter of the stick-iness of blood. 68Fish oils may also lower blood pressure and triglycerides, but they may raiseLDL. 69-71 Other studies show that sh oils lower total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides, whileincreasing HDL. 72In a large study of male physi- cians, those who ate sh at least once per weekhad a 52 percent lower risk of sudden cardiacdeath. 73Fish oils with a seed oil of alpha- linolenic acid and vitamin E have also beenshown to reduce the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), associated with cardio-120WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE vascular disease.74-79 Norwegian researchers con- cluded that eating sh like mackerel, herring, andsalmon will signicantly reduce the risk of heartdisease. As little as one serving of 300 grams of shper week will provide the benet. They suggestedthat the minimal dietary requirement for EPA andDHA should be about 200 mg per day. 80 Keep in mind that sh oil has anticoagulation effects that may act synergistically with medica-tions like warfarin, and therefore caution shouldbe exercised in supplementing with sh oil inpeople who are taking these medications. 81 Lipid-lowering medication was found to decreasebenecial omega-3 fatty acids and increase path-ogenic arachidonic acid after only three monthsof use, leading the authors to conclude that thesemedications should be combined with diets lowin arachidonic acid and high in omega-3 fatty acid. 82Fish consumption not only improves lab- oratory values but also decreases evidence of car-diovascular disease at the blood vessel level interms of stenosis and other markers of atheroscle-rosis in postmenopausal women who consumedtwo or more servings of sh per week. 83 Fiber. Increasing the ber in the diet is another vitally important nutritional habit toacquire. Fiber sources that form a gel such as psyl-lium seed or oat bran bind bile and cholesterol inthe intestines and promote their excretion. Thisaction improves the cholesterol by decreasing LDLlevels while increasing HDL levels. 84A diet high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes isthe optimal high-ber diet. Soluble bers such aspectin or oat bran have the most consistent bene-cial effects on cholesterol levels. 85Most studies on ber have shown rather impressive lipid reduc-tions, with the higher the initial cholesterol, thegreater the benet. One of the ways ber helps tolower cholesterol is to increase the rate at whichfood passes through the digestive tract, therebyincreasing the loss of cholesterol in the stool. Areview of 20 scientic trials on the effect of oatproducts on cholesterol demonstrates that amodest reduction in blood cholesterol can beachieved by eating oat products daily. 86Eating one bowl of oat bran cereal or oatmeal daily (3 gramsof oat ber) lowers the total cholesterol by 8 to 23percent. These results have been achieved in aslittle as three weeks. A more recent study showed that dietary ber intake is inversely correlated with several cardio-vascular disease risk factors. The highest totaldietary ber and nonsoluble dietary ber (morethan soluble) intakes from fruit, vegetables, andcereals were signicantly associated with adecrease in a number of cardiovascular risk factors including overweight, hypertension, lipidmarkers, and homocysteine. 87Part of ber's effect on lipids is because these higher ber diets are in fact diets low in cholesterol intake. 88Five Omega-6 and Omega-3 Fatty Acids to Remember LA:Linoleic acid. An omega-6 fatty acid found in vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds. Given the proper conditions, the body converts LA to GLA and eventually into prostaglandin 1. GLA:Gamma-linolenic acid. LA gets converted to GLA by enzymes in the body. Certain foods, habits, and events (saturated fat, partially hydrogenatedoils, stress, aging, drinking alcohol) disrupt this conversion so that only 5 to 10 percent of LA getsconverted to GLA. It may be better to get GLA directly from evening primrose oil, black currantoil, or borage oil supplements. ALA: Alpha-linolenic acid. This is an omega-3 fatty acid not commonly found in foods. Seven seed oilscontain some ALA, with flaxseed oil being the richest natural source. Through several biochemical steps, the body converts ALA to EPA and then toprostaglandin 3. EPA and DHA: Eicosapentaenoic acid and doca- These two omega-3 fatty acids arefound in cold-water sh oils. EPA is a buildingblock for the body to make prostaglandin 3; DHA is important for the brain, nervous system, and vision.121HEART DISEASE Another study found that soluble ber added simply as a breakfast bread source was found tosignicantly decrease blood pressure and triglyc-eride and cholesterol levels in diabetic patients. 89 Increased ber intake (more than 3 grams ofcereal ber daily or more than six servings ofwhole grains per week) is also associated withdecreased progression of coronary atherosclerosisin postmenopausal women. 90 A number of large, recent epidemiological studies published in medicine's most respectedjournals found that overall, increased intake ofdietary ber is associated with decreased cardiovas-cular disease in adults 91, 92 and menopausal women.93, 94 Another study looked at the combi- nation of 10 mg of simvastatin and 15 grams ofpsyllium (Metamucil) and found that the combi-nation decreased LDL cholesterol better than thesame dose of medication alone and found reduc-tions comparable to 20 mg of simvastatin afterfour to eight weeks of treatment without signi-cant changes in HDL or triglycerides. 95One study of a very low saturated fat diet plus a cholesterol-lowering drug, compared to a diet high in plantsterols, including soy foods and high-ber wholegrains, concluded that dietary intervention may beas effective as the medication. 96Continuing to eat a diet higher in ber as we age also provides car-dioprotection. A large study found that increasingber later in life can decrease risk of cardiovasculardisease in the elderly. 97 Research has also shown that the sugars in fruit (fructose) signicantly raise blood triglyc-eride and cholesterol levels. If your triglyceridesare above 150 mg/dL, or if you have additionalsignicant risk factors for heart disease such aselevated blood pressure or diabetes, avoid toomuch fruit, fruit juice, and other simple sugars.Limit them to one serving per day. Sugar can beeaten in small amounts only if your triglyceridelevel is below 150 mg/dl. All sugars can increasetriglycerides, but a high amount of fructose, esp-cially fructose added as a sweetener, is actuallymore damaging than sucrose and glucose. It getseven worse if you eat high-fructose corn syrup, a very common sweetener used in packaged foods.Fructose increases LDL and does not improveHDL. A recent study showed that foods with ahigh glycemic index have a negative effect onHDL levels. 98 If you have elevated triglycerides, you can eat all the whole grains that you want, althoughsome diets, such as the popular Zone diet, pres-ent some provocative, controversial ideas thatmay be contrary to this. One of the best ways to achieve a high-ber and low-fat diet is the vegan diet. This is a vege-tarian diet in which absolutely no animal prod-ucts are consumed. Strict vegan diets, which aretypically very low in saturated fat and dietarycholesterol and high in ber, can help maintainor achieve desirable blood levels by especiallylowering the total cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol. 99 Specic fruits or vegetables may also have a par- ticular positive effect on serum lipids. Raw carrotsmay have a more potent effect on lowering choles-terol than do oat products. Eating a raw carrot atbreakfast every day for three weeks has been shownto reduce serum cholesterol by 11 percent andincrease fat excretion by 50 percent. 100 Evidence also exists demonstrating that people with a low intake of fruits and vegetableshave an increased risk for heart disease. 101 Numerous studies have continued to show that adiet high in carotenes and flavonoids found infruits and vegetables reduces the risk of heart dis-ease and strokes. 102It is thought that the antiox- idants (C, E, carotenes, and flavonoids) found infruits and vegetables reduce the risk of cardiovas-cular disease by scavenging free radical species.The antioxidants protect the unsaturated fattyacids from peroxidation, thus preventing athero-sclerosis. Lipid peroxide concentrations are infact higher in individuals with atherosclerosis. 103 Good dietary sources of carotenes as well as vita-mins C and E are green leafy vegetables, yellow-orange fruits and vegetables, red and purple122WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE fruits and vegetables, legumes, grains, and seeds. Good dietary sources of flavonoids are citrusfruits, berries, onions, parsley, legumes, green tea,and red wine. Soy. Soy foods contain a group of non- steroidal plant chemicals called phytoestrogens.These compounds are similar in their chemicalstructure to estradiol, and to equol, a phytoestro-gen metabolite, but they are and highest in soybeans.These isoflavones are associated with the proteinpart of the soybeans and are not found in soy oilsor soy lecithin. One potential dietary influence for a choles- terol-lowering strategy is to consume more soyprotein. This is perhaps my favorite recommenda-tion to women because soy also offers many otherpotential benets, including mild reduction ofmenopausal symptoms and potentially reductionin the risk of breast cancer and uterine cancer.Observations in large Asian populations, whosediet includes soybeans as a basic food group, showa lower incidence of CVD than in populationswho consume a traditional Western diet. 104 Much research has been done on soy and its relationship to blood pressure, cholesterol, andeven some inflammatory biomarkers of cardio-vascular disease. In general, the studies are varied,with some showing clear benet and some notshowing any. Perhaps the best evidence comesfrom a review of 38 scientic studies. This meta-analysis concluded that consumption of soy pro-tein rather than animal protein signicantlydecreased serum concentrations of total choles-terol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. 105 The use of soy for menopausal symptoms and heart disease protection continues to receivegreat interest from women, practitioners, and sci-entists. Most recently, a large meta-analysis ofstudies published from 1966 to 2005 found that soy protein intake was signicantly related todecreased total and LDL cholesterol and trigly-cerides and increased HDL. 106Other studies of pre- and postmenopausal women found that soyis benecial for improving lipid parameters, 107, 108 with even more favorable effects in type 2 diabetic women with hyperlipidemia, 109decreas- ing lipid peroxidation with statins to achieve favorable cholesterol levels.113 New research states consuming 25 grams of soyprotein (containing 50 mg of isoflavonoids) dailyfor ve weeks may decrease systolic blood pres-sure by nearly 6 percent. 114 There are many other positive soy studies, too numerous to list here, but to be fair, let's talkabout those soy studies that have not showed lipid-lowering effects. A recent study looked at daily soyconsumption in the form of a 50-mg isoflavone barand found no signicant change in lipids, exceptan increase in HDL, when consumed for eightweeks. The isoflavone-enriched bar did improve C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflamma-tion that mediates the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque lesions, but had no sig-nicant effect on other plasma inflammatorymarkers. 115A controlled trial of 202 healthy post- menopausal women aged 60 to 75 concluded thatthe use of a soy protein supplement containingisoflavones did not improve plasma lipids whenstarted at age 60 or older. 116A 2006 review article concluded that the evidence for soy lowering cholesterol was not overwhelmingly impressive. 117 Interestingly, when soy intake (30 grams of soy, including 4 grams of phytosterols) was stud-ied in the setting of a low glycemic index diet (a diet that does not raise blood sugar levelsquickly), it demonstrated more improvement inlipid parameters than the standard AmericanHeart Association Diet. 118It may in fact be that soy is most effective as part of an overall healthydiet and lifestyle plan. Substituting soy protein123HEART DISEASE for animal protein increases the variety of nutri- ent intake and adds ber, monounsaturated fats,minerals, and antioxidants while avoiding thesaturated fats found in animal protein. Otherstudies have found that supplementing the dietwith a soy protein and soy ber lowers LDL andtotal cholesterol 119and that eating any legumes, including soy, at least four times per week canlower the risk of cardiovascular disease. 120 Despite the lack of effect in some studies on soy and lipids, when we look at the role of soyin other aspects important to women's health\u2014reducing the incidence and severity of hotflashes, loss of bone mass, vaginal dryness, andfemale-related cancers\u2014the most convincingeffects of soy are in fact in the area of its actionon lipids. The North American Menopause Soci-ety seems to agree with this perspective in a 2000consensus opinion. 121 With many good reasons for women to eat soy, blood pressure may be another area of bene-t. New research states that consuming about 25grams per day of soy protein can decrease bloodpressure. 114, 122-124 Good Carbs, Bad Carbs. It seems we all love carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates, such asfound in brown rice, whole wheat, rye, oats,barley, millet, whole fruits, and vegetables arehigh in both ber and vitamin content and there-fore the preferred form of carbohydrates. Renedcarbohydrates, on the other hand, must be placedin the group of unhealthy foods. Sugar, a renedcarbohydrate, is a signicant factor in the devel-opment of atherosclerosis. 125 High-sugar diets lead to elevations in trigly- cerides and cholesterol and also to an increase ininsulin production. Elevations in insulin levelsare associated with risk of cardiovascular diseaseby increasing cholesterol, triglycerides, and bloodpressure. The prudent woman would decrease allsources of rened sugar in the diet by avoidingcandies, pastries, and desserts; she would alsoavoid sweetened cereals, white breads, or anyfood containing rened carbohydrates. Decreas- ing the total carbohydrate intake in favor ofincreased protein may be advisable as well. Arecent study of women found that weight loss ofas little as 5 percent with a plan that includeddecreased carbohydrates and increased exerciselead to a decrease in the ability of LDL choles-terol to cause atherosclerosis. 126Of course, this would presume the carbohydrates left in the dietto be complex and not rened. If your triglycerides are above 150 mg/dL, or if you have additional signicant risk factors for heartdisease such as elevated blood pressure or diabetes,limit fruit, fruit juice, and other simple sugars toone serving per day. Sugar can be eaten in smallamounts only if your triglyceride level is below 150mg/dl. All sugars can increase triglycerides, butfructose is actually more damaging than sucroseand glucose. It gets even worse if you eat high-fruc-tose corn syrup, a very common sweetener used inpackaged foods. Fructose increases LDL and doesnot improve HDL. A recent study showed thatfoods with a high glycemic index have a negativeeffect on HDL levels. 98 Foods with a high glycemic index are those foods that raise blood sugar levels quickly. Thesefoods include items such as white bread, renedcereals, white rice, and white flour pasta. Thesefoods greatly stress blood sugar control and cause arapid rise in blood sugar. In response, the bodysecretes insulin from the pancreas. Over time, toomuch insulin is secreted, called hyperinsulinemia,and the body tissues become resistant to theinsulin. These two consequences of a high glycemicindex diet can promote the growth of cancer andincrease the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Reading labels on packaged foods is a good strategy for reducing intake of rened sugars. Anylabel that says sucrose, glucose, maltose, lactose,fructose, sugar, corn syrup, or white grape juiceconcentrate is a source of added dietary sugar. Salt. With all this talk of lowering cholesterol and improving the cholesterol ratios, it is easy to124WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE forget how important it is to balance the blood pressure and how foods may have a positive or anegative effect on this. For example, a diet low inpotassium and high in sodium is associated withhigh blood pressure. By contrast, a diet high inpotassium and low in sodium can protect againstelevation of blood pressure. 127, 128 It has become common knowledge that too much salt in ourdiet may contribute to high blood pressure. Notso commonly known is that high blood pressureis also related to too little potassium in our diet.In fact, restricting salt alone may not be enoughto lower the blood pressure. Potassium must beincreased. Most Americans ingest twice as muchsodium as potassium. Nutrition researchers rec-ommend a 5:1 potassium-to-sodium ratio that iseasily accomplished by a diet high in fresh fruitsand vegetables, which are rich in potassium. Dietary recommendations in the treatment of hypertension were evaluated by the federalgovernment in the Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension (DASH) studies. The DASH dietis high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairyfoods and low in saturated and total fats. It isalso low in cholesterol but high in ber, potas-sium, calcium, and magnesium. The DASHdiet, along with a sodium intake of less than2,400 mg per day, results in signicantly lowerblood pressures\u2014systolic pressure that is 7points lower in patients without hypertensionand 11.5 points lower in those with hyperten-sion. 129The characteristics of the DASH diet are described in Table 9.3. Caffeine. The peer pressure to become a coffee drinker is no greater than the conflictingevidence around the health impact of coffee.Some studies say it raises cholesterol; some donot. Some say caffeinated coffee is the problembut decaffeinated is not; others show no differ-ence between the two. There is no one consistentanswer on the effect of coffee on heart disease.What does seem to be true is that caffeinatedcoffee drinkers also drink more alcohol, consumemore dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, are more likely to be smokers, and are less likely tobe current exercisers. 130 I encourage all my patients to decrease their coffee intake to not more than one regular coffeedrink per day. Using any stimulant to falsely raiseenergy and obscure the fact that we are tired orstressed or just plain doing too much in our livesdoes not seem consistent with respecting ourbodies' normal rhythms. For women who haveelevated cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, orgenerally higher risks for heart disease, thenumber of studies that do show a connectionbetween coffee and hyperlipidemia, hyperten-sion, and coronary heart disease seem to deliveran obvious message: just say no. In hypertensive individuals, the use of caf- feinated beverages is questionable. T wo studiesshowed slight elevations in blood pressure or apotentiation of the stress-related rise in bloodpressure in hypertension-prone males. In a thirdstudy, caffeine (75 mg per day) had no effect onthe blood pressure of young, healthy subjects. 131 In a recent study, caffeine consumption was notfound to be related to the incidence of hyperten-sion but consumption of cola was. 132 Caffeine also appears to have adverse effects on serum lipid proles. In men, coffee intakeinduced higher levels of cholesterol. 133, 134 More- over, when men with elevated cholesterol levelsrefrained from coffee for ve weeks, their serumcholesterol dropped by 10 percent. Those whocontinued to abstain from coffee showed a 13percent average drop at ten weeks, and those whoreturned to coffee gradually reached prestudylevels of total cholesterol. 135In women, choles- terol levels increased with increasing amounts ofcoffee with a low of 214 mg/dL at one-half toone cup per day and a high of 234 mg/dL at fourcups per day. 136Almost all of the difference was due to an increase in low-density lipoproteincholesterol. Cholesterol was not affected bydecaffeinated coffee in this study.125HEART DISEASE Table 9.3 The DASH Diet\u2014Basic Components (2,000 calories per day) Food Daily Serving Signicance Group Servings Sizes Examples of Food Grains and 7-8 1 slice bread Whole wheat bread, Sources of energy grain products12cup dry cereal whole-grain cereal, and ber 12cup cooked rice, oats, grits pasta, or cereal Vegetables 4-5 1 cup raw leafy Tomatoes, potatoes, Sources of vegetables carrots, peas, squash, potassium, 12cup cooked broccoli, turnip greens, magnesium, vegetables collards, kale, spinach, ber, flavonoids, 6 oz veggie juice artichokes, beans, antioxidants sweet potatoes Fruits 4-5 6 oz fruit juice Apricots, bananas, Sources 1 medium fruit dates, oranges or juice, of potassium, 12cup dried fruit grapefruit or juice, magnesium, ber, 12cup fresh, frozen, mangoes, melons, flavonoids, or antioxidants prunes, rasisins, strawberries, milk Skim or 1% milk; Sources of nonfat 1 cup yogurt nonfat or low-fat calcium, proteindairy foods 1.5 oz cheese yogurt, buttermilk, and cheese; part-skim mozzarella cheese Meat, including 2 or 3 oz cooked meat, Select lean; trim away Sources of poultry and sh fewer poultry, or sh visible fats; broil, roast, protein and or boil instead of frying; magnesiumremove skin from poultry Nuts, seeds, 4-5 1.5 oz or 13cup nuts Almonds, lberts, Sources of energy, legumes per12oz or 2 tbs seeds mixed nuts, peanuts, protein, ber, week12cup cooked walnuts, sunflower magnesium, protein legumes seeds, kidney beans, lentils There are multiple reasons that coffee has this effect on serum cholesterol. Unltered coffee inparticular 137, 138 increases coronary artery disease risk and mortality in men and women.138, 139 This effect is possibly explained by the presenceof the diterpines (removed by ltering), cafestol,and possibly kahweol in unltered coffee. Another explanation came to light in a recentlypublished Norwegian study 140that indicated a dose-response between coffee consumption andblood homocysteine levels: larger the coffeeintake, the greater the homocysteine levels.126WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Homocysteine is formed during the breakdown of certain amino acids and is known to increasethe risk of heart disease when it accumulates inthe blood. Alcohol. Many sweeping statements have been made about the benets of alcohol in preventingheart disease. If we look at the connections be-tween heart disease and alcohol more closely, wend that these general statements are in fact para-doxical and can be misleading. Heavy use of alco-hol causes damage to the heart muscle and is alsorelated to high blood pressure, strokes, and ar-rhythmias (irregular heartbeats). On the otherhand, people who abstain from alcohol, whencompared to those who drink, are at greater risk ofmajor heart disease events such as heart attacks. Tounderstand the alcohol-heart connection, it is im-portant to distinguish between light, moderate, orheavy alcohol use. A working denition is helpful:Heavy use is three or more drinks per day. One totwo drinks per day is low to moderate, and lightwould be something less than one daily drink. There is now strong evidence that light to moderate alcohol consumption protects againstheart disease. Low to moderate alcohol intake,one drink per day, may reduce the risk of cardio-vascular disease. 141In the Nurse's Health Study, one drink per day reduced the risk of heart dis-ease by 40 percent. 141, 142 Another study reported that women who had one drink per day had a 30to 40 percent lower risk of all cardiovascular diseases as well as a lower death rate than heavydrinkers and very light drinkers. 143And more recently, consumption of 15 grams (one drink) to30 grams (two drinks) of alcohol per day by post-menopausal women was shown to improve lipidproles and therefore decreased their cardiovas-cular disease risk. 144Alcohol tends to raise HDL cholesterol, which likely contributes to its cardio-protectiveness. Alcohol also has a benecial effecton decreasing blood clotting. It is not clear whether there are any signi- cant differences between red wine, white wine,liquor, and beer. However, researchers have observed the \"French paradox\": in France, satu-rated fat intake and mean cholesterol levels arehigh, but heart disease mortality is low. Widepublicity about this paradox has asserted that red wine consumption in France is high and isresponsible for the unexpected results. As a con-sequence, a general perception exists that redwine is especially benecial. Nonalcoholic ingre-dients in the red wine may in fact be responsiblefor this benet, including antioxidants and flavo-noids, namely the antioxidants in red grapes thatprevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. Alcohol ingestion, however, harbors potential dangers that may outweigh its alleged benets. In my opinion, daily ingestion of alcohol cannot be responsibly recommended to women. Well-documented evidence indicates that alcohol mayincrease serum estradiol by 300 percent in post-menopausal women who take hormone replace-ment. 145Alcohol also increases the cirrhosis, gastritis, degen- erative nervous system abuse, and cancers of the mouth, phar-ynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver. 151These, and the harmful cardiovascular consequences of heavydrinking, add up to considerable increase in diseaseand death. From a medical perspective, all heavy drinkers should reduce their intake. It is myopinion that moderate drinkers should alsoreduce to light intake, and in individual cases,abstinence (those with breast cancer, those with ahistory of substance abuse, possibly those takinghormone replacement therapy, and maybeothers). Daily alcohol probably does not belongin a healthful life. Stick to the occasional celebra-tions, and utilize other methods of reducing yourrisk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate. It has been hypothesized for some time that chocolate can reduce the risk ofcardiovascular disease. High levels of antioxi-127HEART DISEASE dants, including stearic acid and flavonoids called procyanidins, catechins, and epicatechins,are found not only in chocolate but also in tea,red wine, and various fruits and vegetables.Cocoa is particularly rich in these flavonoids. It isthought that the flavonoids reduce leukotrienes,potent vasoconstrictors, and contain prostacy-clins that vasodilate and inhibit blood stickiness. This benet is only found in dark chocolate, however. Milk chocolate binds to the antioxi-dants in chocolate and makes them unavailable.It is also higher in fat content. Dark chocolate,with 70 percent cocoa or more, also known asbittersweet or semisweet chocolate, contains littleor no added sugar and is made from cocoa butter,which has a neutral or even benecial effect oncholesterol. Dark chocolate is also made withoutthe use of hydrogenated or partially hydro-genated oils, which have a negative impact oncholesterol. Dark chocolate decreases LDL cholesterol oxi- dation, reduces the risk of blood clots, increasesblood flow in arteries, and may even lower bloodpressure. It may or may not have a benecial effecton cholesterol levels. According to laboratoryexperiments and randomized trials, the suggestionis that the flavonoids in chocolate are likely protec-tive against death from cardiovascular disease. 152It is thought that eating 50 grams (about one two-ounce bar) of dark chocolate per day may reduceone's risk of CVD by 10.5 percent. 153 Heart-Healthy Diets. There are a number of diet recommendations that utilize nutritionalbenets to improve and maintain cardiovascularhealth. The following are some of the mostrespected, well-known, and effective cardiovascu-lar diets. The Step 1 and Step 2 Cholesterol-Lowering Diets. The Step 1 and Step 2 diets were created by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Association'sNational Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)and have been endorsed by the American HeartAssociation (AHA). These diets were designed toreduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by focusing on reducing elevated cholesterol levels. The Step 1 diet advises to reduce total fat intake to less than 30 percent of daily calories,with 8 to 10 percent of calories coming from sat-urated fats. Polyunsaturated fats should compriseless than 10 percent of daily calories. Monoun-saturated fats (olive oil, avocados, soy) should belimited to less than 15 percent of total calories.The intake of cholesterol should be less than 300mg per day. Protein should be about 15 percentof total calories, and total calorie intake shouldbe determined based on what amount wouldhelp to maintain normal body weight. The stricter Step 2 diet requires greater disci- pline and perhaps the guidance of a dietician/nutritionist. Step 2 differs from Step 1 in that lessthan 7 percent of daily calories comes from satu-rated fats and cholesterol intake is limited to lessthan 200 mg. If you have a diet that differs from the Step 1 diet, and you have hyperlipidemia, then startwith this diet. If you are already following theStep 1 diet, or a similar diet, and your cholesterolis still abnormal, especially an elevated LDL,then you should start the Step 2 diet. In eithercase, a lipid panel test should be done after threemonths of the diet. In general, a Step 1 diet typically reduces the total cholesterol by 5 to 7 percent. The Step 2 diettypically drops the level of LDL another 3 to 7 per-cent. The dietary changes, along with an exerciseprogram designed to reduce weight, should be donein women who are overweight. Even a small weightloss of 5 to 10 pounds has been associated with agreater reduction in LDL cholesterol than just theStep 1 diet and no weight loss. Weight loss alsoresults in raising HDL-cholesterol levels, loweringtriglycerides levels, and lowering blood pressure. 154 The TLC Diet. In 2001, the National Choles- terol Education Program released new guidelinesfor the management of cholesterol in the \"ThirdReport of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evalu-128WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ation, and T reatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, Adult T reatment Panel III (ATP).\" TheAmerican Heart Association has adopted theNCEP III guidelines, calling for more intensivelife-habit interventions to lower cholesterol andreduce the risk for heart disease and of heartattacks. They call this the Therapeutic LifestyleChanges (TLC) diet. Its target is to lower LDLcholesterol. See the following sidebar for the rec-ommendations of the TLC diet. AHA Recommendations. The American Heart Association dietary recommendations are designedto reduce high cholesterol, high blood pressure,and excess weight. These are the dietary guidelines: Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. Choose ve or more servings per day. Eat a variety of grain products, including whole grains. Choose six or more servingsper day. Include fat-free and low-fat milk products, sh, legumes (beans), skinless poultry, andlean meats. Choose fats with 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving, such as liquid and tub mar-garines, canola oil, and olive oil. Balance the number of calories you eat with the number you use each day. (To nd thatnumber, multiply the number of poundsyou weigh now by 15 calories. This repre-sents the average number of calories used inone day if you're moderately active. If youget very little exercise, multiply your weightby 13 instead of 15. Less-active people burnfewer calories.) Maintain a level of physical activity that keeps you t and matches the number ofcalories you eat. Walk or do other activitiesfor at least 30 minutes on most days. To loseweight, do enough activity to use up morecalories than you eat every day. Limit your intake of foods high in calories or low in nutrition, including foods like softdrinks and candy that have a lot of sugars. Limit foods high in saturated fat, trans fat, and/or cholesterol, such as full-fat milkproducts, fatty meats, tropical oils, partiallyhydrogenated vegetable oils, and egg yolks.Instead choose foods low in saturated fat,trans fat, and cholesterol. Eat less than 6 grams of salt per day (2,400 mg of sodium).Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) Diet Limits for LDL-Raising Nutrients Saturated fats Less than 7% of total calories Trans fats Minimal or none Dietary cholesterol Less than 200 mg per day Therapeutic Options for Lowering LDL Plant stanols/sterols 2 g per day Soluble ber 10-25 g per dayTotal calories Adjust total calorie intake to maintain desirable body weight Physical activity Include enough moderate exercise to expend at least 200 calories per day Recommendations for Nutrient Intake Percentage of Nutrient Total Calories Total fat 25-35%* Saturated fat Less than 7%Polyunsaturated fat Up to 10% Monounsaturated fat Up to 20% Carbohydrates** 50-60%Protein Approximately 15% (including soy protein) *Range of percentages for total fat allows for increased intake of unsaturated fat in place of carbohydrates in peoplewith metabolic syndrome or diabetes.**Carbohydrates should be mainly from foods rich in complexcarbohydrates and ber, including whole grains, legumes,fruits, and vegetables.129HEART DISEASE Have no more than one alcoholic drink per day. Not all low-fat diets have provided cardiovas- cular prevention. In the Women's Health Initiativedietary modication trial, 48,835 postmenopausalwomen aged 50 to 79 years were randomlyassigned to an intervention of intensive behaviormodication to reduce total fat intake to 20 per-cent of calories and increase intakes of vegetablesand fruits to ve servings per day and grains to atleast six servings per day. 155After an average of 8.1 years, this diet did not signicantly reduce the riskof CAD, stroke, or CVD in postmenopausalwomen and achieved very modest effects on CVDrisk factors. What this tells me is that an evenmore rigorous diet and lifestyle changes need to beachieved in order to improve risk factors andreduce CVD risk. The Mediterranean Diet. The Mediterranean diet, perhaps one of the healthiest diets in theworld, emphasizes increased ber, olive oil, fruits,vegetables, grains, and legumes and decreasedrened cereals, meat products, eggs, and saturatedfats. This diet has been shown to have a benecialeffect on cardiovascular health in a number oflarge studies. 156The Mediterranean diet has also been shown to have benecial effects on risk fac-tors for cardiovascular disease and may evenexceed that of the low-fat diet. Compared with alow-fat diet, three months on a Mediterraneandiet that included olive oil (one liter per week) orpackets of walnuts, hazelnuts, and almondsdecreased cardiovascular risk factors. 157Both of these diets were associated with signicant reduc-tions in blood pressure, lower fasting glucoselevels, lower insulin levels in those without dia-betes, lower triglycerides, increased HDL-C, andlower C-reactive protein levels. Ornish Lifestyle Modication Program. The low-fat diet has been promoted by Dr. DeanOrnish since the publication of his bestsellingbook Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for ReversingHeart Disease . What is now known as the Ornish Lifestyle Modication Program is based on thefollowing four components: 1. A very low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,beans, and legumes 2. Regular exercise3. Stress management4. Family/community support systems to maintain healthy behavior The main focus is a plant food-based diet containing whole fruits and vegetables, wholegrains (brown rice, whole wheat breads, whole-grain cereals, whole wheat pasta), dried beansand legumes, soy products, lean poultry, sh, eggwhites, and nonfat dairy. Plant oils are to be usedonly lightly, and red meat, butter, and animal fatsare to be avoided, as are processed foods, high-fatfoods, sweets, and caffeinated drinks. Alcoholand salt are to be consumed in moderation. TheOrnish Lifestyle Modication Program claims topromote weight loss, improve cardiovascularhealth, help to regulate blood sugar and insulin,and lower cholesterol levels. Whether it is the TLC diet, the Step 1 or Step 2 diet, the Mediterranean diet, or the Ornishdiet, they all offer a great step toward reducingthe risk of heart disease. One might be moresuited to you over the other. Consider readingmore about each, experimenting, or speakingwith your health-care practitioner and/or a qual-ied nutritionist to determine which approach isbest for you. Nutritional Supplements Although dietary changes alone can have a pow- erful effect in reducing the incidence of heart disease, they may not be enough for everyone.Lowering cholesterol, lowering blood pressure,inhibiting blood clots, preventing oxidativedamage to the vessel walls, and several othermechanisms are all effects that can be achievedwith the therapeutic use of nutritional/herbal130WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE supplements. This is an exciting and successful area for alternative medicine to make an impacton a large segment of the population. Given thatheart disease is the number-one cause of death inmen and women in America, these conceptsdeserve the attention and respect of individualsand practitioners of all disciplines and all schoolsof thought. Antioxidant Combinations. Combination nutritional supplements are difcult to evaluatebecause of the multi-ingredient combinations andthe different doses of each single ingredient fromone product to another. Numerous observationalstudies have, however, evaluated the effect ofantioxidant combinations on cardiovascularevents. 158-161 In one study, vitamins C and E reduced coronary death and death due to all causesin elderly patients. 158In another, an antioxidant supplement signicantly lowered risk for myocar-dial infarction (heart attack) in men and womenover 55. 159A Finnish study showed no signicant effect of an antioxidant supplement on death dueto coronary artery events; 161however, only 3 per- cent of the people actually used an antioxidant sup-plement. In the very large U.S. observational studyof more than 1 million men and women, 160there were modest reductions in CVD deaths amongwomen using antioxidants supplements who hadno previous history of CVD. Prevention trials with antioxidant combina- tions have unfortunately not produced hoped-forresults. In the Heart Protection Study, a combina-tion of vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-caroteneappeared to cause no difference in either deathrates due to any cause, heart disease-relateddeaths, heart disease events, or vascular events ofany kind. 162Other quality studies of an antioxi- dant supplement for secondary prevention ofCVD (people who already had evidence of heartdisease or had a previous cardiac event) showed nosignicant effects on the rate of return of narrow-ing of a coronary artery, the rate of restenosis (areturn of narrowing of the coronary artery aftersurgery), or the rate of cardiovascular events three years later. 163-165 Major clinical trials of antioxidant use for the primary (initial) prevention of CVD are cur-rently underway and include tens of thousands ofparticipants. In the near future, with an adequateamount of high-quality scientic data, we hopeto gain greater clarity as to the impact of antiox-idant combination products and multivitamincombinations on cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E. In the past, I went so far as to say that of all the vitamins or minerals, vitamin E mayoffer the greatest protection for women againstheart disease because of its ability to be easilyincorporated into the LDL-cholesterol moleculeand prevent free radical damage and, as a result,prevent atherosclerosis and CAD. 166A number of clinical trials have shown that vitamin E supple-mentation (alone or in combination with otherantioxidants) leads to increased resistance of LDLto oxidative damage. 167, 168 Doses between 500 and 1,500 IU have shown signicant reduction inLDL oxidation. 169Women who took vitamin E supplements for more than two years had abouthalf the risk of CVD. 170A recent study evaluating childhood and adulthood dietary intake of vita-min E found that people who consumed the mostvitamin E in their diet had a decreased risk ofhypertension. 171 The New England Journal of Medicine pub- lished a report showing that women who took atleast 100 IU of vitamin E per day for several yearshad 40 percent decreased likelihood of having a coronary event when compared with non-vitamin E users. 172Continued research has now demonstrated that doses between 400 and 800IU per day dramatically reduce the risk of nonfa-tal heart attacks, but do not reduce the numberof deaths from CAD. 173Doses of 400 to 1,000 IU per day provide additional cardiovascularbenet by inhibiting platelet and stimulating thebreakdown of brin (a clot-forming protein).131HEART DISEASE Levels of vitamin E in the blood may be more directly related to the development of a heartattack or stroke than are total cholesterol levels.Whereas high blood pressure was predictive of aheart attack 25 percent of the time, and highcholesterol 29 percent of the time, low bloodlevels of vitamin E was predictive almost 70 per-cent of the time. 174 There are, though, negative studies on vita- min E's effect in cardiovascular disease. Althoughvitamin E was shown in animal studies to be benecial for hypertension, 175, 176 a human trial found that relatively modest doses, 500 IUmixed tocopherols per day for six weeks, led toan increase in blood pressure and heart rate indiabetic patients. 177A very large study, called the HOPE trial, had a signicant influence in dimin-ishing the role of vitamin E for cardioprotectionin the minds of many consumers and practition-ers. In women and men, 55 years of age or older,who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease,treatment with 400 IU vitamin E per day for anaverage of 4.5 years had no apparent effect oncardiovascular outcomes. 178The HOPE-TOO trial was extended for another four years andstudied men and women at least 55 years oldwho had vascular disease or diabetes. 179Again, there were no differences in the main cardiovas-cular outcome between those who took vitaminE and those who took the placebo. In essence,there was no signicant effect of vitamin E onmyocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascu-lar death, unstable angina, or total death rate. Infact, investigators observed an increase in heartfailure rates in patients assigned to the vitamin E.It is not known whether this was due to chanceor whether the alpha-tocopherol form of vitaminE became a pro-oxidant in these patients withsignicant disease. One of the most damaging reports on vita- min E was a meta-analysis on high-dosage vita-min E that compiled the results of 19 studiesfrom 1966 through August 2004 to concludethat large doses of vitamin E (400 IU per day ormore) may increase death rates, at least in those people with chronic illnesses. 180It is important to point out that this type of analysis has seriousflaws. To summarize an insightful commentarywritten by a well-known clinician, Allan Gaby,M.D., for the Emerson Ecologics website (emersonecologics.com), in these different studies,patients were randomly assigned to take vitaminE, in doses ranging from 16.5 to 2,000 IU perday, or a placebo for at least one year. Most of thepatients had one or more chronic diseases includ-ing heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease, or kidney failure. Otherswere at high risk of developing heart disease.When all 19 studies were combined, the risk ofwhat is called all-cause mortality, or death due toany cause, did not differ signicantly betweenpeople assigned to vitamin E supplementationand those who were in the placebo group. Instudies using doses of vitamin E less than 400 IUper day, the vitamin E supplementation was associated with a small although not statisticallysignicant reduction in the death rate. In the 11studies using more than 400 IU per day, vitaminE supplementation increased the risk of death by4 percent. A number of other influences may have affected this small but statistically signicantincrease, including additional nutrient supple-mentation, serum cholesterol levels, and the highpercentage of participants with signicant healthproblems such as high blood pressure, diabetes,cigarette smoking, and severe coronary artery dis-ease. There may have also been a problem in thetype of vitamin E used. (There are four differenttypes of E: alpha-, beta-, themost effective as an antioxidant.) With these flaws, and in contrast to the large body of scientic evidence that shows the bene-ts of vitamin E in slowing the progression ofAlzheimer's disease, treating intermittent claudi-cation, brocystic breast disease, premenstrualsyndrome, osteoarthritis, and more, I continue132WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE to advise the use of vitamin E supplementation. While controversial, I am not willing to give up on the potential benets of vitamin E and cardioprotection. Vitamin E 400-1,000 IU per day Vitamin C. Vitamin C is probably not a major player in blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, or other influences on cardiovascular disease.However, vitamin C has a positive effect on thecardiovascular system and, along with folic acid and zinc, has been found to be low in theblood of hypertensive patients. 181Vitamin C protects LDL cholesterol from oxidation,182 raises HDL cholesterol, and lowers total choles-terol triglycerides. 183In one recent study, 500 mg of vitamin C for 10 weeks led to signicantdecreases in total cholesterol and apoB, a bio-marker for cardiovascular risk. 184But a combina- tion product that included 500 mg vitamin C,160 mg bioflavonoids, 600 mg magnesium, and900 mg vitamin B complex led to decreased clotformation in adults with hyperlipidemia. 185In a recent study, 36 IU vitamin E and 250 mg vita-min C two times per day dramatically decreasedatherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic patientsat both three and six years. 186Despite these encouraging results, a long-term study of 500 mgvitamin C daily did not signicantly affect anylipid measures except triglycerides in womenwho had high triglycerides. 187 Smokers may gain a particular advantage with vitamin C. Nicotine has been known toreduce blood vitamin C levels. An increasedintake of dietary vitamin C has been associatedwith decreased risk of cardiovascular disease insmokers, 188who are typically decient, and intake of vitamin C supplementation was associ-ated with decreased cardiovascular disease in a retrospective study of over 85,000 women.189 Recent long-term studies of vitamin C do not support its use in hypertension, however. A studyof 500 mg daily for over ve years was shown tohave no effect in a group of over 400 subjects. 190 Coenzyme Q10. CoQ10 can be used for high blood pressure control, atherosclerosis,angina, mitral valve prolapse, congestive heartfailure, and cardiomyopathy. protects against atherosclerosis by pre-venting the oxidation of LDL. In a recent study,150 mg CoQ10 in combination with the lipid-lowering medication fenobrate worked betterthan drug therapy alone in improving total cho-lesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. 191A large review study showed that CoQ10 adminis-tration led to decreases in systolic and diastolicblood pressure of 16 and 10 mmHg respec-tively. 192A study using 60 mg CoQ10 twice daily for 12 weeks led to an average decrease in systolicblood pressure readings of nearly 18 percent. 193 These ndings were similar to a previous studylooking at 60 mg CoQ10 twice daily for eightweeks in patients already receiving conventionalcardiovascular treatments. 194This study also found decreases in blood sugar, insulin, and tri-glycerides and increases in HDL. CoQ10 may becoadministered with conventional medication toincrease duration of antihypertensive effect up totwice as long. 195Other studies of up to 600 mg per day allowed patients to decrease the dose ordiscontinue the conventional medication whiledramatically improving cardiovascular function-ing 196, 197 and decreasing subsequent cardiovascu- lar events and mortality by nearly half in patientswith a prior history of MI. 198CoQ10 also works together with vitamin E in preventing damage tolipids and to the vessels. 199 It may be that CoQ10 can benet those women who choose to take HRT and are con-cerned about the potential for increased risk ofheart disease. A recent study showed that the Vitamin C 1,000 mg or more per day133HEART DISEASE common dose of Prempro led to a decrease in CoQ10 and vitamin E levels in the blood,thereby increasing menopausal cardiovascularrisk factors in women who use HRT. 200Use of statins to treat high cholesterol has been associ-ated with muscle pain and decreased exercise tol-erance that has been correlated with a reductionin CoQ10. 201-204 CoQ10 50-150 mg per day Calcium. Calcium is most well known for its effects on bone health, but it can also be usedto treat elevated cholesterol and hypertension.Calcium supplementation may produce modestreductions in blood pressure, usually only 1 or 2points. But in those whose blood pressure is verysensitive to salt intake or whose dietary intake ofcalcium is low, supplementation may be moreeffective. Calcium has been related to decreasesin systolic blood pressure, 205, 206 and an analysis of 40 well-controlled studies found that calciumlowers blood pressure measurements. 207Another large review of studies of calcium for hyperten-sion in pregnancy found that higher calciumintakes were correlated to decreased blood pres-sure, as well as resultant preeclampsia anddeath 208and that the combination of calcium and linoleic acid decreases pregnancy-inducedhypertension as well. 209, 210 Not all studies have shown benet, and a large review of three randomized controlled trials inves-tigating the combinations of magnesium, potas-sium, and calcium found no evidence that thesesupplements improved blood pressure or mortal-ity. 211Calcium probably has only a small role in lowering cholesterol, but a recent randomized con-trolled trial suggests that calcium may have a rolein decreasing cholesterol via its ability to improvethe function of bile in the liver, thereby increasingcholesterol excretion, 212and another study on 223 menopausal women showed that calcium supple-mentation did decrease cholesterol slightly andwith more signicant increases in HDL. 213Cal- cium carbonate 400 mg three times daily can reduce cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by about 4percent and increase HDL by 4 percent. 214 While reducing cholesterol and blood pres- sure may not be calcium's strong suits, the bene-ts to bone health, tooth retention, weight loss,PMS, and reduction in the risk of colorectalcancer make it one of our most important dietarynutrients and nutritional supplements. Calcium 400-1,200 mg per day calcium carbonate or other form Magnesium. Many scientists and health practitioners believe that magnesium is one ofthe most important nutrients for cardiovascularprotection and treatment. Drs. Burton and BellaAltura of NY Health Science Center have donesome of the most consistent research in magne-sium over the last 30 years. They, and others,assert that magnesium contributes to thestrength of contraction of heart muscle, 215 increases HDL levels,216inhibits platelet aggrega- tion and prolongs the clotting time,217-219 decreasing the risk of heart disease, strokes, for-mation of atherosclerotic plaque, and blood clotsthat can result in heart attack or stroke. At least 10 independent clinical studies show that patients with hypertension exhibit serumand/or tissue hypomagnesemia. On the average,patients with long-term hypertension have atleast a 15 percent decit in total magnesium. 220 A recent review of studies showed that supple-mentation with magnesium appears to modestlydecrease blood pressure, 221yet another large review showed no effect at all.222Magnesium may be more effective in decreasing blood pressure andimproving arterial function when combined withpotassium. 223Evidence from both animals and humans suggests that magnesium levels in dietand blood may affect blood lipids; the lower themagnesium intake, the higher the serum lipid134WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE levels. In addition, a recent study showed that supplementation of 600 mg daily for 12 weeksproduced improvements in all lipid parameters inboth type 1 and 2 diabetics. 224, 225 There is strong evidence suggesting a relationship betweenuncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes and mag-nesium deciency, 220thus magnesium deciency may predispose diabetic patients to an increasedincidence of cardiovascular disease and death. Magnesium also improves cardiac perform- ance by enhancing blood flow in the coronaryarteries. It also prevents oxidation of lipoproteinsand subsequent atherosclerosis. Magnesium mg per day in divided doses Niacin. Niacin (nicotinic acid) has been shown to favorably affect all lipids and lipoproteins, and itcan be used either alone or in combination withother lipid-lowering agents. 226We're not sure exactly how it works, although it likely inhibitsmobilization of free fatty acids from peripheral fattissue to the liver. As a result, niacin reduces hepaticsynthesis of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)and triglyceride levels. Because there is less VLDLavailable, LDL levels decrease. 227 The Coronary Drug Project was the rst trial to study the effect of niacin on cardiovascularendpoints. 228Niacin therapy in men with prior MI reduced the ve-year incidence of nonfatalreinfarction by 27 percent. In addition, after amean follow-up of 15 years all-cause mortalitywas 11 percent lower men com-pared with placebo-treated patients. 229 Niacin\u2014specically nicotinic acid\u2014may be used to reduce total cholesterol, TG, and LDLlevels and to raise HDL values. It is currently thebest treatment to raise HDL levels, 227and it can reduce the risk of nonfatal MI.230Niacin lowers LDL levels by about 5 to 25 percent, TG by 20 to50 percent, lipoprotein(a) by 34 percent, 231and the total cholesterol/HDL ratio by 27 percent226while increasing HDL levels by 15 to 35 percent.232Niacin has been compared to several conven- tional pharmaceutical drugs used to reduce choles-terol levels. A study published in 1994 comparedniacin and lovastatin over a period of 26 weeks in136 patients who were at high risk for coronaryheart disease. 233Lovastatin produced a greater effect on reducing LDL cholesterol, but niacin pro-vided better overall results. Niacin far exceededlovastatin in increasing HDL cholesterol, which isa more signicant indicator in reducing the risk forheart disease, and some estimates suggest that itcan raise HDL by as much as 35 percent. 234Niacin has also been found to decrease inflammatorymarkers like C-reactive protein 235and increase adiponectin, a hormone that not only decreasesatherosclerosis but improves glucose tolerance,body mass index, and fatty liver disease. 236, 237 In a study of patients with previous history of heartattack, niacin was found to decrease the risk ofrepeat MI and death in patients with and withoutmetabolic syndrome. 238 Conventional practitioners and alternative practitioners alike acknowledge that severalgrams of niacin per day will lower total choles-terol and LDL cholesterol, raise HDL, 239and decrease atherosclerosis both alone and whenused with conventional treatments like statins.The niacin and statins seem to act synergisticallyto improve lipid parameters at lower doses, in ashorter amount of time, and more effectivelythan when either is used alone. 240-242 The major problem with the therapeutic dosage (1.5 to 3 grams per day) has to do withside effects. Flushing responses are common.Anecdotally, some clinicians decrease the effectsof niacin's flushing by having the patient startwith a low dose, like 500 mg per day, increasingthe dose weekly to achieve the desired dose, andtaking the dose before bed or coadministeringwith 81 mg baby aspirin. More seriously, liverfunction ndings can become abnormal, andindividuals with liver disease Immediate-release niacin is recom-mended, as sustained-release niacin has been135HEART DISEASE associated with severe liver toxicity in doses of more than 2 grams per day. Niacin can also exac-erbate elevated serum glucose levels in diabeticsand can worsen gout. Niacin in doses of morethan 1 gram per day are best taken under theguidance of a physician, with monitoring ofliver-function tests. Niacin (Nicotinic Acid) 500 mg 1-3 times per day Pantethine. Pantethine is the activated form of vitamin B 5(pantothenic acid) and a key com- ponent of coenzyme A (CoA). CoA plays a sig-nicant role in lipid metabolism and is involvedin the transport of fats. The cells of our bodyneed CoA to utilize fats in the form of energy.Pantethine, at the typical dose of 300 mg threetimes per day, has been shown to signicantlyreduce serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, andLDL cholesterol, while also increasing HDL cho-lesterol. 243, 244 This same dose was found to be effective at decreasing adverse lipid parameters inpostmenopausal women. Pantethine 300 mg 3 times per day Potassium. The role of potassium in the body crosses over into many physiological eventsthat include nerve transmission, muscle contrac-tion, enzymatic reactions, carbohydrate synthe-sis, basic cell functions, and acid-base balance.Inadequate potassium intake in the diet mightplay a role in the development of high bloodpressure, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Inaddition to increasing the potassium foods in ourdiet, several studies now show that potassiumsupplementation can reduce blood pressure. Ithas been shown that potassium supplementationof 2.5 grams per day can lower the systolic bloodpressure an average of 12 points and diastolicblood pressure an average of 16 points. 222Potas- sium supplementation may be even more bene-cial in people over age 65 who often do not respond well to antihypertensive drugs. Potassium supplements are available by pre- scription and over the counter. The FDA restrictsthe potassium over-the-counter dose per tablet to99 mg due to potential problems with nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, and ulcers that may result fromhigher doses of the mineral. The frequency andseverity of side effects associated with potassiumsupplementation are negligible when comparedwith the frequency and severity of side effects asso-ciated with conventional antihypertensives. Potassium dosing should be based on individ- ualized need and potassium level in the blood.The common dose for treating hypertension is48 to 90 mEquivalents daily. Drug/potassiuminteractions are possible, and a consultation withyour health-care provider should occur if you aretaking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptorblockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics. In addi-tion, certain drugs influence the nutrient levelsand depletion of potassium. Decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake helps prevent heart disease, high bloodpressure, and strokes. The standard American diethas a poor potassium/sodium ratio; the idealpotassium-to-sodium ratio is greater than 5:1. Adiet rich in fruits and vegetables can produce amore benecial ratio because most of these foodshave signicantly greater potassium than sodium.Amongst the highest are bananas, apples, carrots,oranges, lima beans, and potatoes. Potassium 99 mg-2.5 g per day L-Arginine. L-arginine is an amino acid involved in many areas of our physiology, includ-ing the production of nitric oxide, an importantmessenger in the regulation of our blood vessels.We synthesize arginine from other substances,but dietary intake is the primary source of ourarginine levels. Arginine is the precursor of nitricoxide, a gaseous molecule involved in relaxation136WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE of the smooth muscles of our vessels, which results in vessel dilation (vasodilation) and inhi-bition of blood platelets clumping together. The key to arginine's cardiovascular benets is its ability to induce endothelial nitrous oxide pro-duction whereby an enzyme in the endothelium (lining) of the blood vessel, nitric oxide xynthase,catalyzes a reaction that produces nitrous oxideand ornithine. The nitric oxide diffuses into theunderlying the vessel and causes relax-ation and dilation. Nitric oxide also helps to pre-vent atherosclerosis in the vessels, along with itsdilation and clot prevention effects. Supplementation with arginine has been shown to increase artery dilation in normal people,people with hyperlipidemia, and in those withhypertension; 245, 246 signicantly improve blood flow and function in patients with congestive heartfailure; 247, 248 and in some, but not all trials, improve blood flow, vasodilation, exercise toler-ance, and quality of life in those with angina. 249, 250 Therapeutic doses for cardiovascular effects seem torange from 6 to 12 grams per day. L-arginine is avery safe supplement and has been associated withonly minor problems lasting a few days, includingdiarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, or allergic reac-tions. The exceptions are those patients with kidneyfailure or liver disease. For these patients, supple-mental arginine may not be able to be metabolizedor excreted as well and should be monitored. L-Arginine 6-12 g per day in divided doses, 3 g at a time L-Carnitine. L-carnitine is an amino acid found naturally in the body. We obtain some L-carnitine from the diet in foods such as red meatsand dairy products, but our bodies also synthesizecarnitines from two other amino acids, methionineand lysine. L-carnitine has a key role in the energyproduction within our cells and is required totransport long-chain fatty acids into our cells. T wo to three grams per day of L-carnitine has resulted in reductions in total and LDL choles-terol in individuals with hyperlipidemia 251and also decreased triglycerides in those with highblood pressure. 252Lipoprotein(a) levels, an inde- pendent biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk,have also been reduced with 2 grams per day ofL-carnitine, even in those with type 2 diabetes. 253 In addition, some preliminary evidence suggestscarnitine may be able to attenuate the muscularside effects of statin therapy. 254 Numerous other cardiovascular effects of L- carnitine are beyond the scope of this chapter,but improvement in exercise tolerance, func-tional improvement in angina, peripheral vascu-lar disease, treatment of heart failure, andreduced death rates from heart attacks are allareas of clinical effectiveness of L-carnitine. L-Carnitine 2-3 g per day Folic Acid, Vitamin B 6, Vitamin B 12.Much research over the years has shown that elevatedplasma levels of homocysteine are associated with signicant increases in artery disease, disease.262 T wo recent meta-analyses of observational studiesconcluded that a 25 percent reduction in plasmahomocysteine concentration was associated with decreases of 11 to 16 percent in the risk ofischemic heart disease and 19 to 22 percentreduction in the risk of stroke. 263, 264 Folate, vita- min B 12, and vitamin B 6are inversely related to homocysteine levels, and anyone with a nutri-tional deciency that leads to low concentrationsof either one or more of these nutrients is atincreased risk for elevated homocysteine levels.Testing for homocysteine levels is availablethrough commonly available simple blood tests. The rst meta-analysis of the Homocysteine Lowering T rialists' Collaboration concluded thatfolic acid supplementation lowered homocysteinelevels by about 25 percent. 265The second meta-137HEART DISEASE analysis found a 23 percent reduction in homo- cysteine concentration was the maximum observedwith 800 mcg per day of folic acid. 266A 20 percent reduction was seen with 400 mcg and 13 percentwith 200 mcg per day. Due to folic acid fortica-tion of foods in the United States, our plasmafolate concentration has increased, and subse-quently our homocysteine levels have decreased.For those of us who eat a diet fortied with folicacid in some of the foods, folic acid supplementa-tion is likely to lower homocysteine concentrationsby only about 15 percent. Women are more responsive to the homocysteine-low ering effects of folic acid than are men, and the Women's Health Initiativedemonstrated that the risk of vascular disease wasstronger than the association observed in males inthe Physician's Health Study. 267High consump- tion of foods containing folate and vitamin B 6 may reduce the risk of heart attack268in women by nearly 50 percent.269A study of 80,000 female nurses showed a direct link between the ingestionof these two B vitamins and reduced coronary dis-ease. The results suggested that eating more fruits,vegetables, and whole grains or obtaining thesevitamins through supplementation may be asimportant as quitting smoking, lowering choles-terol, or controlling high blood pressure in lower-ing heart disease risk. Folic acid and the loweringof homocysteine has recently been less impressiveas a heart disease prevention strategy. Folic Acid 400 mcg-2.5 mg per day Vitamin B 6 10-25 mg per day Vitamin B 12 400-1,000 mcg per day Essential Fatty Acids. As I discussed in the nutrition section, a diet rich in omega-3 oilsresults in a much lower risk of heart disease.Besides changes in diet, supplementation of var- ious oils is also warranted for many individuals.The daily consumption of sh oils can signi-cantly lower blood pressure in people with hyper-tension, and low consumption may increase theincidence of hypertension, especially in dietswith a low sh intake. 270 A group of researchers at the Johns Hopkins Medical School evaluated the results of 17 clinicaltrials using sh oil supplementation and foundthat consuming 3 grams or more per day of sh oil led to reductions in blood pressure of individualswith hypertension, 271lowered systolic pressure by an average of 5.5 mm Hg, and lowered diastolicpressure by 3.5 mm Hg. The effect was found to be greater at higher blood pressures. A meta-analysis of 36 trials of sh oil supplementation andblood pressure, with an average dose of 3.6 gramsper day, showed that sh oil had a small effect inlowering blood pressure, especially in older peoplewith hypertension. 272Another meta-analysis of 31 trials also showed a small but statistically signi-cant drop in blood pressures of about 3 points /1.6points at 3.3 to 7 grams per day. 273Granted, these are small decreases, but sh oils in conjunctionwith other nutrients, botanicals, and lifestylechanges can be used as part of a comprehensivetreatment plan to achieve a reduction in bloodpressure, stroke, and risk of coronary events. There are numerous studies on the effect of omega-3 sh oils and triglycerides. In a review ofhuman trials, about 4 grams per day of omega-3fatty acids from sh oil decreased serum triglyc-eride levels by 25 to 30 percent. 274Both the EPA content and the DHA content of sh oils havethe triglyceride-lowering effects. Among post-menopausal women, sh oil supplementation of2.4 g EPA and 1.6 g DHA per day not only lowered triglycerides by 26 percent but alsoimproved the triglyceride/HDL ratio. 275 Another issue pertinent to women is that for those who are on hormone replacement therapy,C-reactive protein (CRP) and triglycerides levelscan be higher. A recent clinical trial of 30 women138WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE on HRT showed that 7 grams per day of sh oil supplementation signicantly decreased CRPand triglyceride levels. 78 It may be most effective to supplement sh oils with statin medications for lowering cholesterol.In one clinical controlled trial, 59 patients whoalready had coronary heart disease and hyper-triglyceridemia who were taking statins were ableto signicantly lower their levels of triglyceridesand very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) whentaking the sh oil and the statin. 276 Another drug/sh oil study showed that 3.36 grams per day of sh oils were able to furtherdecrease the triglycerides, total cholesterol, andapolipoprotein E than just the statin alone. 277 The most compelling reason to give sh oils is ifit in fact lowers heart disease. We have evidencefor this from 15 large studies of more than60,000 individuals where a decrease in deathsfrom ischemic heart disease was observed inthose who consumed fatty sh or omega-3 fattyacids. 278In one of these studies, 1 gram per day of omega-3 EFAs was associated with a 20percent decrease in total deaths, a 30 percentdecrease in cardiovascular deaths, and a 45 per-cent decrease in sudden deaths. 279 Flaxseed oil, nature's richest source of omega-3 fatty acids, is the vegetable alternative to sh oil. Itcontains twice as many omega-3s and is usually lessexpensive. Flaxseed oil provides the body withalpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which it uses to makeEPA, whereas sh oil provides EPA directly. Thereis some concern that humans do not readily con-vert ALA to the EPA and DHA, and thereforeflaxseed oil would be a less efcient method ofgaining EPA and DHA. However, there are studieson supplementation with flaxseed oil that suggestprotective effects against cardiovascular disease byinhibiting the excessive clotting of blood. 280A recent study of flaxseed's effect on cholesterol inpostmenopausal women found decreases in LDL,triglycerides, and other lipid parameters. 281 Other seed oils may also provide some posi- tive effects on lipids. For example, a black cur-rant seed oil dose of 3 grams per day was shown to decrease LDL more than sh oil.282A more recent commercially available product, hempseed and hemp seed oil, may also prove to bebenecial in the lowering of lipids, homo-cysteine, CRP acid (GLA) may alsohave a role in prevention of heart disease 283by decreasing LDL cholesterol. Fish Oil 1 g per day of EPA and DHA 2-4 g per day of EPA plus DHA may be useful in patients with elevated triglycerides Wild salmon ranges from 1.0-1.5 g EPA plus DHA per 3 oz serving, with a little more DHA than EPA. Differ- ent species range in their EPA and DHA content. Wild sockeye salmon has approximately 600 mg DHA and430 mg EPA per 3 oz serving. Flaxseed Oil 1 tbs per day Evening Primrose Oil 3-4 g per day All supplemental oils should be taken with meals. Botanicals Flavonoids. Flavonoids are a group of com- pounds found in many fruits, vegetables, nutsand seeds, and numerous medicinal plants. Over4,000 different flavonoids identied infoods and plants. Quercetin, are used in medi-cine. Flavonoids inhibit the peroxidation oflipids by acting as free radical scavengers. 284 Quercetin specically has been shown to inhibitLDL oxidation. 285In addition to these direct antioxidant effects, flavonoids inhibit plateletaggregation, protect vitamin E from oxidation,and chelate iron. In numerous dietary studies,flavonoids have been shown to reduce cardiovas-cular disease. 286, 287139HEART DISEASE Green, oolong, and black tea are made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant and are rich in cardioprotective flavonoids. Green tea isespecially rich Theaflavins are the pigments found in blacktea, formed from the catechins during the fermen-tation of green tea to form black tea. Green teacatechins have been studied fairly extensively aspreventive agents for cardiovascular disease. 288-290 T wo recent signicant studies prove the car- diovascular benets of green tea. Taking aflavonoid-rich green tea extract (375mg) for threemonths along with a low-fat diet decreased totalcholesterol by 11.3 percent and LDL by 16.4 per-cent in men and women with mild to moderatehypercholesterolemia. 291Another study, the Ohsaki study,292found that green tea consump- tion was inversely associated with mortality due toall causes and inversely associated with cardiovas-cular disease. Compared with individuals whoconsumed less than one cup per day of green tea,those who consumed ve or more cups per dayhad a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause and CVD mortality during 11 years of follow-up. Several studies have examined the potential effects of tea on blood pressure. While there maybe transient increases in blood pressure due tothe caffeine, regular use appears to be associatedwith lower blood pressures. 293Both green tea and oolong tea intake of 120 mL /day or more cansignicantly reduce hypertension. 294In the large population-based Rotterdam Study of Dutchmen and women, the risk of heart attacks was lower in those who drank more than 375 ml (oneand a half cups) per day. 295 Garlic ( Allium Sativum ).Garlic is popular as a lipid-lowering agent, but it has a modesteffect. While analyses have demonstrated thatgarlic can reduce total cholesterol levels by 5 to12 percent, recent reports suggest these studiesmay have been too brief to draw conclu-sions. 296-298 There is great variability in research results, which may in part be due to the greatvariation in the potency of and the extracts ofgarlic used. Even the studies showing a positiveeffect lack long-term follow-up, standardized lab-oratory measurements, and adequate dietarycontrols. While evidence supports at least ashort-term benet, the effect is typically a smallbut statistically signicant decrease in lipid levels.Since 1975, over 32 human studies have beenpublished demonstrating the lipid-loweringeffects of garlic. 299T wo meta-analyses of these studies indicate that one to three months oftreatment using 600 to 900 mg of garlic powder tablets reduced total serum cholesterol an averageof 9 to 12 percent and triglycerides from 8 to 27percent. 300, 301 A recent study of 30 patients who consumed 5 grams of raw garlic for 42 days foundsignicant decreases in total and LDL cholesteroland increased HDL cholesterol. These benetswere reversed after 42 days of no garlic. 302 Garlic has also been shown to lower blood pressure slightly,303inhibit clotting,304and regulate heart rhythms.305, 306 Garlic is not as aggressive atFlavonoids Quercetin 200-400 mg 3 times per day Citrus Bioflavonoids 1,000-6,000 mg per day Green Tea More than 1 cup per day, and especially more than 5 cups per day or 1 capsule or more per day of green tea catechin extract Black Tea More than 112cups per day140WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE lowering serum cholesterol and triglycerides as some of the newer pharmaceuticals, but it alsodoes not have any of their side effects. For womenwith a modest elevation of cholesterol, it will pro-vide a safer and effective alternative. For womenwith severe hypercholesterolemia, appropriatedrugs may be used and later replaced by garlicwhen the desired drug effect is complete. Garlic is not contraindicated during preg- nancy and lactation, and 800 mg per day wasfound to be a safe and effective way to decreasegestational hypertension. 307 Problems with ingestion of garlic are usually minor. In sensitive individuals they may includeheartburn and flatulence. Some people do notappreciate the odor or taste of garlic. Odor-freeor enteric-coated products may avert these unde-sirable effects. Individuals are rarely allergic togarlic. However, people taking anticoagulantdrugs should take garlic with caution and bemonitored by a health-care practitioner. Garlic 1 fresh raw clove of garlic per day or Garlic pill providing a minimum of 4,000 mcg allicin daily Ginger ( Zingiber Ofcinale ).The same ginger that is used in cooking and ginger ale has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation(blood platelets sticking together), 308lower cholesterol,309-312 inhibit atherosclerosis,313and decrease blood pressure.314Ginger stimulates to bile acids andincreases bile secretion, thereby lowering choles-terol by promoting its excretion and impairing itsabsorption. Most research studies have used onegram of dry powdered ginger root. Ginger 1 g per day powdered ginger root Globe Artichoke ( Cynara Scolymus ).The leaf extract of the artichoke has been found to havesome lipid-lowering activity. One clinical trial used 1,800 mg of artichoke extract versusplacebo for six weeks for the treatment of highcholesterol levels. 315The decrease in total choles- terol values was 18.5 percent in the artichokegroup versus 8.6 percent in the placebo group.Also, LDL values fell by 22.9 percent. Forpatients with gallstones or other bile-ductobstructions, globe artichoke supplementationshould be avoided due to the choleretic activityof the extract. This product is currently availableas a nutritional supplement in the United States. Globe Artichoke 600 mg 3 times per day Procyanidolic Oligomers (PCO). Extracts from grape seeds and the bark of the maritimepine tree are high in a group of flavonoids calledproanthocyanidins, also called procyanidins.Mixtures of proanthocyanidin molecules arereferred procyanidolic oligomers (PCO).These commercially prepared extracts of grapeseeds and pine bark, or PCO extracts, possesspotent antioxidant activity that is far strongerthan even vitamin E or vitamin C. In animalstudies, PCO extracts have been shown to pre-vent damage to the arterial lining, lower bloodcholesterol levels, and shrink cholesterol depositsin the arteries. 316, 317 Human studies have con- rmed these ndings in smokers,318and a combi- nation of 100 mg grape seed extract and 200 mcgchromium two times daily was found to signi-cantly decrease total and LDL cholesterol up to20 percent. 319 PCO 50-300 mg per day Gugulipid ( Commiphora Mukul ).The mukul myrrh tree, native to India, Pakistan, andAfghanistan, is the source of standardizedgugulipid extract. The extract is further concen-trated to isolate compounds known as guggul-141HEART DISEASE sterones. The two guggulsterones important in the management of hyperlipidemia are Z-guggulsterone and E-guggulsterone. Gugulipidappears to prevent the oxidation of LDL and mayregulate the level of bile acids, helping the body toexcrete cholesterol. Guggulsterones are thought tobe the main active constituents responsible forthese effects. Studies have shown that gugulipidcan decrease total cholesterol levels by 11.7 per-cent, LDL by 12.5 percent, and TG by 12.0 per-cent, with no change in HDL values. 320Most commercial extracts are standardized to 5 percentguggulsterone content, and the typical treatmentdose is 500 mg (providing 25 mg of guggul-sterones) three times per day. 321 A comprehensive review of available research on gugulipid suggests conflicting evidence at thistime. 322When using the standardized extract preparations, only mild abdominal discomfort isreported in a small number of people. Gugulipid 500 mg with 25 mg guggulsterones, 3 times per day Hawthorn ( Crataegus Oxyacantha ).Haw- thorn leaves, berries, and blossoms contain flavo-noids. One of these, proanthocyanidin, hasespecially good cardiovascular effect. Hawthornpreparations are modestly effective in reducingblood pressure, 323in the prevention and treat- ment of atherosclerosis, lowering cholesterol, andpreventing the oxidation of LDL. 324Hawthorn preparations improve the blood supply to theheart by dilating the coronary arteries, increasethe force of contraction of the heart muscle, andregulate cardiac rhythm. 323A very recent study of 79 diabetic hypertensive patients who received1,200 mg hawthorn versus placebo for 16 weeksfound signicant reductions in diastolic meas-ures, no drug-herb interactions, and only fewmild side effects. 325T wo randomized control trial found decreases in both systolic and diastolicmeasures when treatment was administered forabout three months. 326, 327Hawthorn Choose one of the following: Tincture (1 part herb to 5 parts alcohol): 405 ml per day Freeze-dried berries: 1.0-1.5 g per day Flower extract (1.8 percent vitexin or 20 percent procyanidins): 100-250 mg per day Berries or flowers (dried as a tea): 3-5 g of dried herb per day Plant Sterols/Stanols. Plant sterols are natu- rally occurring cholesterol derivatives from veg-etable oils, nuts, soy, corn, woods, and beans.The hydrogenation of plant sterols producesstanols. Sterols and stanols referred togenerically by the term phytosterols . Phytosterols have a chemical structure similar to cholesterol,and the consumption of these plant sterolsreduces the absorption of cholesterol and thusreduces circulating cholesterol levels. Evenmodest additions have been found to lower totalblood cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by about10 percent. 328Sterols and stanols from a dietary intake of plant sterols in the range of 1.5 to 2.5grams per day reduce LDL cholesterol by 8.5 to10 percent. 329A recent study found that dietary intervention with plant sterols could reduce cho-lesterol levels by about 30 percent, or approxi-mately the same extent as one of the statin drugs,levostatin. 330Most studies have found no effect of these sterols on triglyceride levels, but someindividuals have shown effects in recent stud-ies. 331-333 Sterols do not seem to lower HDL levels. Sterols and stanols are often added to selected brands of margarines, semisolid food spreads,and salad dressings. As of 2000, the FDA author-ized sterol-containing products to state that theyreduce the risk of heart disease. The lowest effec-tive dose for such a claim is 1.3 grams per day.Sterols and stanols are also available in dietarysupplements. The supplement forms of phyto-sterols are advantageous in that they do not142WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE require r efrigeration, are convenient to take, and are largely calorie free. Dietary sterols include sitosterol, campe- sterol, and stigmasterol. Soybean oil prin-cipal source of sterol esters, followed by canola,sunflower, and corn oils. Sterols reduce total cho-lesterol levels and LDL cholesterol because theyare natural competitors of cholesterol absorptionand resorption. Plant Sterols and Stanols Average dose of 3.4 g per day NCEP III recommends 2 g per day Policosanol. Policosanol is a mixture of alco- hols extracted from sugar cane, wheat germ, ricebran, or beeswax. Policosanol has been used toreduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, andtriglycerides and to increase HDL cholesterolbased on over 10 years of critical trials and 30 or so positive clinical trials. One recent meta-analysis of natural interventions for abnormaland elevated lipids concluded that policosanol ismore effective than plant sterols. 334 However, evidence to the benets of poli- cosanol is conflicting. In May of 2006, a random-ized controlled trial studied four different doses ofpolicosanol compared to each other and a placebogroup. 335None of the treatment groups had a decrease of LDL cholesterol of more than 10 per-cent, and no statistically signicant differenceoccurred between policosanol and placebo. It maybe that combining policosanol with other lipid-lowering natural agents, and especially sh oils,will offer the most effect. Animal and humanstudies that combined 5 or 10 mg policosanolwith 1 gram omega-3 fatty acids showed adecrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, andLDL and an increase in HDL greater than whensh oils alone were used. 336, 337 Despite this con-flicting evidence, I still recommend policosanol in my clinical practice due to the results I witness. Red Yeast Rice. Red yeast rice is made from cooked white rice fermented by the yeastMonascus purpureus , which is then sterilized and dried. Red yeast rice has been used as a dietarystaple, to make rice wine, and as a food preserva-tive and is a cholesterol-lowering agent. Themain active ingredient in red yeast rice is mona-colin K (lovastatin), 338which inhibits the enzyme that of cholesterol.Omega-3 fatty acids, isoflavones, and plantsterols in red yeast rice are likely also responsiblefor its benecial effects on lipids. In one of theearly studies on red yeast rice (using 2.4 g/dCholestin), after 8 weeks cholesterol levels werelowered in men and women by 17 percent, LDLby 22 percent, and triglycerides by 12 percent,with HDL values unchanged. 339 However, there is signicant variability in qual- ity and potency of commercial red yeast rice prod-ucts. In addition, the lovastatin content in dietarysupplements of red yeast rice was lowered due tochallenges by the FDA and others. Due to legalissues, Cholestin is no longer available. There are,however, other effective red yeast rice products. Red Yeast Rice 2.4 g per day Additional Botanical Therapies. A vast range of herbs have been used for decades, oreven centuries, to treat heart and vascular systemconditions. Some of these herbs are categorizedhere according to their dominant action: Diuretics: dandelion leaf, lily the valley, parsley Heart tonics: broom, bugleweed, gwort, haw- thorn, night-blooming Aids to circulation: per day143HEART DISEASE Nervines (reduce flowers, hawthorn, mistletoe, yarrow Exercise Numerous studies show the great heart-health benets of exercise. 340-371 Physical exercise is associated with a reduction in obesity, improvedbody fat distribution, a reduced risk of type 2diabetes, reduced blood pressure, and reducedcholesterol levels. In women of all ages, exercisehas been shown to reduce the risk for cardiovas-cular disease by altering CVD risk factors. Inaddition, it diminishes the stiffness of arteriesand decreases damaging plaque in blood vessels.Finally, exercise reduces the risk of arrhythmias,normalizes blood lipids, and increases insulinsensitivity. A recent study suggests that exerciseand modest diet changes can decrease cholesteroland resultant atherosclerosis comparable to cer-tain statins. Most important, by staying activewith moderate levels of physical activity, we canprevent cardiovascular disease independent ofother risk factors and improve our life expectancy. Aerobic exercise in particular is known to raise HDL cholesterol levels, and in women, HDLmay be the most important cholesterol issue inpredicting coronary artery disease. Williamsfound an average 0.13 mg/dL plasma HDLincrease for each additional kilometer run byfemale runners per week. Similarly, other studieshave reported modest to signicant increases inHDL cholesterol following aerobic training. Inone of these studies, the increase in HDL wasmeasured at 7.6 mg/dL when exercise was com-bined with smoking cessation in women. In addition to aerobic exercise, strength train- ing has been found to reduce CVD risk factors aswell. In one study, previously sedentary womenperformed 12 resistance exercises for one hour, three times per week. After ve months of exercise,they showed decreases of 13 and 14 points in totalcholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL), respectively, from baseline values. Anotherstudy noted that previously hypertensive adoles-cents who reduced their blood pressure by aerobicexercise were able to maintain blood pressure con-trol by taking weight-lifting exercise after discon-tinuing aerobic exercise. These results are evenmore surprising when one considers the lack ofeffect noted for aerobic exercise in plasma total andLDL and triglycerides in women. The type of exercise chosen appears less signif- icant than its intensity or duration on its effects onCVD risk factors. Exercise recommendations havechanged over the years and will likely continue tochange with time. Public health recommendationsvary by organization. I recommend engaging in 40 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physicalactivity such as brisk walking on most days of theweek or at a vigorous intensity for 20 minutes perday. It should be noted here that the effects ofexercise on CVD risk factors are not permanent.Code and colleagues found that, in both men andwomen, the effects of exercise on blood pressuredisappeared within weeks after the return to asedentary lifestyle. Benets of Exercise Exercise: 1. Normalizes blood lipids 2. Elevates protective HDL levels in dose-response fashion 3. Signicantly reduces LDL 4. Reduces and stabilizes blood pressure 5. Increases insulin sensitivity6. Stabilizes weight and decreases fat mass and BMI7. Is benecial in congestive heart failure8. Reduces CVD mortality 9. Is an essential in rehabilitation after heart attack, stroke, or bypass surgery 10. Alleviates stress144WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE For several decades, exercise has been advo- cated for the treatment of men who have had aheart attack or stroke. Recent encouraging resultssuggest that it should also be prescribed forwomen in similar situations. Ades and colleaguesstudied 60 older patients (41 men and 19 women) who had had previous MI or bypass surgery andparticipated in a rehab program that includedtreadmill running for 25 minutes, stationarybiking for 15 minutes, and machine rowing for 10 minutes for three and twelve months. 371The results showed improved tness and increasednumber and size of capillaries in the thighs. Women should be encouraged to gradually increase their exercise and engage in an exerciseprogram that is safe, convenient, and hopefullysatisfying and even fun, at least at times. There isno single best exercise but rather what's best foryou. Regular, lifelong exercise offers womenmore CVD benets than any one drug, nutrient,or herbal intervention. Stress Management Women's hearts appear more vulnerable to stress than men's. Arnold suggests that negative stres-sors such as lack of social support and perceivedlack of control contribute to CAD risk. 375A sim- ilar inference can be made from the dataobtained by Blumenthal and colleagues. 376In patients with CAD or ischemia, these authorsfound that a stress management program wasapproximately three times more effective atreducing cardiac events than exercise. Many simple techniques can be effective in managing stress and reducing its baleful influ-ence. Techniques such as deep-breathing exer-cises, biofeedback, transcendental meditation,yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and hypnosishave all been shown to reduce stress and lowerblood pressure. 377The antihypertensive effect of these techniques is not dramatic. However, theyconstitute an important factor in a holistic pro-gram to lower blood pressure and treat and pre-vent heart disease. Natural (Bio-Identical) Hormone Replacement Therapy Whether a woman should go through the meno- pausal years without hormone therapy orExercise Recommendations Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Follow the exercise guidelines outlined in Appendix A. Treatment of Existing Cardiovascular Disease 1. Consult a health-care provider before beginning a new exercise program. 2. Use caution and moderation. Note that in men who seldom exercise, cardiac arrest is 56 timesmore likely during vigorous exercise than at rest. In men who exercise frequently, the risk is 5 times greater. 372 3. Walking program for heart patients:373 Distance Time Weeks (miles) (min/mile) 1-2 1 20 3-4 1 17-205-6 1 157-8 1.5 15 9-10 1.5 14 To maintain the conditioning effect, exercise 20 to 30 minutes three to ve times a week. If you stopexercise for more than two weeks, start again at alower level and gradually build back up to your origi- nal program. Examples of Moderate Exercise for Mild CAD 374 30 minutes of brisk walking each day 10 minutes of brisk walking 3 times a day Swimming, biking, or working out on an exercise machine such as a treadmill, stair-climbing machine, rowing machine, or stationary cycle at moderate intensity for 30 minutes daily Begin slowly and increase speed gradually over time. If you have never exercised before, start with a few minutes each day and increase time gradually every week until you reach 30 minutes per day.145HEART DISEASE whether she should use bio-identical or conven- tional hormone therapy is a complex decision.The decision is especially difcult when one con-siders the many unanswered questions aboutmenopause, cardiovascular disease, and naturaland conventional hormones. The method Ifollow is to systematically evaluate each womanwith a thorough medical history, physical exam,and laboratory testing. Based on these tests andthe patient's preferences and concerns, the prac-titioner and patient can together develop a per-sonalized plan that is right for the patient. A woman's risk for cardiovascular disease changes over time. The plan needs to changeaccordingly to carefully balance the benets versusthe risks of therapy. Both practitioner and patientneed to be open-minded so that informed andappropriate decisions are reached. Conventional HRT may be appropriate for some women. When it is appropriate, itbehooves physicians to advise the use of the leastobjectionable options. Phytoestrogens and bio-identical hormone therapy are perhaps the mostappropriate for some women, and I would assert,most women. No single protocol or approach isequally appropriate for all women. Determiningif my patient is at low, medium, or high risk forCAD has been a critical tool in the path to therecommendations I nally make. (See theoverview section at the beginning of this chapterfor more about issues pertinent to HRT and car-diovascular disease.) Natural (Bio-Identical) Progesterone The use of natural or bio-identical progesterone creams and oral micronized natural progesteronehas grown in popularity over the last severalyears. However, only recently have natural prog-esterone creams been shown to have biologicalactivity. Progesterone is synthesized from dios-genin or stigmasterol found in Mexican wildyams and soybeans. This hormone end producthas come to be known as natural or bio-identicalprogesterone both because it is plant derived and,more important, because it is biochemically identical to the progesterone produced by thehuman ovary. Natural progesterone is biochemi-cally different than progestin, which is com-monly misstated as progesterone. The mostcommon progestin used for menopausal womenis medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), betterknown as Provera. There are few studies on natural proges- terone. However, the development of oralmicronized progesterone (OMP) in the last 10 to15 years, together with the few side effects andpopularity of natural progesterone, have encour-aged scientic research and medical interest inthis natural hormone. For more information onthe indications and effects of natural proges-terone, please refer to Chapter 12. To date, unfortunately, very few studies have addressed the possible cardiovascular effects ofthese preparations in postmenopausal women.The study with the biggest impact on the percep-tion of natural progesterone was the Postmeno-pausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI)trial. 378Although the postmenopausal women in this study were also given estrogen, the PEPI trialdemonstrated similar lipid changes for estrogenand progesterone that are known to occur withadministration of estrogen alone, except for HDL,which was signicantly reduced. Perhaps whatmerits reflection here is that, despite its otherundesirable effects, estrogen alone has the mostfavorable effect on lipids. When estrogen is com-bined with natural progesterone, HDL cholesteroldoes not improve quite as much, and when givenwith progestin, HDL improves even less. A recent study compared the effects of natu- ral progesterone and synthetic progestin (in had an increase in HDL levels of14.4 percent after six months; the estrogen plusprogestin had an increase in HDL of 4.58 per-cent; and the estrogen plus natural progesteronehad an increase in HDL of 5.44 percent. 379Total146WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE cholesterol levels were signicantly decreased only in the estrogen plus progestin group; triglyc-eride levels were increased only in the estrogenplus natural progesterone group; and themicronized progesterone was not superior tomedroxyprogesterone acetate. There is evidence showing that oral micronized progesterone (OMP) may lowerblood pressure. In fact, OMP administered indoses of 200, 400, and 600 mg per day to hyper-tensive postmenopausal women and older mensignicantly reduced systolic blood pressure ascompared to placebo in a two-week treatmenttrial. 380With the maximum dose, systolic blood pressure was decreased approximately 19.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure about 9.6 mmHg. At the lower doses, the decreases in systolicblood pressure were less signicant. Both OMPand progestins can cause fluid retention, althoughnatural progesterone to a lesser extent. Studies demonstrate that synthetic progestins and natural progesterone have markedly differenteffects on the coronary vessels 381and on their smooth wall muscle cells.382The results of these two studies indicate that synthetic progestinsmay induce spasm of the coronary arteries,whereas estrogen and/or natural progesteronepromoted dilation. Although many women are presently using natural progesterone creams as an alternative toconventional HRT, relatively little research hasbeen done on these products\u2014with little infor-mation about their impact on cardiovascular riskfactors. For more information on the use of nat-ural progesterone alone or in combination withdifferent estrogens in menopause, please refer toChapter 12. Perhaps most interesting is that in the Women's Health Initiative, women who were onestrogen only did not have an increased inci-dence of cardiovascular disease but did have anincreased risk of stroke, 383differing from the rst WHI study estrogen and progestin group.17For a discussion on other research and how thetiming of when a woman starts HRT may affect the risks and the benets, see the overview sec-tion of this chapter. Natural (Bio-Identical) Estrogens Natural estrogens are what we have come bio-identical Theyinclude estradiol, estrone, diosgenin and soy contains stig-masterol that can be converted into an estrogenbiochemically identical to that produced by ourovaries. Bio-identical estradiol and estrone in apatented delivery system and in premanufactureddosages are available by prescription from a regular pharmacy. Bio-identical estradiol, estrone,and estriol can also be compounded in customized,individualized dosages of any strength, any combi-nation, and in many different delivery systemsincluding lozenges, sublingual tablets, creams, gels,capsules, and even injections. The distinctionsbetween bio-identical estrogens and other forms ofHRT are presented in Chapter 12. This sectionwill focus on their effect on the cardiovascularsystem. Theoretically, if we have a dose of a bio- identical estrogen that is equivalent in strength tothe dose of the conventional estrogen, the cardio-vascular benet or risk should be the same.Nonetheless, any hormone therapy that is consid-ered to be an alternative to the leading form of ther-apy (conjugated equine estrogens, i.e., Premarin)must at some point be compared in order to proveits worthiness and acceptability among patients andhealth-care practitioners. A few studies have lookedat oral micronized estradiol alone or in conjugated equine plusmedroxyprogesterone (MPA) to effects on CAD. Ten menopausal women,administered the natural estrogen/progesteronecombination, experienced a decrease in total cho-lesterol. In contrast, this parameter did not changesignicantly at 12 months over the initial choles-terol readings in the ve women who were given147HEART DISEASE CEE and MPA. Both groups experienced an increase in HDL cholesterol.384Another study reported the results of a combination pill contain-ing 2 mg of oral micronized estradiol, 1 mg ofestriol, and 1 mg of a synthetic progestin in 265women, who were followed for over four years;serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreasedsignicantly, but HDL levels were not measured. 385 Estriol is the other natural estrogen that can be used either alone or in combination withestradiol (called bi-est) or with estradiol andestrone (called tri-est). Estriol is used for a varietyof treatments and is discussed in more detail inChapter 12. Little is known about what estriolmay or may not do with regard to CVD. How-ever, two studies indicate positive effects ofestriol administration on lipid proles and car-diac function. Japanese researchers found that 2mg per day of estriol was effective in decreasingtotal cholesterol and triglycerides and increasingHDL levels in elderly women (age 70 to 84), butnot in middle-aged postmenopausal women (age 50 to 65). 386The other study followed post- menopausal women using estriol and found anincrease in their cardiac function and improvedblood flow in the extremities. 387Even so, I would not currently consider estriol a viable approachfor treating or preventing heart disease. When it comes to cardiovascular disease, I con- tend that ethically, practitioners using bio-identicalhormone therapy must have the same benet-riskconversation with patients as a conventional prac-titioner who prescribes the typical Premarin/Provera would have. That said, in my opinion,there is enough evidence at this point that oralmicronized progesterone is more cardiac friendlyon lipids and coronary arteries than are the syn-thetic progestogens or progestin (such as Provera).Other than this point, I would advocate for fol-lowing the current guidelines from the NorthAmerican Menopause Society and their PositionStatement on HRT in Menopausal Women: 388Sample Treatment Plan for Cardiovascular Disease or Hyperlipidemia See the Resources section for formulation sources.

However, unlessconrming data become available, ET shouldnot be used for primary or secondary preven-tion of these conditions.\" CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH There is still much that is unknown about car- diovascular disease, hormone replacement, andthe aging process in women. The results of theWomen's Health Initiative (WHI) have dramati-cally changed how HRT has been prescribed inthis country. It is no longer routinely prescribed149HEART DISEASE to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as it was for over 30 years. The approach now is muchmore individualized, and there is still lack of agree-ment if the timing of when HRT is startedimpacts its influence on cardiovascular disease. Aswith all therapies, HRT must be examined againstthe backdrop of benet versus risk. The naggingquestions for women continue to be, \"Should I orshouldn't I?\" and \"Are the risks greater than thebenets?\" Further discussion of these concerns ispresented in Chapter 12. Conventional practitioners are as eager to educate their patients on the importance of pre-venting heart disease as holistic care providersare. For several years now, patients have beenencouraged by their conventional physicians tostop smoking, increase exercise, lower theirdietary fat, increase fruits and vegetables, loseweight, and reduce their stress. It has becomemuch more common to recommend diet andlifestyle changes as a rst line of treatment formild hyperlipidemia and mild hypertension. Those individuals who are at increased risk for heart disease should discuss the potentialbenets and harms of aspirin therapy with theirpractitioner. Low-dose aspirin is a foundation ofheart disease secondary prevention, due to itsability to inhibit platelet aggregation. Recur-rence rates for heart attacks are also consistentlylower in women (and men) who already havecoronary disease when they are treated with alow dose of aspirin. 389In a meta-analysis of four large primary prevention trials using low-doseaspirin, a 15 percent reduction was seen in car-diovascular events and a 30 percent reductionwas observed in MI rates. 390More recently, a large randomized placebo-controlled trial oflow-dose aspirin was done in the Women'sHealth Study (WHS). 391In 39,876 women who did not have coronary disease, a 24 percentreduction was observed in the risk of ischemicstrokes, compared with those women who didnot take aspirin. Unfortunately, there was nooverall reduction in MI or total cardiovascularevents except in women who were 65 years or older. In that age group, aspirin therapy didreduce overall cardiovascular disease by 26 per-cent and the risk of MI by 34 percent. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has found good evidence that aspirindecreases the incidence of heart disease in adultswho are at increased risk. However, they alsoacknowledge that aspirin increases gastrointesti-nal bleeding episodes and that it may alsoincrease the incidence of hemorrhagic (bleeding)strokes. Their conclusion is that for those indi-viduals who are at high risk for heart disease, thebenets outweigh the risks. The American Dia-betes Association has also concluded that clini-cians should consider aspirin for primaryprevention of heart disease in diabetic patientswho are older than 30 or have risk factors for car-diovascular disease and no contraindications toaspirin. The American Heart Association recom-mends aspirin for \"patients who've had a myocar-dial infarction (heart attack), unstable angina,ischemic stroke (caused by blood tran-sient ischemic attacks or 'little strokes'), ifnot not startaspirin therapy without rst consulting yourpractitioner. Also inform your practitioner if youare taking aspirin and must have a simple surgi-cal procedure, even a dental extraction, as itincreases the risk of excessive bleeding. When treating hyperlipidemia, most conven- tional practitioners will follow the NCEP , ATPIII guidelines. Step 1 involves identifying thelipid levels with blood testing; step 2 is to iden-tify the presence of any atherosclerotic diseasethat confers a high risk for heart disease events.Step 3 is to determine the presence of major riskfactors other than an LDL level above 160. Thesemajor risk factors include: Cigarette smoking Blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or some- one on high blood pressure medication Low HDL, less than 40 mg/dL150WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE A family history of premature heart disease (before age 55 in father, brother, or son;before age 65 in mother, sister, or daughter) Age (men 45 and older and women 55 and older) Step 4 is to determine a woman's 10-year heart disease risk according to Framinghamtables of greater than 20 percent risk, 10 to 20percent risk, or less than 10 percent risk; Step 5is to determine the risk category. At this point,your practitioner will initiate advice. Initiatingthe Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) is therst attempt at lowering your lipids, if your LDLis already at its goal. The specics of the TLC aredescribed in the nutrition section. Per the ATPIII guidelines, drug therapy is advised, accordingto the scheme shown in Table 9.4. Ideally, drugs will be advised simultaneously with TLC for women whose 10-year risk is greaterthan 20 percent. For those in lower risk categories,drugs may be added after a three-month trial ofjust the therapeutic lifestyle changes. There are many drug or quasi-drug treatments that your conventional practitioner may consider.The major classes of lipid-lowering agents used inconventional medicine include HMG-CoA reduc-tase inhibitors (statins), bile acid sequestrants,bric acid derivatives, and nicotinic acid. The group of drugs called the statins lower LDL and triglycerides, and some may raise HDL.Currently, these include lovastatin, pravastatin,simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivas-tatin. They each come in several strengths. Bile acid sequestrants decrease LDL and increase HDLbut do not lower triglycerides. These includecholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam. Nico-tinic acid is used (1.5-3 1-2 grams). Nicotinic acid lowers LDL,although not as much as some of the newerstatins; raises HDL better than all the statins; andlowers triglycerides as much or better than thestatins. Finally, bric acids are drugs that are usedprimarily to lower triglycerides. These includegembrozil, fenobrate, and clobrate. The treatment of high blood pressure is responsible for more primary care visits than anyother chronic medical condition. However,approximately 75 percent of treated hyperten-sion patients are receiving inadequate care, asdened by their inability to achieve and maintaintheir target blood pressure. The American Heart Association (AHA) offers 10 ways to control your high blood pressure: 1. Know your blood pressure and have it checked regularly. 2. Maintain a healthy weight.3. Avoid using salt in cooking or the salting of your foods. Avoid packaged salty foods. 4. Eat a diet low in saturated fat according to the AHA recommendations (see nutritionsection).Table 9.4 ATP Guidelines for Drug Therapy Risk Category LDL Goal LDL Level for TLC LDL for Drug Therapy Limit your alcohol intake to one drink per day. 6. If you are taking any medication, take it as prescribed. Do not make any changes with-out consulting your prescribing practitioner. 7. Make regular follow-up appointments with your practitioner. 8. Follow exercise advice.9. Advise your immediate relatives to have their blood pressure checked. 10. Manage stress optimally. There are many different medications to lower high blood pressure, called antihyperten-sives. Diuretics rid the body of excess fluids, andeven sodium, and are often used as the initialtherapy. Beta-blockers reduce the heart rate andthe amount of blood the heart pumps. Sympa-thetic nerve inhibitors reduce the blood pressureby inhibiting the nerves that cause blood vesselconstriction. Vasodilators cause the muscle wallsin the blood vessels to relax, and therefore allowthem to dilate and widen. Angiotensin-convert-ing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors work to lower bloodpressure by interfering with the body's productionof angiotensin, a chemical that causes the arteriesto constrict. The angiotensin II receptor blockersblock the effects of angiotensin, and the calciumchannel blockers are calcium antagonists that canreduce the heart rate and relax the blood vessels.Some individuals will need only short-term treat-ment or may be able to reduce their dose after ayear or more of normal blood pressure. Othersmay need to be on blood pressure medicationsindenitely. Keep in mind that reducing weight,eating healthier, exercising regularly, reducingsodium, and reducing or managing stressors maykeep you from having to take blood pressuremedications or enable you to decrease or discon-tinue them. When drug treatments are needed, as you can see, there are many to choose from,and it takes knowledge, skill, and experience foryour practitioner to offer the best medication foryou. You may need to go through trial periods ondifferent medications to see not only which works best, but which works best with the fewest sideeffects. An additional reminder, though: Don'tjust stop your medication on your own if you get discouraged or are experiencing side effects.Call your medical ofce. The following sidebarcontains a list of some of the drugs used to treathigh blood pressure. This is not a complete list, asthere are many and new ones all the time. The use of pharmacologic agents to lower lipids and/or blood pressure is an appropriateregimen for patients who have not responded toa rigorous lifestyle modication program andnutritional and/or herbal supplementation. It isimportant to recognize, however, that despite the effectiveness of alternative therapies, not allpatients are able to make the necessary changesor comply with the supplementation regimen. Aminority of patients have conditions that willresist their own and their physician's best efforts. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., N.P., P.A., D.O.) The signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease in women can be different from thosefound in men. Women more often have cases of silent myocardial infarction, have chest painwhile having normal coronary vessels, and have a higher incidence of mortality with their rstincidence of chest pain due to coronary arteryspasm. Diagnostic testing in women may not beas reliable either. Exercise stress testing is less predictive, and angiograms reveal less extensivedisease in women than in men. One's risk of heart disease changes with time, and risk must be assessed periodically. For meno-pausal women, it starts with the annual physicalexam, which should include a thorough medicalhistory, physical exam, blood pressure and pulsecheck, weight, listening to heart and lungs, andother physical ndings. Lipid panels checking for total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides,and the cholesterol/HDL ratio and thyroid and152WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE glucose testing are done at different frequencies depending on health status and risk factors. Whileannual routine screening may be more often thanmost practitioners will recommend for womenaged 50 and older, I do in fact prefer that approachto optimize the preventive medicine approach. Ifdeemed necessary, biomarkers of cardiovascularrisk, EKG, stress EKG test, and stress echocardio-grams may also be recommended. The results ofthese tests will help determine the most appropri-ate next step, whether it is a more aggressive diag-nostic test and/or treatment intervention.For women with abnormal ndings, it is important to seek the advice of someone who canhelp determine if therapeutic doses of some ofthe natural therapies discussed in this chapter aresuitable and sufcient for success. A treatmentplan can be agreed on; then, with follow-up eval-uation and testing after an appropriate interval,the next step in the process can be determined.Some women may need to take cholesterol- orblood-pressure-lowering pharmaceutical agents ifan aggressive natural treatment plan has notbrought adequate results, at least on an interimDrugs Used to Treat High Blood Dilators Minoxidil (use in severe cases or in conjuction with treatment of kidney failure)153HEART DISEASE basis, and with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. The determination of whether to usenatural or conventional HRT and its dosage canbest be made by a practitioner who appreciatesthe role and value of each and the benets andrisks of HRT. Another reason to see a licensed health-care practitioner (naturopathic doctor, medicaldoctor, osteopathic doctor, nurse-practitioner, orphysician's assistant) is if you are on prescriptionmedications, for whatever reason, and want to use the natural supplements for your blood pres-sure or cholesterol. There are some signicantdrug/herb/nutrient interactions that are impor-tant to be aware of, and in a few circumstancesthere are herbs and nutritional supplements thatare contraindicated with select medications. Analternative practitioner in particular can assurethe safest method of taking natural supplementswith pharmaceutical medications.This page intentionally left blank 155OVERVIEW Impaired fertility affects over 6 million women in the United States alone, and recent estimatessuggest that approximately 10 million coupleshave sought infertility services. Infertility is con-sidered a common condition and affects 10 to 15 percent of reproductive age couples. Femaleinfertility accounts for about 50 percent of thecases, 19 percent are due to male factor infertil-ity, 17.6 percent are due to a combination, andabout 10.5 percent of the cases are caused byunknown factors. 1Female infertility most often is due to tubal and pelvic disease (40 percent) orfrom a previous pelvic inflammatory infection,asymptomatic chlamydia or gonorrhea, or ovula-tory dysfunction (40 in ovary, uterineabnormalities, immunologic factors, abnormalities, environmental chemicals andtoxins, and cancer chemotherapy or radiationcan also cause infertility. Infertility is dened as a failure to conceive after 12 months of frequent intercourse without contraception in women under 35 years of age orfailure to conceive after six months of intercoursewithout contraception in women 35 years of ageor older. Infertility is further broken down intotwo types: primary infertility is in women withno history of prior pregnancy, and secondaryinfertility is with a history of prior pregnancy. Eighty-ve percent of couples will conceive after the rst year of trying, with an increase to 93 percent after two years. Most spontaneouspregnancies occur within three years, and there isa poor prognosis for success without treatmentafter that. This nal point underscores theimportance of timely specialty referrals to repro-ductive endocrinologists for evaluation for assistedreproductive therapies for infertile couples whowish to have a child. Many ob-gyns, primary care physicians, and complementary care providersmay do couples a disservice by waiting too long to make these referrals. If pregnancy has not been achieved within one year in a woman less than 35 years old, eval-uation of both partners should be initiated.Women who are 35 years old or older; womenwho have a history of irregular menses, pelvicpain, or dyspareunia (pain with intercourse); andwomen with a previous pelvic surgery, PID, orendometriosis should be evaluated earlier. A detailed medical history is necessary to determine many things that are pertinent to fertility: Previous pregnancy history and outcome Menstrual cycle details Contraception history Duration of time without contraception Coital frequency Surgeries, hospitalizations, illnesses, PID, STIs, Pap smear history A review of other systems and history of any thyroid problems, nipple discharge, acne,facial hair, or hair loss Medications, allergies Family history of serious illnesses, congenital birth defects, and reproductive health problems Lifestyle factors: smoking history, alcohol use, exercise A physical evaluation should include height and weight, observation for signs of excess andro- gens (facial hair, acne, and hair loss), abdominalhip and waist circumference, and breast, thyroid,abdominal, and pelvic exam.10INFERTILITY CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 156WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Laboratory testing can be extremely complex, and the order of what is done may vary dependingon the medical history and physical exam. Initialexams often include thyroid testing, prolactinlevels (for those with irregular cycles or symp-toms), mentrual cycle day 3 follicle-stimulatinghormone (FSH) and possibly estradiol levels to assess ovarian reserve, a mid-luteal phase proges-terone test to conrm ovulation, hysterosalpin-gography (HSG) to assess the fallopian tubes andany abnormalities of the uterus, and analysis ofsemen. Other tests may be indicated such as androgen levels, blood sugar, insulin levels, orglucose tolerance testing. Pelvic and transvaginalultrasound (TVUS) looks for uterine broids,ovarian cysts, and ovarian follicles, and a salinesonohystogram (SHG) is useful in evaluating the uterus for polyps, intrauterine adhesions, and submucosal broids. Some women who havea history of pelvic adhesions, tubal disease, orendometriosis may need to have a laparoscopicsurgical evaluation.Causes of Infertility in Couples Pelvic or Structural Factors (35%) Infection: pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted disease, septic abortion, endometritis, pelvic tuberculosis Surgical intrauterine device use, DES exposure in utero, ectopic pregnancy, frequent abortion Endometriosis Ovulatory or Hormonal Factors (15%) Secondary amenorrhea Abnormal uterine bleeding Obesity Luteal phase defect (short luteal phase) Decreased ovarian reserve Premature ovarian failure (early menopause) Polycystic ovary syndrome Elevated prolactin Elevated TSH Prior (35%) cases) Cryptorchidism (3%) Testicular surgeries or sexually Postpubertal mumps Hypogonadism Genital radiation or chemotherapy Hypospadias Testicular cancer (less than 0.1% of cases) Retrograde ejaculation or other dysfunction Development abnormalities: vas deferens absence (related to cystic brosis), impairedtesticular function (chromosome abnormality) Exposure to excessive heat (hot tubs, saunas), toxic chemicals, pesticides Medication or drug use (gonadotoxins): med- and marijuana Unexplained (10%) Depression Unusual Problems (5%) Immunologic Rare Causes Substance use (alcohol, marijuana, caffeine, tobacco)157INFERTILITY A day 3 FSH level (or day 3 and day 10 levels if doing a full clomiphene citrate challenge test) isimportant and helpful information in predictingif a woman is less likely to become pregnantbeyond what would be predicted by age alone. Anelevated FSH level on cycle day 3 (or day 10) ofgreater than 11 to 12 IU/L is associated with poorchance of conception and poor results with invitro fertilization. A FSH test that is 25 IU/L ormore or an age of 43 years or more are each asso-ciated with a chance of pregnancy that is close tozero even with attempts at ovulation induction orwith assisted reproductive technologies. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Complementary medicine has a role in the man- agement of infertility both before and after areferral has been made to a reproductive endocri-nologist. After a detailed history and physical including pertinent lab work, treatment can betargeted to address any identied underlyingcauses. Unfortunately, in many cases, no causecan be determined. In these causes of unex-plained infertility, the rst step is to address basicissues of diet and lifestyle. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors Both overweight and underweight women have increased rates of infertility. Women who areoverweight are more likely to experience prob-lems with ovulation and miscarriages. An in-crease in abdominal fat decreases insulinsensitivity, which is related to ovulation dysfunc-tion. Women who are underweight have infre-quent or even lack of ovulation. This iscompounded when combined with an eating dis-order or excessive exercise. In a woman with abody mass index (BMI) less than 25, weight lossof as little as 5 percent can be signicant in help-ing to normalize menses and ovulation, especiallyin cases of polycystic ovary syndrome. 2-4Weight gain in an underweight woman is important aswell. Overall, the preponderance of evidence sug-gests that a normal body weight increases thesuccess of assisted reproductive therapies such asin vitro fertilization.KEY CONCEPTS Female infertility is most often due to a previous pelvic inflammatory disease, asymptomatic chlamydia or gonorrhea, or ovulatory dysfunction. Other causes of infertility include endometriosis, diminished oocytes in the ovary, uterine abnor- malities, immunologic factors, chromosomal abnor-malities, environmental chemicals and toxins,cancer chemotherapy, and cancer radiation. Maintain optimal weight. Manage stress. Support fertility with a healthy diet. Natural methods for infertility are most effective in anovulatory dysfunction. Acupuncture can increase pregnancy rates in women undergoing fertility treatment. The decision to pursue conventional fertility treatments depends on age, the duration and cause of the infertility, the results of ovarian- reserve testing, nances, other health issues,emotional well-being, and thoughts and emo-tions about adoption or surrogate options. Seek a fertility specialist if considering conven- tional fertility treatments.PREVENTION Prevent pelvic inflammatory disease by practic- ing safer sex and avoiding sexually transmitted infections. Avoid environmental toxins. Reduce stressors. Avoid smoking and excess alcohol and reduce caffeine. Maintain optimal weight. Minimize exposure to environmental chemicals and toxins. Treat any underlying medical conditions related to infertility (exometriosis/endometriosis, poly- cystic ovarian dysfunction)158WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Focusing on daily exercise and a whole foods diet free of processed foods, alcohol, and caffeineis important to help normalize weight as well asblood sugar. However, a very recent study sug-gests that vigorous exercise of greater than fourhours per week may interfere with the success ofin vitro fertilization (IVF) and that nonexercisersmay have more success with IVF than exercisers. 5 Moderate regular exercise is probably indicatedfor most individuals. In addition, in cases of exercise-related reproductive dysfunction, mostof the evidence suggests that it isn't the intensityof the exercise but the lack of adequate nutrition,specically total calories and protein, that causesthe fertility issues. 6, 7 Smoking, caffeine (even decaf), and alcohol have been linked to decreased fertility, so avoid-ance is important in both partners in coupleswith fertility issues. Nicotine is toxic to thereproductive system. Smoking has been shown tocause both primary and secondary infertility inwomen. 8, 9One study demonstrated that 38 per- cent of nonsmokers conceived in their rst cycleattempt compared to only 28 percent for smok-ers. Smokers were over three times as likely totake over one year to conceive versus nonsmok-ers. Heavy smokers are affected more than lightsmokers. 10Smoking has also been shown to decrease success of fertility treatments.11In one report, female smokers had lower ovarian reservesand required more drug intervention to induceovulation than did the nonsmokers. 12 Other considerations are the genetic damage and chromosomal errors caused by smoking.Cadmium, nicotine, and some of the nicotinemetabolites have been identied in the ovaries(and testes) and genital fluids of smokers. Cellswithin the ovaries are affected by one particularnicotine metabolite, cotinine, which causesoxidative damage and developmental problemsof the follicles. 13, 14 Psychological stressors deserve to be addressed as well since the process of dealing with infertilitycan be very stressful and emotionally taxing.Stress can both contribute to infertility and be a consequence of difculty in conceiving. Manywomen and couples decide to discontinue theirfertility treatments because of too much stress and upset. In addition, research suggests that past or current stress and mental illness, especiallydepression, may be the cause of many cases ofunexplained infertility. This can be especiallyproblematic because continued inability to getpregnant often fuels depression, leading to avicious cycle of emotional upset and a veritableroller coaster of monthly hopes and letdowns. Higher levels of premenstrual tension and stress are associated with lower pregnancy rates. 15 Stress hormones have inhibitory effects on thereproductive system, and, therefore, stress needsto be addressed in anyone receiving fertility serv-ices. In addition, it appears that stress decreasesantioxidants, which are often low in both part-ners in an infertile couple. Any treatment ofinfertility should probably start with stress assess-ment and reduction techniques for both part-ners. Psychological counseling and a variety ofrelaxation techniques including biofeedback,yoga, tai chi, Qi gong, and meditation can behelpful aspects of the treatment plan for anyonewith past or present stress or depression. In the last few years, there has been a lot of public health information available on the importance of avoiding alcohol while pregnant,but when it comes to the influence of alcoholconsumption on female fertility, mild to moder-ate alcohol use has not been well studied. It seems,however, that alcohol does reduce conceptionrates with a dose-related connection. Researchdemonstrated that female alcohol intake was associated with two to three times the risk ofspontaneous abortion, and alcohol intake duringthe week of conception increased the risk of earlypregnancy loss. 16In another study, there was a greater than 50 percent reduction in the proba-bility of conception during a menstrual cycle in which women consumed alcohol. In this samestudy, caffeine consumption did not independently159INFERTILITY affect conception rates, but it may enhance the negative effect of alcohol.17 Caffeinated beverages have been associated with decreased fertility, increased miscarriages, andlower birth weights. 18More than ve cups of coffee per day, or more than 500 mg of caffeine per day,is associated with a delayed time to conception,although we don't really understand the mecha-nism. One possibility is that caffeine may impairestrogen production or the metabolism of estro-gens. 19Substances other than caffeine in coffee, tea, and other beverages may also be responsible forreduced fertility. Numerous caffeinated beverages,including coffee, soft drinks, black and green tea,and even decaffeinated coffee, contain tannins, and some contain even more tannins than regularcoffee. In animal experiments, tannins havereduced fertility in mice and hens. 20, 21 Increasingly, environmental pollution and exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, estrogen-likesubstances, and other chemicals are implicated incases of infertility in men and women. Dependingon the specic exposure, duration, and load, dif-ferent aspects of fertility can be affected. Thesetoxic exposures may affect sperm count, spermformation, sperm viability, ovulation, egg viability, and hormone levels. Nutrition In addition to the issues related to weight, caf- feine, and alcohol mentioned previously, there aresome specic nutritional influences on fertility inwomen. In women who have a short menstrualcycle, increasing soy in the diet or taking soyisoflavone supplements may increase the length ofthe follicular phase and delay ovulation. 22Some- thing as simple as flaxseed can lengthen the lutealphase of the cycle (the second half) and increasethe frequency of ovulatory menstrual cycles inwomen who don't ovulate regularly. 23 As far as weight loss is concerned, one can get seriously confused these days about the value ofcarbohydrate versus protein diets. When it comesto fertility, one study demonstrated that it didnot matter whether the diet was high-carbohydrateor high-protein: both groups who stuck to low-calorie diets lost weight and had improved men-strual cycles and fertility. 24, 25 It is, of course, important to limit certain kinds of sh that have a higher mercury content in preg-nancy, but evidence indicates it may be wise to do the same in cases of infertility. Studies showthat infertile couples consumed more sh and hadhigher levels of mercury in their blood than fertilecouples. 26Consumption of biphenyl-contaminated sh also has an adverse effect on fertility.27Substi- tuting sh oils from a reliable manufacturer forsh consumption is a good way to keep omega-3fatty acids in the diet. Prior to pregnancy, a mini-mum daily intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)and docahexaenoic acid (DHA), found in sh andsh oils, is about 650 mg of each. Wild salmon ranges from 1.0 to 1.5 grams per three-ounce serving, with a little more DHAthan EPA. The different species of salmon (sock-eye, chinook, coho) range in EPA and DHA, andwild sockeye contains approximately 600 mgDHA and 430 mg EPA per three-ounce serving.Whether you take sh oil supplements daily orCaffeine Content Item Caffeine (mg) Coffee, brewed (8 oz) 60-120 Coffee, instant (8 oz) 70Coffee, decaffeinated (8 oz) 2-5 Double espresso (2 oz) 45-100 Tea, black, 5-minute steep (8 oz) 60-100 Tea, green (8 oz) 20 Barq's Root Beer (12 oz) 22 Coca-Cola (12 oz) 34Pepsi (12 oz) 38 Chocolate milk (8 oz) 4 Milk chocolate (1 oz) 1-15Dark chocolate (1 oz) 20 Ben & Jerry's Coffee F udge Frozen Yogurt (4 oz) 42160WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE eat sh several times per week, try to average about 650 mg of EPA and DHA per day. Specicneeds for DHA increase during pregnancy (seeChapter 16). (During pregnancy, cod liver oilmay be a questionable choice due to the highcontent of vitamin A, a teratogen, in sh liver. 28) Nutritional Supplements Vitamin E. Some simple vitamin and min- eral supplementation may be key to fertility in selected women, and because oxidative stressaffects the female reproductive system and conse-quently fertility, antioxidants are important con- siderations in enhancing fertility. Vitamin E is apowerful antioxidant, combating free radicaldamage, and can play a benecial role in femalefertility. Most of the research on vitamin E is per-tinent to male fertility, such as making spermmore fertile. In one study, vitamin E was given toboth men and women and resulted in a signi-cant increase in fertility, and also assisted theachievement and maintenance of pregnancy inwomen with repeated miscarriages. 29Other stud- ies show that adding antioxidants, including vita-mins C and E, to the diet of animals signicantlyreduced the decline of regular ovulation relatedto aging. 30This may have importance for women in their 40s, who begin to experience reducedfertility due to diminished ovarian reserve. Vitamin E 400-800 IU per day Selenium. The mineral selenium is another antioxidant that protects from free radicaldamage. Free radicals are created when normalbiochemical reactions cause oxygen molecules tobecome unstable. They are also formed by smok-ing, barbecuing, and deep-frying food, andmore. Selenium can protect normal tissue fromoxidative damage caused by the free radicals,including preventing chromosome damage. Sele-nium may also be able to provide protectionfrom exposure to toxic heavy metals includingcadmium and lead that can adversely affect sperm development. Selenium mostly affectsmale fertility by maximizing sperm formation,optimizing testosterone production, and increas-ing sperm count. (For more information on malefertility, see the section titled \"Male Fertility\"later in this chapter.) Selenium 100-200 mcg daily Zinc. The most widely studied nutritional supplement for fertility in both men and womenis zinc. Zinc plays a vital role in cell division, anddeciencies are associated with reduced fertility,increased miscarriages, and chromosome damage.Less than optimal zinc levels not only reduce con-ception rates, but babies have lower birth weights,more birth defects, and can have a less developedbrain and nervous system. 31Zinc deciency is especially important for sperm development. Zinc 30 mg per day L-Arginine. L-arginine is an amino acid nec- essary for the synthesis of protein and is foundnaturally in numerous animal protein foods.Arginine supplementation of 16 grams per dayhas been shown to improve uterine blood flowand fertilization rates in women who had previ-ously failed in vitro fertilization. 32Additional effects for enhancing sperm count and spermquality are discussed in the male fertility section. L-Arginine 16 g per day Para-Aminobenzoic Acid (PABA). PABA is a part of the folic acid molecule and is found ineggs, milk, meat, and several grains. The role ofPABA produced by the body is not really known,but as an oral supplement it is FDA-approved for161INFERTILITY difcult conditions such as scleroderma, vitiligo, It is approvedfor use as a sunscreen because it acts as a lter toblock out ultraviolet radiation. In fertility, PABAsupplementation of 100 mg four times dailyresulted in pregnancies in 12 of 16 women witha history of infertility. 33 PABA 100 mg 4 times per day Multiple Vitamin-Mineral. A double-blind trial found that taking a multivitamin-mineral supplement increased female fertility. 34A multivit- amin and mineral in the form of a prenatal prepa-ration has much of what is needed, but womenwho are decient in vitamins like folic acid andB 1235-37 magnesium from the pituitary gland and mildly inhibitsFSH. The result is an indirect ability to raise ormodulate progesterone levels. 39Chaste tree also modulates the secretion of prolactin from thepituitary gland, and in study was sig-nicantly reduced while shortened luteal phasesand progesterone decits were normalized. 40 Chaste Tree Liquid extract 1 tsp per day or 0.6-0.75% standard- ized Racemosa ). stim-ulate pituitary secretion of LH and therefore leadto ovulation and subsequent production of prog-esterone by the corpus luteum. 41, 42Black cohosh may be especially valuable for women in their40s whose FSH levels may be starting to increaseas the ovary ages.Black Rhodiola Rosea ).Rhodiola may enhance fertility. It has been shown to enhancethyroid function without causing hyperthy-roidism in animals, and egg maturation wasenhanced as well. These and other preclinicalresearch led to treating 40 women with amenor-rhea and infertility with rhodiola (100 mg) twicedaily for two weeks. Normal menses were restoredin 25 women, 11 of whom became pregnant. 43, 44 Additional Botanicals. Numerous plants have been used in traditional herbal medicine fortheir ability to regulate the tone of the uterus. Incases of infertility of undetermined cause, theseuterine tonics are thought to prepare the uterusfor implantation of a fertilized egg. These herbsinclude can tonify a weakened uterus by improving the metabolism within the uterus 45as well as regulating hormonal control and improv-ing the timing of the menstrual cycle. 46Blue cohosh can improve the muscular tone of a hypo-tonic uterus and thereby was thought by earlytraditional herbalists to improve fertility. Cramp-bark has been used more in cases of miscarriagerather than actual infertility. It has been used tra-ditionally both as a uterine sedative and a uterinetonic. False unicorn or helonias has been used toimprove uterine tone and decrease what has beencalled pelvic congestion. This herb also tends tobe used more for women who have a history ofmiscarriage or abnormal bleeding during thepregnancy rather than true infertility. Squaw vineis a uterine tonic that increases the circulation toand in the uterus, thereby also reducing uterinecongestion. It can both sedate a hypertonic uterusas well as tonify a hypotonic uterus.162WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Ginseng species are an important considera- tion in infertility due to their ability to enhanceoverall health, vitality, stamina, and endurance.Siberian ginseng may be able to promote regula-tion of reproductive hormones, thereby regulat-ing the timing of ovulation. 47 Phytoestrogens can be particularly useful in the IVF fertility treatments by improving implanta-tion, pregnancy, and delivery rates. 48In addition, phytoestrogens may also reverse the antiestrogeneffects of clomiphene citrate, a medication fre-quently used in the treatment of infertility. 49 A plant that many are not familiar with, tribulus ( Tribulus terrestris ), has been studied as an ovarian stimulant. A study of women takingtribulus every day has demonstrated the ability oftribulus to normalize ovulation, whereby some ofthe women also became pregnant. 50When using the tribulus simultaneously with an ovulation-induction drug, the results with the combineduse were better than the drug by itself.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), also known as chronic anovulatory syndrome, is theassociation of hyperandrogenism with chronicanovulation in women specic underly-ing diseases of the adrenal or pituitary glands.One of the characteristics is infertility, althoughsome PCOS patients may randomly ovulate andare fertile that month. PCOS is a complicateddisorder that takes a very comprehensive, multi-factorial approach. Several herbs may have a role.Flaxseed, nettles, and green tea stimulate sex-hormone-binding globulin, which can theelevated estrogens and androgens. Saw inhibit testosterone dihydrotestos-terone, and smilax and sanguinaria may be able toproduce a progesterone effect. All of these mech-anisms\u2014plus modifying insulin resistance and/orlowering a hypersecretion of insulin, treating theunderlying endocrine problem, and inducingovulation\u2014are the keys to treating PCOS. Additional Therapies Recent research also supports the use of manual soft-tissue therapy for pelvic adhesions, whichmay be implicated in some cases of infertilitywhere there has been a history of surgery, infec-tion, inflammation, or trauma. Adhesions formas a result of the natural healing process but causeproblems by attaching to internal structures andaffecting normal anatomy, mobility, and func-tion. The manual therapy can improve tissuemobility and restore function by breaking thecollagen cross-links that have formed during thehealing process. The specic technique studied isthe Mojzisova method, which combines bothsoft-tissue and osseous manipulation and is usu-ally performed by specially trained physicaltherapists. 51 Celiac disease, which may cause deciencies in a number of nutrients, requires special consid-eration for appropriate diagnosis and manage-ment. Gluten avoidance has been shown toimprove fertility rates in sensitive patients. 52-54A Note About Acupuncture Acupuncture has been shown to improve pregnancy rates in women undergoing fertility treatment. Pelvicultrasound studies have conrmed that acupuncturetreatments can improve pelvic blood flow, and thismay account for its effectiveness. Another possiblemechanism for the ability of acupuncture to improvefemale fertility is a favorable effect on gonadotropin- releasing hormone, and therefore on the secretion of gonadotropins and improved thickening of the liningof the uterus (the endometrium). In addition, acupuncture can also be helpful in improving sperm count, menstrual cycle regulation, ovulation i nduc- tion, and decreasing stress and depression. Acupunc- ture, as with many complementary therapies, is best when combined with conventional treatment whenindicated. Research studies thus far have had smallsample sizes and difculty in providing proper con- trol, so the results should not be overemphasized until further studies can be done. Acupuncture by alicensed professional with experience working with fertility issues appears to be safe and well tolerated.163INFERTILITY Celiac disease may lead to decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, thereby causing decien-cies that may impair male fertility as well. Topical or vaginal progesterone may help normalize menstrual cycles, improve implanta-tion rates, and maintain pregnancies in womenwith history of repeated miscarriages but shouldonly be used under the care of a physician. 55, 56 MALE FERTILITY Low sperm counts have been attributed to a number of factors, including exposure to pesti-cides, welding, antibiotic and other medicationuse, a history of mumps, gastrointestinal com-plaints, decreased intake of fruits and vegetables, family history of female fertility disorders, andnicotine and caffeine intake. 57Therefore, it seems prudent when dealing with a couple whowant to improve their fertility that these factorsbe addressed promptly, especially in patients whohave demonstrated sperm abnormalities. Supplements A number of supplements can improve sperm quality and quantity, including vitamins C, B 12, and E; L-arginine; L-carnitine; selenium; zinc;and folic acid. 58 Vitamins C and E. Vitamin C and other antioxidants can decrease sperm DNA damagethat can interfere with fertility. 59Vitamin C de- ciency has been linked with signicant decreasesin sperm count, motility, and vitality and with anincrease in morphologically abnormal sperm. 60 Vitamin E and selenium have been shown toreduce lipid peroxidation and, therefore, improvesperm quality. One study looked at men who hadnormal sperm counts, but low rates of fertilizationduring in vitro fertilization treatments. After onemonth of daily vitamin E supplementation, thefertilization rates increased from 19 percent to 29 percent, suggesting that the antioxidant effectsof vitamin E may make the sperm more fertile. 61 The combination of oral vitamin C and vita- min E (one gram of each), administered to malepatients with DNA damage who had previouslyfailed fertility treatments for two months, wasshown to decrease DNA-fragmented sperm, anda second fertility treatment led to improvementof clinical pregnancy and implantation rates. 62 Vitamin C 500-3,000 mg 3 times daily Vitamin E 500-1,000 IU per day L-Carnitine. The amino acid L-carnitine is essential for normal functioning of sperm.

Inmen who had sperm counts under 20 million/ml,1,000 mcg of vitamin B 12per day led to an increase to 100 million/ml.64In another study of men with low sperm counts, 6,000 mcg of vita-min B 12per day showed improvements in the sperm counts of 57 percent of them.66 CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH It is important to be aware of the latest conven- tional treatment options for infertility and togain insight into when is it timely to seek special-ized fertility care. The decision to pursue conven-tional modes of infertility treatment depends onage, the duration and cause of the infertility, theresults of the ovarian-reserve assessment/testing,nances, other health issues, emotional stamina,and thoughts and feelings about adoption or surrogate options. T reatment options includeintrauterine insemination (IUI) (with and in vitro fertilization. Intrauterine insemination involves introduc- ing a concentrated suspension of washed sperminto the upper uterine cavity. The success of IUIvaries depending on the cause of infertility. IUIalone, without ovulation induction medications,increases the chance of fertility in a natural cycleby only 1 to 2 percent in couples with unexplainedinfertility. When clomiphene citrate (CC) is addedin these couples, the fertility rate increases to 8 to10 percent.Three main types of medication are used to induce ovulation. Clomiphene citrate is the mostcommon, but aromatase inhibitors (AI) andinjectable gonadotropins are also used when thereis no response to other treatments. Clomiphenecitrate is not only the most commonly used med-ication, but it is also the most effective, inexpen-sive, and easiest to use and requires less monitoringthan the other medications. Clomiphene citrate is primarily used to induce ovulation in womenwith abnormal ovulation patterns, in women witha luteal phase defect (abnormal length of thesecond half of the cycle), or in women who haveunexplained infertility. It is also used to assess ovar-ian reserve. It is not generally effective in womenwho have amenorrhea due to low estrogenic statessuch as hypothalamic amenorrhea. Clomiphene citrate is well tolerated most of the time and does not often have any serious sideeffects. However, because it depletes estrogenreceptors, side effects include hot flashes, nauseaand vomiting, breast discomfort, and headaches.It can also have detrimental effects on cervicalmucus and the endometrial lining. Severe sideeffects occur in less than 2 percent of womenusing it. CC can lead to an increase in multiplegestations at a rate of about 6 to 10 percent.Most of these tend to be twins; less than 1 per-cent are triplets or higher-order multiples. Pastconcern about increasing the risk of ovariancancer has faded with recent research showing noincreased risk. About 80 percent of women usingCC will ovulate, but only 50 percent of those willconceive. Over the course of using CC for six tonine cycles, the rate of pregnancy goes up toabout 70 to 75 percent in those who begin toovulate while on CC. Obesity, elevated androgenstates, and late reproductive age diminish theresponse to CC. Inducing ovulation with gonadotropins is indicated in women who fail to ovulate with CC,don't conceive on CC despite ovulatory cycles,have endometriosis, have unexplained infertility,or are of advanced reproductive age, or if CC is 165INFERTILITY contraindicated. Gonadotropin therapy FSH alone.FSH stimulates the development of multiple fol-licles and therefore carries a higher risk of multi-ple birth than does CC use. Overstimulation(hyperstimulation) of the ovaries is also a risk.These cycles require close monitoring with serialestradiol levels and ultrasounds. This therapy isusually combined with IUI. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are best known for the treatment of breast cancer, but they've beenused more recently to induce ovulation. By usingAIs in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle(the rst half, before ovulation), estradiol levelsare reduced and the hypothalamus and pituitarydon't receive their normal feedback message. This results in increased secretion of the pituitarygonadotropins, which can stimulate ovulation.AIs are usually given at a dose of 2.5 to 5 mg perday on days 3 to 7 of the cycle. AIs are indicatedfor women with infrequent or no ovulation andfor unexplained infertility. Other drugs that are used on a selective basis and along with other therapies includegonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists,and human PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., P.A.) It's important to remember that a signicant number of pregnancies occur in previously infertilecouples without any treatment at all. The mainreason to see a health-care provider is to pursue athorough investigation of the reasons for yourinfertility. Remember, infertility is dened as a fail-ure to conceive after 12 months of frequent inter-course without contraception in women under 35years of age or failure to conceive after 6 months ofintercourse without contraception in women 35 years of age or older. At age 35, and especially afterage 40, time becomes of the essence, so it is a goodidea to seek the advice of a practitioner promptly ifa desired pregnancy is delayed. A practitioner with expertise in fertility can proceed with a methodical evaluation, treat anyabnormalities that are found, provide educationabout the reproductive system, offer advice aboutyour fertility potential, provide counsel regardingall options, and provide clinical and emotionalsupport. Infertility in women lends itself to an integra- tive approach using conventional therapies alongwith natural therapies. A health-care team ofdiverse practitioners\u2014including a reproductiveendocrinologist, a naturopathic physician, andperhaps an acupuncturist specializing in women'shealth and/or a psychotherapist\u2014who are com-fortable working collaboratively provides an opti-mal environment for patient care.

About 90 percent of ICpatients are female. 1IC typically begins in young or middle-aged women. IC is characterized by pelvic and/or perineal pain, urinary urgency, urination at night, painincreased by holding urine (which leads to fre-quency), and a constant urge to urinate. The painof IC can range from a mild burning or discomfortto severe debilitating pain in the bladder, lowerabdomen, perineum, pelvis, vagina, low back, andthighs. Menstruation and sexual intercourse aggra-vate symptoms in as many as 75 percent ofwomen. There are often flare-ups and remissions. When a woman has the classic symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency (more than eight times per day), bladder pain, and urinating at night(more than twice); has no evidence of a urinarytract infection; andreports continuous pain or pain with menstrual flow, then other pelvic diseases such as endometriosis should be given some considera-tion. If urinary leakage (incontinence) is present, anevaluation for the cause of the incontinence shouldbe done. Painful or difcult urination (dysuria)may indicate a urinary tract or vaginal infection ora structural problem in the urinary tract. Diagnostic tests for IC are mostly done to rule out other causes. Keeping a daily diary of when youfeel the need to urinate may be useful. Your health-care practitioner may use the O'Leary-Sant Index,which measures pain, voiding symptoms, and qual-ity of life. A physical exam can help to rule outother diseases and pelvic pathology. Urinalysis andurine cultures are normal in patients with IC. Ifblood is visible in the urine under a microscope,then cytology tests should be done. Vaginal and cer-vical cultures are done if the practitioner suspects asexually transmitted disease. Some urology experts,especially urogynecologists, may choose to recom-mend a potassium sensitivity test, which instillspotassium into the bladder, to see if the bladder hasincreased in permeability. If the usual pain getsworse, the test is considered positive for IC. On cystoscopy, bladder ulcers called Hunner's ulcers and reduced bladder capacity are detected inless than 10 percent of individuals with IC. If theseulcers are seen, this is considered denitive for IC.More commonly, IC is characterized by petechialbladder mucosal hemorrhages, inflammation, andno ulcerations. IC is more common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colon, abdominalcramping, hysterectomy, rheumatoid arthritis,bromyalgia, hay fever, asthma, and allergies tofoods and medications. Drug and surgical interventions have been used to treat this condition with limited successand potential side effects. Despite continuedresearch on IC, safe, noninvasive treatmentoptions are lacking. Several causes have been proposed for IC, although none have been proven. The contribut-ing factors fall into two main categories: bladderepithelial permeability and inflammation. Theexact causes are difcult to distinguish and arelikely to be interrelated in any one patient.Because of this, a variety of treatment options maybe used. These include vitamin A (as palmitate),bioflavonoids (from citrus), L-arginine, quercetin,N-acetyl glucosamine, corn silk, kava root, andOregon grape root. Although the cause of IC is unknown, it is important to consider the possible causes to 11INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

Because IC is a multifactorial syn-drome, it is likely that several of these factors maybe true in your case. Short descriptions of possi-ble factors in IC follow: Bladder epithelial permeability. One of the more recent theories for IC is that the bladder epithelium is abnormally permeable,allowing components of urine to penetrate andirritate the bladder. The most common explana-tion of the permeability is that the bladderepithelium is decient in glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Several studies haveshown that IC patients had decreased levels ofglycoproteins and GAG in both the bladder andthe urine. Mast cell activation. This theory proposes that bladder mast cells are activated and releasehistamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, andother substances that affect bladder smoothmuscle and sensory nerve terminals. Several stud-ies have shown that IC patients have increasedurine levels of these mast cell mediators. Some IC bladder biopsy samples contain mast cells, but itis known that these cells are not specic to ICand can also be found in other bladder disorders. Autoimmune causes. Autoimmune theories are based on detecting antinuclear antibodies,increased urinary excretion of eosinophiliccationic protein, and the tendency of IC to affectwomen. Other evidence includes IgM in theuroepithelium, immune deposits in vessel walls,and T and B cell nodules in patients with IC. Inflammation. Most biopsies of IC bladders show mild chronic inflammation to signicantinltration of T cells, B cells, plasma cells, neu-trophils, eosinophils, and mast cells. Inflammatorymediators such as interleukin-6 are also increased. Infection. The possibility of an infectious cause has been suggested by the presence ofmicroorganisms embedded in the bladder wallof patients with IC and bacterial ribosomalmRNA in tissues of bladder biopsies. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Bladder sympathetic innervation may be interrupted byinjury to peripheral nerves from prior UTIs,hysterectomy, or childbirth. This may lead to anincreased transmission of pain impulses fromthe bladder and reduced circulation, facilitatinginflammatory cell inltration and leading tobladder ulceration, brosis, and atrophy. Each of these theories has supportive and detractive evidence. As stated earlier, the cause ofIC may vary in different people, or multiple fac-tors may be in operation. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Therapeutic options, both conventional and alternative, are as varied as the theories on thecause of IC. Almost no studies have been done tohelp practitioners identify which patients wouldlikely respond best to which treatments. T reat-ment choices are made individually for eachpatient, and in most cases, several treatmentsKEY CONCEPTS IC is a noninfectious chronic condition charac- terized by pelvic and/or perineal pain, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, bladder pain, andurination at night. IC is difcult to diagnose with any test; tests are mostly done to rule out other causes of thesymptoms. There is no proven cause, but bladder permeabil- ity and inflammation direct the variety of treat- ment options available. PREVENTION No specic prevention strategies have been established, but minimizing bladder irritants seems logical. Classic offenders are coffee,chocolate, alcohol, carbonated drinks, citrus fruits, and tomatoes.169INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS should be used concurrently until symptom relief occurs. After that, a careful, gradual process ofreducing dosages or simplifying the treatmentinterventions is appropriate. The most commonly used treatment by both conventional and alternative practitioners isdietary changes. Patients with IC will oftenreport that certain foods increase their symp-toms. Classic offenders are coffee, chocolate,alcohol, carbonated drinks, citrus fruits, andtomatoes. Acid or potassium content is often sus-pected as the mechanism. Responses to thesefoods is hugely variable, and there is no consis-tent diet that works for all IC patients. The following natural treatment plan may seem complex, but consider that the averagepatient with IC has symptoms three to four yearsprior to diagnosis. In my experience with treatingIC patients over a one-year period with this proto-col, signicant improvements are usually seenwithin the rst three months. Continued improve-ment (75 percent better or greater) is seen after sixmonths while maintaining the same doses. Withinthe second six months and beyond, gradual reduc-tion of dosage can be done on an individual basis.I have found that IC patients are so thrilled withtheir improvement that they hesitate to reduce thesupplements and do so carefully. With this naturalmedicine approach, IC patients can proceed withoptimism and be reassured that there is likely helpfor their very chronic condition. Nutrition Some foods and beverages seem to exacerbate symptoms for many women. Although not fullyinvestigated, about 53 percent of patients withIC associate a flare-up of their symptoms withdietary influences, especially citrus fruits andother acidic foods and beverages. 2Many women nd it helpful to avoid certain foods. If you avoidthese foods for two weeks and your symptomsimprove, this is good news for the bladder.Making these dietary changes is a good self-helpstrategy in managing this condition.Glycosaminoglycans and Bladder Epithe- lial Permeability. The bladder epithelial perme- ability hypothesis is a compelling and active areaof research. This theory asserts that the bladderepithelium is abnormally permeable in IC, sourine components penetrate and irritate thebladder. Several lines of indirect evidence sup-port this hypothesis: 1. Some IC patients have increased pain after eating foods such as citrus fruits and toma-toes that are acidic and high in potassium. 2. Some IC patients have pain when potassium chloride is instilled into the bladder, whilemost healthy controls do not. 3, 4 3. Taking fluorescein orally yields higher blood fluorescein levels in IC patients than in con-trols, attributed to increased fluoresceinreabsorption across the bladder wall. 5 4. In one of the only direct bladder permeability studies, radio-labeled diethylenetriamine pen-taacetic acid (DTPA) was instilled in the blad-der and blood samples showed that ICpatients had higher blood levels of DTPA thanFoods to Avoid Alcohol Lentils Apples Lima beans Aspartame LimesAvocados Mayonnaise BananasNuts* Cantaloupes Onions Carbonated drinks Oranges Cheese** Peaches Chicken livers Pickled herringChilies/spicy foods Pineapple Chocolate Plums Citrus fruits Prunes Coffee Raisins Corned beefRye bread Cranberries Saccharine Grapefruit Sour cream Grapes Soy sauce Tomatoes GuavaStrawberries Vinegar LemonsTea Yogurt *Except almonds, peanuts, and pine nuts ricotta, and cream cheeseSource: K.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) normally line the epithelium and are thought to con-tribute to the permeability barrier. Severalstudies have shown that IC patients havedecreased levels of GAGs in both the blad-der and urine. 7-12 GAG supplementation is used to treat IC based on the rationale that the GAG may supple-ment or replace the decient epithelial GAGs.The GAG studies treatment efcacy over placebofor each of these treatments. No studies havebeen published on over-the-counter preparationsof chondroitin sulfates and glucosamine pr epara- tions; however, a link has been established betweenchondroitin and IC. 22A GAG in the form of N-acetyl glucosamine or glucosamine sulfate canbe used as part of a multifactorial approach torepair the bladder epithelium.

Vitamin A has been shown to inhibit mast cell growth and proliferation, anddeciency may aggravate the clinical manifesta-tions of inflammatory reactions due to mastocy-tosis. 23-26Vitamin A also helps to elevate urinary nitric oxide levels. (See the section on L-arginineand inflammation for more information on therole of nitric oxide in IC.) In addition, vitamin Adeciency has been linked to a higher level oftissue damage due to inflammation, both as anetiological and aggravating factor, and supple-mentation may decrease inflammation in thesecases. 22, 27, 28 Vitamin A also plays an essential role in maintaining and protecting epithelial integrityand mucosal surfaces and their secretions,including those of the bladder. 26, 29 Vitamin A may also be of benet in the man- agement of IC as it is essential to proper immunefunction 30, 31 and stimulates epithelial repair and growth.30, 32, 33 Vitamin A increases immune response mainly due to its effect on T-helper cells.34 In addition, evidence supports the theory that Vitamin A may also attend to the GAG repair. 35 Vitamin A 5,000 IU per day L-Arginine and Inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) may play an important role in the patho-genesis of IC in that it activates the cyclooxyge-nase (COX) enzymes, leading to production ofproinflammatory prostaglandins that exacerbatethe inflammatory response. 36NO also plays a role in IC in the regulation of smooth musclerelaxation, immunological responses, and blad-der neurotransmission and blood flow. 37, 38 Luminal nitric oxide is elevated in IC, correspon-ding to symptom severity, and can be used as amarker for mucosal inflammation in suchcases. 39-41Nutrients such as arginine (a precursor to NO synthase) and antioxidants like vitamin A help to elevate urinary nitric oxide levels andmay play an important role in the managementof interstitial cystitis. 36, 40, 42, 43 Oral supplemen- tation with arginine changes urine levels ofNO, 44and three studies demonstrated symptom improvement over placebo.40, 45, 46 Another study reported that a six-month course of oral L-arginine increased nitric oxide-related enzymesand metabolites in the urine of patients with IC.This result was correlated with a decrease in ICsymptoms. 37 helpreduce bladder pain and urinary urgency in ICpatients when it is used with acidic foods andbeverages. Calcium glycerophosphate, sold underthe trade name Prelief, is a food-grade mineral,available in granulated form. When added toacidic foods and beverages, it removes the acidand helps to reduce bladder pain and urinaryurgency associated with these foods. However, from a naturopathic medicine standpoint, this should be done sparingly. This islike taking a heartburn medicine but still eatingspicy Polish sausages. The food is still aggravatingyou, you are just temporarily protected from theimmediate bodily response. The fact that thesefoods are causing symptoms means that they arecausing irritation and inflammation. Calcium Glycerophosphate (Prelief) 2 packets 3 times daily with meals Add 2 packets of powder to a serving of acidic food or beverage. (It will not dissolve in alcoholic drinks.)Also take 2 packets at bedtime if desired. You can use more if needed. Botanicals Kava ( Kava Methysticum ).A permeable or \"leaky\" bladder may allow chronic diffusion ofurinary potassium, leading to sensory symptomsand tissue damage. This appears to be a majorfactor in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis. 47 Kava is known historically as a urinary antispas-modic, and recent reports support its use as asmooth muscle relaxer, likely through inhibitionof calcium channels. 48In addition, kava blocks sodium and calcium ion channels in neural tissueand thereby alters potassium potentials. 47Abnor- mally elevated potassium levels may induceheightened nervous and electrical sensitivity andincrease mucosal sensitivity in patients with IC.Kava may help to reduce this effect by alteringthe potassium channel activity. In addition, IChas been reported to be aggravated by stress 49, 50 and associated with panic disorder,51two condi- tions that may be ameliorated by kava.52 Kava Kavalactones: 70 mg 3 times daily Quercetin. Another proinflammatory culprit in IC is the mast cell, an immune modulatory cellthat secretes its damaging contents in a processcalled degranulation in response to factors such asstress and toxins. Mast cells can directly damagethe bladder mucosa, leading to bladder inflamma-tion. Some researchers speculate that treatment of IC must include mast cell stabilizers. 45, 53, 54 Quercetin and other bioflavonoids may be helpfulin mast cell stabilization, inhibiting degranulationand the release of damaging mediators. 55-59 Quercetin and other bioflavonoids also con- tribute in other ways to mitigate the inflammatoryprocess. Quercetin may be benecial to connectivetissue by limiting inflammation and associatedtissue degradation, improving circulation, and promoting a strong collagen matrix. 60, 61Quercetin also plays a part in modulation of the inflamma-tory response, at least in part by modulating pros-taglandin synthesis and cytokine production. 62 Quercetin 500-1,000 mg twice specicallyin mucosal membranes, and, like vitamin A, maybe effective in treating allergic and inflammatoryconditions like IC due to its effect on T-helpercells. 63, 64 In addition, evidence suggests that berberine may also decrease inflammation byinhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism inendothelial cells. 65172WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Oregon Grape Root 500 mg per day Corn Silk ( Zea Mays ).Another botanical, corn silk, has been found to be a potent inhibitorof proinflammatory cytokines as well. 66Corn silk also has historical evidence for its application in avariety of urinary conditions and may be helpful inthe treatment of IC due to its demulcent effects. 67 Corn Silk 300 mg 3 times daily Additional Botanicals. Other botanicals might be considered for their ofcinale ). It can be crucial to use herbs that provide pain relief while the other therapies attempt torepair the lining of the bladder. Common MEDICINE APPROACH The most likely conventional IC expert will be the urogynecologist. Dietary modications arestandard recommendations. A diet low in acidicfoods and avoidance of beverages such as coffee,tea, and carbonated and/or alcoholic drinks canbe helpful in reducing symptoms. The practitioneralso will often recommend Prelief, a nutritional supplement discussed earlier in this chapter.Sample Treatment Plan See the Resources section for formulation sources.

Other oral medications for pain), hydrox-yzine, antispasmodics, muscle relaxants, andnumerous pain medications. PPS is the most stud-ied conventional medicine for IC. Unfortunately,it only shows about a 30 percent efcacy rate. Medicine can also be instilled into the bladder. Until PPS, DMSO was the only approved med-ication for IC. The medication is placed directlyinto the bladder through a catheter weekly orbiweekly. Another intravesicular (within the blad-der) therapy is Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).The mechanism is unknown, but the solutionmay modulate the immune response in the blad-der. Intravesical heparin, hyaluronic acid, andintravesical PPS are other options. Experimental therapies are being explored, including electrical nerve stimulation to activatethe inhibitory circuits and decrease the sensationof pain, intravesical injection of botulinium toxin,gene therapy, and nerve growth-factor inhibitors.Surgical interventions are currently considered alast resort. These include surgical removal of visi-ble ulcers, laser denervation, or removing a part ofthe colon and attaching it to the bladder toincrease bladder capacity. These surgical proce-dures are still associated with a high rate of relapse,persistent pain, permanent or intermittent needfor catheterization, and additional surgeries.SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) The symptoms of IC can range in severity from mild and intermittent to chronic and very severe.The main reason to see a licensed health-carepractitioner is to diagnose the cause of the symp-toms. That is easier said than done, and often IC symptoms are misdiagnosed as a urinary tractinfection, endometriosis, a sexually transmittedinfection, or a vaginal infection. On the otherhand, sometimes these, rather than IC, are thecause of the symptoms. Rarely, bladder cancermay be the cause if blood in the urine is present. The diagnosis of IC is based upon the pre- senting signs and symptoms. A good medical history, physical exam, and tests are done todetermine the cause of the symptoms. A cys-toscopy or intravesical potassium sensitivity testmay be recommended. Once the diagnosis of IChas been made, either with certainty or as a pos-sibility, treatment can proceed. IC is a conditionthat lends itself well to alternative therapies\u2014notonly because they typically work as well or betterthan the conventional options, but also becausethere is no medical danger if conventional treat-ment options are declined. Whether alternativeor conventional medicine or an integration of thetwo is used, symptom improvement is the ulti-mate measure of success.This page intentionally left blank 175OVERVIEW There are currently 43 million American women who are postmenopausal, and their numbers areexpected to increase to 60 million by the year2020. By the year 2015, nearly 50 percent of thewomen in the United States will be menopausal.This rapid expansion in the menopausal popula-tion is related both to an increase in longevity (toan average life expectancy of approximately 84years) and to the maturation of the baby boomergeneration into the menopausal age group. Understanding the terminology and deni- tions can be helpful in understanding the naturalbiological process of aging. The term menopause is derived from meno (month, menses) plus pausis (pause, cessation); in other words, it is a pause inmenstruation. A spontaneous or natural meno-pause is the permanent cessation of menstruationfollowing the loss of ovarian activity and isstrictly dened as the point after 12 consecutivemonths of no menses following the nal men-strual period. The average age of menopause hasbeen estimated to be between 50 and 52. In theMassachusetts Women's Health Study, the largestand most comprehensive study of middle-agedwomen, the median age for menopause was 51.3years. 1The range is generally from age 40 to 58 years of age, although some women reach meno-pause prematurely in their thirties and a few aslate as in their sixties. Despite our aging popula-tion and greater life expectancy, the age of meno-pause has not changed in the last few centuries.Three important factors influence the age ofmenopause: current smoking, familial factors,and genetic factors involving the estrogen recep-tors. Other influences may also affect the timingof menopause: increased body mass index (beingoverweight), more than one pregnancy, history ofno pregnancy, toxic chemical exposures, treat-ment of childhood cancers with chemotherapyand radiation, epilepsy, and cognitive scores inchildhood (the higher the score, the later themenopause). There appears to be no linkbetween age of menopause and history of hor-monal contraception, socioeconomic or maritalstatus, race, or age of rst menstrual cycle. Premenopause refers to the period of life from the rst menstrual period up to the nal men-strual period, but this term is often used incor-rectly. To avoid confusion, it's probably best tonot even use this term. Perimenopause is the period immediately before menopause. Peri- menopause starts with changes in the menstrualcycle and ends 12 months after the nal men-strual period. In the early stage of peri-menopause, the menstrual cycle length begins tovary by as much as 7 days from the normal cycle.So, rather than having a 28-day cycle, maybe thecycle begins to be a 20- to 21-day cycle from day1 of the menses to the next day 1. In the laterstage of perimenopause, we start to see two ormore missed menses in a year, and the cyclebeing 60 days or more. Some people call peri-menopause the menopause transition or the climacteric . The average age of onset of the peri- menopause or menopause transition is age 47.5. For most women, this transition lasts about fouryears. Only a very small number of women stophaving their menses abruptly. Most of us experi-ence the irregular pattern of bleeding. Postmenopause begins after the time of the nal menstrual period, whether it was a naturalor medically induced menopause, and continuesuntil the end of life. It is dened as stage /H110011 (early postmenopause) and stage /H110012 (late post- menopause). The early postmenopause stage is12MENOPAUSE CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

Menopause should be regarded as a normal, natural event of aging except when it is broughtabout by surgery, medications, or radiation. As wediscuss problems that can be associated with meno-pause for some women, it can quickly be viewed asa disease process and a sign of pending fragility, dis-ability, and even death. It is important to appreciatethat menopause is or can be the beginning of a new phase of life, with fewer family obligations,new options, new learning opportunities, and newadventures. With a proper understanding of peri-menopause and menopause, and an adequatelyinformed and respectful health-care practitioner,the majority of menopausal women can be healthyand happy and use this time period as an opportu-nity to foster a preventive health-care plan andlifestyle as well as an opportunity to assess their life. Women can enter menopause by several dif- ferent routes and pass through more than onephase. Premature menopause (also called prema- ture ovarian failure, or POF) is a combination ofsecondary amenorrhea, menopausal symptoms,and a persistent elevation in follicle-stimulatinghormone (FSH) levels greater than 20 IU/Lbefore 40 years of age. One in 100 womenbetween the ages of 15 and 40 will spontaneouslydevelop premature menopause. 2In two-thirds of cases, no apparent cause for the premature ovar-ian failure will be found. 3These cases are called idiopathic. In one-third of cases, causes of prema-ture menopause include metabolic and systemicdisease, chromosome abnormalities, immunologicdisorders, infections, lack of blood supply to theovaries, cigarette smoking, ovariectomy or bilateraloophorectomy (both ovaries removed), pelvic irra-diation, and chemotherapy. Some women may experience a temporary menopause in which normal ovarian function is interrupted temporarily and the menses stops (for12 months or more). Some medications that areused to treat conditions such as endometriosis orcertain cancers may cause this.The term induced menopause is used when the menses ceases after surgical removal of bothovaries. This is referred to as ovariectomy orbilateral oophorectomy and may or may notinclude the removal of the uterus (hysterectomy).A hysterectomy is actually only the surgicalremoval of the uterus. These surgeries can bedone separately or together. The incidence ofhysterectomy and oophorectomy in the UnitedStates is substantial. Women who undergo abilateral oophorectomy have an increased risk ofdeveloping osteoporosis, coronary artery disease,and/or atrophy of the genital area at a youngerage. Probably the most dramatic entry intomenopause is to have both ovaries removed. From 1994 through 1999, an estimated 3,525,237 hysterectomies were performed amongU.S. women aged 15 years or older. 4During this time, the overall hysterectomy rate for U.S.women was 5.5 per 1,000 women. The hysterec-tomy rates for women living in the South (6.5 per1,000) is signicantly higher than those in theNortheast (4.3) or West (4.8). For women livingin the Midwest, it was 5.4 per 1,000. About 55percent of women who had a hysterectomy had abilateral oophorectomy (both ovaries removed).Uterine broids, endometriosis, and prolapse ofthe uterus are the most frequent reasons for thesesurgeries in women aged 15 years and older. Withnew laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies, ovariesare removed more easily (and this is unfortunate ifthe ovaries are healthy) and removal of the ovarieshas increased signicantly, from 20.4 percent in1994 to 42.5 percent in 1999. When the ovaries are removed, the onset of menopause is immediate. The sudden onset ofhot flashes, mood changes, sleep disturbances,and loss of sexual arousal is accompanied by aslower onset of fatigue, headaches, dry skin, boneand joint pain, loss of vaginal lubrication, andpainful vaginal sex. This overwhelming barrageof symptoms results from the sudden drop inhormone production\u2014estrogen, progesterone,and testosterone.177MENOPAUSE Women who have had a hysterectomy but still retain one or both ovaries will go throughmenopause more naturally most of the time,although sometimes earlier than they would haveotherwise. Without the uterus and the monthlybleeding, it may be harder to know when meno-pause arrives. All the typical symptoms canoccur, though. If you are fortunate to not haveany of the overt menopausal symptoms, you canestimate that you'll have gone through meno-pause somewhere between ages 48 and 53. TheFSH blood test may be used to determine meno-pausal status. Other methods of inducing menopause include chemotherapy, medications, or pelvicradiation therapy, which causes the ablation ofovarian function. Women who have been treatedwith chemotherapy may go into menopause eithertemporarily or permanently. About 30 percent ofthese women will have a return of their mensessometime within the rst year. Irradiation of thepelvic or abdominal area can also induce meno-pause. Tamoxifen, another cancer drug usedmostly for women who have breast cancer, caneither induce menopause in premenopausalwomen or increase menopause symptoms in post-menopausal women. Several drugs can induce menopause that is reversible once the drugs are discontinued. Theseinclude Lupron and Synarel, which are usuallygiven to suppress menses in the case of endome-triosis and to shrink broids before surgery.Menopausal symptoms tend to be not as severe asin surgical menopause but worse than naturalphysiologic menopause. Fortunately, all of the sex hormones are not lost with menopause or even with surgical meno-pause. For example, about 50 percent of ourtestosterone comes from the ovaries and adrenalglands; the other 50 percent comes from manydifferent parts of the body, including the liver, theskin, and the brain. These tissues manufacturetestosterone from precursor hormones that aremade in the ovaries and the adrenals. In otherwords, the ovaries and the adrenal glands are responsible for producing all of a woman's testos-terone, either directly or indirectly. The adrenalglands also produce androstenedione. Andro-stenedione is converted to estrogen (estrone) inthe body fat and to a lesser degree in some othertissues and organs including the muscle and skin.For some women, this source of estrogen is ade-quate to counter some of the menopausal symp-toms, and they have an easier time. Although this adrenal source of hormonal sup- port is a blessing, the adrenal glands produce theirmaximal amount of androgens in the presence offully functioning ovaries. The function of thecortex of the adrenal glands is linked to the func-tions of the ovaries due to their shared originalgroup of cells in the developing embryo. If youdon't have your ovaries, then the adrenal glandswill not produce their potential amount of andro-gens. In natural menopause, the ovaries continueproducing androgens (typically referred to as malehormones) that help maintain the potential forsexual arousal. 5Several studies have shown that surgically induced menopausal women have lowersexual desires and subjective arousal compared towomen who have retained their ovaries; treatingthese post-oophorectomy women with estrogenand androgens results in a greater sexual responsethan treatment with estrogen alone. 6Surgical menopause may also have a psychological impacton women. Not only is this related to the suddenchange in hormone status, but the severity ofdepression that may develop can often be corre-lated to body image, sexual identity, cultural back-ground, and family issues. 7 The natural transition from the reproductive years to the postmenopausal years is not necessar-ily a smooth one, even though it is a normalprocess of aging. Though not a disease, there canbe health problems associated with menopause.For many women, symptoms of these hormonalchanges occur intermittently for a number ofyears. Dr. Susan Love calls this period \"pubertyin reverse.\" Just as the hormonal highs and lows178WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE of puberty brought sleepiness, acne, mood swings, and unpredictable menses, this end of the spectrum with its own hormonal fluctuationsmay bring hot flashes, insomnia, mood swings,acne, poor concentration and memory, andunpredictable menses again. No two women's menopause transition is alike. Many women begin to experience an array ofphysical, mental, and emotional symptoms longbefore they meet the denition of menopause. During perimenopause, several biological changes occur: The number of ovarian eggs (oocytes) reaches very low levels The menstrual cycle begins to vary, usually shortening from one menses to the next. The levels of FSH in the body increase. This rise is one of the rst signs of an aging repro-ductive system. Health-care practitioners oftenmeasure FSH levels to determine if one'ssymptoms are related to menopause. There aretwo problems with this test, however: varyingpatterns of FSH may occur even in the samewoman, and the FSH is often normal even ina perimenopausal woman. Ovarian production of estradiol, proges- terone, and testosterone decreases with theonset of true menopause. Although hormone levels will eventually decrease, lower estrogen levels aren't experi-enced until six months to one year beforetrue menopause. It's only in the last year ofperimenopause that estrogen levels begin todecrease. Near menopause, estrogen levelsrise very high and then drop very rapidly.Declining progesterone levels precededeclining estrogen levels. Some of the peri-menopause symptoms may in fact be due tolowered progesterone levels or a relativechange in the relationship of estrogen toprogesterone. Eventually, the lower levels of estrogen are no longer adequate to cause a buildup of theuterine lining, and there is not enough tissue to produce a menses. The specic reason why menopause occurs is the ultimate loss of follicles in the ovaries.This leads to the loss of progesterone pro-duction and declining estrogen influence.This coincides with an increase in FSH andLH (luteinizing hormone). The symptoms of decreased hormone levels and perimenopause are varied, unpredictable,and often go unrecognized as perimenopausalsymptoms. The signs and symptoms of peri-menopause can include menstrual irregularities,hot flashes, vaginal dryness and thinning, skinchanges, fatigue, decreased libido, mood swings,depression, changes in memory and cognition,sleep disturbance, hair loss on the head, hairgrowth and acne on the face, heart palpitations,nausea, headaches, urinary tract infections, jointpains, and the beginning stages of osteoporosisand heart disease. Menopausal Symptoms The transition to menopause usually begins sometime in a woman's 40s. Symptoms tend tobegin and increase over a span of months and canlast about four to seven years. Seventy-ve to 90percent of women will have transient symptomsthat resolve within this time period and stopwithout any treatment. Maybe 10 to 25 percentwill have symptoms that persist. Vaginal drynessand thinning and problems related to this tendnot to be transient and in fact tend to get worsewith time. The changes associated with menopause can be mild, moderate, or severe. Some women mayhave no signicant menopausal symptoms, andothers will have symptoms that are progressiveand problematic for many years. The mostcommon prevalent symptoms are vasomotorsymptoms (hot flashes and night sweats), sleepdisturbances, and vaginal dryness. A comprehen-sive list of symptoms includes the following:179MENOPAUSE Decline in fertility (perimenopause) Irregular bleeding (perimenopause) Vasomotor symptoms Sleep disturbances Urinary leakage, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, infection, pelvicrelaxation) Vulvovaginal changes (dryness, irritation, discomfort during sexual activity, discharge,itching, inflammation, infection) Headaches Mood swings Depression and anxiety Memory changes Sexual function effects Body aches Skin, mouth, eye dryness Fatigue More rare symptoms might include voice impair- ment, shoulder problems, and sometimes strange,rare, and peculiar symptoms that don't seem to berelated to anything else but are due to hormonalchanges. These might include numbness and tingling sensations, dizziness, and nerve pain, toname a few. Hot Flashes, Night Sweats. Hot flashes and night sweats in perimenopausal and menopausalwomen are often referred to clinically as vasomo-tor symptoms. The traditional vasomotor symp-toms, commonly referred to as hot flashes andreported by about 85 percent of menopausalWestern women, are related to the decline in ovar-ian function. 8Hot flashes are the most common symptom associated with the menopausal periodand second to irregular menses during the peri-menopausal period. We still do not understandthe physiology of hot flashes, the mechanism oflowered estrogen levels and hot flashes, the averageage of onset, triggers, duration, frequency, or whythey are prominent in some cultures and absent inothers. A few triggers may affect the frequencyand/or severity of hot flashes in some women.Stress, hot or spicy foods, hot drinks, warm envi-ronments, alcohol, and caffeine are the most common triggers. Hot flashes are sudden, tran-sient episodes ranging from just feeling warm oroverheated to intense heat and perspiration.Women tend to describe a wavelike sensation overthe body, particularly of the upper torso, face, andhead. If the hot flashes occur at night and are asso-ciated with what can be drenching perspiration,they are called night sweats. The number of women in the United States who are affected by hot flashes is remarkable.About 75 percent of women will experience hotflashes, and 15 percent are severely affected. 9The occurrence of hot flashes is highest in the rsttwo years postmenopause, although informationis scanty on the total time over which hot flashesare experienced. Women with surgically inducedmenopause often report particularly persistent,more intense, and more frequent hot flashes. Ithas been determined by one large study that formost women hot flashes last about 2 years,although some women experience them for 5 to10 years. 9As many as 15 percent of women may still report hot flashes 16 years after menopause.Hot flash frequency is particularly variable andranges anywhere from several episodes in a yearto every hour throughout each day. Not all cultures report the same incidence of hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms. Forexample, Japanese and Indonesian women reportfar fewer hot flashes than do women from Westernsocieties. 10Mayan women in the Yucatan do not report any symptoms at menopause other thanmenstrual cycle irregularity. 11Many researchers have attributed these differences to biological,psychological, social, and cultural factors. The clearest explanation for hot flashes is that they appear to be the body's response to a suddenbut transient downward resetting of the body'sthermostat, which is located in the hypothala-mus. 12This temporary alteration of the set point would cause the sensation of intense heat andflushing. What we don't know is what triggersthis event. A logical correlation between low180WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE estrogen levels and hot flashes exists. Estrogen levels have been found to be lower in premeno-pausal women with hot flashes than in thosewithout hot flashes. 13However, not all studies are consistent, and some women never have hotflashes, while others have persistent ones, and yet others have them only sporadically. Prior topuberty, girls have low estrogen levels, but nothot flashes. Also, hot flashes are reported duringpregnancy, when the estrogen level is high. Someresearchers believe that hot flashes are due to animbalance in beta-endorphins and other opiatesin the brain that in turn may influence the tem-perature regulation center. 14Estrogen and prog- esterone may alter the activity of these naturallyoccurring opiates, and it is possible that lowerlevels of estrogen and progesterone cause a with-drawal of opioids, triggering a hot flash. What may seem like a hot flash due to peri- menopause or menopause may in rare cases becaused by another condition such as thyroid disease, epilepsy, infection, insulin-producingtumors, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid syn-dromes, leukemia, pancreatic tumors, autoim-mune disorders, or allergic disorders. Irregular Uterine Bleeding. In the transition phase of menopause, changes in the amount offlow and the frequency of the flow are the mainsigns of perimenopause. These changes and irregu-larities in the cycle are due to decreased frequencyof ovulation and unpredictable fluctuating levels ofthe ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone.The menses can become lighter or heavier, bleed-ing for fewer days, even less than two, or more daysthan your usual length. The cycles can becomeshorter by at least a week, as well as longer than thepattern you have become accustomed to. At somepoint, most women will just skip one or moremenstrual cycles. Basically, changes can occur anywhich way, and each woman will have to identifywhat is an irregular bleeding pattern for her. Even though these hormonal changes are normal, the woman with abnormal uterinebleeding needs to be evaluated by a licensed health-care practitioner. Fortunately, in the vastmajority of cases there is nothing serious, and thesolutions are straightforward and effective. Attimes, the bleeding can become too chaotic, and,of course, there are other causes of abnormalbleeding other than perimenopause such as auterine polyp, hypothyroid, uterine broids, andendometriosis, to name a few. Chapter 1, onabnormal bleeding, is an important chapter toread to help understand these distinctions.Normal menstrual blood loss is approximately 40mL. Blood loss greater than 80 mL is consideredheavy, especially if there are blood clots or if youbecome anemic. If the bleeding is prolonged,longer than seven days, and/or the cycle is nowshorter than 21 days, and/or bleeding or spottingoccurs between menses or after sexual activity,then these symptoms require investigation by ahealth-care practitioner and effective treatments. Although perimenopausal women are at risk for endometrial hyperplasia (a thickening of thelining of the uterus), the majority with abnormalperimenopausal bleeding do not have hyperplasia.In postmenopausal women who bleed and whoare not taking HRT, the bleeding is generally dueto atrophy (thinning of the lining of the uterus).Any uterine bleeding that occurs after the actualmenopause (12 consecutive months since the lastmenstrual period) should be reported to yourpractitioner. In women on HRT, abnormal bleed-ing can be due to too little estrogen, too muchestrogen, too little progesterone, or too muchprogesterone. It is important to see your licensedhealth-care practitioner in order to determine thecorrect hormonal solution and also to determine iffurther testing with a pelvic ultrasound and/oruterine biopsy is necessary. These issues are dis-cussed further in Chapter 1. Fertility Changes. The decline in fertility during perimenopause is related to several factors,including that word we don't want to hear, \"aging\"of the ovaries and the uterus. Other specic181MENOPAUSE changes are going on as well: rising levels of follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) and changes in thefeedback mechanism that regulates the menstrualcycle. This increase in FSH is a reflection of thelower number of follicles within the ovaries and theless viable quality of the follicles. Fewer follicles,poor quality, and irregular or lack of ovulation con-tribute to this decline in fertility. The blood level ofFSH on day 3 of the menstrual cycle is a good indi-cator of infertility related to aging ovaries. On the other hand, some women mistakenly think that if they are in their mid- to late 40s orearly 50s, having some perimenopause symptoms,and haven't menstruated for a few months, theycannot become pregnant. On the contrary,unplanned pregnancies are common during thistime period. If pregnancy is not desired, contracep-tion must be used until you have not had a mensesfor 12 consecutive months, or until levels of FSHare consistently above 30 IU/L. Insomnia/Sleep Disturbances. Sleep prob- lems are especially common in perimenopausalwomen, increasing after age 40 and plateauing byage 50. Sleep problems also contribute to fatigue,poor concentration, low motivation, irritability,depression, and anxiety. Insomnia comes in manysizes and shapes, including difculty falling asleep,difculty staying asleep, restless sleep, and wakingearly and not being able to go back to sleep. Theseproblems may last only a few days or a few weeksor become chronic with persistent problems morethan three nights per week. The longer or morefrequent the insomnia, the more it leads to poorcoping skills, fatigue, and depression. A primary problem for many women with hot flashes and nighttime sweats is sleep disrup-tion. Some women are awakened during sleepdue to a night sweat, but sleep disturbances arenot always a result of hot flashes, and not all hotflashes disrupt sleep. Most nighttime hot flashesare associated with waking up, but almost halfthe time a waking episode is not associated withhot flashes. Sleep disturbances and early morningawakenings are also signs of depression and anx- iety. These emotional changes are also associatedwith menopause for some women. In addition to the direct influence of hor- monal changes and hot flashes on insomnia, thistime in a woman's life, quaintly called midlife,can also be a time of signicant life changes and challenges. Job stress, relationship loss, childcare, parent care, or medical problems can alterbrain chemistry and sleep patterns. Insomnia canalso be a result of sleep-related disordered breath-ing due to snoring or apnea, chronic pain such asarthritis or bromyalgia, thyroid conditions, rest-less leg syndrome, asthma, or medications. Mood Swings, Depression, and Anxiety. The psychological conditions associated withmenopause have been a source of conflicting scientic data and controversy. Even though therelationship between menopause and depressionhas been extensively studied, the results havebeen inconsistent. Some studies have shownmore frequent depressive moods among peri-and postmenopausal women compared to pre-menopausal women, while other studies havenot. It may be that the psychosocial and culturalfactors that influence variations in moods affectwomen more at the time of menopause. 15 The Massachusetts Women's Health Study concluded that women who were depressed pre-menopausally had higher rates of depression inperimenopause; for the women who were notdepressed during the premenopause years, the rate of depression was slightly increased duringperimenopause and was highest for women whoremained perimenopausal for at least 27 months. 16 Researchers observed that the rate of depressionbegins to decrease as women move from peri- topostmenopause and is lowest for those womenwho have been postmenopausal for at least 27months. These results show that depression ismoderately associated with perimenopause andthat the depression is transient and will declineabout two years after menopause.182WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE A 1997 study was able to demonstrate that depression and anxiety were higher in post- thanin perimenopausal women, 17although not all studies conrm this. This study also showed thatdepression and anxiety scores were reduced tovalues below those of perimenopausal womenwhen the women took hormone replacementtherapy (HRT). Women who take estrogen aloneseem to do best compared to womenwho take estrogen plus synthetic progestogens,called progestins. 18 Mood changes may not be as prominent as depression or anxiety. Many women are plaguedby irritability, melancholy, weepiness, shorttemper, feeling overwhelmed, and a lower toler-ance of stressors. Up to 10 percent of peri-menopausal women experience mood changes.Some of these mood changes are due to sleepdeprivation with or without night sweats. Inthese circumstances, successful treatment for themoods requires treatment of the night sweatsand/or insomnia. Decreased Memory and Concentration. T rouble concentrating, planning, and learningnew things and difculty remembering names,words, or what you went into the kitchen toretrieve are common changes experienced bywomen in the menopause and menopause transi-tion. Many of us experience some degree ofchange in memory and concentration and clarityof thinking as we age, but there are also speciccognitive changes that occur when estrogen,progesterone, and androgens are rapidly with-drawn from the system, most commonly short-term memory loss. The relatively rapid transitionfrom the menstruating/reproductive years tomenopause appears to be a factor in these cogni-tive changes, and related to these hormonaldeclines, especially in All of these have influences on concen-tration, learning, and memory. This is most dra-matic after childbirth or after bilateral oophorec- tomy (both ovaries being removed). Short-termmemory impairment is also a common cognitivechange in women with natural menopause. Dif-culty concentrating, difculty with previouslysimple technical tasks, decrease in memory, andlack of mental clarity are typical states that canthen be worsened by difculty sleeping and sleepinterruptions. An evaluation of signicant cognitive impair- ment may be necessary to assess for a thyroidimbalance, medication problems, overuse of seda-tives or alcohol, and dementia. Alzheimer's disease(AD) is the most common cause of dementia andaffects 1.5 to 3 times more women than men. 19 For women on hormone therapy, adjustments inthe dose may improve mental function. Vaginal Dryness and Thinning. Vaginal dryness, vaginal thinning, and what is calledatrophy are very common problems for meno-pausal women but usually do not become trou-blesome until several years after menopause.Estrogen is responsible for the thickened, elastic,lubricated tissue of the vagina and vulva (externalgenital area). When estrogen levels decline, thevulva loses its collagen, fat, and water-retainingability. As a result, it becomes flattened, thin, anddry and loses tone. With estrogen loss, the vaginaalso shortens and narrows, and the vaginal wallsbecome thinner, less elastic, and pale in color.Problems of vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge,and pain with vaginal sex are reported by two outof three women at the age of 75. 20The change that is usually noticed rst is a feeling of drynessof the vagina. The cause is atrophy of the mucus-producing glands of the vaginal wall. With a lossin lubrication and a thinning of the tissue, thevagina is more prone to infections and mechani-cal injury from vaginal penetration. Small pin-point bleeding, itching, and burning can result.Other tissue in the same area also becomes thinand atrophied. The urethral tissue (exit route forurine), the labia (the \"lips\" of the external genital183MENOPAUSE region), and the vaginal wall can all atrophy. These changes can result in increased bladderinfections, involuntary loss of urine (inconti-nence), and prolapse of the bladder, rectum, oruterus. As the atrophy progresses, women mayexperience an increase in urinary urgency or dif-culty holding the urine. Urinary Problems. Urinary incontinence and recurring tract infections in postmenopausal women. Uri-nary incontinence (recurring involuntary leakageof urine) is common and affects from 10 to 30percent of women between the ages of 50 and64. Urge incontinence occurs when there is asudden strong desire to urinate, and stress incon-tinence is urinary leakage with coughing, laugh-ing, sneezing, or lifting. Stress incontinence ismore common during perimenopause and doesnot tend to increase over time, whereas urgeincontinence tends to increase with time. Other urinary changes include increased uri- nary frequency, sudden urges to urinate evenwhen the bladder is not full, frequent nighttimeurination (nocturia), and increased frequency ofurinary tract infections. As estrogen levelsdecline, the end of the urethra, where we urinate,becomes shorter, and this reduces our defenseagainst the bacteria that cause urinary tract infec-tions (UTI). Lower estrogen levels also cause ourvagina, urethra, and bladder to become morealkaline, which also leaves these areas prone toinfections. Vaginal estrogen therapy is an impor-tant option in restoring the acidic environmentof the vagina and the bladder. Changes in Sexual Response and Sex Drive. Changes in sexual response and libido are common throughout life, can be due to a host of influences, and tend to increase with aging.With an increasing number of menopausalwomen, an aging population, and an increasedopenness about the topic of sexuality, women areincreasingly coming to their health-care practi-tioners wanting help in this area.According to at least one large study, as many as 30 percent of women have low sexual desire,and about 50 percent of these feel distressedabout it. 21Not all sexual problems come in the form of low desire. Female sexual disorder (FSD)is dened in four main categories: desire disor-ders, arousal disorder, orgasmic disorders, andpain disorders. Sexual desire disorders includehypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD),which is a recurrent consistent deciency orabsence of sexual thoughts, fantasies and/orinterest in sexual activity, and sexual aversion disorder, a persistent or recurrent aversion toand/or avoidance of sexual contact with a part-ner. HSDD increases with age and is morecommon in women after age 60. In fact, it isthought that HSDD is more related to age thanto menopause. 22, 23 Sexual arousal disorder is dened as the inability to attain or maintainsexual excitement and a lack of response to sexualstimulation such as lubrication. Orgasmic disor-der is difcult, and arousal. of the of theentrance to the vagina that interferes with pene-tration; and sexual pain related to sexual stimula-tion other than intercourse. Numerous variables affect sexual function, including emotional and psychological factors,medical problems causing fatigue and/or pain,certain medications (see the following sidebar),and hormonal influences. Testosterone is necessary for a normal sex drive in women and men, helping to determinedesire, arousal, and sexual sensation. During per-imenopause, estrogen levels are fluctuating butultimately are declining, and testosterone pro-duction is also declining. The hormonal issuesinfluencing sexual function in women aren'ttotally understood, but fluctuating testosteronelevels have been associated with a decrease inlibido (desire). 24, 25 Most, but not all, sexual184WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE problems in postmenopausal women are related to estrogen loss to the genitals. Decreased estro-gen levels are responsible for most of the changesand decrease in lubrication during sexual arousal,vaginal tone, vaginal elasticity, and genitalengorgement. This can manifest as a lack of ade-quate vaginal lubrication with sexual arousal,bleeding after vaginal sex, and pain with vaginalsex. Vaginal dryness is not only associated withpainful vaginal sex, but also with a decrease insexual desire. 26It is not hard to understand why anticipation of painful sex would dampen one'sdesire for sex. With a loss of estrogen, relaxationof vaginal tissue and decreased muscle tone also occur, which leads to a decrease in sexual response.A woman's total estrogen production decreases by 70 to 80 percent in menopause, while andro-gen production decreases by about 50 percent. Ifone has a surgical menopause, the plasma levels of testosterone are decreased signicantly morethan in women in natural menopause, 27and this can result in an even greater incidence of sexualdysfunction than in women who went through anatural physiologic menopause. Acne, Facial Hair, and Hair Loss. Many peri- and postmenopausal women have problemsrelated to the change in the ratio of estrogen totestosterone. Even though both hormones havedeclined, there is a relative increase in testos-terone because there is less estrogen to block itseffects. In addition, women have individual sen-sitivities to androgens. Some women only reactto very high levels, while others are especiallysensitive to what are considered normal androgenlevels. In addition, women have different kindsof receptor site and tissue sensitivity. Some willdevelop acne, some thinning hair, and someexcess body and/or facial hair. Excessive hair growth occurs in areas where hair follicles are the most androgen-sensitive.These include the face, chin, skin under the jaw-bone, upper lip, sideburn area, and cheeks. Othersensitive areas include the area below the bellybutton, the lateral pubic area, midline of thechest, around the nipple area, and the low backover the sacrum. Hirsutism (excess body hair) ismost notably correlated with elevated free testos-terone, but testosterone must be converted by anenzyme in the skin to be fully active in the skin.This enzyme is probably higher in women whohave excess body and facial hair. These enzymelevels may change in postmenopausal women, orthe hair follicle may become more sensitive to theactivated testosterone in some postmenopausalwomen. Hair thinning and hair loss are often trau- matic for women and cause a great deal of anxi-ety. Androgenic alopecia (hair loss) is the mostSelected Medications That Can Affect Sexual Function Reduction in Sexual Desire Antipsychotics BarbituratesSelective serotonin alopecia in is genetically determined. Androgens modulate hair growth.The follicle responds to the androgens and isdependent on the amount present and the pres-ence and number of androgen receptors. Thethinning of hair that can be seen in menopausalwomen is more likely to be diffuse but is mostcommon on the top of the head (the vertex) and next most common at the crown. Somewomen have a receding hairline and thinning atthe temples. Weight Gain. One of the more troubling changes to women during the menopause transi-tion is weight gain, which is often about vepounds. We don't understand very clearly if orhow a drop in hormones, and if or how prescrib-ing hormones, affects weight. What we do knowis that aging itself and lifestyle are associated withweight gain. Lean body mass, muscle mass, andthe metabolic rate decrease with age, whichmeans we burn fewer calories. These changes,combined with being more sedentary as we age,can easily lead to weight gain. Hormonal changesin menopausal women are probably associatedwith an increase in insulin resistance, leading toincreased fat storage, increased abdominal fat,and weight gain. Headaches. Hormonal changes may play a role in headaches, especially in perimenopauseand especially in women with migraine head-aches. Migraine headaches tend to be worse onone side of the head and worse with light andnoise, can be associated with nausea and vomit-ing, and tend to be moderate to severe. The hor-monal changes associated with the menopausetransition can increase the frequency and inten-sity of headaches, especially for those womenwho have a history of menstrual-related head-aches. During times of more stable estrogenlevels, such as during pregnancy, or once meno-pause has been reached, most women will expe-rience a resolution of their headache patterns,especially migraine headaches.Skin, Eye, and Dental Changes. We already talked about how hormone changes can berelated to acne. Specically, acne can be the effectof excess testosterone on the glandular secretionsin the skin. Estrogen also has important func-tions in the skin. It determines the skin collagen,skin thickness, and texture. Collagen, a majorprotein in the skin, is dependent on estrogen,and 30 percent of skin collagen is lost during therst few years after menopause. As time goes on,more collagen is lost, resulting in increasinglaxity of the skin, wrinkling, and loss of elasticity.The skin also becomes dry more easily. A variety of changes occur in the eye relative to hormonal status. Postmenopausal womenreport dry eyes, burning, pressure, light and tem-perature sensitivity, blurring, tearing, eye fatigue,swollen eyelids, and a feeling of scratchiness. Dryeye syndrome can, oddly enough, cause excesstearing, and it appears to also be affected bydrops in testosterone levels. Fluctuations in hormones during peri- menopause and lower levels in menopause areinvolved in inflammation of the gums, sensitivityof the teeth, tooth loss, and a burning sensationin the mouth and tongue. These symptoms maybe a sign of more serious problems as well. Toothloss may be associated with low bone density andosteoporosis. Burning sensations in the mouthcan be a symptom of diabetes or anemia, andgum inflammation may be related to anincreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Heart Palpitations. A palpitation can feel like a rapid heart rate, missed heartbeats, or irreg-ular heartbeats. Not all heart palpitations arerelated to a decrease in estrogen levels but may bea symptom of anxiety, panic disorder, fears, ordepression. Fortunately, women in their 40s andearly 50s, during the most common time of themenopause transition, are not likely to have aserious cardiac problem. Nonetheless, thesesymptoms should be evaluated, especially if theyoccur with exercise, are associated with shortness186WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE of breath or chest pain, or if you have a family history of early heart disease or heart attack (menless than age 50 and women less than age 60). Joint Pains. Another symptom commonly reported during menopause is joint pain and/orbody aches. This is not currently well under-stood, but it is likely there is a connectionbetween hormones, immune function, andinflammation in the joints. Osteoarthritis, specif-ically, is a common joint disease that increaseswith age and affects women more than men. Osteoporosis and Cardiovascular Disease. While the symptoms of hot flashes, mood swings,insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and the rest areannoying at best, and can signicantly impactquality of life, the most signicant changes associated with menopause are osteoporosis andcardiovascular disease. These conditions can dra-matically alter and even shorten one's life. For acomprehensive discussion on osteoporosis, refer toChapter 14, and for heart disease, refer to Chapter9. Prevalence, risk factors, evaluation, and alterna-tive and conventional approaches and treatmentsare covered in these chapters. Menopause Evaluation The onset of perimenopause is an important time for a comprehensive health and lifestyleevaluation. A thorough medical history, com-plete physical exam, and selected tests dependingon your age, your symptoms, and other medicalproblems should be done by a licensed health-care practitioner. While it may seem surprising, there is no one test for menopause. Tests to determine ovarianfunction are not routinely done because the diag-nosis of perimenopause or menopause is largelyable to be made based on the medical history.Practitioners can use hormone testing on an indi-vidual basis, mostly to differentiate menopausefrom thyroid problems, abnormal causes of a lackof menses such as elevated prolactin levels, orpremature ovarian failure (premature meno-pause). The follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test is not as accurate as we would like, but if it isconsistently elevated above 30 mIU/mL, a diag-nosis of menopause can be established. The dif-culty with FSH tests is that they can fluctuateimmensely, especially in perimenopause. Theother problem is that FSH tests are frequentlynormal in perimenopausal women. It can also bevery difcult to use the FSH test if women are onhormonal contraceptives or hormone replace-ment therapy (HRT or HT). There is a recent popular notion that saliva or serum testing can be done to determine estrogen,progesterone, and testosterone levels or individ-ual estrogen levels including estriol, estrone, andestradiol. However, saliva testing has yet to beproven accurate for the testing of these hor-mones, although the FDA has approved salivatests for cortisol and DHEA levels. I will focusmy comments on blood serum testing. For the perimenopausal woman, it is difcult to gather conclusions on test results when thehormones are in such a fluctuating state. Thereare so many peaks and valleys and so mucherratic hormone activity that testing offers littlevalue in most situations. For the women takingHRT, it is tempting to think that we could testthe blood to determine what dose to take. This isa popular recommendation in some consumermenopause books. However, I would point outthat there is no mathematical grid comparingvalues of estrogen or progesterone or of testos-terone levels in the blood and how that wouldequate with a certain dose of the comparable hor-mone. There are reference ranges for these hor-mones, but practitioners don't know exactly whatdose to give to keep a woman in the referencerange. Women absorb and metabolize hormonesdifferently. The form of hormones and the deliv-ery method\u2014oral, transdermal, sublingual, orinjection\u2014also behave differently from womanto woman. In selective cases, testing may be ahelpful guide. These are generally cases in which a woman is on HRT and not doing well, and187MENOPAUSE despite the practitioner's best efforts with a good medical history and adjusting the dose, she stilldoes not feel well. But clearly, the majority of thetime, it requires the practitioner's experience andmenopause expertise and time to listen to thepatient to know what dose, what dosing adjust-ments, and what forms and deliveries of hor-mones may work best. Even if testing is done, thedecision basically comes down to good clinicaljudgment and the willingness of the woman andher practitioner to try various approaches. Testing can be done to facilitate assessing a woman's risk for diabetes, heart disease, and osteo-porosis. Risk assessment for heart disease is dis-cussed in Chapter 9 and for osteoporosis, Chapter14. Diabetes risk assessment is a combination ofhistory and physical exam, glucose screening, andlipid panel testing. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosedwhen a fasting plasma glucose test is 126 mg/dL or greater on two or more occasions or the blood glu-cose is 200 mg/dL or greater two hours after a doseof glucose is ingested. Other important situations also warrant test- ing and are discussed in the appropriate chaptersin this book. To name a few, abnormal uterinebleeding may need thyroid blood tests, pelvicultrasound, or endometrial biopsy. Urinary tractinfections can be tested with urinalysis and urinecultures. Cervical cancer can be screened for with Pap smears. Breast cancer can be screenedfor with mammograms. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS The fundamental goals of an alternative approach to menopause are to provide relief fromcommon menopausal symptoms and to preventand/or treat osteoporosis, heart disease, andother diseases of aging. The goal is to do this withmethods that do not increase the risk of life-threatening diseases such as breast cancer, bloodclots, and strokes. In order to accomplish these fundamental goals, the menopausal woman and her practi-tioner must embrace an individualized approach.An alternative and comprehensive approach isdistinct in that the evaluation of each womanlends a great deal of attention not only to indi-vidual symptoms, but also to her individual risksfor future diseases. This requires a comprehensivehealth history; judicious use of tests to assess risksfor osteoporosis and heart disease; an apprecia-tion of risk factors for breast cancer, diabetes, andAlzheimer's disease; a willingness to individualizethe treatment very carefully; and an ability to uti-lize the whole spectrum of interventions, includ-ing diet, exercise, stress management, nutritionalsupplements, herbal therapies, all available hor-mone options, and prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Although more and more conventional HRT regimens are becoming available and new non- KEY CONCEPTS Find a good menopause practitioner to work with. Seek the advice of practitioners who caninform you about the spectrum of options. Seek out an initial comprehensive evaluation. Managing menopause symptoms is distinct from prevention of signicant diseases such as heart disease and osteoporosis. Attempt to determine indiv idual risks for signi- cant diseases\u2014osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, and diabetes. Hormone testing is not routinely recommended and offers limited help in knowing how tomanage your menopause symptoms. Be well informed about the process of menopause. Be well informed about the spectrum of alterna- tive and conventional treatment options. Realize that menopause and aging are processes that evolve over time. What you decide today is not permanent; you can change your treatment decisions based onyour changing health, changes in medical under- standing and research, and newly available treatment options.188WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE hormonal drugs are being developed, a practi- tioner who has an understanding of the wholespectrum of options from the most natural to themost conventional is in the ideal position toproperly advise and prescribe a customized opti-mal treatment and prevention plan. A licensednaturopathic physician is currently the only pri-mary health-care provider trained in all theseoptions, although he or she may have to refer forsome selected expertise in osteoporosis, heart dis-ease, gynecology, or endocrinology. In the past,conventional medicine largely approached thesituation as \"HRT for all and forever.\" Since2002 and the rst Women's Health Initiativeresearch results, 28women and many of their doc- tors abandoned HRT almost overnight. At the other extreme is an absolute fear and bias against using HRT for any reason or for anyamount of time. The use of nonhormonal natu-ral therapies has thrived in this environment,both in the form of women treating themselvesand for those seeking advice from licensed alter-native practitioners. In either case, cautionshould be exercised in presuming that just treat-ing the symptoms of menopause is adequate.Keep in mind our fundamental goals: symptomrelief, disease prevention, and disease treatment.While there are many effective nonprescriptionnatural therapies for symptom relief, this doesnot adequately address greater long-term con-cerns such as bone density, blood pressure, cho-lesterol levels, breast health, or vaginal tissuehealth. The identication of disease risks may notbe very important in the early perimenopausalyears, but it acquires increasing importance as the postmenopause years accumulate. This is why Irecommend that women seek the advice of alicensed naturopathic physician with a strongexperience in women's health, and menopause inparticular. In this section on natural medicine, we will focus on symptom relief. See the chapters onheart disease and osteoporosis for prevention andtreatment of those diseases.The Naturopathic Approach In the naturopathic approach to menopause, therapeutic intervention is determined followinga comprehensive assessment of symptom severityand scope and an evaluation of risk factors forosteoporosis, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes,and breast cancer. A determination of low,medium, or high risk, especially for osteoporosisand heart disease, is especially directive in provid-ing choices regarding alternative and/or conven-tional therapies. Once the symptoms have beenpinpointed and the risks have been assessed, thentreatments are recommended. T reatment consid-erations include a spectrum of options. The seventreatment categories are: 1. Diet, exercise, lifestyle, and stress management 2. Nutritional supplementation3. Botanical supplementation4. Nonhormonal prescription medications You may be surprised to see the inclusion of conventional hormone replacement therapy inmy list of options. Choosing to use hormones,whether compounded bio-identical or conven-tional pharmaceutical preparations, is a matter ofweighing the benets and the risks. Hormonaltherapies should be utilized in the lowest dose,shortest duration, and safest way possible thatmeets the goals that have been identied. Theseissues are addressed in the section on hormones. Diet/exercise/lifestyle and/or nutritional sup- plements and/or botanical therapies will be effec-tive for the management of menopause symptomsin the majority of women. When these are notadequate, individualized formulations of bio-identical hormone options should be used. Ifthese are not adequate, then \"friendlier\" hor-mone therapy (also bio-identical) semisynthetic189MENOPAUSE and not bio-identical) HRT. (The distinctions between the different kinds of hormones are dis-cussed in the hormone section.) Determining thetreatment approach is a combination of subjec-tive and objective ndings resulting from themedical history, physical exam, any lab or diag-nostic imaging tests, and the personal perspectiveand values of each woman. The specics of theseoptions and therapies will be expanded on as wediscuss nutrition, exercise, nutritional supple-mentation, botanicals, bio-identical hormones,conventional HRT, and nonhormonal drugs. Nutrition An alternative approach to menopause isn't com- plete without proper nutrition. This includes gen-eral considerations such as a diet rich in wholenatural and unprocessed foods, with an emphasison fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds,nuts, and healthy fats, and low in saturated fats,fried foods, white flour, alcohol, sugar, and salt. The Value of Soy. One of the important dietary recommendations for all menopausalwomen may be to increase foods that are high inphytoestrogens, although their benets may bemore for preventing osteoporosis, heart disease,and even breast cancer than for the relief ofmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes. A large number of plants, especially legumes, contain compounds called phytoestrogens.Phytoestrogens are mainly, but not exclusively,nonsteroidal in structure and are either of plantorigin or derived from the body's metabolism ofprecursors present in dietary components. Themost important dietary phytoestrogens are thephenolic phytoestrogens, which include theisoflavones and the lignans. Soybeans are therichest food source of isoflavones, containing 1to 2 mg of isoflavones per gram of soy protein.The two main isoflavones of soy are genisteinand daidzein. Isoflavones have a unique ability toweakly bind to estrogen receptors in the bodyand seem to have both a weak estrogen effect aswell as an antiestrogen effect, depending on the tissue involved and the dose consumed. There are hundreds of studies on soy and dozens on hot flashes, some showing effect andothers not, making it difcult to make conclu-sions. For now, I'd like to pass on the results oftwo systematic reviews of isoflavones and meno-pausal symptoms and one consensus opinionfrom the North American Menopause Societythat offer a good summary of the research. Therst systematic study was a review of the literaturefor the randomized controlled clinical trials onsoy and perimenopausal symptoms. 29Ten trials were evaluated, and only four were positive andshowed benet for perimenopausal symptoms.There were no serious safety concerns with soyproducts for the treatment periods, which wereup to six months. In the second systematic review,25 trials involving approximately 2,300 womenmet the study criteria. 30Soy and red clover isoflavones were evaluated in this review, includ-ing soy foods, beverages, or powders; soy extracts;and red clover extracts, for a total of 25 studies.Only one soy food trial and two soy extract trialsshowed the ability to reduce hot flushes. The nal report comes from a consensus opinion of the North American Menopause Soci-ety, 31which acknowledges that some data does support the efcacy of isoflavones in reducingthe incidence and severity of hot flashes but thatmany studies have not found any difference. Italso concluded that there was not adequate datato evaluate the effect of isoflavones on breast andother cancers, bone mass, and vaginal drynessbut that there were convincing health benets ofisoflavones and lipids in reducing low-densitylipoproteins and triglycerides and increasinghigh-density lipoproteins. Perhaps the best evi-dence that soy lowers cholesterol comes from areview of 38 scientic studies. This meta-analysisconcluded that consumption of soy protein ratherthan animal protein signicantly decreased serumconcentrations of total cholesterol, LDL choles-terol, and triglycerides. 32190WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE In terms of menopause symptoms and hot flashes in particular, I'm sure the three reviews aredisappointing news for advocates of soy. It'simportant to appreciate, though, that statisticalsignicance is not the same as clinical signi-cance for any one person. For some women, andthis has been borne out in some studies, soy pro-tein and soy isoflavones can be helpful in reduc-ing the frequency and severity of hot flashes. Forthe specics in regard to bone effects and cardio-vascular effects, please refer to the osteoporosisand heart disease chapters. If you choose to increase soy foods or take soy beverages, powders, or supplements, a wordabout dosages and addressing some of the highlypublicized controversies about soy is important.A reasonable approach would be to ingest a dailylevel of isoflavones that does not exceed theamount consumed in ethnic diets that containhigh amounts of isoflavones. From a review ofthose diets, it appears that this amount is some-where between 50 to 150 mg of isoflavones perday for adults. The isoflavone content of soyfoods varies with the form. A listing of theisoflavone content of some of these soy foods willoffer some help in calculating your daily intake(see Table 12.1). There have been some controversies about soy, and based on the actual research, these neg-ative comments and concerns about soy are in some cases incorrect and in other cases highlyexaggerated. Some have pointed out problemswith thyroid function, inhibition of mineral andprotein absorption, and concerns about hor-monal effects. Some of the controversy about soy lies not only in its ability to bind to estrogen receptors but in its content of phytates and trypsininhibitors, interference with thyroid function,and difcult digestibility for some individuals.Soy foods, especially cooked soybeans, are dif-cult for some people to digest, causing gas andstomach upset. Soy's content of trypsin inhibitorscan block the enzymes needed for protein diges-tion. When the protein is improperly digested,fermentation and gas production ensues. How-ever, many researchers believe that so few trypsininhibitors are left behind after processing the soyfood that for most people, their digestion is notaffected. The phytate content in soybeans has been another cause for concern with soy foods. Phy-tates are compounds found in grains and legumesthat can compete with the uptake of mineralssuch as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc.Although the phytate content of soybeans ishigher than that of other grains or legumes, themineral-blocking effect of phytates is reduced Table 12.1 Isoflavone Content of Soybeans Soy Food Amount Isoflavones (mg) Textured soy protein granules14cup 62 Roasted soy nuts14cup 60 Tofu, low-fat and regular12cup 35 Tempeh12cup 35 Soy beverage powders 1-2 scoops 20-50 (varies with manufacturer) Regular soy milk 1 cup 30Low-fat soy milk 1 cup 20 Roasted soy butter 2 tbs 17 Cooked soybeans 12cup 35191MENOPAUSE when eaten with meat or sh. If you eat soy products in the context of a healthy, varied diet,you should get adequate minerals. Phytates arealso reduced in fermented products such astempeh and miso. The genistein and daidzein in soy can also inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. High-soybean diets have been implicated in diet-induced goiter. This problem is not likely tooccur with an average amount of soy in the dietand again in the context of a healthy, varied diet,especially a diet that is adequate in iodine, whichis now mostly the case in this country. In somesusceptible individuals, or in some who take veryhigh doses of nutritional supplementation of soyisoflavones (above 200 mg per day) or have anextreme diet low in other nutrients and high insoy, it is prudent to be aware of potential butextremely rare problems with soy ingestion. One of the greatest fears for women contem- plating menopause treatment options is the con-cern about estrogen replacement therapy andbreast cancer. Although we will be addressing this in the hormone and conventional medicinesections of this chapter, there are several lines ofevidence and logic that support the conclusionthat not only is soy safe, but there is actually arelationship between increased soy intake andbreast cancer prevention. Several studies con-cluded that Asian women who consume a tradi-tional low-fat, high-soy diet have a four- tosixfold lower risk of developing breast cancer. 33 The constituents in soy are remarkable in theiractivities against a variety of cancers via severaldifferent mechanisms. Dietary phytoestrogensalso inhibit cancer cell growth by competing withestradiol for the type II estrogen binding sites. 34 Even more convincing evidence for the breastcancer protection benet of soy comes fromanimal studies. 35Soy supplementation has reduced the number and size of tumors inducedwith a carcinogenic substance. The most comprehensive review of the litera- ture on soy and its effects on the breast comesfrom a paper citing over 280 references. 36In reviewing animal, laboratory, and human studies,the study's authors conclude that while there issome conflicting data as to whether soy is protec-tive against breast cancer or is safe or harmful forbreast cancer patients, it is clear from reading thisresearch that the data signicantly favors safetyand even protection if consumed from a youngage. The authors concluded that moderation inintake is probably wise and should mimic theAsian soy intake of one to two servings per day.Doubts as to the signicance of the breast cancerprotective effects of soy and the safety of soy willremain until there has been a prospective studyon soy comparing women on a high-soy dietwith women on a low-soy diet over the span ofmany years with identical risk factors in otherareas. One specic word of caution to breastcancer patients undergoing treatment withtamoxifen: until it has been determined if soy isbenecial in addition to tamoxifen or if it inter-feres with tamoxifen, I would recommendagainst daily soy ingestion while on tamoxifen. For the most part and in most individuals, soy foods will not interfere with thyroid func-tion, protein digestion, or the uptake of minerals,and they are more associated with reducing therisk of hormone-dependent cancers than withincreasing it. Any potential negatives with soy arenot likely to occur with one to two servings ofsoy foods daily, with adequate iodine in the diet,using soy in the context of a healthy, varied dietand focusing on organic sources. Organicallygrown soybeans are grown without pesticides andare not from genetically modied seeds. This isan important issue for soy foods in particular, asgenetically modied soy crops have increasinglydominated in the agriculture business. Fortu-nately, there are farmers and manufacturers whoare committed to raising and producing organicsoy products. The optimal use of soy would be to start early in life and eat a diverse array of soy foods with atotal dietary intake of 50 to 150 mg of soy192WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE isoflavones per day. If you don't like soy foods, take a high-quality soy protein powder or capsule. Flaxseed. Another signicant dietary source of phytoestrogens to consider is flaxseed.Flaxseed contains lignans, two of which,matairesinol secoisolariciresinol, are knownto have estrogenic activity. Other lignans aremodied by intestinal bacteria to form estrogeniccompounds. Lignans from plants such as flaxseedare absorbed in the circulation and have bothestrogenic and antiestrogenic activity 37much like soy, although to a lesser degree. Flaxseed flour and its defatted meal (flaxseed meal) are the highest plant producers of lignans.The lignan content of flaxseed meal is 75 timeshigher than that of seaweeds (the second highestlignan-containing group) and 804 times higherthan that of fruits (the lowest lignan-containinggroup). 37 The evidence that lignans can reduce the risk for cancer is still unclear, although the biologicproperties of lignans and data from various cul-tures suggest that they do. Many lignans haveantitumor, antioxidant, weak andantiestrogenic urinary excretion of lignans has beenfound to be lower in nonvegetarians and in post-menopausal women with breast cancer as com-pared with healthy women. 43-45 Foods for Bone Health. Several dietary factors affect bone health and are involved in the develop-ment of osteoporosis: insufcient calcium intake,vitamin D deciency, low calcium and high phos-phorus intake, low fatty acid intake, insufcientdark leafy greens, a high-protein diet, excess saltintake, and excess alcohol. See Chapter 14 fordietary and lifestyle factors, supplements, herbs,hormones, and other conventional medications forprevention and treatment of bone loss. Foods for Heart Health. Heart disease is the other major concern in the postmenopausal years.The prevention of heart disease is largely deter-mined by diet and lifestyle. Women who make thenecessary dietary changes have a signicant advan- tage in being able to age healthfully and reduce therisk of heart disease. Lowering the level of trans fatsand saturated fats while increasing omega-3 fatsand monounsaturated fats from olive oil are keys toa nutritional preventive approach to heart disease.Diets that are high in cholesterol and saturated fats(beef, pork, lamb, butter, cheese, palm oil, andcoconut oil) contribute to poor fat ratios and ele-vated cholesterol. Even though total fat intakeshould be reduced, switching from saturated fats tovegetable oils will lower total cholesterol levels.Olive oil is your best choice for salads and cooking. Increasing ber in the diet with whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes is the optimalhigh-ber diet. Soluble ber such as the pectin inapples or oat bran has the most consistent bene-cial effect on cholesterol levels. 46Specic fruits or vegetables can also have a positive effect onblood levels of fat. Raw carrots, for example, mayhave a more potent effect in lowering cholesterolthan oat products. 47People with a low intake of fruits and vegetables have an increased risk forheart disease. 48See Chapter 9 for dietary and lifestyle factors, supplements, herbs, hormones,and other conventional medications for preven-tion and treatment of heart disease. Nutritional Supplements Following are the nutritional supplements that are used to treat some of the symptoms of menopause.For an in-depth look at some of the nutritionalDietary Recommendations Reduce saturated fats (cheese, butter, beef, pork). Avoid trans fats (deep fried foods, margarine, par- tially hydrogenated oils). Reduce rened grains and flours, sugar, and salt. Use only a modest amount of low-fat dairy products. Increase fruits, vegetables, legumes (especially soy), whole grains, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and cold- water sh (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, hal- ibut, and sardines).193MENOPAUSE supplements used to treat and prevent heart dis- ease and osteoporosis, consult Chapters 9 and 14. Bioflavonoids. Bioflavonoids, such as rutin, hesperidin, fortheir antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proper-ties and their ability to strengthen capillaries.Some evidence exists to show that giving bio-flavonoids in combination with vitamin C willhelp to relieve menopausal hot flashes. 49 Bioflavonoids 1,000 mg per day plus 1,000-1,500 mg vitamin C Vitamin B 6.Vitamin B 6, or pyridoxine, plays a critical role in the manufacture of serotonin aswell as other amino acid neurotransmitters. Vita-min B 6levels are typically quite low in depressed patients, especially women taking birth controlpills or conjugated equine estrogens (Pre-marin). 50-52 An cause insomnia and irritability. Since depres-sion, insomnia, and irritability are typical meno-pausal symptoms, this vitamin may be a helpfuladdition to a supplement program. Vitamin B 6 50-200 mg per day Warning: chronic intake of dosages greater than 200 mg per day can be toxic over a period of manymonths or years. Evening Primrose Oil. Currently, natural products for menopause often include eveningprimrose oil (EPO) because it has a reputationfor alleviating vasomotor symptoms such as hotflashes. However, a study on the effects of gammalinolenic acid (GLA) from evening primrose oilfound it to offer no benet over placebo in treat-ing menopausal flushing. 53 Cyclic breast pain is a common symptom in menstruating women before their period. In peri-menopausal women, this symptom can be exacer-bated or can occur in women who have not hadthe problem in the past. Results of research and clinical trials have consistently shown that EPO iseffective in relieving breast pain and premenstrualcyclic breast pain. 54-56 (See Chapter 7 for more information about this and other treatments forpainful and lumpy breasts.) Evening Primrose Oil 1,500-3,000 mg per day Gamma-Oryzanol. Gamma-oryzanol is a substance found in grains and is isolated fromrice bran oil. This ferulic acid compound is pres-ent in rice, wheat, barley, oats, tomatoes, aspara-gus, olives, berries, peas, citrus fruits, and otherfoods. The concentrations are higher in wholegrains than in rened grains and flours. Gamma-oryzanol was initially shown to be effective in relieving menopausal hot flashes in theearly 1960s, 57and at least one additional study has conrmed that nding.58The typical dosage of gamma-oryzanol is 100 mg three times daily. Gamma-Oryzanol 100 mg 3 times per day Vitamin E. The considerable reputation of vitamin E as a remedy for hot flashes comes fromstudies done as far back as 1945. 59-62The problem is that vitamin E has received very little scienticattention for this use since those early studies. Onlyrecently has there been renewed research interest,largely born of the need to provide menopausalbreast cancer patients with safe and effective medi-cines for symptom relief. 63Patients received four weeks of vitamin E (800 IU per day), then fourweeks of an identical placebo, or vice versa. Hotflash frequency decreased by 25 percent in the vita-min E group and 22 percent in the placebo group.Although this is considered a statistically signicantdifference, the clinical impact of this reduction wasmarginal, and the patients did not particularlyshow a preference for vitamin E over placebo.194WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Vitamin E 400-800 IU per day Botanical Medicines Phytoestrogens. As discussed in the nutri- tion section, phytoestrogens are plant-derivedsubstances that are able to activate the estrogenreceptors in mammals. They are mainly, but notexclusively, nonsteroidal in structure and areeither of plant origin or derived by the body'smetabolism of precursors present in dietary com-ponents. Phytoestrogens are present in virtuallyevery plant in varying amounts. Phytoestrogens are capable of exerting weak estrogenic effects in some parts of the body, andthey also have antiestrogenic effects due to theirability to occupy estrogen receptor sites andblock the estrogen produced by our own bodiesfrom binding. Since the phytoestrogens are somuch weaker than estrogen, the signicantly less estrogenic stimulationin the target organ. Phytoestrogens are found in many medicinal herbs with a historical use in conditions that arenow treated by estrogens. The weak estrogeniceffects of phytoestrogen-containing herbs canprovide some benet in relieving menopausesymptoms. One advantage of phytoestrogens isthat they have not been associated with increas-ing the risk of breast cancer. In fact, epidemio-logic data and experimental studies in animalshave demonstrated that phytoestrogens areextremely effective in inhibiting mammarytumors, not only because they occupy estrogenreceptors but also through other unrelated anti-cancer mechanisms. 64, 65 The common phytoestrogen compounds, the isoflavones, have a similar structure to the body'ssex hormones. They have the ability to bind toestrogen receptors on human cells, and inwomen they have a preference for binding to thebeta form of the estrogen receptor. As a result,they preferentially express estrogenic effects in the central nervous system, blood vessels, bone,and skin without causing stimulation of thebreast or uterus, at least in typical doses. 66 Dong Quai ( Angelica Sinensis ).Dong quai, also known as tang-kuei, dang-gui, and Chineseangelica, is an aromatic herb widely used through-out Asia. In Asia, dong quai is to women's healthwhat ginseng is to men's. It has predominantlybeen used as a female remedy to treat menopausalhot flashes, menstrual cramps, lack of menstrua-tion, or frequent menstruation and to promote a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery. Thecoumarins in dong quai are found largely in theroot. The potential estrogen-like activity of dongquai has been assumed because of its observed tra-ditional uses and clinical effects, and evidenceincludes its ability to cause an initial increase inuterine contraction, followed by relaxation 67and its effect in increasing uterine weight when givento mice. 68These observations may be a partial explanation as to why dong quai may be useful inmenopause, although clearly there is some benetat least for issues related to missed menses or fre-quent menstruation. In a 12-week study conducted by Kaiser Per- manente, using dong quai as a solo agent for therelief of menopausal symptoms such as hotflashes and sweats did not prove to be effective. 69 More research is needed on use of dong quai incombination with other herbal preparations. Dong quai may increase the flow of a period or bring on a menses. In a perimenopausal womanwho is either already having heavy flow problemsor may have missed a menses for several months,this may be alarming. In this case, dong quai isprobably not the best herbal choice for yourmenopausal symptoms. Dong Quai Dry herb used in combination with other herbs in cap- sule form world's oldest living species of tree with fossilrecords as old as 200 million years. The leaves ofyoung, cultivated trees are used in modern herbalpreparations. T wo groups of active constituents\u2014the terpene lactones and the ginkgo flavone glyco-sides\u2014are the most critical compounds ofstandardized herbal products. Many forms andmethods of preparation of ginkgo are available,although a high quality of Ginkgo biloba extract is typically standardized to 24 percent ginkgoflavone glycosides and 6 percent terpene lactones.The actions of these constituents include improv-ing blood flow to the brain 70and to the hands and feet.71, 72 Although ginkgo extract has not been specically studied in menopausal women withmemory or cognition problems, it has been usedto improve memory. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efcacy ofGinkgo biloba extract (GBE) for the treatment of memory loss, depression, and disorientation associ-ated with cerebrovascular insufciency in geriatricpatients. 73-75T wo studies have shown gingko to be effective for patients with mild to moderate pri-mary dementia of the Alzheimer's type or multi-infarct dementia. 76, 77Patients who received ginkgo showed memory and attention improvements andsignicant improvement in cognitive function testsand depression. Relative differences for dementiawere not observed. I think it is important toinclude ginkgo for menopausal women becausechanges in mental clarity, memory, and concentra-tion are common, and it may be that ginkgo willhave an increasing role in improving these symp-toms for this group of women. Another commonly reported change in peri- and postmenopausal women is a drop in their sexdrive. Extract of ginkgo appears to be remarkablyeffective in reversing antidepressant-inducedsexual dysfunction in women as well as men. 78 Although the sexual dysfunction in this studywas drug-induced rather than the result ofchanging hormones, I recommend trying thissafe and simple approach.Ginkgo Biloba 40-80 mg standardized extract capsules or 12-1 tsp tincture 3 times per day Ginseng ( Panax Ginseng ).There are many types and grades of ginseng and ginseng extractsthat include related species. Panax ginseng , also known as Korean or Chinese ginseng, is the mostwidely used. A standardized extract of ginsenghas been shown to improve depression and well-being in 384 postmenopausal women. 79Another randomized controlled trial found that onemonth of Korean red ginseng increased energyand decreased insomnia and depression. 80 Historically, ginseng has been used as a \"tonic for invigoration and fortication in times offatigue and debility and for declining capacity forwork and concentration.\" 81Ginseng can help in reducing mental or physical fatigue,82-85 enhanc- ing the ability to cope with physical and mentalstressors by supporting the adrenal glands, 86or treating the atrophic vaginal changes due to lackof estrogen. 87 Panax Ginseng Standardized extract capsules: 200 ginseno- sides active constituent in glycyrrhizin.Much of the attention on on anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,antiviral, and expectorant of theelimination of mucus from the lungs or bronchi)properties, but for menopausal symptom reliefwe are more interested in the estrogenic activityof some of its phytoestrogen components, includ-ing beta-sitosterol, and others, in particular as active as estradiol.88However, the gly- coside of glycyrrehetinic acid has been shown tohave an antiestrogen activity, inhibiting the effect196WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE of estradiol on uterine growth in ovariectomized animals.89It may be that licorice has both hor- mone and antihormone effects, or it may in factlower estrogen levels while simultaneously raisingprogesterone levels. This creates some confusionin thinking about why and when to take it, andat this time we cannot really clear up the confu-sion because there is insufcient research toaccount for the use of licorice as a single meno-pausal herb. Licorice may, however, be used incombination with other herbs as part of an effec-tive formulation for symptom relief. Licorice Dry form used in combination with other herbs in cap- sules or Tincture: Praetense ).Red clover, a member of the legume family, has beenused worldwide as a source of hay for cattle,horses, and sheep, and the leaves and youngsprouts have been used by humans as a source ofprotein. Historically, it has also been recognizedas a medicinal plant for humans and, morerecently, as a menopausal herb. At least six clinical trials have been conducted on the effect of red clover isoflavones on vasomo-tor symptoms. Three show benet, and three donot. The rst two published studies on red cloverand vasomotor symptoms showed no statisticallysignicant difference between the red clover stan-dardized extract and the placebo. 90, 91 T wo other studies showed positive results in reducing hotflashes. 92, 93 The two most recent studies con- tinue the contradictions. In a 2002 study, 80 mgof isoflavones per day resulted in a signicantreduction in hot flashes as compared to base-line. 94Another recent study, called the ICE study, compared two different doses of red cloverisoflavones with placebo. The reductions in themean daily hot flash count at 12 weeks were sim-ilar for groups receiving 82 mg of isoflavones, 57mg, and the placebo. However, in comparisonwith the placebo group, the hot flashes were reduced more rapidly in the group receiving 82mg of isoflavones. 95 Other effects of red clover also have implica- tion in menopausal women. One publishedstudy showed that red clover isoflavones mayreduce the risk of coronary vascular disease byincreasing although it did notimprove cholesterol levels. 96Red clover isoflavones may also slow bone loss of the spine.97 There have been no signicant adverse or intolerant reactions with red clover, no signi-cant change in blood parameters used to measuretoxicity, and no evidence of uterine bleeding orincreased endometrial thickness. In fact, an 80mg red clover extract did not increase the thick-ness of the lining of the uterus in postmeno-pausal women, despite its high content ofphytoestrogens. 98 I cannot offer women who have a history of breast cancer the same degree of reassurance aboutusing red clover as I can with black cohosh. I donot consider it denitely contraindicated, becausein fact red clover has a rich history in herbal med-icine as a treatment for cancers of all kinds. Onecan see the logic of its use in cancer because of itsgenistein and daidzein constituents, both knowninhibitors of tumor growth and cancer cell divi-sion. However, the results of an experiment thatcompared the relative effects of several differentherbs on estrogen-receptor positive breast cancercells in vitro raised concern. 99Surprisingly, the breast cancer cells in the laboratory responded thesame to red clover as they did to estradiol. Thequestion of safety or concern with using red cloverextracts in postmenopausal women with a historyof estrogen receptor positive breast cancer remainsunanswered. Red Clover Standardized extract of 40 mg total isoflavones, 1 tablet 1-2 times per day or Dry herb capsule (500 mg): 1 per day197MENOPAUSE of the buttercup family and is used for avariety of women's health conditions. In the last 25years, it has emerged as the most studied of theherbal alternatives to hormone replacement ther-apy for menopause symptoms. Since the 1980sand up through 2005, numerous studies, includingseveral randomized controlled trials, have been car-ried out using a standardized extract of blackcohosh, with encouraging but mixed results. 100-106 In one of the largest studies, 629 women withmenopausal complaints received a liquid standard-ized extract of black cohosh at 40 drops twice perday for six to eight weeks. As early as four weeksafter beginning the therapy, a clear improvement inthe menopausal ailments was seen in approxi-mately 80 percent of the women. After six to eightweeks, complete disappearance of symptomsoccurred in approximately 50 percent. 107 In 2006, one study using a standardized extract of black cohosh seemed to indicate bene-cial effects on bone metabolism by stimulatingbone-building cells and a weak effect on matura-tion of vaginal cells, 108and another showed no effect on menopausal symptoms.109 In a third study, the Herbal Alternatives for Menopause (HALT) Study, ve groups werestudied: black cohosh (160 mg/daily), a multi-botanical herbal formula including andplacebo. 110Hot flash frequency and intensity did not differ between the herbal interventions andplacebo at 3, 6, or 12 months with one excep-tion. At 12 months, symptom intensity was sig-nicantly worse in the group that received themultibotanical formula plus dietary soy versusthe placebo group. The unfortunate news here isthat black cohosh extract, in a higher dose thanis generally used in clinical practice, did not showbenet in the relief of hot flashes.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled study, a combination of black cohoshand Saint John's wort was studied. 111The Saint John's wort plus black cohosh group was signi-cantly superior to the placebo group on scalesmeasuring menopause symptoms and depression. The average recommended dose of the stan- dardized extract of black cohosh is 40 to 80 mgper day. The clinical studies performed prior to1996 used doses of 40 to 140 mg of standardizedextract. Although there is still some confusionabout which dose of black cohosh may be mosteffective, the dosage used in most clinical trials todate is 20 to 40 mg of the standardized extracttwice daily. Despite the two negative studies in 2006, the collective study ndings and clinical anecdotalevidence on black cohosh teach us that it is effec-tive for menopause symptoms of hot flashes,mood swings, sleep disorders, and body aches. Left unanswered is, how does black cohosh work? Early studies found it to have estrogenicactivity, 112whereas other studies in the last few years have demonstrated no phytoestrogens inblack cohosh and no estrogen-like levels, estradiol,and endometrial thickness were not affected byblack cohosh. 113, 114 Most recently, scientists from the University of Illinois have reported thatconstituents in black cohosh bind to opiatereceptors and activate responses, including coretemperature regulation. 115At the moment, the mechanism of action is not clear, although somehave postulated an effect on serotonin levels. Over these same 25 years, safety and toxicity studies have also been conducted on blackcohosh, and it has been subjected to increasedscrutiny, as has hormone replacement therapy.T wo areas that receive the most attention arewhether black cohosh is safe in breast cancerpatients and if there are any adverse effects onliver function. We don't know with certainty that black cohosh is safe to use in breast cancer patients, but198WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE we have compelling safety data that offers much reassurance. There are two recent excellent reviewsof the literature on the safety of black cohosh. 116, 117The more comprehensive Low Dog paper addresses safety in special populations, such asbreast cancer survivors. Recent studies nd thatthere is no estrogenic action of black cohosh, thatit not effect serum levels of estradiol, LH,FSH, and prolactin. 113, 114 In addition, in vitro studies have shown that black cohosh did notcause increase in proliferation of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, and it had an additiveeffect of inhibiting proliferation when given withthe antiestrogen drug tamoxifen. 118-120 A very recent study demonstrates that black cohoshinhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells. 99 The other area that has received a lot of atten- tion in the last two years is whether black cohoshhas adverse effects on liver function. Reports andhuman clinical trials including more than 2,800patients demonstrate the low incidence of adverseevents associated with black cohosh. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) CollaboratingCenter for International Drug Monitoring data-base of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical andherbal products revealed a total of 35 adversereactions to black cohosh as of July 31, 2000. Thereactions were primarily general and temporarysymptoms and were not concentrated on a partic-ular organ system. This list did include one caseof liver failure, one case of hepatitis, and one caseof elevated liver enzymes. These cases were relatedto unspecied amounts of black cohosh andunspecied products. Some studies on animalsreported increased liver weights associated withvery large doses over an extended period of time. Australia, Canada, and selected European countries have elected to require a warning labelon black cohosh about liver effects. In the UnitedStates, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)concluded in 2004 that there was no competentevidence to support concerns about safety in theuse of black cohosh in breast cancer patients andthat there is inadequate evidence that blackcohosh preparations are causally associated with hepatotoxicity. No warning labels are required onblack cohosh products in the United States. Inthe recent Osmers study, liver enzyme testing was done, and there was no adverse effect on liverfunction tests. 103Another recent long-term observational study published in the journalMenopause in 2006 found no endometrial prolif- eration, no negative effect on breast health, and nohepatotoxicity after 52 weeks of 20 mg of blackcohosh extract in postmenopausal women. 121 These facts, and a review of the scientic literature, do not present a compelling case for concern. 116, 117 The only true contraindication to black cohosh that I can point out is for the cancerpatient taking cisplatin. This is based on an in vitrostudy in which black cohosh slightly protectedmouse mammary tumor cells from cisplatin. 122 Black cohosh did not alter the response of the cellsto radiation or 4-HC and had an enhancing sensi-tizing effect for doxorubicin and docetaxel. Veryoccasional side effects have been reported thatinclude gastrointestinal discomfort, headache,nausea, vomiting, weight gain, and vertigo. Standardized extracts of black cohosh continue to be one of the most reliable herbal approaches to treating a wide array of perimenopausal andmenopausal symptoms. The most commondosage is 40 mg daily, but many achieve betterresults with 40 mg twice daily. One should expectresults within four weeks. In my experience, about85 percent of women will receive benet, andmaybe 50 percent will achieve complete ameliora-tion of their hot flashes and night sweats. Blackcohosh can also be safely and effectively used withhormone therapy. Lower doses of hormone ther-apy are often achieved by also using black cohoshextract at the same time. Black Cohosh Standardized extract capsules (40 mg per capsule): 1-2 capsules twice per day Standardized liquid extract: per day199MENOPAUSE Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ).As an herb for the management of menopausal symptoms, Ibelieve chaste tree has been overpromoted. Thefruits of chaste tree contain essential oils, irridoids,pseudoindicans, and flavonoids, and the effect ofchaste tree is on the hypothalamus-hypophysisaxis. It increases secretion of LH and also has aneffect that favors progesterone. 123-125 The result is a shift in the ratio of estrogen to progesterone andconsequently a \"progesterone-like\" effect. One ofthe most common changes that occurs in the menopause transition is irregular bleeding.Whether it be frequent or infrequent, heavy orlight, ultimately a change and cessation will occur.In the process, some will experience signicantbleeding problems because of menses that areeither too frequent or too heavy. These problemsare some of the most convincing indications forchaste tree. The rst major study on chaste tree was pub- lished in 1954. 126Although this study was pre- dominantly treating women with amenorrhea(lack of menses), a dramatic improvement wasseen in 40 patients with cystic hyperplasia of theendometrium (excessive thickening of the uterinelining). The impressive effect lends credence to itsprogesterone effect. Chaste tree was also studied inwomen with frequent menses and heavy menses,although they were not perimenopausal. 127In women who had frequent menses, the durationbetween periods was lengthened, and in womenwith excessive bleeding, a shortening of thenumber of heavy bleeding days occurred. Chaste tree is the most important herb to normalize and regulate the menstrual cycle. It isnot a fast-acting herb, so do not hesitate to use itover a long period of time. Results may not beachieved until after three to six months.Saint John's Wort ( Hypericum Perfora- tum).Saint John's wort is the most thoroughly researched natural antidepressant. The majorityof these studies have not been conducted onmenopausal women, but in 37 of 39 clinicaltrials, Saint John's wort was shown to be superiorto the placebo or equal to the conventional pre-scription antidepressant medications. In general,studies have shown improvement in individualswith mild to moderate depression. 128In a recent review of studies, a total of 37 trials, including 26comparisons with placebo and 14 comparisonswith synthetic standard antidepressants, wereevaluated. The authors concluded that \"current evidence regarding hypericum extracts is incon-sistent and confusing. In patients who meet criteria for major depression, several recentplacebo-controlled trials suggest that the testedhypericum extracts have minimal benecialeffects while other trials suggest that hypericumand standard antidepressants have similar bene-cial effects.\" 129 One non-placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in women with menopause symptomsfound that 900 mg of Saint John's wort for 12weeks signicantly improved psychological and Chaste Tree Standardized extract capsules (175 mg of 75% agnu- side): 1 capsule per day Standardized liquid extract: 30-60 drops per daySample Treatment Plan for Mild Depression, Irritability, and Mood Swings See the Resources section for formulation sources. Diet: Reduce alcohol, avoid sugar and simple carbohydrates. Eat whole grains, vegetables, nuts, seeds, adequate sh or low-fat dairy, proteins, and legumes. Eat regularly three meals per day. Lifestyle: Get 30-60 minutes of exercise daily. (See Appendix A.) Botanicals: Black cohosh: 40 mg standardized extract twice daily Saint John's wort standardized extract: 300 mg 3 times per day200WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE psychosomatic symptoms as well as a feeling of sexual well-being.130 As mentioned earlier, in a double-blind, ran- domized, placebo-controlled study using a com-bination of and Saint John's wort,the study group was signicantly superior to theplacebo group on both a general menopauserating scale and a depression scale. 111 Saint John's Wort Standardized extract of 3 percent hypericin: 300 mg 3 times per day Kava ( Piper Methysticum ).Kava is a plant indigenous to Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polyne-sia. Its properties have been most often analgesic, sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant,and anticonvulsant effects. While kava is typicallynot often thought of as an herb for menopause,anxiety, irritability, tension, nervousness, and sleepdisruption are common perimenopause and meno-pause symptoms in which kava can offer some help.Kava has been used as a social and ceremonial bev-erage for generations by the people of Fiji and otherislands of the South Pacic, at least in part to createa relaxed, stress-free atmosphere. Kava has beenshown to have signicant effects in reducing anxi-ety in a number of studies. 131 Three randomized, controlled trials have investigated the value of kava for menopausalsymptoms. 132-134 The rst two showed signi- cant reduction in anxiety and general menopausesymptoms and the third a reduction in the anxi-ety scale, with kava plus HRT showing the great-est improvement. In 2003, another valuable study evaluated the effects of kava on anxiety, depression, and meno-pause symptoms in perimenopausal women forthree months. 135Eighty women were random- ized to one of three groups. The control groupknowingly received 1,000 mg of calcium per day,the second group received the calcium and 100mg of kava, and the third group received the calcium and 200 mg of kava. There was a clearand similar reduction in depression and anxiety in the two kava dosing groups compared with the calcium alone control group, but not a cleardecline in general menopause symptoms scores. Kava Standardized extract (70% kavapyrones): 100-210 mg per day Additional Botanicals and Combination Herbal Products for Menopause The natural food stores and drug stores are brim- ming with herbal menopause products thesedays. You will nd the herbs we have discussed inmost of them in one combination or another,and perhaps in combination with nutritionalsupplements, soy, or additional herbs that con-tain phytoestrogens or have some other thera-peutic benet specic to menopause. Most ofthese combination products have not beenresearched, even though individual ingredientshave been. I am aware of only one herbal combi-nation product that has been researched in adouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial. I was oneof two principal investigators on this study,which set out to research the effects of a botani-cal formulation containing phytoestrogens onmenopausal symptoms, serum lipids, and someof the hormone indicators of menopause. 136 The treatment group took two capsules of burdock root, licorice root, motherwort, dongquai, and wild yam root times per day.After three months, women receiving the herbalproduct showed a greater response rate thanwomen in the placebo group. One hundred per-cent of women taking the botanical formula hada reduction in their symptom severity, while only67 percent of women receiving the placeboshowed a decrease. Seventy-one percent ofwomen taking the herbal formula reported areduction in the total number of symptoms, while only 17 percent of the women taking the placeboreported a decrease in the total number of their201MENOPAUSE symptoms. The botanical formula was most effec- tive in treating hot flashes, mood changes, andinsomnia. Numerous other herbs can be helpful for individual menopause symptoms. The GermanCommission E (the German agency similar to our FDA) has approved hops for mood issuessuch as anxiety and restlessness and for sleep disruptions. 137Hops contain a group of non- steroidal phytoestrogens called prenylflavonoids.In one study, 67 menopausal women were given either a placebo or a 100 mcg or 250 mcg stan-dardized hop extract for 12 weeks. 138At 6 weeks, the 100 mcg dose was signicantly superior tothe placebo, but not after 12 weeks. Even so,there was a more rapid decrease in menopausesymptoms for both doses of hop extract, espe-cially the hot flash score. The higher dose was notany better than the lower dose. Valerian has been used for centuries by many different cultures and has been used in moderntimes, mostly for anxiety and insomnia. Threerandomized clinical trials have showed improve-ment in sleep quality, although none of these stud-ies were specic to menopausal women. 139-141 Motherwort is another plant that has been used historically in situations that are relevant toperimenopause and menopause. It can ease heartpalpitations and act as a calming agent, known as a nervine. The German Commission E hasapproved its use for nervous cardiac problems. 142 OVERVIEW OF HORMONEREPLACEMENT THERAPY Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), now often called HT as well, has been used since the1950s to treat menopause symptoms and to pre-vent osteoporosis and heart disease. Several keystudies, of the last nine years in particular, havechallenged previously held beliefs about thesafety and efcacy of long-term HRT use. TheWomen's Health Initiative (WHI) was the mostfamous of these studies and was a large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial of 16,608menopausal women aged 50 to 79. 28This study, of 0.625 conjugated equine estrogens (Pre-marin) and mg medroxyprogesterone acetate(Provera) was halted prematurely after 5.2 yearsdue to a slight increase in the risk of breast cancerin women receiving the HRT. Women in thehormone group also appeared to have higherrates of strokes, heart attacks, and blood clotsthan the placebo group. The HRT users also hada reduced risk of colorectal cancer and fractures,but overall the risks outweighed the benets.This study marked a signicant moment in his-tory for HRT, and millions of women discontin-ued their HRT as a result of the ndings. In theve years since the WHI, many studies have beencompleted, shedding new light on why decadesof observational studies of postmenopausalwomen using HRT differed from the WHI studyand why there seems to be such disparityamongst some of the key studies in the area ofmemory, heart disease, and breast cancer in par-ticular. While reviewing each of these studieswould be informative, I would like to summarizeand utilize the 2007 position statement of theNorth American Menopause Society (NAMS)and its expert advisory panel of clinicians andexperts in the eld of women's health. 143The pri- mary goal of understanding HRT research inperi- and postmenopausal women is to come tosome determination as to the risks and benets ofestrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogentherapy (EPT) for symptom relief and diseaseprevention and treatment. For a more compre-hensive discussion on osteoporosis and heart dis-ease, and on the benets and risks of ET andEPT, I refer you to Chapters 14 and 9. The NAMS panel offered two main categories of recommendations: those where the panel wasable to reach consensus and those where they werenot. There are several factors involved in the lack ofconsensus recommendations: the timing of whenHRT was started in relation to perimenopause andmenopause accounts for part of the difculty.Starting HRT in early perimenopause has a differ-202WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ent risk-benet prole than starting 5, 10, or even more years beyond the last menstrual period. Inaddition, the panel acknowledged that there isinsufcient scientic data on the risks of long-termuse of HRT for symptom control versus the long-term use for reduction of risk of certain diseasessuch as osteoporosis, heart disease, or even demen-tia. Another difculty faced in drawing conclusionsfrom the HRT research is that not all the groups ofwomen studied are comparable. Some groups havemore women on statins (drugs for high cholesterol)and others have more overweight women, smokers,or previous users of HRT. These are just some ofthe signicant variables involved in comparing onestudy to the next. Recommendations for the Use of HRT The following summarizes the areas of consensus recommendations for the use of HRT, 143along with some additional input for clarication anddiscussion. Evaluation Prior to Starting HRT. All women should have a complete health evalua-tion, including a medical history and physicalexamination and a mammogram within the pre-vious 12 months before HRT. Decisions on bonedensity testing are made based on each situation. Hot Flashes. The primary indication for using HRT is for the treatment of hot flashes andnight sweats. Vaginal Symptoms. Most systemic and vagi- nal ET and EPT products are approved for treat-ing symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.These symptoms include vaginal dryness, painfulvaginal sexual activity, and atrophic vaginitis. Ifone or more of these symptoms are the onlymenopause symptom, then a local vaginal estro-gen is recommended rather than products thatdeliver a systemic effect. Progestogens. Progestogens include bio- identical progesterone and progestins (which are synthetic). The primary purpose for the useof these products is to provide protection to the lining of the uterus when estrogen is given.Postmenopausal women who have a uterus andwho are given estrogen need an adequate dose ofa progestogen in order to prevent endometrialcancer. For women who have no uterus, a proges-togen is generally not prescribed with the systemic estrogen. (Some practitioners, and espe-cially alternative-minded practitioners, believethat giving a bio-identical progesterone can haveadditional health benets other than protectingthe uterus from the estrogen. A discussion on this is included in the section on bio-identicalprogesterone later in this chapter.) A progestogenis generally not indicated when a low-dose vagi-nal estrogen is used for local vaginal effects. Coronary Heart Disease. \"The majority of observational and preclinical studies support thepotential benets of systemic ET/EPT in reduc-ing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Mostrandomized clinical trials do not. Emerging datasuggest that these disparities in ndings may berelated to the timing of initiation of ET/EPT inrelation to the proximity of menopause. It is cur-rently not clear if ET/EPT can prevent CHD inwomen who do not have evidence of CHD(called primary prevention). There is current evi-dence that initiating ET/EPT in perimenopausalor early postmenopausal women may indeedoffer protection, but this needs further evalua-tion. For women who already have evidence ofCHD, EPT does not provide prevention offuture cardiovascular problems (called secondaryprevention). For the moment, the NAMS panelstates that the use of ET/EPT is not recom-mended for the purpose of coronary heart diseaseprevention in women, no matter their age. It isalso important to note that in the WHI study ofestrogen only, there was no increased risk ofCHD. 144 Venous Thromboembolism (Blood Clots). Postmenopausal women who use ET or EPT havean increase in the risk of venous thromboem-203MENOPAUSE bolism (VTE). This tends to appear during the rst one to two years after starting the hormones,and it tends to decrease over time. In the WHI,there were 11 additional cases per 10,000 womenper year of using EPT and 2 additional cases per10,000 per year in the ET-only women aged 50 to59. It is thought that lower doses of estrogen maybe safer, and possibly estrogen delivered transder-mally as well (creams, gels, and patches). Stroke. Both ET and EPT appear to increase the risk of ischemic strokes (deciency of bloodsupply caused by a clot) in postmenopausalwomen, although clinical trials have not beenconsistent. There were 8 additional strokes per10,000 women per year in the WHI EPT groupand 12 additional strokes per 10,000 women peryear in the WHI ET only group. This is consid-ered rare for the EPT group and slightly aboverare for the ET group. The risk is even lower inwomen who are 50 to 59 years old or within therst ve years of menopause. Women whoalready have cardiovascular disease have a higherrisk of stroke even without the use of hormonetherapy. The panel concluded that no HRT regi-men should be used for the primary or secondaryprevention of stroke, and HRT should be partic-ularly avoided for women who have an elevatedbaseline risk of stroke. Diabetes Mellitus. Large good studies sug- gest that HRT reduces the onset of diabetes mel-litus (DM). Women in the EPT group of theWHI had a 21 percent reduction in DM or whatresulted in 15 fewer cases per 10,000 women peryear of hormone use. Even so, the panel does notrecommend the use of EPT for the sole purposeof DM prevention. Breast Cancer. According to the WHI, breast cancer risk slightly increases in women on EPTafter ve years of use. This risk was rare, slightlyless than having a rst-degree relative with breastcancer, but resulted in four to six additional breastcancers per 10,000 women per year in EPT usersfor ve or more years. It is not clear if there is a dif-ference between women who use HRT daily and those who cycle their hormones by going off for afew days per month. In the ET arm of the WHI,there was no increase in the risk of breast cancereven after seven years of use, and in fact there wereeight fewer cases of breast cancer per 10,000women per year of use of estrogen only. 144 EPT increases the proliferation of breast cells, breast pain, and density of mammograms. ETonly does this to a lesser degree. In fact, it is pos-sible that EPT may interfere with the radiologi- cal interpretation of mammograms. (Otherresearch has shown that women who take EPTand acquire breast cancer get diagnosed earlier onmammograms and have less invasive disease,smaller tumors, and better outcomes.) Osteoporosis. Both ET and EPT reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. For women whohave osteoporosis or are at high risk for fractures,ET/EPT is a treatment option. One shouldweigh the benets and the risks of this and othertreatment options. Depression. Short-term ET may have anti- depressant activity in perimenopausal womenbut not in older postmenopausal women. Thepanel did not support the use of ET or EPT forthe treatment of depression. Dementia and Cognitive Decline. Starting EPT after age 65 is not recommended for the prevention of dementia or cognitive decline.The Women's Health Initiative memory studyshowed an increase in the risk of dementiaduring the ve years in women 65 and older. 145 It is not yet clear as to whether ET or EPT canprevent dementia when hormones are startedduring perimenopause or early postmenopause. Premature Menopause and Premature Ovarian Failure. Women who have the onset of menopause early, and especially prior to age 40,have lower risks of breast cancer, but earlier onsetof bone loss and CHD. It is not known if ET orEPT affects these conditions in this populationof women. It is logical to think that younger204WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE women who start ET or EPT may experience more benets, but this is not known. Risks and Benets. An overriding perspec- tive of ET and EPT use offered by the NAMSpanel is that HRT should be used based on cer-tain goals and evaluating the benets and risksfor each individual woman. This should also takeinto account the cause of menopause (surgical,medications, normal physiology), time sincemenopause, and scope and severity of symptomsand their impact on quality of life, as well as theunderlying risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke,clots, DM, dementia, and depression. Dosing. Lower doses should be considered and can provide adequate symptom relief inmany women, while also being able to stabilizebone loss. Some women will not achieve ade-quate results with lower doses or may need anadditional vaginal estrogen for local vaginalsymptoms. These lower ET and EPT doses arebetter tolerated in terms of less breast tenderness,for example, and may have a better risk-benetprole, although this is not known for certain. Non-Oral Hormones. There is some evi- dence that transdermal estradiol suppliedthrough patches, gels, or creams less likely tocause blood clots because it initially bypassesmetabolism by the liver, which has clotting fac-tors. There is no evidence that transdermal estro-gens are any safer for the breast. Additional Issues. Some additional guide- lines are offered by the advisory panel. Theresults of the WHI are relevant especially forwomen in their mid-60s but should be extrapo-lated with caution for perimenopausal women,women younger than 50 who use HRT, and forwomen early in their menopause. Short-term use (less than ve years) in symptomatic peri-menopausal and early menopausal women isgenerally considered benecial with very smallrisks. Long-term use of the lowest effective dose of ET or EPT is a decision that many women maywant to make based on the benets they receive in relieving their menopause symptoms. Thesebenets may outweigh the risks. Other womenwho may want to use HRT long term are womenwith osteoporosis who also have moderate tosevere menopause symptoms. Another group iswomen who have low bone density for whomother nonhormonal therapies cause too manyside effects or do not work to slow bone loss. Forwomen who have been on HRT and decide tostop, symptoms have about a 50 percent chanceof recurring. The panel's position on bio-identical hor- mones that are compounded for an individual bya special pharmacy is that any risk-benet datapertaining to other kinds of hormones alsoapplies to these compounded hormones. Theyalso expressed a concern as to quality controlissues with some bio-identical compounded hor-mone prescriptions. (In my opinion and experi-ence, quality control is not an issue withcompounding pharmacies that are operated bylicensed pharmacists with oversight by state andfederal agencies.) There were only two areas where the panel did not reach consensus. How to discontinue HRTwas one area. Some clinicians recommend abruptdiscontinuation of HRT, while others taper thedose. In general, it doesn't seem to affect thereturn of menopause symptoms. In women whohave a history of severe symptoms, tapering thedose is a compelling approach, and I nd it to bepreferable. However, there is not current data tosuggest whether stopping abruptly or reducinggradually over time is better. The other area withlack of agreement is whether taking estrogen andprogestin every day has a different effect thancycling the estrogen and progestin or just cyclingthe progestin. There is some concern that dailyprogestin may be related to the adverse breastcancer and cardiovascular effects, but the data isconflicting on this topic. The panel concluded that each woman will have to decide for herself based on her own goals205MENOPAUSE and her own concerns relevant to benets and risks of long-term HRT. An age of less than 60 andwithin the rst four years of menopause are themore optimal times to use HRT. The potentialrisks are small, and even rare, except for stroke,especially for women who use estrogen only. Forwomen younger than 50 and at low risk for CHD,stroke, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and coloncancer, the risks or benets for HRT are evensmaller than those described in the WHI. Again,it is important to emphasize that each womanshould have an evaluation prior to hormone useand should be informed of potential risks. Bio-Identical or Natural Hormones One of the greatest areas of confusion in meno- pause medicine today is the subject of bio-identical or natural hormones. The bio-identicalhormones include estradiol, and dehydroepian-drosterone (DHEA). from many of the commercially availableprescription hormones\u2014some of which are syn-thetic, while others may be derived from a natu-ral substance but are still not bio-identical.Bio-identical hormones are made from eitherbeta-sitosterol extracted from the soybean orfrom diosgenin extracted from Mexican wildyam root. Those compounds are made into thedesired hormone that is biochemically identicalto the hormone the body produces. By deni-tion, a \"natural\" hormone is plant derived andbio-identical. includeestriol, and estradiol. By contrast, non-bio-identical hormones intentionally differ-ent in chemical makeup from the testosterone. It is the chem-ical structure of a hormone, not its source, thatdetermines if a hormone is bio-identical or not. For the past 50 years, conjugated equine estrogen, under the brand name Premarin, hasbeen the most commonly prescribed estrogen in the United States. Conjugated estrogens arederived from pregnant mares' urine. In the believed that Premarin consisted of only10 estrogens\u201417 beta-estradiol, 17 beta dehy-droestrone equilenin. Since then,advancements in technology have revealed thatthe original 10 estrogens make up less than 40percent of the hormonal content of Premarin.Using modern analytical techniques, today over200 individual components have been identied,including androgens and progestins. 146The com- position of Premarin is complex, and differentestrogens produce various effects in different tissues. Herein may lie a theoretical basis for apotentially different effect of conjugated equineestrogens versus bio-identical estradiol. Dr. JoelHargrove has shed some light on these distinc-tions for years. 147His hypothesis is that a non- bio-identical hormone may act like an environ-mental toxin to the genetic material within the cellbecause even though it can bind to the receptorhormone complex, it is a foreign substance. Besides the effect on the genes themselves, bio-identical hormones and non-bio-identicalhormones may very well leave what Dr. Hargrovecalls a \"different metabolic footprint\" on the restof the body with different metabolic conse-quences. They may be directly cytotoxic to estrogen-sensitive tissues, bind differently to dif-ferent kinds of estrogen receptors, alter bindingof other hormones to those receptors, or alter theliver's metabolism of carcinogens. It is this dis-tinction and potential difference in metabolicconsequences, as well as the shorter half-life ofbio-identical hormones, that motivates me to usealmost exclusively bio-identical hormones. Bio-identical estrogens are available as either a patented conventional hormone prescriptionmade by a pharmaceutical company and dis-pensed from a regular pharmacy with a prescrip-206WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE tion, or in a nonpatented form from a specialty pharmacy called a compounding pharmacy, alsoavailable only by prescription. There are a fewkey advantages to the compounded forms. First,health-care providers can create customizeddosing regimens and potencies to t each indi-vidual woman, which can be adjusted in smallunits to taper a woman onto or off of treatment.Second, the pharmaceutical company versionshave additives, binders, adhesives, or preserva-tives included in their formulations because theypatent one or more of those or the delivery tech-nology rather than the estrogen itself. As moreand more practitioners recognize, these chemicalsubstances can cause reactions and side effects inmany individuals. These can include skin reac-tions, headaches, digestive problems, or others,only because of the chemical additive, notbecause of the estrogen itself. Third, bio-identical hormone formulations have a vast array of delivery options to attend tothe specic individual needs of each patient.Capsules, sublingual lozenges or pellets, creams,gels, vaginal creams or gels or tablets, nasalsprays, and even pellets that are implanted underthe skin are available in an innite array ofdosing combinations. These exceed the limitednumber of doses and deliveries that are availablein either the pharmaceutical company bio-identical hormone preparations or the syntheticand semisynthetic prescription estrogens progesterone, testosterone, andDHEA are also available. Any combination ofthese hormones can be formulated in a com-pounded hormone prescription: any dose, anycombination, and the numerous delivery options. I am not suggesting that bio-identical hor- mones are innately good and other hormones areinnately bad. I want to stress that there currentlyis no scientic evidence that bio-identical estra-diol has a better synthetic estrogens,conjugated equine estrogens, conjugated plant are, clear andpotential advantages to bio-identical proges-terone over progestogens.) Much of the decisionas to which kind of hormone to take depends onthe woman. Some would argue that the advantage of con- ventional pharmaceutical company HRT is thatit has undergone years of scientic study. Whilethis is true, there has been little effort to makedistinctions between different kinds of estrogens.Also, as you will see, combining estriol withestradiol, and the use of bio-identical proges-terone and testosterone with the estrogens, pro-vide the potential maximum benet and a moreindividualized approach for each patient. Bio-Identical Estrogens Estrogen is the major hormone that has been used to treat menopausal symptoms. There arethree dominant estrogens in the body: estradiol,estrone, and estriol. Estrone isformed from estradiol. Estriol is produced inlarge amounts during pregnancy and is a break-down product of estradiol. Before menopause,estradiol is the body's predominant estrogen;after menopause estradiol drop so thatestrone becomes the predominant estrogen. Bio-identical estrogen preparations mirror these threenaturally occurring estrogens in your body. Estriol. Naturally occurring estriol is pro- duced by the body almost exclusively duringpregnancy. Practitioners of alternative medicineprimarily use estriol to treat menopausal symp-toms because it is considered to be the safestform of estrogen\u2014it is thought to be less car-cinogenic than estradiol and estrone and is aboutone-fourth the potency. Several researchers have studied the use of estriol on postmenopausal women. Symptomsthat were alleviated with estriol treatmentincluded hot flashes, insomnia, and vaginal dry-207MENOPAUSE ness and itching during intercourse. A common problem associated with menopause is atrophicvaginitis, a condition that occurs when estrogen islacking in the body. Symptoms may include vagi-nal dryness, pain with penetration, increased fre-quency of vaginal and urinary tract infections,urinary incontinence, and urinary frequency andurgency. Estriol can be taken orally, in capsules or tablets, and intravaginally in a cream, gel, or sup-pository to treat urinary incontinence, urgency,persistent urinary tract infections, and infections. I often prescribe estriol vagi-nal cream or suppositories for dry or itchy tissuerelated low estrogen, vulvar/vaginal discom-fort with sexual activity, urinary incontinence,and recurrent urinary and vaginal infectionsin women who are peri- or postmenopausal.These creams most likely work by restoring thevaginal flora, which improves vaginal and blad-der health, and increasing lubrication, elasticity,and thickness of the vaginal skin cells. Estriol cream is equal to the estradiol ring in decreasing vaginal dryness, decreasing atrophicsigns (signs of thinning), and decreasing the vagi-nal pH to a more preferred acidic environment.However, the estriol cream may not be quite asgood at decreasing the itching. 148Estriol has also decreased the incidence of bladder infections.149 A common prescription is 1 mg of estriol pergram of cream. One gram of cream is inserted inthe vagina daily for two weeks as a loading dose,then twice a week as a maintenance program. Estriol Oral estriol: 1-4 mg per day Vaginal cream (1 mg/g): insert 1 g every night for 2 weeks, then twice weekly as a maintenance dose Estriol and Endometrial Cancer. Although there has been a good deal of study as to theeffects of estriol therapy on the endometrial oruterine lining (conventional thickening or overgrowth of the lining,called endometrial hyperplasia, that can lead to cancer), there have been mixed results. In typicaldoses from 1 to 4 mg, there appears to be nothickening of the lining of the uterus. If I wereprescribing higher doses, I would advise usingestriol along with a proven progestational agentto protect the lining from this thickening effect. Estriol and Heart Disease Risk. Estriol has not been studied as extensively as conventionalHRT in terms of its affect on the risk for heartdisease; however, a few studies indicate positiveeffects of estriol, while others have found estriolto have no effect on blood cholesterol levels, aprecursor of heart disease. 150There is no clear risk or benet related to estriol and heart disease. Estriol and Bone Density. Estriol also has been minimally studied regarding its effects onbone density and loss; therefore, I do not useestriol to slow or prevent bone loss or to treat lowbone density. The research is just not convincingenough at this point. However, estriol taken withcalcium lactate supplements may help preventbone loss that occurs during menopause. Estriol and Breast Cancer. Women often opt against conventional HRT because they areafraid that it might put them at risk for breastcancer. Many practitioners and researchers agreethat there is a slight increased risk, and deliveringthe safest possible hormone options continues tobe a goal. This has led some to study and useestriol for reducing the risk of and treating breastcancer. Henry Lemon, M.D., a leading researcher on estriol, has concluded that small doses of estriolgiven in a noncontinuous dosing or cyclic sched-ule provides protection from breast cancer.Although his hypothesis and work is interestingand provides an appealing basis in which to useestriol, his ndings have not been followed upwith rigorous clinical trials. The results of otherresearch has not been promising. 151Estriol, estrone, and estradiol all stimulated humanbreast cancer cells in tissue cultures. However,208WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE estriol may reduce the negative effects of the cancer drug tamoxifen for women already diag-nosed with breast cancer. 152 Prescribing Estriol. Estriol seems to be help- ful in treating many of the symptoms of meno-pause such as hot flashes. However, the jury is stillout as to whether estriol will protect you fromconditions such as osteoporosis and if it providesany heart disease protection or adverse cardiovas-cular effects. Women who currently have breastcancer or who are survivors must weigh the bene-ts and risks after being provided with well-balanced information. The prudent thing to do,given current research, is for breast cancer sur-vivors to avoid the use of oral estriol. Vaginalestriol for vaginal dryness, however, is a preferredform of vaginal estrogen for breast cancer sur-vivors. In a study of 11 postmenopausal womenwith vaginal atrophy who were treated for eightweeks with 0.5 mg/day of estriol vaginal creamdaily for three weeks then twice weekly for veweeks, there was no change in blood levels ofestradiol or estrone. 153In another study of 74 postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophytreated with vaginal estriol cream, while bloodestriol levels rose initially followed by a gradualdecline, the levels of the stronger estrogens,estrone and estradiol, were unchanged. 154This is considered reassuring for breast cancer survivors. A popular practice for prescribing com- pounded natural estrogens is to combine thepotentially safer estriol with small doses of estra-diol and estrone. Currently, practitioners who prescribe a triple-estrogen compound typicallyuse a formula of 80 percent estriol, 10 percentestradiol, and 10 percent estrone. Progesterone isadded to the formula at a minimum of 100 mgper day to protect the uterus from the potentialeffects of the estrogen in thickening the lining ofthe endometrium. Using estrogen only, withoutthe proper dose of progesterone, in women witha uterus might put them at risk for endometrialhyperplasia or even endometrial (uterine) cancer. I use a bi-estrogen formulation containing estriol and estradiol, which is increasingly popularbecause of concerns that estrone may be associatedwith more carcinogenic estrogen metabolites andthus an increase in the risk of breast cancer. Bio-Identical or Natural Progesterone Many people make the mistake of using the term progesterone when they really mean its synthetic counterpart, progestin . Progesterone is the other natural hormone your ovaries make, other thanestrogen, and its main function before meno-pause is to support pregnancy. Progestin is theterm applied to the synthetic derivatives, whichdiffer in biochemical structure from proges-terone. Progestins are the synthetic hormonesused in conventional hormone replacement ther-apy and birth control pills and are what oftenaccount for the side effects that some women feelwhen taking these medications such as irritabil-ity, depression, bloating, and mood swings.These side effects are due to the progestins' ten-dency to cause water retention, affect brainchemistry, and alter other steroid pathways. Pro-gestogen is a term applied to any substance pos-sessing progesterone qualities. It can refer toprogesterone or a progestin. During the perimenopausal phase, when a woman may have months or years of irregularovulation, her production of progesterone beginsto decline. Progesterone falls to almost zero inthe beginning of menopause, while estrogenlevels decline to about 40 to 60 percent of pre- Tri-Estrogen and Bi-Estrogen Formulation Dosages Tri-estrogen formulation (estriol mg/progesterone Bi-estrogen formulation (estriol mg): 1 capsule twice daily(equivalent to 0.625 mg Premarin or 2.5 mg Provera)209MENOPAUSE menopausal levels. The progesterone deciency explains many of the perimenopausal symptomssuch as mood swings, hot flashes, vaginal dry-ness, and irregular menses. In treating perimenopause and menopause symptoms, progesterone can be used for the reliefof symptoms and to balance the effects of estro-gen on the uterus. It has a critical role in prevent-ing endometrial hyperplasia (an overgrowth orthickening of the uterine lining) and uterinecancer. Progesterone is often touted in the natu-ral products marketplace as effective for the pre-vention and treatment of osteoporosis, butclinical trials show that neither oral natural prog-esterone nor progesterone patches or creams canslow, prevent, or reverse bone loss. I can't stress enough that if you are peri- or postmenopausal and are taking any form of estro-gen, you must also take a proven form and dosage of progesterone (or progestin) to protect youruterus from hyperplasia and cancer. The excep-tion is women who have had a hysterectomy; theydo not need to take progesterone or progestins.However, there are times when adding naturalprogesterone rather than increasing the dose ofthe estrogen, even in women without a uterus,may alleviate some menopausal symptoms. Somewomen's insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, andother menopause symptoms may be more respon-sive to progesterone than to estrogen. It is important to note that all progestins (the synthetic progestogen) can have undesiredside effects. 155Premenstrual symptoms such as increased breast tenderness, edema, irritability,and abdominal cramps are fairly frequent, caus-ing as much as 40 percent of women to not taketheir prescriptions properly. Mo re serious side effects are rare and include high blood pressure, blood clotting, and altered carbohydrate lipidmetabolism. 156If you try the synthetic progestins and nd you cannot tolerate them, bio-identicalprogesterone is an excellent option. In fact, bio-identical progesterone is a preferred option notonly to minimize these symptoms, but it alsomay have a positive affect on cholesterol proles and help to keep the coronary arteries in theheart dilated. If you are taking estrogen and are one of the few women who cannot tolerate either the syn-thetic or natural progesterone, you must be mon-itored by a primary care practitioner to watch forcertain cancers such as uterine cancer. Progesterone is available with a prescription in the form of an oral capsule, sublingual drops, sub-lingual pellets, lozenges, or transvaginal or rectalsuppositories; it also may be injected. Progesteroneis also available over the counter as a cream. Progesterone Creams. The most popular form of progesterone is the topical cream. Thegoal of natural progesterone cream is to supportthe waning daily production of progesterone inthe body and keep progesterone at normal levels.The goal is not to supply pharmacological levels(higher doses), as is the case with oral progesterone.Unfortunately there is currently considerable con-fusion and misinformation about progesteronecreams. There are two basic categories of creams: Those that contain wild yam and no progesterone Those that contain diosgenin extract (a phy- toestrogen compound) from wild yam thatis converted into natural progesterone in alaboratory The problem is that the creams that contain only wild yam are not effective as a progesterone agentbecause the body cannot convert the diosgeninto progesterone. The confusion is further exacerbated by the varied strengths of the creams. The wild yamcreams with bio-identical progesterone addedcome in a wide range of dosages. Some of theseproducts have less than 2 mg of progesterone perounce of cream, some have between 2 and 15 mgper ounce, and some have as much as 400 mg perounce or more. It is important to know exactlywhat you are getting because the strength of the210WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE cream will dictate how it is used and what symp- toms it should be used for. As a practitioner, when using the proges- terone creams, I largely use the creams that haveat least 400 mg per ounce because they yield thebest results for most women suffering from PMS,menopause symptoms, and irregular bleeding. Ingeneral, these doses of bio-identical progesteronein cream form tend to be effective for mildersymptoms of menopause. In general, women tolerate bio-identical prog- esterone cream extremely well, and most nd iteffective for alleviating some menopausal symp-toms. Very few women experience side effects(reported as less than 4 percent by the manufac-turing companies), but these may include breasttenderness, drowsiness, depressive moods, head-aches, and irritability. In my experience as a clini-cian, I have found very few side effects. Bio-identical progesterone cream is typically used for menopausal symptoms such as hotflashes, mood swings, sleep disruption, and irreg-ular and/or heavy bleeding. Absorption of prog-esterone from the creams through the skin isvariable from person to person. A study evaluat-ing different concentrations of progesteronecreams has demonstrated that the progesteronecan be measured in the blood if the cream isapplied on a regular basis. 157This same study also demonstrated signicant improvement in hotflashes and night sweats. However, another studyon transdermal progesterone cream delivering 32mg daily did not show evidence that it suppliedsufcient hormone to enter the body to achieve abiologic or therapeutic effect on lipid levels orbone mineral markers or to improve vasomotorsymptoms or moods. 158Bio-identical proges- terone cream has yet to be adequately studied toshow sufcient protection of the uterus when given with an oral estrogen or estrogen patch. I do not recommend that progesterone creams be used to prevent heart disease, osteo-porosis, breast cancer, endometrial hyperplasia,or uterine cancer. There is continuing researchon the benets of progesterone creams, but todate there is insufcient evidence that they pro-tect women from any of these conditions. Oral Micronized Progesterone (OMP). While bio-identical progesterone creams are pop-ular with women in menopause, only the oral,injectable, and vaginal gel forms, available byprescription only, are available in high enoughconcentrations to protect against endometrialhyperplasia, a thickening of the uterus that canlead to cancer. Studies demonstrate that oral micronized progesterone (OMP) is effective in preventingendometrial hyperplasia associated with estrogenuse. 159It does not undermine estrogen's bone loss benets, nor does it improve bone density whenit is added to estrogen replacement, 160and it does not appear to increase the risk of heart disease.161 However, I can't stress enough that if you areperi- or postmenopausal with an intact uterusand taking any kind of estrogen, you must also take a proven form and dosage of progesterone(or progestin) to protect your uterus from hyper-plasia and uterine cancer. If you do not toleratesynthetic progestins, bio-identical progesteroneis an excellent option. If you are one of the smallnumber of women who do not even tolerate bio-Natural Progesterone Cream Apply natural progesterone cream (400 mg proges- terone per ounce) to the palms, inner upper arms, orinner thighs. Perimenopausal Women Days 1-7: do not use progesterone cream during menses Days 8-21: 14tsp twice a day Days 22-28: 14-12tsp twice a day Menopausal or Postmenopausal Women 14tsp twice daily continuously211MENOPAUSE identical progesterone and you are taking an estrogen, then you and your uterus must be reg-ularly monitored by a primary care practitioner. OMP is available by prescription from a com- pounding natural pharmacy in any dose yourprovider prescribes. It is also available from aconventional pharmacy under the trade namePrometrium. For perimenopausal women whoare taking estrogen every day, oral progesteronecan be given at a dose of 100 mg per day everyday, or it can be given at 200 mg per day on days15 to 26 of the cycle. These doses are based on an average dose of estrogen replacement or less. For higher doses ofestrogen, the dose of progesterone will need to beincreased as well, typically doubled. Progesteroneis prescribed on a cyclical basis (as opposed toevery day) for women who are still bleeding. Thiscycling of the progesterone allows them to stillhave a monthly period, the onset of which occurswithin a few days of stopping the progesterone.Sublingual Progesterone. Sublingual (under the tongue) progesterone has basically the sameuses for menopause and premenstrual symptomsas the creams and the oral progesterone. How-ever, it is generally stronger than the creams andweaker than the usual oral doses. Typically, thetablets must remain under the tongue for 20minutes while they dissolve before the proges-terone is fully absorbed. One advantage of sublingual tablets\u2014as well as creams and vaginal and rectal suppositories\u2014is that they are not signicantly metabolized bythe liver, as is the case with oral progesterone.This is thought to minimize side effects. However,there is very little information available as tohow sublingual progesterone works and its possi-ble longer-term side effects, so I take care whenrecommending this form of progesterone. Themain issue is that sublingual progesterone andprogesterone creams have not yet been proven toprotect the uterus from the effects of estrogen replacement. Rectal administration of progesterone has not been well studied. Nasal sprays of progesterone(in oil) produce relatively low serum levels,which are sustained for only a few hours. 163Even though these levels are low, they can producesome secretory changes in the endometrium andmay prove with further to be sufcient toreverse endometrial hyperplastic effects of estro-gen replacement therapy. More About HRT and Breast Cancer. The issue of progestogens and breast cancer is com-plex and not very well understood. It is difcultto come to a comfortable conclusion on thismatter. One of the largest studies to date, theNurses' Health Study, showed that adding a syn-thetic progestin to estrogen failed to reduce theincidence of breast cancer and actually increasedit. 164Women taking estrogen alone had a 36 per- cent increase in their risk of breast cancer; thoseon estrogen plus progestin had a 50 percentincrease; those progestins alone had a 240Oral Micronized Progesterone (OMP) Perimenopausal woman taking continuous estrogen and/or a monthly menstrual cycle is desired: 100 mg twice daily (or 200 mg once daily) 12 days per month Perimenopausal woman taking estrogen and/or a monthly menstrual cycle is desired: 1 mg estradiol(or equivalent) plus 50 mg OMP twice daily (or 100 mg once daily) 3 weeks on and 1 week off (during menses) Postmenopausal woman taking continuous estrogen and a monthly cycle is not desired: 1 mg estradiol (or equivalent) plus 50 mg OMP twice daily (or 100mg once daily) continuously In my experience, women have few side effects with OMP in doses of 200 mg or less. Higher doses, 400mg per day, are sometimes prescribed for amenorrhea, or lack of menstruation, in women who are not yet truly menopausal, or to manage heavy acute uterinebleeding. However, in high doses OMP can cause side effects, including dizziness, abdominal cramping, headaches, breast pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, irri-tability, and abdominal bloating. 162212WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE percent increase\u2014although this number may be misleading because the number of women ononly progestins was very small. The Nurses'Health Study also was able to report on durationof use. For women who had been taking estrogenand progestin for ve to ten years, there was a 46percent increase in their risk of breast cancer. Atthe end of 2000, the Nurses' Health Study pub-lished its estimates of breast cancer risk associatedwith HRT in postmenopausal women. 165The results were expressed as percentage increases inthe cumulative risk of breast cancer and werefrightening to many: the use of estrogen alone for 10 years leads to a 23 percent increase by age70, and the use of estrogen plus progestin for 10years leads to a 67 percent increase by age 70. Itis important to realize that the result is not anactual mathematical conclusion but the conclu-sion of the model, the consequences of a smalldifference in risk that gets magnied as the mathis carried out into the future. Also, it is importantto realize that risk estimates represent a projec-tion, not an actual measurement. Another study done in Seattle had contradic- tory ndings to the Nurses' Health Study. 166This study found no effect on the risk of breast cancerfrom either estrogen alone or estrogen and prog-estins together. In the WHI group of estrogenplus progestin users, there was a slight increase in breast cancer after ve years of use. 28In the estrogen-only arm of the WHI, estrogen did notincrease the risk of breast cancer, even after sevenyears of use. 144 At the other end of the pendulum, investiga- tions that have found no increased risk of breastcancer with HRT or ERT use receive much lessattention. The Iowa Women's Health Study isprospectively following a cohort of women who were selected in 1985. 167After six years of following these women, a statistically signicantincrease in the risk of breast cancer could not bedetected in women who had either ever usedHRT or who were currently using it. Anotherreport through eight years of follow-up looked atwhether postmenopausal HRT increased the risks for breast cancer and death from breastcancer in women with a family history of breastcancer. 168There was no signicant increase in the rate of breast cancer even in women with a familyhistory of breast cancer who were using HRTlonger than ve years. These results are consistentwith other reports that there is no additional riskin using HRT/ERT in women who have a rst-degree relative with breast cancer. The latest analysis from the Iowa Women's Health Study, an 11-year follow-up, showed anassociation between women who had ever usedpostmenopausal HRT and the risk of breast can-cers that were more localized and had a betterprognosis. 169The study did not nd an increased risk of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma inwomen who had used HRT either less than ormore than ve years. A slight increased risk ofbreast cancer was observed in current users andthose with less than ve years of use; currentusers with more than ve years of use had noincrease in risk. These results are the opposite ofthose seen in the Nurses' Health Study\u2014womenwho are using HRT for more than ve years have the increase in risk. 164T wo other recent studies, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study170and analyses from the National Health and NutritionExamination Survey (NHANES), 171found no increased risk with postmenopausal hormones.These recent studies perpetuate the inconsistencyin research on this issue that has been true in thelast 25 years. This provides some logic to thepoint of view that if there is an increased risk ofbreast cancer associated with ERT/HRT, the riskmust be small because otherwise by now, afterthis many years, we would have seen more con-sistency in the data and the size of the risk esti-mates would be large rather than slight. A reminder about duration of use offers some reassurance amidst the confusion. No studiesnd an increased risk of breast cancer with short-term use of HRT, and the conflicting results ofmore than 60 studies demonstrate that if there is213MENOPAUSE an increased risk with long-term use, it is a slight increase. The effect of bio-identical progesterone on the risk of breast cancer in menopausal womenwho are taking bio-identical EPT is basicallyunresolved. Some evidence does exist that bio-identical progesterone might help to preventbreast cancer. In a 1995 study, women who werescheduled for breast reduction surgery appliedprogesterone cream to their breasts for two weeksbefore the surgery. 172The cells in the removed breast tissue showed less cell division in thewomen who used the progesterone cream, andthe researchers concluded that progesteroneapplied directly to the breast might even helpprevent breast cancer. In perhaps the most com-pelling study to date, done in France, transder-mal bio-identical estradiol plus oral micronizedbio-identical progesterone was not associatedwith an increased risk of breast cancer whereastransdermal estradiol with progestins did increasethe risk, similar to the WHI results. 173 For women already at risk for breast cancer or who have had breast cancer, no good studies existon the effects of progestins or progesterone. Friendlier and Less-Friendly Conventional HRT Friendlier conventional HRT includes all estro- gens manufactured by a pharmaceutical com-pany that are made with bio-identical estradiolor estrone. As stated previously, the differencesare the binders, llers, preservatives, adhesives,and additives used in these products. Oral capsules of 1 mg bio-identical hormones areequivalent to 0.625 mg of conjugated are equivalentto 0.625 mg or mg of oralbio-identical estradiol. Estradiol cream and gelare also Less-friendly conventional HRT uses hor- mones that are composed of estrogens and prog-estins that are not identical to a woman's own estro- gen or progesterone. Conjugated equine estrogensare derived from the urine of pregnant mares.Esteried are in part estrone sulfate andin part equilin sulfates. (See Appendix C for a charton current conventional hormone options.) Androgens. The normal postmenopausal ovary produces testosterone as well as andro- stenedione amounts of estrogen. Fol-lowing menopause, a woman's androgen (male hormone) production decreases by as much as 50percent. Ovarian androgen production stopsabruptly with surgical menopause and moregradually with natural menopause. A substantialnumber of menopausal women who are givenestrogen replacement at standard dosages con-tinue to have menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and insomnia. Thesewomen may have enhanced symptom relief whenthey are switched to estrogen plus androgen, usually testosterone. Studies have shown thattestosterone increases the bioavailable estrogen,both that produced by the body and that given in a pill. 174 Estrogen and testosterone therapy has been explored not only for its ability to improve vaso-motor symptoms but also to improve sexualdesire and sexual satisfaction. For example, adouble-blind study of women who were dissatis-ed with their HRT regimen showed that sexualdesire, satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activ-ity were increased when they used the estrogen/testosterone combination. 175Another study of early postmenopausal women, both natural andsurgical, were switched from estrogen alone toestrogen/testosterone therapy. 176Overall symp- tom relief was greater with estrogen/testosteronetherapy than with estrogen-only therapy. Sexualdrive and satisfaction increased. Results of otherstudies have shown that the combination of 1.25mg of esteried estrogen and 2.5 mg of methyl-testosterone given daily for two years signi-cantly reduced the intensity of hot flashes and214WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE vaginal dryness in women with surgical meno- pause.177A study comparing the effects of estro- gen and an estrogen/testosterone combinationon sex drive showed improvement in 50 percentof women on estrogen alone, but 90 percent ofwomen when testosterone was added. 178 There have been some concerns about estro- gen/testosterone therapy reversing the increasedHDL cholesterol achieved with estrogen alone.The combination of esteried estrogens andmethyltestosterone has been shown to decreasetriglycerides, LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol in postmenopausal women. However, a two-yearstudy of estrogen/testosterone therapy producedno change in LDL levels but did show signicantreductions in triglycerides and very low-densitylipoprotein, and also reduced HDL levels. So thestory is mixed, and further studies are needed todetermine the actual impact of these changes oncardiovascular disease. If testosterone is used, itwould be prudent to monitor blood lipid levelsfor any adverse effects. For treatment of osteoporosis, adding testos- terone to estrogen therapy appears to produce agreater increase in bone density compared withestrogen therapy alone. In a double-blind study,66 surgically menopausal women without osteo-porosis received either 1.25 mg of esteriedestrogen alone or 1.25 mg of esteried estrogenand 2.5 mg of methyltestosterone daily for twoyears. Both groups already had bone loss at thespine, hip, and wrist. Only the combination ofestrogen with testosterone signicantly increasedspinal bone density after one year and two years. Standard formulations of CEE and methyl- testosterone combine either 0.625 or 1.25 mg of CEE with 5 mg of methyltestosterone. Otherformulations contain either 1.25 or 0.625 mgesteried estrogens, combined with 2.5 or 1.25mg of methyltestosterone, respectively. Through a compounding pharmacist, one can obtain bio-identical testosterone. I generallyuse 1 to 3 mg for-mulated into the bi-estrogen or tri-estrogen for-mulation, and the pills are taken one capsule twice daily. Testosterone cream applied to thegenital region has received mass media attentionon \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" It is used as analternate method of delivering the testosterone.Common prescriptions are anywhere from 1 to 4mg per gram of cream. These are applied to theexternal genital region right before sexual activityto enhance sensation to touch and orgasm. Useshould not exceed twice per week to avert localtestosterone side effects such as enlargement ofthe clitoris that can occur if testosterone cream isused daily and in the stronger dosages. A goodresource for both menopausal women and theirhealth-care practitioners is a book called The Hormone of Desire . 179 The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) invited a panel of clinicians andresearchers who were experts in the eld oftestosterone therapy to review the scientic evi-dence regarding the role of exogenous testos-terone in postmenopausal women. 180Their conclusions were as follows: Postmenopausalwomen with decreased sexual desire with noother cause other than being postmenopausalmay be candidates for testosterone treatment.Because of lack of adequate evidence for testos-terone increasing sexual function, testosteronetreatment without also giving estrogen therapycannot be recommended. Other causes of lowlibido are to be ruled out and laboratory testingof testosterone levels should be used only tomonitor for supraphysiologic levels before andduring therapy, not for the purpose of diagnosingtestosterone insufciency. Monitoring would beincluded in an ofce visit follow-up assesschanges in sexual function. T ransdermal and top-ical gels or creams are preferred over oral formsdue to their minimal effect on the liver. Testos-terone therapy is contraindicated in women withbreast or uterine cancer and in women with car-diovascular or liver disease. Testosterone shouldbe given at the lowest dose for the shortest timethat meets treatment objectives.215MENOPAUSE Bio-Identical Testosterone Oral: 2-6 mg per Cream (1-4 mg/g): apply twice weekly to external genitalia before sexual Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Dehy- droepiandrosterone (DHEA) is another of theandrogens. It is the most abundant circulatingsteroid in humans. DHEA is called a precursorhormone because it is produced in large amountsin the body and other steroid hormones are madefrom it, including estrogen and testosterone. In awoman, 90 percent of DHEA comes from theadrenal glands; the remaining 10 percent is manu-factured by the ovaries. Our DHEA level peaks atage 25 and then declines gradually to only 15 to 20percent of our maximum by the time we turn 70. Many claims have been made about DHEA's effect on the immune system, and its anti-agingproperties are said to include better memory, lessfatigue, more energy, relaxation, and increasedability to handle stress. It is also touted as havingpositive effects on bone density and helping toprevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. How-ever, the exact effect DHEA has on the body'scells is unclear. I have seen DHEA increaseenergy, improve stress response, improve musclemass, and occasionally increase libido. A daily oral intake of 50 mg of DHEA for a postmenopausal woman may restore DHEAlevels to those of a young adult. At this dosage,DHEA is converted to other more potent andro-gens, including testosterone. In pharmacologicaldoses of 1,600 mg, DHEA is converted toestrone and estradiol. Unfortunately, there areonly a handful of randomized placebo-controlledstudies examining the effects of giving DHEA tohumans. Although animal studies are promising,we need more research on its particular effects onpostmenopausal women. One of the most signicant effects of DHEA may be its ability to enhance a sense of generalwell-being. This effect was found at doses of 50mg and 100 mg daily. 181Few adverse effects have been reported with DHEA, although in women,androgenic side effects such as facial hair growthand acne can occur with doses as low as 50 mg.A dose of 25 mg daily may be more appropri-ate. 182I typically give 5 to 20 mg per day to women who are either low in DHEA accordingto test results or to women with fatigue, loss ofvitality, and/or low sex drive. DHEA 5-50 mg per day Exercise The benets of exercise for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women are wide and deep.Women can receive substantial reductions in car-diovascular disease, 183a reduced risk of breast cancer,184an increase in bone density,185a lower- Sample Treatment Plan for Hot Flash Symptom Relief Diet: Follow a whole foods diet high in fruits, vegeta- bles, whole grains, and legumes. Emphasize soybean products and flaxseed. Reduce total fat, animal fats, and simple carbohydrates. Eat modest amounts of organic low-fat dairy. Exercise: Regular weight-bearing, strengthening, and aerobic exercise with light weight training Herbal: Choose one of the following: Black cohosh standardized extract capsules (40 mg): 1-2 capsules 1-2 times per day cream (400 mg/oz or more): apply 14tsp twice daily 3 weeks on and 1 week off if perimenopausal Bio-identical estrogens/progesterone (estriol 1 mg/estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone): 1 capsule (50 mg) twice daily (1 week off if perimenopausal)216WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ing of body fat and body mass index, and an improved sense of well-being.186The ability of exercise to reduce the incidence or severity of hotflashes during menopause is not clear. It appearsthat for women who are not overweight, moder-ate exercise may be benecial for hot flashes andmore vigorous exercise may exacerbate them. Exercise Recommendations. Physical exer- cise that includes strength, cardiac, and flexibilitymodalities (see Appendix A) ensures a meno-pause without exaggerated symptoms and pro-tects against heart disease and osteoporosis whenit is initiated early in life, is appropriate andmoderate, and lasts throughout life. However, if you have reached menopause and have been sedentary, start slowly and progressgradually. Consult an exercise consultant to learnthe safest program both for aerobic and strength/weight training. Solutions to Selected Problems Insomnia. In determining individualized treatments for insomnia, it is imperative to iden-tify and address the underlying cause as well asprovide options for short-term relief. The basicsstart with good sleep hygiene. This includesgoing to bed at the same time each night andavoiding or reducing naps. A comfortable bedand room temperature along with low levels oflight and noise contribute to better sleephygiene. It is often advised that the bedroomshould not be used for eating or television watch-ing but rather only for sleep and intimacy. If youare not able to fall asleep after 20 to 30 minutesin bed, get out of bed and engage in a quiet activ-ity and then return to bed when sleepy. Nutritional practices may influence sleep. Caffeinated drinks may have to be avoided alto-gether or at least within 12 hours of sleep. Someindividuals have nighttime hypoglycemia. Adrop in blood glucose level causes the release ofchemicals that can stimulate the brain. Consum-ing complex carbohydrates with protein can helpmaintain sleep through the night by regulating nighttime blood glucose levels. Relaxation techniques such as biofeedback, progressive muscular relaxation, meditation, andwarm baths can help sedate some people. Sooth-ing music may also reduce anxiety and stress.One study showed that after listening to musicwhile trying to go to sleep, the level of sleepinesswas signicantly increased and the time to sleeponset was much lower. The music became moreeffective each night of continued use. 187 Some studies of insomnia in postmenopausal women demonstrate that HRT signicantlyimproves sleep quality, shortens sleep onset, andreduces nighttime restlessness and awakenings. 188 Sleep efciency and time spent awake after sleeponset appear to be signicantly better when usingoral micronized progesterone with estrogenreplacement therapy but not when using syn-thetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). 189 Insomnia is not only a frequent medical problem, but it's also a difcult problem. Insom-Sample Treatment Plan for Insomnia See the Resources section for formulation sources. Diet: Avoid stimulants, especially during the second half of the day (coffee, caffeinated tea, chocolate, caffeinated sodas). Have a protein snack before bed. Lifestyle: Get regular exercise, practice good sleep hygiene. Herbal: Black cohosh extract: 40 mg twice dailyValerian: 1-2 capsules or 1-2 tsp liquid extract before bed Nutritional supplement: 2 mg melatonin before bed For difcult cases: Add hormone prescription, with oral micronized progesterone taken right before bed. Consider adding 5-HTP, higher doses of melatonin, or other herbal combinations of hops, valerian, and passionflower.217MENOPAUSE nia is usually a symptom of an underlying hormonal, nutritional, pharmacological, orpsychological problem. Some women may needevaluation for sleep apnea, treatment of psycho-logical issues, or pharmacological treatment. Melatonin. One of the better-known natural treatments for insomnia is melatonin. Oneplacebo-controlled trial on melatonin found that0.5 mg of melatonin daily for two weeks short-ened the amount of time it took to fall asleep buthad no effect on sustaining sleep or improvingthe quality of the sleep. 190In another study, 2 mg of melatonin per day was effective in improvingsleep efciency. 191Melatonin has also been effec- tive in patients with long-term insomnia whowere using benzodiazepines. 192Most patients were able to decrease their benzodiazepines by 50percent during the second week of using 2 mg ofmelatonin nightly and discontinue it by the fthor sixth week. It is thought that individuals whoactually have a melatonin deciency are mostresponsive to melatonin 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). 5-HTP is a form of tryptophan that has been reported innumerous double-blind studies to decrease thetime required to get to sleep and to decrease thenumber of night awakenings. 193-196 The typical dosage range of 5-HTP is 100 to 300 mg about45 minutes before bed. Valerian. This herb has been used for decades, if not centuries, as a sedative, including as an aidfor insomnia. Studies have conrmed the effec-tiveness of valerian. In double-blind study improved sleep latency,reduced night awakenings, and improved sleepquality, especially in women. 197Several trials have looked at valerian in combination with otherherbal sedatives such as passionflower and lemonbalm. In one clinical trial, 33 percent of men andwomen without insomnia who took valerian andlemon balm 30 minutes before bed reported animprovement in sleep quality. Only 9 percent inthe placebo group reported improvement. 198Other Botanicals. Numerous plants have seda- tive actions and have been used historically to promote sleep and improve sleep quality. Theseinclude hops, skullcap, chamomile, lemon balm,oat straw, lavender, bitter orange, Californiapoppy, and kava. Preparations can include pow-dered capsules, tinctures, and teas. Most of theseherbs are mild sedatives and are unlikely to sufcealone, but are typically used in combinations. Sexual Function Ginseng. The most well-known herb to im- prove energy and stamina, as well as for sexual rejuvenation, is ginseng. American ginseng hastraditionally been used for weakness, loss ofmuscle tone, low endurance, loss of work efciency,and decreased sexual function. The ginsenosides inAmerican ginseng exert an estrogen-like action onthe vaginal epithelium that improves the lubrica-tion and elasticity of the vaginal tissue, contributingto sexual response and comfort. In animal stud-ies, ginseng increased testosterone levels inmales. 199Given the potential influence of testos- terone on sexual function in women, this maypartly account for its effect in women as well.Therapeutic effects of ginseng on the reproduc-tive system of female animals also include accel-erating ovarian function, enhancing ovulation,and stimulating egg production. 200 (Enhancing pelvic and specically genital cir- culation is also a consideration for which onemight consider ginkgo. Ginkgo was also dis-cussed earlier in the botanicals section as an aidto improve sexual function in women takingantidepressants. 78) Several studies show the ability of ginseng to battle fatigue and stress. One study of nurseswho took ginseng showed improved scores in jobcompetence, mood, and mental and physicalperformance. 84 Ginseng has also been shown to enhance the ability to cope with various mental and physicalstressors, largely due to its effect on the adrenalglands, which are involved in maintaining our218WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE hormonal balance. Finally, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 232 patients withfatigue, it was found that ginseng improved fatigue,anxiety, nervousness, and poor concentration. 201 Damiana. All students of herbal medicine are probably familiar with damiana's time-honoredreputation as an aphrodisiac. It is unclear how theconstituents of damiana bring about this effect,and indeed no studies have proven this effect onwomen, but it has been shown to enhance sexualbehavior in animals. A combination product thatincluded ginseng, damiana, and gingko was shownin a small placebo-controlled study to improvesexual desire and satisfaction. 202Mexican Indians and generations of herbalists have looked to dami-ana to improve sexual interest and response. Ashwagandha. In cases of general debility, nervous exhaustion, loss of muscle strength, andthat all-familiar \"brain fog,\" the ashwagandhaplant that grows and is cultivated in India andeven the Himalayas is well-known in folk medi-cine of that region as a traditional treatment ofthese problems. This plant is regarded in India asa tonic and adaptogen, with properties similar toginseng. In one study, physical endurance wasdoubled in participants given of ashwa-gandha ( Withania 203 golden root or arctic root, has been used for centuries toincrease physical endurance and exercise per-formance 204and as a folk custom to ensure fertil- ity. Effects on regulation of the menstrual cycleand the successful treatment of 25 of 40 womenwho had stopped having menses altogether sup-port its use in matters related to hormones andsexual function. 205 Maca. Maca has been used in Peru for ve thousand years. Alkaloids from the root of theplant act upon the two key glands in the brain,the hypothalamus and the pituitary, supportingand boosting energy levels and encouraging theproduction of ovarian hormones such as estrogenand testosterone. 206Look for these herbs in popular combination products to enhance sexual desire as well as toaddress other menopause issues. The Importance of Lubrication. The amount of estrogen in the vagina is the main determinantof vaginal health, including the pH, the balanceof organisms, the integrity of the tissues, and theamount of lubrication. As estrogen levels declinewith menopause, many changes can occur,including thinning of the vaginal wall tissue,vaginal dryness, loss of vaginal tone, and suscep-tibility to infections. Symptoms such as painwith vaginal sexual activity, itching and burning,and even urinary leakage may result. For sexualfunction and comfort with vaginal sexual activ-ity, lubrication during sex not only is helpful forcomfort, but for some is a necessity. There aremany over-the-counter lubricants, and in thecontext of natural medicine, we can look forlubricants that are less irritating due to a lack ofchemicals and hypoallergenic bases. Somethingas simple as vitamin E oil can be used as a lubri-cant. Products are available that contain vitaminE oil and allantoin and are water based so theyare nondrying and nonirritating. Other naturalvaginal moisturizers are oil based rather thanwater based. Common ingredients are mineraloil, glycerin, yerba santa, castor oil, and more. Itis important to check to see which ones areappropriate to use with condoms and to remem-ber that lubricants do not contain spermicideand so do not provide contraception. The most effective way to improve lubrication over the long term is prescription vaginal estrogens.Please refer to the section on hormones earlier inthis chapter for how to use vaginal estrogens forthinning, dryness, and pain of the vagina andproblems related to these atrophic changes. Topical Ingredients to Enhance Arousal. Numerous botanical and nutrient topical productsnow exist to enhance female arousal and orgasmwhen applied to the vulva (external female genitalarea). One such product is a feminine massage oil219MENOPAUSE that contains borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, extracts of angelica and coleus, and severalantioxidants. A randomized, double-blinded,cross-over study was conducted to evaluate the ef-cacy of this product in women who had been diag-nosed with female sexual arousal disorder. Thetreatment resulted in increases in sexual pleasure inmore than 90 percent of women. 207 Another over-the-counter topical cream that supports female sexual arousal contains nitricoxide, which is the chemical produced by the body to promote the dilation of blood vessels inthe female genital tissues. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are amino acids that the body uses toproduce neurotransmitters important in the initi-ation of blood vessel dilation. Niacin, also knownas vitamin B 3, is known for its ability to dilate blood vessels as well. In addition, oils such as L-menthol from mint oil, rosemary oil, and cinna-mon oil can increase local blood flow and havewarming and stimulating effects when formulatedin a cream and applied to the genital tissues. As discussed earlier in the hormone section, topical testosterone cream is also a valuable toolto enhance genital arousal and orgasm. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Conventional medicine treatment of menopause has changed fairly dramatically in the years follow-ing the initial publication of the Women's HealthInitiative (WHI) report in 2002. Many womenwho were taking hormone therapy for preventionof heart disease and osteoporosis were instructedto stop their hormones, because the WHI sug-gested that there might be a slight increase inbreast cancer and strokes in asymptomatic womentaking hormones. We have known that there is aslight increase in deep venous thrombosis, whichwas conrmed by this study. The study alsoshowed an improvement in prevention of osteo-porosis and colon cancer, but these benecial ef-fects were considered not to be worth the risk. Therecommendation that all menopausal women beplaced on hormone therapy, which was a mainstay of conventional medicine for the preceding 40 to60 years, has changed. After the WHI report, theAmerican College of OB/GYN (ACOG) and theNorth American Menopause Society (NAMS)convened panels of specialists to look at the infor-mation and make recommendations. These rec-ommendations are for the general patient, withprovisos that each individual woman should becounseled and her risk and goals assessed, andsome deviation from these guidelines may be pos-sible at the discretion of the practitioner and pa-tient. There are three commonly agreed-upon usesfor hormone therapy: 1. Decrease of menopausal symptoms 2. Prevention of osteoporosis in women who are intolerant of other medications used totreat osteoporosis 3. Topical use of hormones for urogenital atrophy They also recommend that hormones be used at the lowest effective doses for the shortest effec-tive period of time. What this means is that theprovider should try different doses and nd onethat is most effective in the reduction of awoman's symptoms. That does not mean it has tobe the lowest dose possible. The shortest periodof time means that women should periodicallygo off their hormones to see if their menopausalsymptoms have reduced or gone away. These recommendations are not applicable to womenwho are using hormones for treatment of osteo-porosis, which should be a lifetime treatment.Women with atrophic urogenital symptoms willneed to use their hormones lifelong, but the top-ical vulvovaginal estrogens pose no meaningfulrisks. The lowest effective dose, in the shortestperiod of time, pertains primarily to a womanusing hormones for menopausal symptoms. They recommend that all women with an intact uterus have a progestogen administeredalong with the estrogen to prevent endometrialhyperplasia and uterine cancer. The regimens of220WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE treatment with progestogens varies greatly but are divided into two basic approaches: 1. Continuous daily therapy 2. Cyclic treatment, adding a progestogen 12 to 14 days per month, and recently there is a\"long sequential cyclic\" regimen of 14 daysevery 3 months Woman who do not have a uterus are not required to use a progestogen. Women who have auterus and are progestogen intolerant can have the option of annual uterine lining evaluation withtransvaginal ultrasound or an endometrial biopsy.When using transvaginal ultrasound, women withan endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less are con-sidered not to have disease and do not need anendometrial biopsy unless there is persistentabnormal bleeding or other medical reasons.Women with more than 4 mm thickness may havea normal lining but need an endometrial biopsyand/or a saline sonohystogram. Or, instead of thetwo-step approach of ultrasound and then biopsy,women may instead have an endometrial biopsyyearly to assess the lining tissue. Another alternative is the use of the proges- togen intrauterine system known as a MirenaIUD. This is not an FDA-approved use of thisdevice as of this writing. The Mirena IUD pro-vides a large local progestogen environment forprevention of hyperplasia and cancer withoutany signicant systemic absorption. There is nojustication for the use of unopposed estrogensin a woman with a uterus unless she is doing reg-ular assessments of her uterine lining. There areonly a few reasons why women without a uterusare given progestogens along with estrogen: 1. To increase menopause symptom relief 2. To reduce the risk of endometriosis in women who had active disease during theirsurgery to remove the uterus and ovaries The use of hormone therapy for other reasons is widespread, but is not approved by the FDA,ACOG, or NAMS. There have been empiricreports over the years that the use of estrogen reduces the onset or severity of dementia, macu-lar degeneration, cataracts, tooth loss, and skinwrinkling, and many women choose to use hor-mones for these quality-of-life issues. This goesback to the decision to individualize eachwoman's therapy based on her goals and risk factors. Properly counseled about the risks ofhormone therapy, many women are continuingto use hormones for these issues. That choice isbetween the woman and her provider. A pharmaceutical company's FDA application information shows that 0.014 mg of transdermalestradiol in the form of a weekly patch has beenshown to be effective for prevention of osteoporo-sis, but it does not develop blood levels highenough to increase or build an endometrial lining.Therefore, the FDA is allowing this medication tobe used as an unopposed estrogen in women witha uterus. The information in the package insert forthis medication suggests a progestogen challengetest at 6- to 12-month intervals. Another contro-versial unopposed estrogen use is topical vaginalproducts. Several studies suggest that there is min-imal to no increase in blood estrogen levels withthe use of the vaginal ring, creams, and tablets.Over the years, there have been suggestions that awoman with a uterus using these products begiven a progestogen withdrawal challenge test onan annual basis. These recommendations are vari-ably applied. Again, discussion with the womanabout her choices is probably the most importantmanagement suggestion. So, what hormones are currently being used? The delivery systems and types of hormones havechanged dramatically over the past 10 to 20years. This discussion will provide some informa-tion on the most commonly prescribed products.There are, however, two rst important guidingprinciples for hormone therapy managementthat should be discussed. First is the bioequivalence of oral and trans- dermal estrogen products. The following doses of the different types of estrogen supposedly 221MENOPAUSE provide the same blood levels after administra- tion, and so they are considered biologically (Estrogel): 2 squirtsEstradiol cream (Estrasorb): 2 packets A dosage higher than these amounts would give higher-than-average blood levels, and dosageslower than these amounts would give lower-than-average blood levels. It is acceptable to varythe estrogen dosage to meet the woman's symp-tom requirements. The second guiding principle is that there is a minimal acceptable dosage of progestogen thatwill prevent hyperplasia or uterine cancer. Onecannot go below the recommended amounts ofprogestogen or frequency intervals without therisk of hyperplasia and uterine cancer, so the rec-ommended progestogen dosages should not bevaried. For information on the various types ofconventional estrogen products and the recom-mended progestogen dosages, see the NorthAmerican Menopause Society website, meno-pause.org. This site offers a menopause guide-book that outlines all of the currently availableconventional estrogen and progestogen productsas well as a 47-page committee opin-ion on progestogen usage. (See Appendix C for alist of conventional hormone preparations andsome details about dosing.) For purposes of the summary discussion in this chapter, these are the conventional hormoneguidelines: 1. Estrogens. The most commonly used estro- gens are the oral forms, and they come as estra-diol (by product name and generic), come combina- tion products containing an estrogen plus a pro-gestogen and in transdermal patches, gels, andcreams, as well as in a vaginal ring that providestransdermal systemic estrogen levels (Femring).Even some conventional practitioners areincreasingly using compounded hormone ther-apy, which has the benet of a variety of dosingforms and can be compounded as an oral cap-sule, a transdermal cream or gel, a vaginal tablet,or a sublingual-dissolving medication. 2. Combination products. The combinations of estrogen plus progestogen products are verypopular because the woman can take one med-ication and get both hormones. These come inoral forms and in two patch brands. There isalso a combination estrogen plus progestogenvaginal product called NuvaRing, which is alow-dose birth control product that has beenused for perimenopausal symptom relief andcycle control. And again, there are compounded hormone products from the compoundingpharmacies. 3. Progestogens. There are several commer- is available in a product calledPrometrium, in two dose forms. Compoundingpharmacies can compound bio-identical proges-terone in oral, sublingual, transdermal, or vagi-nal form. There is also a vaginal bio-identicalprogesterone, FDA approved for use in infertil-ity, that comes in a 4 percent and 8 percent geland can be used for vaginal application of sys-temic progesterone. 4. Vaginal estrogens. Vaginal estrogen prod- ucts that are used only for urogenital atrophicproblems are very weak estrogens and are notlikely to increase blood levels. For many years,vaginal creams have been available in eitherestradiol or conjugated estrogens, but in the222WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE past 10 years or more, we have also had the three-month indwelling vaginal ring estrogencalled Estring and vaginal tablets of estradiolcalled Vagifem. Compounded vaginal estrogenproducts in variable doses are also available.Conventional practitioners by and large do notuse these and are particularly unaware of how touse vaginal estriol, as discussed in the alternativemedicine section on hormone therapy. Nonhormonal medical options have in- creased in popularity and understanding. For low bone density, a bisphosphonate such as Fosamax, Actonel, or Boniva or a selective estro-gen receptor modulator (SERM) such as Evista(raloxiphene) may be prescribed. Or for severeosteoporosis, parathyroid hormone (Forteo)\u2014which works on the bone in an entirely differentway than hormones, SERMs, or bisphospho-nates\u2014may be recommended. For insomnia, there are many different options depending on age, type of use (daily versus inter-mittent), and abuse potential of the patient. Most sleep aids are benzodiazepines, some are antihistamines, and a new one (Rozerem) works on melatonin receptors. Consult a physician wellacquainted with the use of these medications. For anxiety and depression, there are the common For vasomotor symptoms, a blood pressure med, a seizure drug, SSRIs, SNRIs, and ergotscan be prescribed. None of these medications'actions on relieving sweats and flushes are under-stood\u2014practitioners have just observed thatsome women on some medications had signi-cant improvement in their symptoms. Most ofthe drugs are safe and easy to use, but some are expensive. The blood pressure med used isClonidine, usually 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily at bed-time. The anti-epileptic drug gabapentin (Neu-rontin) is administered as 300 mg three times aday. Effexor and Paxil have shown a reduction insweats and flushes in studies at 37.5 to 75 mg and 10 to 20 mg daily, respectively. However,SSRIs and SNRIs have been occasionally shownto cause vasomotor men andwomen. Bellergal Spacetabs, an and bel-ladonna combination, were used for many yearsfor vasomotor symptoms but are no longer madeby its pharmaceutical company. Some com-pounding pharmacies supply it. There are nostudies on it, but empirical reports have shownmixed results. It is used one to two times daily. Sexual problems are commonly reported by women in midlife, and the treatment is verycomplex. Libido can be decreased because ofestrogen deciency, sudden surgical loss of testos-terone from an oophorectomy (not from naturalovarian aging), or the administration of an oralestrogen, which can lower serum testosterone.Libido can decrease because of pain with inter-course, decreased skin sensation from loss ofestrogen, chronic medical problems, medica- tions, or most often from the woman's psychoso-cial environment. Sexual performance problemscan have similar roots but are often the result ofother diseases (hypertension, diabetes, athero-sclerosis) that affect clitoral and pelvic blood flowor from medications used to treat other diseases(notably antidepressants). A few studies havebeen done on the use of testosterone to improvesexual function and have shown conflictingresults. The work done by Dr. David Archerusing testosterone patches (pending FDAapproval) shows improvement in women whohad bilateral oophorectomy but not those whohave undergone natural menopause. Testosteroneis not well absorbed orally, and it has potentialhealth risks such as permanent voice change, hairgrowth on the face or body, loss of head hair,lipid elevations, acne/oily skin, and emotionalside effects. More research is needed on the roleof hormones in sexual dysfunction in women. In summary, the conventional practitioner's use of hormone therapy and the standard of practicethese days is limited to three areas of use: meno-223MENOPAUSE pausal symptoms, osteoporosis prevention or treat- ment, and vaginal or urogenital atrophic symp-toms. The formulations of type, dose, and deliveryhave signicantly increased, and it is important towork with a provider who is capable and knowl-edgeable about the various products. Most womenwill do well on most hormone products, but forthose women whose symptoms do not respondeasily to these products, a knowledgeable meno-pause clinician can provide better guidance. It isimportant for a woman with a uterus to use a pro-gestogen along with estrogen replacement. Womenwho have had a hysterectomy do not typically needprogestogens. Hormone therapy is used for nonap-proved, nonstandard reasons, and the patient needsto be counseled about risks and needs to dene hergoals. This is an acceptable practice as long asproper counseling is provided. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Most women who are perimenopausal can feel comfortable starting on their own with the diet,exercise, herbs, nutritional supplements, and nat-ural progesterone creams described in this chapterfor the relief of menopause symptoms. Womenwho do not nd adequate relief from these thera-pies will need to see a licensed primary careprovider (naturopathic doctor, medical doctor,osteopathic doctor, nurse-practitioner, or physi-cian's assistant) who preferably is educated in therange of options, not just conventional HRT.My advice to all women is to at some time have a full evaluation by a practitioner whois educated in all the natural, hormonal, andpharmaceutical nonhormonal options. The only primary care practitioners that are trained inthe medical school setting about all of theseoptions are licensed naturopathic physicians. The purpose of this evaluation, as discussed inthe overview section and the overview of alterna-tive medicine, is to conduct a medical history,physical exam, and necessary laboratory andimaging studies to determine the risk for osteo-porosis and heart disease. After a determinationof whether you are at low risk, medium risk, orhigh risk for these conditions, a treatment planwill be recommended. Using natural therapies versus using conven- tional or bio-identical HRT or some combina-tion of the these is a very personal decision. A well-informed patient who also has the goodfortune of having a well-informed, respectful,open-minded practitioner is in the best positionto make appropriate decisions. Remember thatany decision you make is reversible. Decisionscan and do change over time. Menopause, aging,and our concerns about long-term health prob-lems evolve over time, and balance is necessary.Na\u00efvet\u00e9 is inappropriate, and over-medicalizationof menopause is also inappropriate. Menopauseis a normal and natural event of aging. It can bea time of strength, empowerment, personalgrowth, and positive, life-changing insights anddecisions.This page intentionally left blank 225OVERVIEW Menstrual cramps are one of the most common problems that women face, affecting over 50 per-cent of menstruating women. The term dysmen- orrhea , derived from the Greek and meaning \"difcult monthly flow,\" is commonly used torefer to painful menstruation. isbest classied as primary or secondary. In pri-mary dysmenorrhea, painful menstrual crampsoccur that have nothing to do with any physicalabnormalities or identiable pelvic disease. Sec-ondary dysmenorrhea is painful menstrualcramps due to some specic pelvic or systemiccondition such as endometriosis, pelvic inflam-matory disease, adhesions, ovarian cysts, celiacdisease, thyroid conditions, congenital malfor-mations, narrowing of the cervical opening,polyps, or uterine broids. We will be focusingon primary dysmenorrhea in this chapter,although the treatments in this chapter for acutepain relief can be used in both primary and sec-ondary dysmenorrhea. T reatment for secondary dysmenorrhea is directed to treating the underlying cause of thecondition, whether it is endometriosis, broids,or another condition. Menstrual cramps are asignicant personal and public health problemfor women. Of the 50 percent of menstruatingwomen who are affected by menstrual cramps,about 10 percent have severe pain that rendersthem incapacitated for one to three days eachmonth. 1It is estimated that 600 million work hours are lost in a year in the United Statesbecause of untreated and incapacitating dysmen-orrhea. Social and family life is also disrupted bythe painful episodes. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs most com- monly between the ages of 20 and 24. Women in13MENSTRUAL CRAMPS CHAPTER this age group experience the most severe pain. Women older than 24 have less painful cramp-ing, and the overall incidence of primary dys-menorrhea tends to decrease with age\u2014morerapidly in married women than in unmarriedones, possibly due to pregnancy and childbear-ing. Women who begin to menstruate at ayounger age and have longer menstrual periodshave increased severity of pain and more days ofpain. In smokers, cramps tend to last longer. Infact, a recent study showed that there is a deniterelationship between the amount of cigarettesmoke exposure and menstrual cramps. 2Being overweight is also an important risk factor for menstrual cramps, and it doubles the odds ofhaving a long painful episode. 3Conversely, being underweight has also been shown to be an inde- pendent risk factor for dysmenorrhea.4 Primary dysmenorrhea usually appears within 6 to 12 months after the rst menstrual period.The pain usually begins several hours before orjust after the onset of menstruation and is oftenthe most severe the rst or second day of men-struation. It tends to be spasmodic and isstrongest in the lower part of the abdomen abovethe pubic hairline, although it can often radiateto the back and along the inner aspects of thethighs. More than 50 percent of women withmenstrual cramps also have additional symptomsincluding nausea and vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea,lower backache, and headache. Women withsevere cases may also become dizzy and evenfaint. The symptoms may last from a few hoursto one day but seldom last longer than two tothree days. Some women have more congestivesymptoms that are characterized by a dull achingin the low back and pelvis, bloating, and weightgain, along with some systemic symptoms Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

Primary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed when other causes of pelvic pain have been excluded.Certain characteristic clinical features distinguishthe diagnosis. The cause of primary dysmenorrhea may be one of several factors, including behavioral andpsychological factors; lack of blood flow, andtherefore oxygen, to the uterus (ischemia); andincreased production and release of uterine pro-staglandins. Increased prostaglandins, specicallyPgF2-alpha and PgE2, cause uterine contractionsthat lead to ischemia and pain. The levels of bothPgF2-alpha and PgE2 are low during the rsthalf of the menstrual cycle and the early part ofthe second half, then rise sharply and reach theirhighest levels shortly before and during the onsetof menses. Studies have found that women withdysmenorrhea produce 8 to 13 times more PgFthan do women without dysmenorrhea. 1This increase in prostaglandin production may berelated to the decline in progesterone levelstoward the end of the cycle just before the onsetof menses. Dysmenorrhea occurs only in cycles where ovulation has occurred. In cycles withoutovulation, there is no increase in progesteroneproduction in the second half of the cycle andthen decline right before the onset of menses, asin a normal cycle, and there is subsequently noincrease in the prostaglandin concentration inthe lining of the uterus. These mechanisms formthe basis for many of the therapies used, bothnatural and conventional. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS An alternative approach to menstrual cramps due to primary dysmenorrhea needs to provide effec-tive pain relief while at the same time correctingthe underlying dysfunction that is creating thepain. Because it is a functional problem and nota disease state that is causing the pain, we cantruly focus on a holistic approach by looking foraggravating factors in the diet, lifestyle, environ-ment, and emotional realm. Dietary principlesemphasizing good nutritional habits\u2014eliminat-ing junk foods, saturated fats, and trans fats;increasing omega-3 oils from sh, hemp oil, andflax oil; and increasing whole grains, fruits, andvegetables\u2014provide a range of nutrients neededto prevent and treat menstrual cramps. Stressreduction can help relieve tension in the lowerback and pelvic area that can worsen cramps.Improvements in posture improve the position-ing of the spine and promote proper circulationand nerve stimulation to the pelvic organs. Providing acute pain relief is one of the great- est challenges for natural medicine, whether it ispelvic pain, headaches, or musculoskeletal pain.Mild and moderate levels of pelvic pain are moretreatable with natural therapies than is severepain, although some women with severe pain will experience relief from the therapies thatfollow. Even when acute pain relief is not accom-plished with alternative therapies, a treatment planfor the interim days of the month is important in order to reduce the severity of the recurringClinical Features of Dysmenorrhea The initial onset is at or shortly after the rst menstrual period (menarche). If dysmenorrheastarts two years or more after menarche, thenother causes and secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered. Endometriosis is difcult to distinguish from primary dysmenorrheabecause they produce similar symptoms. One distinction is that endometriosis tends to get worse with time. Duration of the pain is usually 48 to 72 hours, starting a few hours before or just after the onset of the flow. Pain that starts several daysbefore the menses is less likely to be primarydysmenorrhea. The pain is cramping, or labor-like, although some women have more congestion and bloating. Findings on pelvic exam are normal.227MENSTRUAL CRAMPS menstrual cramp episodes over time. Having a natural therapeutic treatment plan for thechronic problem and using over-the-counter orprescription conventional medicines for acutepain relief can turn out to be the most effectiveplan. Over time, hopefully, the need for painmedications will decrease. Many alternative practitioners have experi- ence with natural therapies not included in thisbook such as acupuncture, homeopathy, andhands-on techniques that may offer effective helpfor many women with menstrual cramps. I oftenencourage women to try an herbal or nutritionalproduct for a couple of hours during acute pain.If no relief is accomplished within that amountof time, then switch to a pharmaceutical methodof pain control. As each successive month oftreating the chronic problem goes by, a measureof the success of that treatment will be a de-creased need to use the pain relief medication. It is important not to overlook the role of stres- sors in our personal lives that can be at least partof the cause of our pain and can also affect ourability to deal with pain. A recent study of over380 otherwise healthy women demonstrated thatwomen who experienced high stress were twice aslikely to experience dysmenorrhea in the followingcycle, especially among those women with a prior history of painful menses. 5Psychotherapy can help a woman gain insight into these influencesand learn how to reduce and manage stressors.Research has shown that behavior therapy hasbeen highly effective in reducing the symptoms ofspasmodic dysmenorrhea. 6 Biofeedback treatment with a relaxation prac- tice has also proven to be signicant in reducingdysmenorrhea. 7After two months of biofeedback treatments, sufferers of menstrual cramps haddramatic declines in the severity and duration ofKEY CONCEPTS Primary dysmenorrhea should be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea. Typical menstrual cramps are due to primary dysmenorrhea. Causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include endo- metriosis, adhesions,ovarian thyroid conditions,congenital malformations, narrowing of the cervi- cal opening, polyps, and uterine broids. Seek adequate pain relief in addition to trying to correct the underlying mechanism that is causing the problem. About half of all women experience menstrual cramps.PREVENTION Good posture and spinal alignment may decrease the tendency toward menstrual cramps. Stress reduction may help to relax the pelvic and low back muscles. Some women may nd that their menstrual cramping is worsened when they use tampons;these women should switch to sanitary napkins. A copper IUD (Paraguard) for contraception may menstrual cramping. A (Mirena) and hormonalcontraception can improve chronic dysmenor- rhea. Barrier methods of contraception have no bearing on dysmenorrhea. Maintain a healthy weight. Avoid smoking. Food allergies may contribute to water reten- tion, gas, and bloating, which may contribute to congestive menstrual pain. An increase in exercise may improve blood flow to the uterus and create an optimal pelvic mus-culature that will tend to reduce the incidence of menstrual discomfort. Maintain optimal digestive function. Irregular bowel habits may be correlated to primary dysmenorrhea. Reduce foods that may contribute to an excess of the prostaglandins that cause uterine con- tractions: dairy products, beef, pork, lamb, poul- try, eggs, deep-fried foods, and trans fats foundin potato chips, french fries, and partiallyhydrogenated packaged foods.228WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE their symptoms as well as a decline in the amount of medication they were taking. Medita-tion, visualization, and relaxation techniques areused by many women both as a primary form ofpain management and also in combination withother therapies. My advice would be to seek theadvice of a trained person to help you learnwhich method may be most appropriate andeffective for you. Nutrition A healthy diet is fundamental to an effective menstrual cramps treatment program. In fact,something as simple as eating breakfast regularlywas found to be inversely related to the incidenceand severity of dysmenorrhea. 8Many women experience relief from cramps just by switchingto good nutritional habits. There are two basicaspects to making changes in the diet. One is todecrease the intake of foods that may be con-tributing to the condition, and the other is toincrease the intake of foods that provide a widerange of important nutrients necessary to bringabout a functional change in the pelvic area. Onestudy supports this theory by demonstrating thatdietary intake of sh, eggs, and fruit was associ-ated with less dysmenorrhea while wine intakewas associated with more dysmenorrhea. 9In addition, another study advocates a vegetariandiet as a way to increase sex-hormone-bindingglobulin and decrease body weight and the sever-ity and duration of menstrual cramps. 10 The most important foods to avoid are those that are high in arachidonic acid. This is thepolyunsaturated fatty acid that the body uses toproduce the series-2 prostaglandins (PgE2)\u2014theones that cause muscle and uterine contractions.Egg yolks, red meat, and poultry are the mainsources of arachidonic acid. In addition, many people are allergic to dairy products or lack the enzymes to digest them.Digestive problems such as bloating and gas canintensify with menstrual cramps, adding to theoverall discomfort. Reducing or even eliminatingthe intake of milk, cheese, cottage cheese, butter, ice cream, and yogurt may be enough to have asignicant impact for as many as one-third ofwomen with menstrual cramps. Saturated fats from nondairy sources can also intensify menstrual cramps by stimulating thePgE2 series. Most of our saturated fats comefrom animal products, although a few are fromvegetable sources such as palm oil or coconut oil.Animal foods to reduce or avoid that contain sat-urated fat include beef, pork, lamb, and evenchicken and turkey. Even though chicken andturkey are lower in saturated fat, they are actuallyhigher in arachidonic acid than red meats. Salt can be another aggravating factor for women with menstrual cramps. Too much dietarysalt can increase fluid retention and worsen bloat-ing that contributes to the congestive symptoms ofmenstrual cramps. Canned and frozen foods, fastfoods, and processed/packaged foods are all sus-pect for high amounts of salt. Read the labels care-fully. You may be surprised to nd that some ofthe things you thought were healthy, such as cer-tain salad dressings, are actually loaded with salt.Even a bean burrito at a fast-food restaurant willbe high in salt. Look for \"no salt\" labels on yourpackaged foods, and go light on the saltshaker inthe kitchen and at the table. Although sugar in the diet may not be directly related to menstrual cramps, sugar does interferewith the absorption and metabolism of some Bvitamins and minerals. Deciencies or less thanoptimal amounts of some of these nutrients mayworsen muscle tension and increase the contractilenature of the uterus. High-sugar foods are oftenthe same foods that are high in saturated fats. Women with monthly menstrual cramps run the risk of overusing alcohol because of its seda-tive and pain-relieving effects. This overuse maylead to other problems, including alcoholism andsubstance abuse. Nonaddictive pain relief med-ications would be far preferable. Alcohol alsodepletes the nutrient status of many B vitaminsand minerals such as magnesium. These decien-229MENSTRUAL CRAMPS cies and nutritional imbalances can lead to dif- culty in regulating muscle function and worsenmuscle spasms during menstruation. Alcohol mayalso interfere with the liver's ability to metabolizehormones effectively and efciently. This may leadto heavier flows. A heavier amount of blood createsmore clots, and the passage of clots will trigger anincrease in the uterine muscle spasms. The best medicinal foods for menstrual cramps are those foods that increase the antispas-modic prostaglandins, the PgE1 and PgE3 series.Certain omega-3 oils, specically eicos-apentaenoic acid (EPA), a fatty acid that helps torelax muscles by the production of PgE3. 11Many seeds and nuts are sources of linoleic acid andlinolenic acid, also precursors to these muscle-relaxing prostaglandins. The best sources of bothof these fatty acids are flaxseed, hemp seeds, andpumpkin seeds. Sesame seeds and sunflower seedsare excellent sources of linoleic acid. The oils fromthe seeds of flax, hemp, pumpkin, sesame, andsunflower are the best oils to use in salad dressings.Flax, hemp, and pumpkin oils should not beheated, but sesame and sunflower are acceptablecooking oils. In many cases the seeds, nuts, andfruits from which these oils are extracted arehealthy choices as well. To round out the healthy changes in the diet, emphasize whole grains, legumes, vegetables, andfruits. Whole grains such as brown rice, oats,millet, barley, rye, amaranth, and buckwheat pro-vide sources of magnesium, calcium, potassium,ber, vitamin E, B-complex vitamins, and protein.Specically, intake of dietary ber has been shownto be inversely proportional to menstrual pain. 12 Both calcium and magnesium reduce musculartension, ber helps to regulate the bowel function,and potassium has a diuretic effect that can aid inreducing bloating. Beans are also good sources ofcalcium, magnesium, potassium, and protein.Many vegetables are high in the calcium, magne-sium, and potassium that help to relieve and pre-vent muscle spasms. Fruits are an excellent form ofnatural anti-inflammatory substances like bio- flavonoids and vitamin C. These nutrients notonly strengthen the blood vessels that can aid cir-culation to areas of muscle tension in the pelvisbut also reduce the pain from menstrual crampsthrough their anti-inflammatory effect. Nutritional Supplements Vitamin B 1(Thiamine). A large, well- designed study found that 100 mg of thiaminedaily helped to alleviate dysmenorrhea com- pletely in 87 percent of study subjects, while only5 percent had no relief. 13 Vitamin B 1 100 mg daily Vitamin B 3(Niacin). Niacin or vitamin B 3 has been shown in clinical research to be effective in 87.5 percent of women with menstrualcramps. 14Niacin was given in 100 mg doses twice daily throughout the month, and thenevery two to three hours during the periods ofmenstrual cramps. Although a sometimesuncomfortable niacin flush could easily occur atthe escalated dosing, none of the women in thestudy stopped the medication due to the flush-ing. Interestingly, the women who received norelief of their menstrual cramps were frequentlythe women who reported no flushing. Thevasodilating effect of niacin (which causes flush-ing) may indeed be the main treatment effect.Vasospasm of the uterine arteries may be respon-sible for the menstrual pain. Vitamin B 3(Niacin) 100 mg twice daily throughout the month 100 mg every 2-3 hours during episodes of menstrual cramps Vitamin C and Rutin. In a follow-up study, the author of the niacin study also found thatrutin with ascorbic acid increased the effective-ness of niacin in the treatment of menstrual230WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE cramps.15In twice as many women as the niacin- only study, the same dose of niacin (100 mgtwice daily regularly and every two or three hoursduring menstrual cramps) was given while alsoadding 300 mg of vitamin C and 60 mg of rutindaily. These additions slightly improved theresponse in up to 90 percent of the women. Thisincreased effectiveness was thought to be due toimproving the permeability of the capillaries,thus potentiating the vasodilating effect of theniacin. In most cases, niacin was not effectiveunless it had been taken 7 to 10 days before theonset of the menstrual flow. Vitamin C 300-3,000 mg per day Rutin 60-1,000 mg per day Vitamin E. Vitamin E was studied back in the 1950s for the treatment of spasmodic dysmenor-rhea. It was used in doses of 150 IU ten days pre-menstrual and during the rst four days of themenstrual period. In approximately 70 percent ofthe women tested, it helped to relieve menstrualdiscomfort within two menstrual cycles. 16A more recent, large, well-designed study evaluated vita-min E at a dose of 200 IU two times per daybeginning two days before the start of menses andcontinuing through the third day of the cycle andfound a signicant decrease in dysmenorrhea andoverall blood loss after two months. 17I generally recommend higher amounts of vitamin E becausethere are so many other benets for women,including relieving cyclic breast pain, raising ben-ecial HDL cholesterol, and providing antioxi-dant protection . Vitamin E 150-800 IU per day Calcium. Calcium supplementation for menstrual cramps has been used by women as aself-care treatment for many years. Muscles need calcium to maintain their normal muscle tone; if they are decient in calcium, they can moreeasily cramp. This is true of the uterine muscle aswell. Low calcium intake is associated with men-strual water retention and greater pain during themenses. 18The typical American diet supplies about 450 to 550 mg of calcium per day, fallingshort of the recommended daily allowance of1,000 mg per day in menstruating women. Calcium Supplement the diet so that total calcium is 1,000 mg per day Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Essential fatty acids are the raw materials from which prostaglandins,benecial hormone-like substances, are made.There are two linolenic acids cannot bemade by the body and must be supplied daily inthe diet from either food or supplements. Thetypical American diet is often much higher inomega-6 oils than it is in omega-3 oils. As a result,many of us end up with the PgE2 prostaglandinsthat cause muscle contractions and pain. Another problem is that our bodies need a certain amount of linoleic acid to convert togamma linolenic acid (GLA), which leads (the anti-spasmodic and anti-inflammatory the benecial prostaglandins requires thepresence of magnesium, vitamin B 6, zinc, vita- min C, and niacin. Women who are decient inthese nutrients won't be able to make oil(high in omega-3 fatty oil, and evening primrose oil(all high in linoleic acid and GLA) is one way offavorably altering the synthesis of the benecialprostaglandins; the end result likely will be feweruterine contractions and less menstrual pain.231MENSTRUAL CRAMPS As mentioned earlier, after the rise of proges- terone in the second half of the menstrual cyclefollowed by its decline right before menstruation,omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid,are released. Subsequently, an increase in PgF2-alpha and PgE2 occurs, causing uterine contrac-tions leading to ischemia and pain. Instead ofinhibiting ovulation and therefore the proges-terone effect, or inhibiting the synthesis of pro-staglandins with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatoryagents, the omega-3 fatty com-pete with omega-6 fatty acids and result in theproduction of the friendlier antispasmodic andanti-inflammatory prostaglandins, series 1 and 3. Based on these observations and mechanisms, using sh oil containing omega-3 fatty acids as asupplement seems benecial. Dietary supple-mentation with sh oils was tested in 42 adoles-cent girls with dysmenorrhea. 11The rst group of 21 girls received sh oil (1,080 mg EPA and 720 mg DHA) and 1.5 mg vitamin E dailyfor two months, followed by a placebo for anadditional two months. In the second group, 21girls received a placebo for the rst two months,followed by sh oil for two more months. At the conclusion of the study, on a 7-point scale, a score of 4 being moderately effective anda 7 meaning totally effective, 73 percent of thegirls rated the supplementation greater than orequal to 4. Another, more recent study looked atsupplementation with krill oil in decreasingmenstrual symptoms, including cramps com-pared to standard sh oil, and found the krill oil to be superior in decreasing the severity ofdysmenorrhea as evidenced by a decreased use ofanalgesics. 19 Fish Oils 1,080 mg EPA and 720 mg DHA per day Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) 500-1,000 mg up to 3 times per dayMelatonin. I have no personal experience prescribing melatonin for menstrual cramps, butI think it has potential based on some of itsknown biochemical effects. It has been proposedthat insufcient melatonin secretion during thesecond half of the menstrual cycle (the lutealphase) is a factor in primary dysmenorrhea. 20 This hypothesis is based on several factors: (1)melatonin levels are low at ovulation and increasepremenstrually three- to sixfold and reach theirpeak synthesis and release.25 Since melatonin has been shown to have all these effects, supplementation in order to achievehigh concentrations during menstruation mayserve to oppose the effects of prostaglandins andtherefore prevent the occurrence of dysmenorrhea. Melatonin 2.5 mg per day, taken 3-4 days prior to onset of menses Botanicals Rose. A recent study suggests that rose tea consumption helped to decrease both pain andpsychological distress of women during menses. 26 In addition, another study showed that abdominalmassage of rose, lavender, or clary sage essential oil in a base of almond oil was more effective than almond oil alone in decreasing the severity ofdysmenorrhea. 27 Valerian ( Valeriana Ofcinalis ).Valerian traditionally has been used primarily as a sedativeand antispasmodic for the treatment of anxietydisorders, sleep disorders, and a diverse array ofconditions associated with pain. Valerian con-tains an important class of compounds calledvalepotriates and valeric acid, which are foundexclusively in this perennial plant native to NorthAmerica and Europe. It is not difcult to see how232WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE valerian would help to relieve pain, anxiety, and insomnia because both valepotriates and valericacid are capable of binding to the same receptorsin the brain as the pharmaceutical drug Valium. 28 Although valerian has not been scientically studied for menstrual cramps, it has been shown to relax the spasmodic contractions of intestinalmuscles. 29Both the uterus and intestines contain smooth muscles. In clinical practice, valerian isusually a signicant feature of an alternative medi-cine approach to painful menstruation. It is most practical to take valerian in tincture form or cap-sules. Many people prefer valerian capsules becausethe tincture has a very bitter taste. Attempts to dis-guise the taste can be made by placing the tincturein a small amount of fruit juice and then followingthat with several swallows of plain juice. Valerianmay make you tired and sleepy, so it is advisable tostay home and rest or take a nap. Valerian 1 tsp tincture or 1-2 capsules every 3-4 hours as needed for pain ) and Black of these species of viburnum are mentioned repeatedly inthe traditional botanical reference books as uter-ine relaxants and general antispasmodics. 30They have been used mainly for menstrual cramps,bearing-down uterine pains, and chronic uterineand ovarian pains. Animal studies have con-rmed that both species have an antispasmodiceffect on the uterus. 31Laboratory studies on human uterine tissue also have conrmed thatViburnum prunifolium exhibits a relaxant effect on the uterine tissue. 32 When the menstrual pains are of either a congestive or spasmodic nature and include lowback pains, especially if the pains radiate downthe thighs, there is no better herbal choice thancrampbark. The root bark of black haw is reported to contain several active constituents that are uter-ine relaxants, one of which is scopoletin, which has been historically used as a specic medicinefor menstrual cramps with severe low back andbearing-down pelvic pains. For menstrual painsassociated with a profuse menstrual flow andintermittent severe pains, black haw would prob-ably be a more specic choice than crampbark.American Indians used the root and/or stem forthe treatment of painful menses, to prevent mis-carriage, and as a postpartum antispasmodic. Crampbark 12tsp tincture or 1 capsule every 2-3 hours Black Haw 14tsp tincture or 1 capsule every 2-4 hours Caution: Both viburnum species should be avoided during pregnancy except in the hands of an experi-enced herbal practitioner. Ginger ( Zingiber Ofcinale ).Ginger is typ- ically known for its stimulatory effects on diges-tion and easing the nausea of an upset stomach.The pungent constituents in ginger, shagaol andgingerol, also have an inhibitory effect on inflam-matory and prostaglandins. Althoughginger has not been studied specically in rela-tion to menstrual cramps, it does have antispas-modic effects on the smooth muscle of theintestines. Given that the uterus is also made up ofsmooth muscle, and ginger has a long history oftraditional use for treating spasmodic dysmenor-rhea, I use it in clinical practice with great con-dence in combination with other herbs. Ginger 1-2 g of dried ginger powder 1-2 times daily Black Cohosh ( Cimicifuga Racemosa ). Black cohosh has gained increased attention inthe last few years largely as an herb for the reliefof menopause symptoms. However, when I wasrst studying botanical medicine, this herb wasknown more for its relaxant effect on the uterus233MENSTRUAL CRAMPS in dysmenorrhea, false labor pains, and threat- ened miscarriage. It can be helpful in both con-gestive and spasmodic menstrual cramps of evena severe nature. If the menses is also associatedwith PMS irritability and anxiety, delayed orirregular menstrual cycles, or scanty flow, thenblack cohosh would be an even more indicatedherbal choice for menstrual cramps. Black Cohosh 14-12tsp tincture or 1-2 capsules every 2-4 hours Other Traditional Herbs to Consider. Herbs such as false unicorn an independent antispasmodic or sedative effect on the uterus in their own right.They are often used in combination with eachother or in formulations with some of the moredominant choices such as crampbark, black haw,valerian, and black cohosh. Additional herbs may also be considered for their different actions. For example, herbs thathave an anti-inflammatory effect, such as whitewillow and ginger; diuretic herbs that decreasethe pelvic congestion, such as parsley, dandelionleaf, or horsetail; and herbs that promote circula-tion, such as ginkgo, may also have a role in reduc-ing the pain experienced from dysmenorrhea. Natural Progesterone. As stated earlier, it is believed that the drop in progesterone premen-strually results in an increased production ofarachidonic acid by the endometrium. This stim-ulates PgE2 release and uterine contractions. Ifwe can temper or delay this drop in progesteronepremenstrually, then, in effect, natural proges-terone can be used to inhibit the uterine contrac-tions, ischemia, and pain during menstruation. Remember, though, that some decline in progesterone is necessary in order to trigger theonset of blood flow. Natural progesterone may allow a slower decline or a delayed decline. Thus,some women do indeed nd that a natural prog-esterone cream, applied topically for 3 to 12 daysprior to onset of menses, will reduce menstrualcramps. Natural Progesterone Cream Apply14tsp of cream ( >400 mg/oz) 2 times per day for 3-12 days before the expected onset of menses. Exercise The effects of both special exercises33-35and gen- eral regular physical exercise on primary dysmen-orrhea have been studied. No discrepancies existin the results from the rst group of studies\u2014special exercises are reported consistently toreduce or eliminate menstrual pain. For example,one researcher found symptom reduction in 89.3percent of 129 dysmenorrheic women whoadhered to his program of special exercises. Sim-ilarly, another researcher, investigating 141 dys-menorrheic girls 14 to 18 years of age from twodifferent high schools, found that 92 percent ofparticipants in one of the schools were \"cured\" orimproved after being given a set of specic exer-cises to reduce menstrual pain. 36(A girl was con- sidered cured \"if she was free of pain for at leastthree menstrual periods\" following the perform-ance of the prescribed exercises.) The experimentwas conducted from mid-September 1956 tomid-June 1957. The results for the second schoolwere 76 percent \"cured.\" The three studies on the effects of general reg- ular physical exercise on dysmenorrhea offer conflicting results. One group of investigators 37 conducted a 12-week experiment that comparedtwo groups of dysmenorrheic women who volun-teered to either walk/jog or to act as sedentary controls. The experimental group reported signi-cantly less severe menstrual symptoms than thecontrols. In contrast, another group of investiga-tors reported a 30 percent increase in menstrual234WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Sample Treatment Plan for Dysmenorrhea Dietary Recommendations Increase salmon, tuna, halibut, sardines, her- ring, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Decrease dairy, salt, sugar, red meat, poultry, and eggs. For Acute Pain Management Calcium carbonate: 1,000-1,500 mg during pain Valerian: 1 tsp tincture or 1-2 capsules every 3-4 hours Crampbark and/or black haw: 2 capsules every 3-4 hours Relaxation techniques Consider combination products containing niacin, borage, vitamin E, calcium, crampbark,valerian, and black cohosh: 3 capsules every 3 hours during acute pain (see theResources section for formulation sources) Use Throughout the Month Niacin: 100 mg twice daily Fish oils: 1,080 mg EPA and 720 mg DHA daily Vitamin E: 200-400 IU daily Crampbark and/or black haw and/or black cohosh: 1-2 capsules daily Consider combination products containing niacin, borage, vitamin E, calcium, cramp- bark, valerian, and black cohosh: 2 capsulesfor daily pain (see the Resources section for formulation sources) symptoms in regularly exercising over sedentary student nurses.38However, a more recent, con- trolled study again validated the hypothesis thatregular exercise decreases menstrual symptoms innding that \"high exercisers experienced the great-est positive effect and sedentary women the least.\" 39 CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH T wo groups of drugs are highly effective against dysmenorrhea: oral contraceptives and prostag-landin synthetase inhibitors, also known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Thechoice of medication depends on whether awoman needs oral contraceptives for birth control,whether she has any allergies to aspirin or con-traindications to oral contraceptives such as priordeep venous thrombosis, whether she has a historyof gastric ulcers, and her age. Women desiring birth control should proba- bly use oral contraceptives as the rst agent ofchoice. Combination oral contraceptives reduceprostaglandin levels and menstrual flow, andapproximately 80 percent of patients achievenear-complete relief of dysmenorrhea. A newerregimen of oral contraceptive use may be even more effective. Reducing the pill-free interval toapproximately four days reduces the volume ofmenstrual bleeding beyond the usual reductionseen in the seven-day pill-free interval and sup-presses ovulation more effectively, further reduc-ing the production of prostaglandins. Paincontrol with oral contraceptives is probably theresult of reduced volume of menstrual fluid andsuppression of ovulation, which reduces uterineprostaglandin levels. You may need to try several oral contracep- tives before you nd one you are comfortablewith. The majority of oral contraceptive sideeffects come from the progestin. Use the medica-tions for several months before you decidewhether they are effective, rather than giving upafter the rst cycle, and be willing to try differentbrands if necessary. Oral contraceptives, if suc-cessful, can be used throughout a woman's entirereproductive cycle and into her early 50s. If dys-menorrhea is reduced but not signicantly elim-inated, an NSAID can also be added. For women who do not need contraception or do not tolerate or choose to take oral contra-235MENSTRUAL CRAMPS ceptives, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors can be used. These nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs reduce menstrual fluid prostaglandins andtheir metabolites, resulting in decreased uterinecontractility and menstrual pain. They alsosomewhat decrease the amount of menstrualflow. They are most effective if given beforecramping begins and are usually only taken fortwo to three days per cycle. There are several groups of prostaglandin syn- thetase inhibitors, including medications such asaspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, The aryl-propionic acid derivatives such asibuprofen and naproxen are easily available overthe counter and have been highly successful.Patients achieve a signicant reduction in dys-menorrhea 60 to 90 percent of the time. Aspirinhas not been shown to be any more effective than a placebo and is not generally used by women formenstrual cramps. However, aspirin in associa-tion with other proprietary agents in a combina-tion medication such as Midol is reported bypatients to be effective. Another category of NSAIDs includes meclofe- namate (Meclomen) and mefenamic acid (Ponstel).They have been available for more than 20 yearsand have been highly effective. They are used whencramps begin. COX-II inhibitors such as Celebrexhave been very effective in the treatment of dys-menorrhea. However, some head-to-head trialswith the other NSAIDs have not shown them to bemore effective, and they are signicantly moreexpensive and possibly have an increase in sideeffects. Side effects of all prostaglandin synthetaseExercise Recommendations for Menstrual Cramps If not exercising regularly, incorporate exercise into your daily routine. (See Appendix A.) Try the following special exercises for moderate to severe dysmenorrhea (adopted from Haman33and Golub36). For mild menstrual pain, do only one or two of the exercises. Do these exercises twice a day for 10 consecutive days before menses. Exercise 1 Stand at a right angle to the wall with left elbow on the wall on a level with the left shoulder. Tilt pelvis forward. Keeping knees slightly flexed, to avoid hyper- extending them, move left hip until it touches wall. Return to original position. Repeat 5 times. Repeat sequence with right elbow on the wall. Exercise 2 Stand facing the wall with both elbows on wall on a level with shoulders. Without moving elbows or feet and keeping knees slightly flexed, to avoid hyperextendingthem, move pelvis away from wall and then toward it until pelvis touches the wall. Return to original position. Repeat 5 times. Exercise 3 Stand with feet 12 inches apart and arms raised to the side at shoulder level. Keeping knees slightly flexed, to avoid hyperextending them, twist trunk to the right and bend forward, attempting to touch the right ankle with the left hand. Return to original position. Repeat sequence in the opposite direction. Repeat 5 times. Exercise 4 Stand with feet a few inches apart and arms at the sides. Swing arms forward and upward, simultane- ously raising the right leg backward. Return to the original position. Repeat with the left leg. Repeat 5 times.236WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE inhibitors can include headaches, stomach or intes- tinal upset (specically gastritis or ulcers), and atendency to feel fatigued. Serious complicationsinvolve kidney damage and gastrointestinal bleed-ing. Recommended doses for acute menstrual painare as follows: Ibuprofen: 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours Naproxen (Naprosyn): 500 mg every 12 hoursNaproxen sodium (Aleve): two 220-mg tablets every 6 hours Naproxen sodium (Anaprox DS): 550 mg every 6 to 8 hours Mefenamic acid (Ponstel): two 250-mg tablets at the onset of pain, followed by one tabletevery 8 hours Meclofenamate (Meclomen): 100 mg every 8 hours Celebrex: 200 to 400 mg once daily For those who do not respond to oral contra- ceptives or other medications, it is best to considerlaparoscopy to rule out endometriosis or anotherpelvic disease. Usually, when the oral contracep-tives or the NSAIDs work, the practitioner willconsider that the patient has primary dysmenor-rhea, which is not associated with another pelvicdisease. If the patient has a negative laparoscopyand oral contraceptives or NSAIDs do not helpthe dysmenorrhea, she may be carefully watchedand administered intermittent narcotic medica-tions under the ongoing supervision of a physi-cian. Narcotic medications should be avoidedwhen possible because of the potential for toler-ance and abuse. They should be used only whenother options and diseases have been excluded.The levonorgestrel intrauterine system in the Mirena IUD substantially reduces menstrual flowapproximately 80 percent as a bonus to the excel-lent contraception it provides. It has also beenfound to signicantly reduce menstrual cramps andmight be a good option for women seeking bothcontraception and treatment of menstrual cramps. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) We need to remember that primary dysmenorrhea is pain during menses that exists without any iden-tiable pelvic disease. You must be certain thatyour menstrual pain is indeed primary dysmenor-rhea and not pain due to pelvic disease such asendometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine broids,pelvic infection, or an ovarian tumor. These condi-tions need to be diagnosed by a licensed health-carepractitioner capable of ordering the tests necessaryto exclude these pelvic diseases if you are notresponding to simple treatments. If your pain is being well managed by con- ventional treatments, but you are experiencingsome unwanted side effects, an alternative practi-tioner can work collaboratively to reduce theseside effects. Alternative practitioners may also beconsulted for their expertise in using effectivealternative therapies and higher doses of naturalanti-inflammatories, herbs that may not be easilyaccessible for self-treatment, or for a comprehen-sive treatment plant looking at the relationship ofthe menstrual cramps to the whole system andwhole person.237OVERVIEW As the U.S. population ages, certain diseases and medical conditions more common among agingAmericans are gaining greater public attention.Osteoporosis, a serious and disabling disease andthe most prevalent metabolic bone disease inWestern societies, is one such condition. Fortu-nately, osteoporosis can and should be preventedand, when present, treated. Osteoporosis affects75 million people in Europe, the United States,and Japan. In the United States alone, it affects25 million people and causes 1.5 million frac-tures annually. 1 In the United States the rates of osteoporosis and fractures vary with ethnicity, with African-Americans having the highest bone mineral density (BMD) and Asian-Americans having thelowest. After adjusting for body weight, one largestudy of postmenopausal women revealed thatwhite American women and Hispanic Americanwomen had the highest risk of osteoporotic frac-ture. This was followed by Native Americans,African-Americans, and Asian-Americans. 2So while Asian-Americans have the lowest BMD,they also have a lower fracture rate, which wethink may be related to body size. Most cases of osteoporosis occur in post- menopausal women, and the rates increase withdeclining BMD and with age. Of white Ameri-can women, 13 to 18 percent who are 50 years orolder have osteoporosis of the hip. 3An additional 37 to 50 percent have low bone mass (osteope-nia) of the hip, again increasing with age andworse in women age 80 and older. Osteoporosis is dened as a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and a deteriora-tion in bone microarchitecture leading to bonefragility and susceptibility to fracture 4and isresponsible for about 90 percent of all hip andspine fractures in white American women aged65 to 84. 5The World Health Organization (WHO) has dened osteoporosis as a bone min-eral density that is 2.5 standard deviations (SD)below the mean peak value in young adults. 6 This is called the T-score. A T-score that isbetween 1 and 2.5 SD below the mean is calledosteopenia. These denitions are useful because they pro- vide objective criteria, but they have limitationsbecause they ignore the importance of otherdeterminants of bone strength. The denitionsalso ignore other risk factors for fractures in elderly women such as a maternal history of hip fracture, age, and poor balance. For example,most postmenopausal women with fractures donot have a bone density score that meets theWHO osteoporosis criteria. 7The World Health Organization, the National Osteoporosis Foun-dation, and other expert panels are in the processof releasing new guidelines to estimate a woman'srisk of an osteoporotic fracture, using a bonedensity test along with these other risks. Thesenew guidelines will provide better direction fortreatment interventions. Although low bone mass, as measured by bone density, is important in determining a person's riskof fracture, other risk factors are equally important.These include maternal history of a hip fracture,previous vertebral fracture, previous hip fracture,high fall risk, and others. 8Assessing a person's like- lihood of a fall (use of sedative medications, inabil-ity to stand unaided from a sitting position, poorvision, muscle weakness) is very important as well.Low bone mass may be due to osteoporosis and/orpoor bone quality. Vitamin D deciency and othercauses of hyperparathyroidism can lead to poor14OSTEOPOROSIS CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

Clinically, the term osteoporo- sisis used in reference to loss of bone associated with relatively atraumatic fractures of the ribs,spine, wrist, and hips. Fractures associated with osteoporosis are dis- tinguished by three characteristics: 9 Greatly increased incidence with aging, with fractures occurring 2 to 100 times moreamong adults over age 75 than amongyounger people Greater incidence among women than men Associated with modest trauma The three most common fracture sites are the spine, hip, and forearm. For a 50-year-old Amer-ican woman, the risk of having an osteoporoticfracture in her remaining years is estimated to be 40 percent, 10and two-thirds of the fractures occur after age 75. Osteoporosis-related fractureswill develop in half of all women and one-fth ofall men older than 65 years. 11Hip fractures, with a median age of 82, are particularly life altering.Within the rst year following a hip fracture, themortality rate is increased by up to 20 percent, asmany as 25 percent of the survivors will be con-ned to long-term care facilities one year afterthe fracture, and 50 percent will have at leastsome long-term loss of mobility. 12 Vertebral fractures (fractures of spinal verte- brae) occur a little younger, on average in awoman's mid-70s. Multiple vertebral fractures,or one severe one, can cause severe pain, loss ofheight, and an exaggerated curvature of the mid-spine called thoracic kyphosis. These pains anddeformities can restrict bending and reachingand can greatly increase the risk of additional ver-tebral fractures. 13, 14 Fractures of the thoracic spine can also restrict lung function, cause diges-tive problems, 15lower self-esteem and body image, and result in depression.16 Vertebral fractures are twice as common as either hip fractures or distal radius (wrist) frac-tures. The incidence of wrist fractures starts to riseimmediately after menopause, with an incidenceof about 15 percent by age 80, but a peak inci- dence about 20 to 25 years sooner. Each year,172,000 wrist fractures occur that are the result ofmoderate trauma and rapid postmenopausal boneloss. The female to male ratio is 5:1. Wrist frac-tures are rarely fatal and cause much less disabil-ity than do hip and spinal fractures. 17, 18 How Osteoporosis Affects the Bone There are two types of bone: trabecular and cor- tical. The skeleton is living tissue composed ofabout 75 percent cortical bone and 25 percenttrabecular bone. The trabecular bone is the insidepart of the bone where the bone marrow is. It iscomprised of a network of structural tissue thatprevents it from compressing with pressure (forexample, from a fall). The cortical bone is thehard exterior of the bone that protects the bonefrom external trauma. Vertebrae are made up of90 percent trabecular bone and only 10 percentcortical bone; the hip is 50:50, and the extremi-ties are 90 percent cortical bone. T rabecular boneis concentrated in the vertebrae, pelvis, other flatbones, and at the ends of long bones like theupper and lower leg. T rabecular bone is metabolically much more active and has a higher turnover rate than corti-cal bone. To provide support for the body, boneis continuously rebuilt to maintain an optimalstructure. Any damage or fatigue effect is con-stantly repaired through a process of bone break-down (resorption) and rebuilding (formation)called bone remodeling. Bone formation andresorption are interdependent processes; if one isaltered, it directly affects the other. The cells thatcause bone resorption are called osteoclasts andstimulate the production of acid and enzymesthat dissolve bone mineral and proteins. Bonebuilding cells, or osteoblasts, promote bone for-mation by creating a protein matrix, which con-sists primarily of collagen. This becomes calciedand results in mineralized bone. Normal bone remodeling is a process that is balanced by bone resorption and bone forma tion.239OSTEOPOROSIS In childhood, bone formation far exceeds bone remodeling, leading to longer, denser bones.During the adult years, bone resorption andbone formation are in balance, and total bonemass remains relatively stable. As we age, theosteoblasts and osteoclasts may no longer func-tion in a balanced fashion. When there is animbalance between bone resorption and bone for-mation, bone loss occurs, bone mass decreases,and fracture risk increases. Bone loss can be osteoclast-mediated, as seen in osteoporosis, or osteoblast-mediated, as seenin bone cancers. In osteoporosis, osteoclast-mediated bone loss outpaces the ability ofosteoblasts to ll in the empty spaces. Certainproblems cause different types of bone loss. T rabecular bone loss occurs with low estrogenlevels, steroid use, and immobilization. So, whenwomen choose not to take estrogen after meno-pause, they are more likely to lose trabecularbone and therefore may be at higher risk for ver-tebral and hip fractures. Cortical bone loss occurswith calcium and vitamin D abnormalities suchas vitamin D deciency and leads to an increasedrisk of extremity fractures. An extreme form ofthis is rickets, which presents with bowing of thefemurs that results from small microfractures ofthose bones. Because of the differences in corticaland trabecular bone, many practitioners prefer tomeasure both the hip and the spine when doingbone density testing. The Role of Menopause in Osteoporosis As we age, bone resorption increases. This in- crease is worsened by a decrease in bone forma-tion in women after menopause. Within the rstfew years of menopause, there is rapid bone lossdue to lower levels of ovarian estrogen produc-tion. With less estrogen in the body, bone resorp-tion is no longer inhibited. This decline inestrogen is the most signicant factor in the in-creased bone loss associated with menopause. 19 In the spine, bone loss of 2 percent per year begins about two to three years before the lastmenstrual period, and this accelerated rate of loss ends three to four years after menopause. Atthe hip, bone loss has an age-related rate ofdecline of about 0.5 percent per year. Over theseve to seven years, it totals approximately 10.5percent loss for the spine and 5.3 percent for thehip. 20A slow and small amount of bone loss occurs from then on. Women older than 70 faceother challenges that may accelerate their boneloss again such as increasing age and secondaryhyperparathyroidism due to a drop in calciumabsorption. In women who have premature menopause (at or before age 40), whether spontaneous or bymedical causes such as having both ovariesremoved, chemotherapy, or pelvic radiation,there is a greater risk of low BMD compared toother women their age who are not meno-pausal. 21By the age of 70, when risk of fracture is greater in general, this issue of early prematuremenopause becomes moot because no matterhow menopause was attained, women will havethe same risk of low BMD or fractures. The Role of Heredity, Nutrition, and Lifestyle in Osteoporosis Genetic predisposition contributes signicantly to bone mass and to the development of osteo-porosis later in life. Heredity has the greatestinfluence on a woman's peak bone mass, andstudies have suggested that 80 percent of thedeterminant of peak bone density is due togenetic factors. 22, 23 Female children of women who experienced an osteoporotic fracture werefound to have 3 to 7 percent lower bone massthan would be expected for their age. 24, 25 Addi- tional studies have shown that relatives of womenwith osteoporosis tend to have lower bonemass. 26The racial differences observed in bone mass also suggest the role of a genetic factor. Dietary factors and nutrient deciencies alter bone growth and remodeling and may result inlower bone mass. Girls or women with a dietaryabnormality such as anorexia nervosa have signi-240WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE cantly lower bone mass than their healthy counter- parts.27A balanced diet of plenty of vegetables, especially dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds,whole grains, low-fat dairy, sh, and small amountsof animal meats play an important role in thedevelopment and maintenance of healthy bone.Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is neededto achieve the genetically determined peak bonemass, to maintain bone mass once this peak hasbeen achieved, and to maintain the strength andintegrity of the skeleton throughout our lives. 28 The intake of calcium is most important during the bone-building years of childhoodthrough adolescence and in old age. Duringpuberty, calcium is required for bone growth andfor the achievement of maximal calcication.Postmenopausal women and men over 65 requirea greater intake of calcium because absorption ofcalcium is less efcient, but the dietary intake ofcalcium is usually lower because of intolerance todairy products or elimination of dairy productsas part of a low-fat diet. Lifestyle factors, such as the level of physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,and additional nutritional influences can pro-foundly impact bones. We will expand on thesein the overview of alternative treatments. Assessing Osteoporosis Risk and Diagnosing Osteoporosis The evaluation of risk and diagnosis of osteo- porosis is made by a careful medical history, athorough physical examination, laboratoryanalysis, and measuring bone density. No one test or risk factor, alone or in combi- nation, will accurately predict which patients willor will not experience osteoporotic fractures. Ingeneral, the more risk factors present, the greaterthe potential for lower bone mass and the higherthe risk of fracture. However, predictions fromrisk factors cannot pinpoint all persons who willbe affected. Risk factors for osteoporosis accountfor only 20 to 40 percent of bone mass variance. 29 Therefore, risk factors alone do not provide adequate assessment of low bone mass, but rather are important guides in the clinical assessment ofosteoporosis risks that contribute to optimal pre-ventive management. Ultimately, an individualwoman's risk of fracture is the most relevantparameter for her future health care. It is important to distinguish between risk factors for osteoporosis as dened by BMD andrisk factors for osteoporotic fractures. by BMD, major risk factors are: Postmenopausal Advanced age Genetics Lifestyle factors (low calcium, low vitamin D intake, smoking) Thinness The most common risk factors for osteo- porotic fracture are female, advanced age, lowBMD, previous fracture as an adult (other thanthe skull, facial bone, ankle, nger, and toe). Amore comprehensive list of risk factors for osteo-porotic fractures includes: Female Postmenopausal and advanced age Previous fracture as an adult (other than skull, facial bone, ankle, nger, and toe) History of hip fracture in a mother or father Body weight less than 127 pounds or body mass index (BMI) less than 21 Characteristics: short, slender, fair-skinned, blonde, blue-eyed Current smoking, of any amount Low calcium or vitamin D intake More than two alcoholic drinks per day Early menopause (physiologic, surgical, or drug-induced) Increased risk of falling (impaired vision, dementia, poor health or fragility, sedentary,history of recent falls) When trying to determine a woman's risk of low bone mass and risk of fracture, questionsshould be asked to determine risk factors as241OSTEOPOROSIS stated in the two preceding lists. There are also various medications, disease states, and geneticdisorders that are secondary causes of bone loss.This information should also be explored with amedical history. Most of these risks can be deter-mined on a questionnaire. They don't diagnoseosteoporosis, but identifying these risk factorscan help to determine causes of osteoporosis andhelp to guide the best treatment strategy. After menopause, the risk of falling should also be determined. Factors related to an increased riskof falling include A history of falls, fainting, or loss of consciousness Muscle weakness Balance problems Dizziness Difculty standing or walking Arthritis Poor vision Medications that affect balance and coordination Physical exam should assess height, weight, site of back pain and localized spinal muscle spasms,spinal contours and deformities, and dental health.A loss of height can be a sign of a fracture in thevertebrae. Normal age-related height loss is up to1.0 to 1.5 inches. Height should be measuredyearly, and a loss of height that is greater than 1.5inches increases the possibility that a vertebral frac-ture has occurred. 30Vertebral fractures also cause acute or chronic back pain, especially in themiddle part of the back, called the thoracic spine.If there are multiple vertebral fractures, calledcompression fractures, the most obvious sign is anabnormal curvature called kyphosis. If back pain,height loss, and kyphosis are all present, this war-rants an x-ray of the spine to determine if there isMedications, Diseases, and Disorders That Increase the Risk of Osteoporosis Medications Oral or intramuscular use of glucocorticoids for more than three months Excessive thyroid hormone Long-term use of the anticonvulsant Hemochromatosis Hypophosphatasia Calcium Balance Disorders Elevated urinary D deciencyEndocrine Disorders Cortisol excess Cushing's syndrome (celiac disease, Crohn's disease) Total gastrectomy (removal of the stomach) Other Disorders and Conditions Multiple myeloma Lymphoma and leukemia Systemic mastocytosis Anorexia nervosa Rheumatoid arthritis Chronic renal disease242WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE osteoporosis and/or vertebral fractures. Even exces- sive height loss without back pain warrants an x-ray to conrm a spine fracture. Women who haveone vertebral fracture are at high risk for a subse-quent fracture, 31which makes diagnosing a single vertebral fracture that much more important. Body weight should also be recorded. A body weight less than 127 pounds or a body massindex less than 21 kg/m 2is a risk factor for low BMD. Thinness is associated with low bone den-sity and a twofold increased risk of fracture, espe- cially in older women. 32 Laboratory Tests. Laboratory tests are important in determining the cause of the lowbone density or osteoporosis. Secondary causesof bone loss should be identied because thecause needs to be treated, not just the resultingeffects, the bone loss. Laboratory studies and biochemical markers are done on an individualbasis. Some women may need some or all ofthese tests initially because their risk is deter-mined to be high from the history and physicalexam. Other women will want or need these testsbecause their bone density is signicantly low,and possible metabolic causes will be importantto determine. Tests may need to be repeated overtime in order to monitor the effectiveness of thetreatments that have been employed. It's impor-tant to fully understand, however, that these testscannot diagnose osteoporosis, predict bone den-sity, or determine fracture risk. Tests that should be routinely performed include a complete blood cell count, serum cal-cium, alkaline malabsorption of calcium or arenal calcium leak. Selected cases warrant addi-tional testing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels inthe serum, parathyroid hormone, and serumelectrophoresis to determine the cause of theexcessive bone loss or fractures. There are some newer tests that are biochem- ical markers of bone turnover. Again, they do notdiagnose osteoporosis or determine future bone loss or fracture rates. However, they can be usedto determine a response to treatment. These testsof bone turnover can be done prior to beginninga treatment for osteoporosis and then again in afew months to determine if the treatment isworking to slow bone turnover. Tests for bio-chemical markers of bone turnover can be donemore frequently than a bone density test and canbe done early, even within weeks after beginningthe treatment. The role of these tests in routineclinical practice has not been established, how-ever, and therefore it is difcult to determine thescope of their usefulness. It might be tempting to think that all meno- pausal women should have a bone density test. Iwould discourage that way of thinking because atest is really only helpful if it influences the treat-ment. If a woman really wants the test, I have noobjection to ordering it for her. However, I tendto follow the recommendations for BMD testing(described later) of the North American Meno-pause Society: Postmenopausal women with medical causes of bone loss All postmenopausal women who are 65 years or older Postmenopausal women younger than age 65 who have one or more of the followingrisk factors for fracture: Fracture after menopause (other than skull, facial bone, ankle, nger, and toe) Weight less than 127 pounds or BMI less than 21 Hip fracture in mother or fatherCurrent smoker Bone density testing can clarify an already dif- cult decision and can optimize the use of bothconventional and natural medicine therapies. Imaging Techniques. Bone imaging tech- niques include radiographic techniques and243OSTEOPOROSIS ultrasound of the heel. Radiographic techniques include dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA),CT the commonly used densitometry tech-niques and is more accurate in measuring bonedensity of the lumbar spine and proximal femur.DXA offers a lower dose of radiation and ashorter examination time than other imagingmethods. Because of its enhanced precision andaccuracy, DXA has become the gold standard forbone densitometry. The total hip, femoral neck,and lumbar spine are the three most importantmeasurements. The lowest score of the three is themost important. Repeat tests in women who arenot receiving treatment generally do not need tooccur until three to ve years later. For womenreceiving treatment for osteoporosis, BMD test-ing is typically done after two years, althoughselected cases may warrant testing at one year. Ultrasound of the heel is less expensive, is easily administered, and uses no radiation. Theheel bone is 100 percent trabecular bone, the sametype of bone that makes up 90 percent of the ver-tebrae and 50 percent of the hip. Ultrasoundmeasurement of the heel bone may provide a lessexpensive screening test for osteoporosis. Reviewshave concluded that ultrasound of the heel was agood predictor of fractures of the spine. 33Its lim- iting factor is that the scans are not useful indetecting small changes in density over time andtherefore cannot be used to monitor the effective-ness of treatment of osteoporosis. Women withabnormal results would be referred for DXA test-ing to more precisely assess bone mineral density. In women who are receiving treatment for osteoporosis, DXA scans are usually done aftertwo years of treatment. It is important to realizethat even if there is no increase in BMD on theDXA scan in the rst two years, there may be signicant increases in the third year, even on thesame therapy. In addition, if proven fracture-reducing drugs are being used (bisphosphonatesand estrogen therapy), a reduction in fracture risk occurs even if the bone density is not increased.On the other hand, if there is a decrease in theDXA scan, while on proven osteoporosis treat-ment medications, further testing should be doneto determine if there are any secondary causes ofbone loss. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Osteoporosis is far easier to prevent than to treat. An osteoporosis prevention perspective needs tostart in the teenage years. Education shouldinclude several key areas: Medical problems, early in life and current, that can lead to osteoporosis Medications that can interfere with calcium metabolism The role of nutrition and exercise early in life and their necessity in achieving peak bonedensity Awareness of the long-term consequences for bone health of anorexia Awareness of the negative effect of smoking and excess alcohol For women in their 40s, 50s, and older who have just begun to think about osteoporosis, thetime for reaching peak bone density at age 30 to35 is already past. We all lose bone density as weage, and if you achieved 100 percent of maxi-mum by 30 or 35 and you do not have a condi-World Health Organization Denitions 1.Normal bone mineral density (BMD): Within 1 standard deviation (SD) of young adult gender-matched means 2.Osteopenia: BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below young adult means 3.Osteoporosis: BMD more than 2.5 SD below young adult means 4.Severe osteoporosis: BMD more than 2.5 SD below young adult means and the presence of one or more fragility fractures244WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE tion or genetics that cause rapid bone loss, then all is well usually. If your peak bone density wasonly 85 percent of maximum, then you can'tafford as much normal age-related bone lossbefore your bone density becomes osteopenicand then osteoporotic. Several approaches are available to prevent osteoporosis and to treat both those who are athigh risk and those who have developed the condi-tion. Natural medicines are especially key in pre-vention and in helping women with mild low bonedensity. Once osteoporosis has been diagnosed,many of the natural interventions such as diet,exercise, nutritional supplementation, and herbalmedicines could be used aggressively in mildercases to slow bone loss and possibly improve bonedensity, bone strength, bone architecture, and bonehealth in general. In general, it is my position thatin cases of diagnosed osteoporosis, natural inter-vention should be used to supplement an antire-sorptive therapy intended to stop or slow the rateof bone loss and reduce the rate of fractures. Themost common proven antiresorptive (SERMS). All postmenopausal women, no matter their risk for osteoporosis or bone density status, shouldbe encouraged to practice prevention strategies. Abalanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D, regular exercise, not smoking, low alcohol intake,and fall prevention are important steps for bonehealth as well as other health benets. Natural interventions for mildly low bone density and osteoporosis include dietary andlifestyle factors, exercise, nutritional supplemen-tation, the use of phytoestrogens, and natural(bio-identical) hormone replacement therapy.Each of these areas deserves special attention. Nutrition Several dietary factors affect bone health and are involved in the development of osteoporosis:insufcient calcium and vitamin D intake, highphosphorus intake, a high animal protein diet,excess salt intake, and other mineral deciencies.A diet that maximizes consumption of fruits andvegetables and minimizes dietary fats is benecialfor bone development. Women older than age 65 who do not eat enough and women who practice frequent dieting KEY CONCEPTS Osteoporosis-related fractures will develop in almost half of all women older than 65. Osteoporosis is a serious and disabling disease and is far easier to prevent than to treat. Women with a family history of osteoporosis, and especially hip fractures, are at the highest risk of developing the condition. Eighty toninety percent of the determination of the development of osteoporosis is a family history of osteoporosis. Fracture risk can be determined from a medical history, physical exam, laboratory testing, and a DXA bone density test.PREVENTION Do not smoke. Reduce or avoid alcohol consumption and do not exceed one drink per day. Do regular weight-bearing exercise, especially comprehensive weight lifting throughout life. Ensure proper nutrition: organic low-fat dairy, soy foods, adequate calcium and vitamin D,whole grains, dark leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, healthy oils, and sh. Avoid being underweight. Minimize caffeine intake. Reduce animal protein. Avoid falls and injuries. Get regular annual health checks; laboratory testing and bone-density testing may be appropriate. Consider hormone replacement therapy (bio- identical hormones or conventional hormones) if you have several risk factors. Take nutritional supplements for bone health.245OSTEOPOROSIS or have eating disorders are susceptible to insuf- cient intake of vitamins and minerals and there-fore may have insufcient bone mass. Elderlywomen are particularly vulnerable to the negativeeffects of weight loss impacting their bonehealth. Weight loss in this group may lead toaccelerated bone loss and a higher risk of frac-tures, particularly of the hip. 34 Studies have shown that excessive animal pro- tein in the diet may promote bone loss. It particu-larly causes an increase in urinary excretion of calcium. Raising daily animal protein intake from47 to 142 grams doubles the excretion of calciumin the urine. 35Calcium is mobilized from the bone to buffer the acidic breakdown products ofprotein. In addition, the amino acid methionine,highest in meat, dairy products, and eggs, is con-verted to homocysteine, which in high amountsmay also cause bone loss. All of these mechanismsof a high animal protein diet contributing to cal-cium and bone loss should raise serious concernabout popular high animal protein diets. On the other hand, insufcient protein may also be a problem, especially in women olderthan 75, and adequate protein intake may helpto minimize bone loss. 36, 37Protein supplementa- tion of 20 grams per day in older patients whohave had a hip fracture have been shown todecrease recovery time and result in lower rates ofcomplications and a lower death rate the rstseven months after the fracture. 38 A vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis,39even though vegetarians do not have greater bone mass in their 20s, 30s, and40s. Several studies have shown that vegetariansdo have signicantly higher bone mass later inlife, which would indicate that vegetarians losebone more slowly than nonvegetarians. 40, 41 Many high-protein animal foods also containhigh amounts of phosphorus, which mobilizescalcium from the bones in order to maintainhomeostasis in the bloodstream. High-phosphorus beverages are also implicated in osteoporosis. A study in children demonstrateda severe impact of soft drinks on calcium levels. Fifty-seven children with low blood calcium levelswere compared to 171 children with normal cal-cium levels. 42Of the 57 children who had low blood calcium levels, 66.7 percent drank morethan four 12- to 16-ounce bottles of soft drinks perweek. Only 28 percent of the 171 children withnormal serum calcium levels consumed that manysoft drinks per week. For all 228 children, a strongcorrelation was seen in the serum calcium level andthe number of bottles of soft drinks consumedeach week. The more soft drinks consumed, thelower the calcium level in the blood. Due to thehigh intake of soft drinks in the United States, wecan probably expect to see increased osteoporosisin the \"Pepsi generation\" for many years to come.The American per-capita consumption of softdrinks is about three quarts per week. Other nutritional factors also accelerate cal- cium loss and may be implicated in osteoporosis.Rened sugar may raise the risk for osteoporosisby increasing the loss of calcium from the bodyand by causing a signicant increase in fastingserum cortisol levels. A serving of rened sugarincreases the urinary excretion of calcium, 43and an excess of corticosteroids can cause osteoporosis.High sodium intake can also cause an increase inurinary excretion of calcium in some individu-als. 44Rened grains and flours may also play a part in the development of osteoporosis. Due totheir lack of nutrient-rich germ and bran, there isa signicant loss of vitamins and minerals inthese foods. The rening process produces whiteflour stripped of B 6, folic acid, calcium, magne- sium, manganese, copper, and zinc. One of the best general dietary preventive habits to acquire is to eat a lot of dark green leafyvegetables. Kale, collard greens, romaine, spinach,Swiss chard, and other dark greens are a rich sourceof vitamins and minerals, including calcium, vita-min K, and boron. As you will learn in the nutri-tional supplements section, vitamin K is involvedin the mineralization of bone, and boron decreasesthe urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium.246WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Soy foods appear to also have some role in preventing or slowing bone loss. Soy contains aclass of compounds called phytoestrogens. Thephytoestrogen especially high in soy foods isisoflavone. Phytoestrogens and isoflavones arediscussed in more detail in Chapter 12; here we'llfocus on their effect on bone health. a semisynthetic product called Ipri-Flavone, which is used to treat osteoporosis. Soyis the only dietary source of daidzein, which is anonsteroidal estrogen-like molecule. Soy alsoincreases the menstrual cycle length by one tove days, especially the follicular phase. This mayhave a positive effect on bone density due tolonger exposure to elevated estrogen levels. Soy appears to have a proestrogen effect on bone in some experimental evaluations. Thebone density of ovariectomized rats for which soy replaced casein in the diet was compared toanother group that received estrogen. The addi-tion of soy inhibited bone loss, although not tothe same extent as was achieved with estrogentreatment. 45Another study of ovariectomized rats also reported a positive effect of the soy phy-toestrogen genistein in maintaining bone. 46 These authors also reported that genistein sup-presses the bone resorption cells (osteoclasts)both in the test tube and in vivo. Several human studies have provided further insight into the possible role of soy in bonehealth. A study conducted at the University ofIllinois found that menopausal women had an increase in mineral levels and density in theirlumbar spines after taking 55 to 90 mg ofisoflavones for six months. 47The placebo group showed the lowest bone density and the greatestbone loss, while the estrogen group showed thehighest bone density and the slowest bone loss.What was surprising was that the soybean pro-tein diet was effective in preventing bone loss inthe fourth lumbar vertebra and, although less so,in the right hip as well. Soybean protein seems tohave more of an effect on trabecular bone (morepredominant in the spine) than on cortical bone(more predominant in the hip). The soybeanprotein did not show as great an ability to pre-vent bone loss as the estrogen group, but the pos-itive effect it showed is encouraging. The study of the relationship between soy isoflavone intake and bone mineral density wasconducted from the Study of Women's HealthAcross the Nation, a U.S. cohort study of womenaged 42 to 52 years. 48For African-American and Caucasian women, median intakes of genisteinwere too low to pursue analyses. For Chinesewomen, no association between genistein andbone mineral density was found. Premenopausal,but not perimenopausal, Japanese women whoseintakes were greater had a higher bone density ofthe spine and femoral neck. Mean spinal bonedensity of those women in the highest genisteinintake group was 7.7 percent greater than that of women in the lowest group. Bone density of the femoral neck was 12 percent greater in thehighest intake group versus the lowest. Other positive studies on soy and bone den- sity also give some credence to the role of soy for bone health. In a study estimating the dailyintakes of soy isoflavones in the diets of 478 post-menopausal Japanese women who reported soyconsumption, high consumption of soy productswas associated with increased bone mass. 49 Soy is also a good source of calcium. A diet that includes greater amounts of soy productscan account for a meaningful amount of calcium,Calcium Content of Selected Soy Foods Soy Product Calcium (mg) Tofu, rm (14block) 553 Tofu, regular (14block) 406 Soy milk, calcium-fortied (1 cup) 80-300 Soy milk (1 cup) 7Soybeans, roasted 14cup) 119 Soybeans, boiled (14cup) 88 Tempeh (14cup) 77247OSTEOPOROSIS and some soy foods can offer as much or more calcium than a serving of dairy products. An adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is fundamental for bone health and is an impor-tant adjunct to drug treatments for osteoporosis.In fact, a review of almost three dozen clinicaltrials found that bone mineral density of the hipincreased more in the estrogen plus calciumgroup, compared with the estrogen groupalone. 50 Most menopausal women look to calcium supplementation to meet their calcium needs.However, dietary sources of calcium should beemphasized as part of a well-balanced diet toensure intake of other nutrients found in high-calcium foods. Dairy products are good sources of calcium. In addition, dairy products have ahigh elemental calcium content and absorptionrate and are affordable. There are now many dairyproduct alternatives as well, such as calcium-fortied soy foods, calcium-fortied rice milk,and others. Some foods can actually inhibit calcium absorption. I don't advocate avoiding thesefoods, but it is important to be aware that theoxalate contained in foods such as spinach andthe phytates found in whole grains can inhibitcalcium absorption. Foods high in calcium include kelp, Swiss and cheddar cheese, carob flour, dulse, buckwheat,sesame seeds, olives, broccoli, walnuts, cottagecheese, and spinach. Calcium and vitamin D arediscussed in detail in the nutritional supplementsection. The influence of dietary fats on mineral absorption is complex and only understood inpart. Several key observations have been made,although many of the factors that influenceabsorption are still unknown. For example,increasing linoleic acid in the diet signicantly reduce calcium in the stool, indicating thatomega-6 essential fatty acids (EFAs) stimulatecalcium absorption. 51Calcium absorption will also be signicantly increased when the diet issupplemented daily with sh oil, evening prim-rose oil, a mixture of both, or sunflower oil. 52 Deciencies of EFAs modify bone fatty acidlevels and have profound effects on the degree ofmineralization of the bone. This is observed inanimals fed EFA-decient diets, who developosteoporosis. The role of EFAs is discussed inmuch more detail in the nutritional supplementsection of this chapter. Alcohol and Smoking. Consumption of alcohol also appears to promote bone loss. Scien-tic evidence links consumption of alcohol (sevenounces or more per week) with lower bone mass,increased bone loss, an increase risk of falls, and ahigher incidence of hip fracture. 53A meta-analysis showed that consuming two alcoholic drinks perday signicantly increases the risk of fracture, 54 and even heavier consumption has additional neg-ative effects on bone density. The good news isthat a small amount of alcohol, one to two ouncesper week, is associated with a higher bone mineraldensity in women age 65 years and older 55and a decreased risk of hip fracture.56 The results of most studies show that smok- ers lose bone more rapidly and have a lower bonemass than nonsmokers. 57Some research shows that postmenopausal women who smoke have asignicantly higher fracture rate than womenwho don't smoke. 58In female smokers, the risk of hip fracture is increased by 1.5 to 2.5-fold.14 It's not clear what mechanisms are involved inthe adverse effects of smoking on bone densityand fracture. Some evidence suggests that smok-ing may alter calcium absorption 59, 60 and lower estrogen levels.61All in all, it appears that women who smoke tend to lose bone more rapidly, havelower bone mass, and reach menopause abouttwo years earlier than nonsmokers. 62-64248WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Nutritional Supplements Calcium. When women think about what they can do to prevent osteoporosis, most womenthink of calcium supplementation. Calciumimproves bone health, increases bone mineraldensity, and improves the effectiveness of osteo-porosis medications. Although most studies donot show a positive effect of calcium in reducingfracture risk, in the Women's Health Initiative(WHI) trial, hip fractures were signicantlyreduced in older women on the calcium supple-ment program. 65Calcium supplementation has also been shown to decrease bone loss in post-menopausal women. 66The effects of calcium sup- plementation have been greatest in women whosebaseline calcium intake was low, in older women,and in women with osteoporosis. 67 As women age, especially after menopause, calcium requirements increase due to bothreduced intestinal calcium absorption and lessefcient kidney conservation of calcium. Eventhough these two mechanisms are in play, how-ever, the primary influence on calcium absorp-tion is the amount of calcium that is ingested, via either diet or supplementation. Selected populations of postmenopausal women may nothave adequate calcium intake, including olderwomen, women who are lactose intolerant (andso must avoid dairy foods), vegans (who con-sume no animal or dairy products), and womenon poor diets in general. Even in the UnitedStates, postmenopausal women have dietaryintakes of calcium of about 600 mg per day,which is below the recommended amount. TheNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) recom-mendations 68(last revised in 1997) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommen-dations 69(last revised in 1994) are the two most well-accepted guidelines for calcium intake inwomen (see the following sidebar). To determine how much calcium you should take in a supplement, you must rst estimatewhat your dietary intake is. Start by assumingthat you get 250 mg per day, not counting any dairy foods or calcium-fortied foods, if you eattwo or three meals per day. Most women take inan additional 300 mg per day in the form of oneserving of dairy. If you take in more than oneserving per day of dairy, add another 300 mg foreach additional serving, as well as for each serv-ing of a calcium-fortied soy food. If you drinkone glass of milk per day and eat no soy foods orother calcium-fortied foods, for example, youraverage daily intake is 250 mg /H11001300 mg /H11005550 mg per day. So, if you are 55 and postmeno-pausal, you need an additional 650 to 950 mgper day to reach a total that falls within the rec-ommendations of 1,200 to 1,500 mg per day forpostmenopausal women under 65. There is a great deal of confusion and contro- versy about which form of calcium is best. I dis-courage women from using either oyster shell orbone meal calcium. These calcium supplementsmay contain substantial amounts of lead. In1981, the FDA cautioned the public to limitintake of calcium supplements made from eitherdolomite or bone meal because of the potentiallyhigh lead levels. Unfortunately, even othersources of calcium from various chelates may alsoRecommendations for Calcium Intake National Academy of Sciences Recommendations Age 31-50 1,000 mg/day Age 51 and older 1,200 mg/day National Institutes of Health Recommendations Premenopausal women aged 25-50 1,000 mg/day Postmenopausal women under 65 using estrogen therapy 1,000 mg/day Postmenopausal women not using estrogen therapy 1,500 mg/day All women aged 65 and older 1,500 mg/day249OSTEOPOROSIS contain minute amounts of lead. In a 1993 study of lead content in calcium supplements, lead wasthe highest in bone meal, unrened calcium carbonate, and dolomite and lowest in calciumchelate supplements and rened succinate, and aspartate. When the calcium is taken on an empty stomach, calcium citrate is absorbed better thancalcium carbonate. In addition, it may be that aswomen age and have lower stomach acid produc- tion, lower fat absorption, and take in less vita-min D due to less exposure to sunshine anddecreased fat absorption, calcium citrate may bea better choice to combat these compromisingeffects on calcium absorption. In most women,though, especially in perimenopausal womenand postmenopausal women up to age 65, thereis no known best form. Calcium carbonate isabsorbed well when taken with food. Calciumcitrate can be taken with food or on an emptystomach, making it more flexible as to timing ofyour supplement regime. Calcium supplementation is extremely safe, and even in amounts of total calcium intake upto 1,500 mg per day there is no increase in therisk of a kidney stone. 71However, in women with a history of kidney stones, calcium supple-ments are contraindicated except with medicaltesting/assessment and supervision. Calciumintake greater than 2,500 mg per day, taking intoaccount diet and supplement, should be avoided.Some women become constipated or have nauseaand indigestion with calcium supplementation,especially calcium carbonate. In these cases, cal-cium citrate will less likely cause these problems. Another issue that makes it difcult to deter- mine the optimal dose of calcium is that higherdoses of calcium may interfere with the absorp-tion of other nutrients. In two separate studies,researchers have shown that a high dietary cal-cium intake adversely affects zinc absorption andbalance in humans. 72, 73 This may be especially important in elderly women due to their com-promised zinc absorption, their possible mar- ginal zinc status to begin with, and their high riskof osteoporosis. A zinc deciency can result inskin changes, growth retardation, loss of appetite,changes in vision, decreased insulin function,dysfunction in prostaglandin synthesis, andimmunologic abnormalities. Zinc is also essentialfor normal bone formation; it enhances the bio-chemical actions of vitamin D, is required for theformation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and isrequired for the synthesis of various proteinsfound in bone tissue. Zinc levels have been foundto be low in the serum and bone of elderly peoplewith osteoporosis, 74and also in people with bone loss at the alveolar ridge of the mandible.75This negative interaction between calcium and zincabsorption raises concerns about how higher cal-cium intakes may affect the absorption of otherminerals needed for bone health. Another area of great disagreement is what ratio of calcium to magnesium is best. Someresearchers and clinicians recommend twice asmuch calcium as magnesium; others recommendequal parts calcium and magnesium; others rec-ommend 1.5 parts calcium and 1 part magne-sium; and still others recommend twice as muchmagnesium as calcium. The most scienticresearch support exists for two parts calcium toone part magnesium. (See the section on magne-sium later in this chapter.) The optimal time to take calcium supple- mentation is the last question to consider. Theabsorption of calcium is dependent on itsbecoming ionized in the intestines. Calcium carbonate has to be solubilized and ionized bystomach acid in order to be absorbed. Manypeople have insufcient stomach acid, and stom-ach acid secretion decreases with age. In studiesof postmenopausal women, about 40 percent arefound to be severely decient in stomach acid. 76 For this reason, I recommend taking a form of calcium that is already in a soluble and ionizedstate, such as calcium citrate, calcium lactate, orcalcium gluconate. In these ionized products,250WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE about 45 percent of the calcium is absorbed from calcium citrate in patients with reduced stomachacid, as compared to 4 percent absorption for calcium carbonate. 77 All of these issues make it difcult to choose from the myriad options of form and dosing incalcium supplementation. In general, I wouldfollow the dosages of either the NIH or NAS. Ifyou don't mind taking more pills, then I wouldalso recommend taking calcium citrate over cal-cium carbonate, or at least a combination. (Cal-cium citrate is much bulkier, and you have totake more pills to get adequate amounts of theelemental calcium.) Even though I can no longerargue for advantages in absorption in general ofcitrate over carbonate, fewer digestive sideeffects, the flexibility of taking the calcium withor without meals, and the possibility of enhancedabsorption as you age make a good case for cal-cium citrate. In the end, though, the amount ofyour total calcium intake is far more importantthan the kind of calcium. Recommended Daily Calcium Intake Women aged 25-50: 1,000 mg/day Women aged 51 and older: 1,200-1,500 mg/day Vitamin D. Vitamin D is the only vitamin that's also a hormone, and it is the only vitaminwe don't have to consume from our diet. VitaminD is normally produced in the skin throughultraviolet exposure of a derivative of cholesterol(7-dehydrochlesterol) to produce previtamin D,which is then metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitaminD in the liver and then to 1-alpha dihydroxyvit-amin D 3in the kidney, at which time it becomes functional. This hormone is now able to carryout its function, including calcium absorption,phosphate absorption in the intestine, calciummobilization in the bone, and calcium reabsorp-tion in the kidneys. Vitamin D also maintainsnormal parathyroid status, is an important regu-lator of the immune system, and is important formuscular strength.Vitamin D enhances intestinal calcium absorp- tion, thereby contributing to a favorable calciumbalance in the system. Increased calcium absorp-tion also reduces parathyroid hormone-mediatedbone resorption. In the United States, most infantsand young children have adequate vitamin D con-sumption from fortied milk. During adolescence,however, the consumption of dairy products dropsoff and inadequate vitamin D intake is more likelyto adversely affect calcium absorption. In general, calcium intake alone may have only a slight protective effect for bone mass and fracturerisk, and it is more benecial to supplement witha combination of calcium and vitamin D. Severallarge studies of vitamin D (400 and 800 IU perday) plus calcium (1,000 mg per day) have notshown a signicant effect on fracture risk. 78, 79 However, there are studies that do show a signi-cant effect. One such study in people aged 65years or older showed that both calcium and vita-min D consumption can signicantly reduce theincidence of nonvertebral fractures. 80Another study of postmenopausal women undergoing hipreplacement surgery showed that women with hipfractures were more likely to have a vitamin Ddeciency than those undergoing elective jointreplacement. 81More recently, the NoNOF study of survivors of hip fractures demonstrated thatvitamin D supplementation, either orally or byinjection, suppresses parathyroid hormone,increases bone mineral density, and reduces falls. 82 The effects were more marked with cosupple-menting with 1,000 mg of calcium per day. Perhaps the most compelling study is a meta- analysis of randomized clinical trials in post-menopausal women with a mean age of 71 to 85,which found that 700 to 800 IU per day of vita-min D was associated with signicant reductionin hip and wrist fractures 83; 400 IU per day had no effect. Finally, more recent results from theWomen's Health Initiative found that 1,000 mgper day of calcium plus 400 IU of vitamin D wasassociated with a small but signicant 1 percentincrease in bone mineral density of the hip. 65251OSTEOPOROSIS Experts have typically thought that the mod- erate protective effect of vitamin D on fracturerisk is due primarily to bone mineral densitychanges. However, there is a good body of evi-dence that vitamin D may also directly improvemuscle strength and, as a result, reduce fracturerisk by preventing falls. While randomized con-trolled trials have found that vitamin D reducedfractures within two to three months 84and has benets in improving muscle strength,85-87 the effect of vitamin D on falls has not been wellestablished and results of randomized trials havebeen mixed. A meta-analysis in 2004 attemptedto determine the overall efcacy of vitamin D inpreventing falls in the elderly, especially women. 88 Based on ve randomized clinical trials involving1,237 individuals, vitamin D reduced the risk offalling by 22 percent, compared with individuals,but especially women, who received calcium or a placebo. A recent study on vitamin D sup-plementation and fall prevention was done inAustralia 89in which 625 older residents of nurs- ing homes and assisted-living facilities (95 per-cent women) were randomized to receive eithervitamin D (ergocalciferol; 10,000 IU weekly or1,000 IU daily) or a placebo. None of the partic-ipants had a vitamin D deciency. All partici-pants also received 600 mg of elemental calciumdaily. During two years of follow-up, the inci-dence of falls was signicantly lower in the vita-min D group compared to the placebo group(1.37 versus 1.86 falls per person/year). Thosewho received vitamin D were also less likely tosustain a fracture (8 percent versus 11 percent),although this was not statistically signicant. How much vitamin D is enough? The requirements for vitamin D were last set in 1997by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Instituteof Medicine and may be inadequate (see sidebar). A popular approach of using cod liver oil to supplement vitamin D deserves awareness and abit of caution. One tablespoon of vitamin D-fortied cod liver oil supplies 1,400 IU of vita-min D but also contains high levels of vitamin A,which can exacerbate calcium loss and be associ- ated with low bone density. Magnesium. The conventional scientic view is that magnesium is essential for parathyroid hor-mone (PTH) production and release. PTH isessential for the activation of vitamin D and there-fore absorption of calcium across the gut wall.However, magnesium is an intracellular ion anddifcult to measure. A magnesium level is a reflec-tion of extracellular magnesium. There are severalconditions that can lead to magnesium deciencyand therefore hypoparathyroidism and vitamin Ddeciency. These (urinaryloss), alcohol abuse (nutritional deciency), chronic From the conventional scientic viewpoint,the main reason why magnesium is part of calciumsupplements is that carbonates are constipatingand magnesium has a laxative effect, and thereforethe combination is usually better tolerated. Even though calcium has received the most attention, alternative medicine views the impor-tance of magnesium in skeletal metabolism andcalcium regulation in a little bit different andperhaps broader context. Magnesium influencesboth matrix and mineral metabolism in bone.Magnesium depletion causes cessation of bonegrowth, decreased osteoblastic and osteoclasticCurrent Dietary Recommendations for Vitamin D Adequate Tolerable Age Intake Upper Limits 0-50 200 IU/day 2,000 IU/day 51-70 400-800 IU/day 70 800 or more IU/day 2,000 IU/day Higher doses than those listed as adequate or even upper limits will be needed by women who have hadtheir vitamin D levels tested and found to be low or low normal. Dosage for these women should be moni- tored with follow-up tests.252WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA magnesium levels are necessary forproper calcium metabolism; adequate calciumintake may not ensure proper bone health ifmagnesium status is abnormal. Magnesium deciency has been shown more than once to be related to osteoporosis. Magnesiumstatus appears to have a major influence on the typeof calcium crystals present in the bones, and there-fore its deciency is associated with abnormal calci-cation of the bone. 91This may in part explain why some women who have reduced bone mineraldensity do not have an increase in fracture rates.These women may have a lowered bone mass, butthey have excellent structural calcication, due inpart to adequate levels of magnesium. In order to assess the effects of magnesium on bone density, a group of osteoporotic postmeno-pausal women were given magnesium over aperiod of two years. At the end of the study, mag-nesium therapy appeared to have prevented frac-tures and resulted in a signicant increase inbone mass density after the rst year of treat-ment. There was, however, no change in densityfrom then on to the end of the study. 92The nd- ing that magnesium supplementation actuallycaused an increase in bone density rather thanjust a stabilization of current bone density is signicant. Other factors may have influencedthe increase in bone density, but the results ofthis study warrant further investigation into thepotential effect of magnesium on bone density. Dr. Guy Abraham published a study support- ing the importance of magnesium above that ofcalcium. His study demonstrated an 11 percentincrease in bone density in the group that wasgiven dietary advice, hormones, and nutritionalsupplements (500 mg calcium citrate, 600 mgmagnesium oxide, vitamin C, vitamin B-complex,vitamin D, zinc, copper, manganese, and boron).The group that received the dietary advice plus thehormones but no supplementation had an averageincrease of only 0.7 percent. 93An 11 percent increase in bone density is greater than that foundin studies of calcium or hormone replacement therapy taken either separately or together. However, in most studies on bone density orosteoporosis-related fractures, the benets of calcium have been observed without magnesiumsupplementation. A study looking at calciumabsorption found no benet on calcium absorptionin postmenopausal women taking magnesium. 94 Continued research to elucidate magnesium's rolein bone metabolism and calcium-magnesium inter-actions is needed as well as clinical treatment trialsthat vigorously evaluate magnesium as a potentialtreatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Foods high in magnesium include kelp, wheat bran, wheat germ, almonds, cashews, molasses,brewer's yeast, buckwheat, Brazil nuts, dulse, l-berts, peanuts, millet, whole wheat, pecans, wal-nuts, rye, tofu, beet greens, and coconut. Magnesium 500-750 mg per day Manganese. Manganese may be one of the most important trace nutrients related to osteo-porosis. Manganese deciency causes a reductionin the amount of calcium laid down in the boneand thereby an increased susceptibility to frac-ture. Manganese stimulates the production ofmucopolysaccharides that provide a structure onwhich calcication takes place. 95 Manganese 15-30 mg per day Boron. Dr. Forrest Nielsen studied the effect of boron on bone loss in postmenopausalwomen. Published in 1988, his results indicatedthat boron supplementation reduced the urinaryexcretion of calcium by 44 percent, reduced urinary magnesium excretion, and markedlyincreased denitively implicate boron in calcium and mag-253OSTEOPOROSIS nesium metabolism, hormonal stabilization, and the subsequent prevention of bone loss. Boron 3 mg per day Zinc. Zinc is essential for normal bone for- mation,97enhances the biochemical actions of vitamin D,98and is required for the formation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and for the synthesisof various proteins found in bone tissue. Zinclevels have been found to be low in the serumand bone of elderly people with osteoporosis. 74 Zinc 15-20 mg per day Copper. Copper deciency may be a related cause of osteoporosis. Copper deciency is knownto produce abnormal bone growth in growing chil-dren. Copper supplementation has been shown inlaboratory studies to inhibit bone resorption. 99Its supplementation is deemed necessary in womenat risk for or with diagnosed osteoporosis. Copper 1.5-3 mg per day Folic Acid. Accelerated bone loss in meno- pausal women may in part be due to the increasedlevels of homocysteine, a breakdown product ofmethionine. Homocysteine has the potential topromote osteoporosis if it is not eliminated adequately. Since folic acid is involved in thebreakdown of homocysteine, supplementing post-menopausal women with this nutrient results insignicant reductions in homocysteine levels. 100 This association of homocysteine levels and osteo-porosis was recently seen in a study showing thathigh homocysteine levels were associated withalmost twice the risk of nonvertebral osteoporoticfractures in women. 101However, in the same study, there was no association between homo-cysteine levels and BMD at either the femoral neck or the lumbar spine. Despite these associations, itis not yet clear that giving folic acid is a therapeu-tic tool in preventing bone loss or fractures. Fornow, it remains an interesting association, and folicacid is easy enough to include in a holistic bonehealth approach and prevention program. Folic Acid 400-800 mcg per day Vitamin B 6.Vitamin B 6also plays a role in homocysteine metabolism. In genetic homo-cystinuria, B 6supplementation has been shown to reverse the elevated levels of homocysteine.102 Vitamin B 6has been studied and prescribed for its role in osteoporosis prevention in other capac-ities as well. Animal studies have shown B 6de- ciencies to cause increased fracture healingtime, 103impaired growth of cartilage and defec- tive bone formation,104and more rapid develop- ment of osteoporosis.105Vitamin B 6may also stimulate the production of progesterone and,through this hormone's activation of osteoblasts,have a distinct role in preventing osteoporosis. Vitamin B 6 50-100 mg per day Vitamin C. One of the actions of vitamin C is to promote the formation and cross-linking ofsome of the structural proteins in bone. Animalstudies have shown that vitamin C deciency cancause osteoporosis. 106Moreover, it has been known for decades that scurvy, a disease causedby vitamin C deciency, is associated with abnor-malities of bone. Vitamin C 500 mg or more per day Vitamin K. Vitamin K has been thought for some time to be a contributing factor in the 254WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE prevention of bone loss. It is required for the pro- duction of osteocalcin, the protein matrix onwhich mineralization occurs. Octeocalcin attractscalcium to bone tissue, enabling calcium crystal formation to occur. Vitamin K also plays a key rolein the formation, remodeling, and repair of boneby helping the calcium adhere to the site of thisprotein matrix. Individuals with osteoporosis havebeen found to have lower serum vitamin K levelswhen compared to age-matched controls. 107The amount of vitamin K that is required for optimalbone health appears to be greater than that neededfor normal clotting of blood. 108 Recently, a review and meta-analysis of 13 published clinical trials made an even strongercase for the role of vitamin K in osteoporosis. 109 In 12 of the 13 clinical trials, this meta-analysisconcluded that supplementation with large dosesof vitamin K can prevent bone loss of the hip andvertebrae. (The one trial that showed no effectwas a study of premenopausal athletic womenwho were given 10 mg per day of vitamin K 1.) Even more impressively, fracture data was avail-able in seven of the studies. The rates of hip fractures were reduced by 77 percent, other non-vertebral fractures by 81 percent, and vertebralfractures by 60 percent. 110 Most of the studies in this meta-analysis were of postmenopausal women, but some of thestudies included patients who had diseases thatare associated with higher risk of osteoporosis,including patients with primary biliary cirrhosisand some on glucocorticoids. These results infracture reduction exceed those typically seenwith alendronate (about 50 percent), and fewerside effects are associated with vitamin K com-pared to the approximately 17 percent side effectrate of reflux and esophagitis with bisphospho-nates. However, the longest study in this meta-analysis was only three years, which is a shortamount of time in the world of bone density andfracture data, and further research is neededbefore drawing conclusions on the comparativevalue of vitamin K supplementation.Vitamin K 2 45 mg per day Essential Fatty Acids Essential fatty acids (EFAs) have not been talked about much in relationship to osteoporosis, butthere is a growing body of evidence and research towarrant attention. Most of the research and focuson osteoporosis has been around the loss of calciumfrom bone before and during osteoporosis, reducedbone strength, and increased risk of fractures. Whathas received less attention is that osteoporosis maybe a marker for other serious potential health prob-lems apart from fractures. Not only must we con-sider demineralization of bone, but ectopiccalcication and the possible connection betweenectopic calcium deposits, particularly in the arteriesand kidneys, and bone decalcication. Specically, low bone density may be related to vascular problems, and essential fatty acids andtheir regulation of calcium metabolism may be akey player in influencing the sites at which calci-cation occurs. The role of essential fatty acids haslargely been ignored in relation to osteoporosisdespite animal and human studies indicating thatEFAs enhance calcium absorption, enhance theeffects of vitamin D, reduce urinary calcium excretion, increase bone calcium, reduce ectopiccalcication elsewhere, and increase bone proteinsynthesis and bone strength. The rst published paper that clearly described the relevance of EFAs on calciumshowed that in EFA-decient animals, the kid-neys became highly calcied, apparently becauseof a shift of calcium from the bones. 111Other early studies demonstrated that EFA deciencyin animals was associated with loss of normal col-lagen synthesis and of normal connective tissuein bone, loss of normal cartilage, demineraliza-tion of bone, and bone weakness. 112-114 This early body of research established that EFA deciency led to severe osteoporosis in ani-255OSTEOPOROSIS mals and that the osteoporosis was associated with signicant ectopic calcication. Not untilthe 1990s, however, did new observations lead torenewed interest in EFAs and calcium. Theseobservations indicated that prostaglandin (PG)formation could stimulate bone growth, thatrenal calcium stones were rare among the Inuit(Eskimos) of the Arctic, seemingly due to theirhigh intake of EFAs from sh oils, and that EFAmetabolism might form a basis for the associa-tions between osteoporosis and coronary arterydisease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Before we get too far along, it's important to have some familiarity with the basics of EFA bio-chemistry. There are two families of EFAs ofimport in this conversation, the omega-6 seriesand the omega-3 series. Linoleic acid (LA) is theparent compound of the omega-6 series, andalpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the parent com-pound of the omega-3 series. Each of these ismetabolized by a series of enzymatic reactions in which their metabolites play key roles within the body. The most important metabolites areprobably dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid (DGLA)and arachidonic acid seriesand eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doca-hexaenoic acid (DHA) of the omega-3 series. Essential fatty acids are required constituents of every membrane within the body. They arerequired for the normal functioning of everymembrane and for the normal functioning ofcalcium release from storage. EFAs are also partof most of the signaling systems within every cell. How calcium is excreted and how much is excreted are major factors in the metabolism ofbone and the development of kidney stones, aswell as the overall calcium balance in the body.Probably the major factor controlling calciumexcretion is calcium intake, but we also knowthat prostaglandins are involved in calcium in the urineare also correlated with increased PgE2 and increased calcium excretion. Although the pre-cise role of EFAs and prostaglandins in hypercal-ciuria is not understood, the balance of researchdemonstrates that excessive production of PGEfrom arachidonic acid is a factor. If we could reduce urinary calcium excretion, this could not only have a bone-preserving effectbut also reduce the formation of stones. Researchin the early 1990s explored enhancing dietaryEPA with sh oils to protect against stone dis-ease. What was found was that the sh oils wereable to reduce urinary calcium excretion. Thiswork was preliminary and fundamental tounderstanding how EFAs and prostaglandinmetabolism could affect calcium excretion andreabsorption. Although the work was undertakenin an effort to prevent kidney disease and kidneyfailure, it supports the idea that EFAs affect cal-cium metabolism and could be used to improvebone health and bone density. The influence of dietary fats on mineral absorption is complex and only understood inpart. Several key observations have been made,although many of the factors that influenceabsorption are still unknown. For example,increasing linoleic acid in the diet signicantlyreduces calcium in the stool, indicating thatomega-6 EFAs stimulate calcium absorption. 51 Calcium absorption will also signicantlyincrease when the diet is supplemented with shoil, evening primrose oil, a mixture of both, orsunflower oil daily. 52 Animal studies have revealed many mecha- nisms related to EFAs and calcium absorption.Probably the largest body of work establishedthat there is a signicant relationship amongEFAs, the actions of vitamin D, the transport ofcalcium across the membrane, and an increase inmembrane fluidity followed by an increase in calcium absorption. As mentioned earlier in the nutrition section, deciencies of EFAs modify bone fatty acid levelsand have profound effects on the degree of miner-256WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE alization of the bone. Animals fed EFA-decient diets also develop osteoporosis. Evidence is alsobuilding that prostaglandins have an influence onbone metabolism. Prudent use of EFAs may reducethe degradation of bone matrix collagen, while alsoincreasing bone mineral content. Animal studiesusing different ratios of evening primrose oil (highin gamma-linolenic acid or GLA), sh oil (rich and DHA), sunflower oil, and flaxseed oilsuggest that supplementation with high doses ofevening primrose oil and sh oil is more effectivein inhibiting bone loss than is supplementationwith linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids. 118 The relationship between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease has several correlations.One is that those individuals with osteoporosisand a subsequent hip fracture have an increasedrisk of mortality due to strokes. Calcium is notsimply lost from the bone in osteoporosis, butsome of that calcium is deposited in the arteriesand kidneys. The calcication process in athero-sclerosis is very similar to what occurs in bone. Itmay be that metabolic issues that regulate calci-cation are common to both diseases. Individualswith osteoporosis frequently have ectopic calci-cation in other tissues as well, especially the discsbetween the vertebrae. Loss of bone calcium with concomitant calci- cation in the kidneys was observed as far back as 1931 in a study by Borland and Jackson wherean induced EFA deciency elicited both prob-lems. 111More recently, supplementation with EPA and GLA was shown to prevent ectopic cal-cication. This is better understood by looking atthe role of EFAs in membrane health, calciumabsorption, calcium excretion, and bone mineral-ization. It is also worth speculating that sincedecits of long chain EFAs are important in cardiovascular disease, the associations betweenosteoporosis and heart disease may be dependenton a commonality of impaired EFA metabolismand poor sources of dietary fat. While preventive measures of a well-balanced diet, avoiding smoking and excess alcohol, regu-lar weight-bearing exercise, and proper vitamin and mineral intake should be the hallmarks inthe prevention of osteoporosis, the informationand data on essential fatty acids should not onlymotivate us to improve sources of dietary fat, italso suggests that EFA supplements are a viablemethod of decreasing the risk of osteoporosis. Essential Fatty Acids: Omega-3 and Omega-6 Approximately 1 g per day of EPA and DHA Botanical Medicine Red Clover ( Trifolium Pratense ).Red clover is a member of the legume family rich in flavonoids,glycosides, phytoestrogens, and other vitamins andminerals. This native American herb was histori-cally used to treat whooping cough, gout, andcancer. Some researchers speculate that red clovermay have an estrogenic effect on the bone. Theystudied the effects of a special red clover extract,Rimostil, 119Fifty postmenopausal women were ran- to 28.5 mg, 57.0 mg,or 85.5 mg of Rimostil for six months, followed bytwo months of a placebo. Bone density was meas-ured at baseline, three months, and six monthsusing a DXA scan. (Lipid levels and uterine liningthickness were also measured in this study.) Allthree doses of Rimostil were associated with a 2.9to 4 percent increase in bone density from zero tosix months in the proximal radius and ulna (clos-est to the elbow). No signicant change in bonedensity occurred at the distal radius and ulna. Another placebo-controlled clinical trial attempted to determine the effect of red cloverisoflavones on bone density in women aged 49 to65. 120One group received one tablet of a stan- dardized extract of red clover (26 mg biochaninA, 16 mg formononetin, 1 mg genistein, and 0.5mg daidzein), and the other received a placebo.257OSTEOPOROSIS This trial lasted one year, and 86 women in the red clover group and 91 in the placebo groupcompleted the study. Dietary calcium and vita-min D were similar in both groups. At the end of12 months, women in the red clover group hadless bone loss of the lumbar spine than women inthe placebo group. Bone density decreased by1.08 percent in the red clover group and by 1.86percent in the placebo group. The differences inthe hip bone between the red clover and placebogroups were not signicant. T wo markers of boneformation were also tested in this study. For post-menopausal women in the study, there was anincrease in these markers in the red clover group,and a decrease in one marker and a lower increasein another marker in the placebo group. Theseresults suggest that red clover isoflavones may beable to slow bone loss in the lumbar spine. Red Clover Standardized Extract 28-85 mg per day of red clover isoflavones Ipriflavone. A synthetic derivative of isoflavones, Ipriflavone was only available in Italyand a handful of other countries until recently. It is now available over the counter in naturalfood stores or from alternative practitioners. T wo multicenter, two-year clinical trials evaluated the efcacy and bioavailability of Ipriflavone inpostmenopausal women with low bone mass. 121 Women were randomly selected to receive eitheroral Ipriflavone (200 mg three times daily) or aplacebo, plus 1 gram oral calcium daily. Bothstudies were reported in the same paper. Study A showed a bone-sparing effect of 1.6 percent inthe spine, and study B, 3.5 percent in the wristafter two years. A signicant difference wasfound between the treatment groups and theplacebo groups in both studies. It seems as though Ipriflavone has a direct ability to inhibit the osteoclastic (bone-losing)cell activity, but how it does this is unknown.Although the effects on bone density using Ipri-flavone tend to be small, between 1.15 and 3.7percent, these results provide yet another option for many women who cannot, will not, or do notneed to take stronger, more effective conven-tional treatments. It remains to be seen whetherIpriflavone can have a positive effect on the hip, a far greater concern. Although the effect onthe spine and wrist is encouraging, these smallincreases in bone density do not necessarily meanthere is a reduced fracture rate, the true test of aneffective treatment for the prevention and treat-ment of osteoporosis. One well-publicized study in 2001 was not able to document any benet for Ipriflavone inwomen with signicant bone loss and withosteoporosis. 122It was also noted through blood tests that some of the women taking Ipriflavonedeveloped lower lymphocyte counts. For thisreason, I recommend Ipriflavone only for womenwith mild bone loss or for those who are athigher risk for bone loss, but not for women withsignicant bone loss. I also recommend getting ablood test, a complete blood count (CBC), everysix months to check the lymphocyte counts. In the studies that do show benet, Ipri- flavone was given with a calcium supplement. Ipriflavone 200 mg 3 times per day Herbs in High Mineral Content. Through- out the centuries of traditional herbal medicine,many herbs have been known for their high min-eral content. It is difcult to use herbs as a substi-tute for mineral supplementation because weknow so little about the precise mineral content ofa given herb. However, using these high-mineralherbs to augment mineral supplementation maynot only improve one's mineral but alsooffers Natural or Bio-Identical Progesterone. The term natural progesterone , now more popularly258WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE called bio-identical progesterone , refers to proges- terone made from derivatives found in the Mex-ican wild yam or in soybeans. It is important torealize that commercial bio-identical proges-terone is made in a manufacturing laboratory by extracting either diosgenin from Mexican wildyam or beta-sitosterol from soybeans, then con-verting the natural substance into progesteronethrough various enzymatic and biochemical reac-tions. This progesterone is biochemically identi-cal to the progesterone produced by a woman'sovaries. Because of this, it is called bio-identicalor natural progesterone. This is distinctly differ-ent from synthetic progestational agents, properlycalled progestins , the most common of which is medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Accelerated bone loss has been shown to occur after menopause, but evidence also existsindicating that normal menstruating womenbegin to lose spinal bone prior to meno-pause. 123-127 Evidence also exists that this bone loss prior to menopause is related to progesteronedeciency and that progesterone, like estrogen,plays an important role in bone metabo-lism. 128-130 Dr. Jerilyn Prior postulated a hypo- thetical relationship between phases of the boneremodeling cycle and the normal menstrualcycle. Ovarian steroid levels are low at menstrua-tion, so increased bone resorption occurs at thistime. As estrogen production increases beforeovulation, resorption begins to reverse. Finally,bone remodeling begins as progesterone levelspeak in the mid part of the second half of themenstrual cycle. 131 Dr. Prior and colleagues went on to study 66 premenopausal women over one year.128In these women, 29 percent of all menstrual cycles weredisturbed by a lack of ovulation or short lutealphase (number of days between ovulation andonset of menses), even though nearly all of thesewomen continued to have regular 30-day cycles.These subtle ovulatory disturbances did notresult in any symptoms, but they did correlatewith decreases in spinal bone density. Thewomen with the shortest luteal phases, and there- fore with decreased progesterone production,had the greatest decline in spinal bone density,losing 2 to 4 percent of bone per year. Theseresults have been cited as a strong suggestion thatthe maintenance of peak bone density through-out a woman's adult life requires normal ovarianproduction of progesterone as well as estrogen. Dr. Prior and colleagues also studied the effects of synthetic progestin, medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA, also called Provera),10 mg for 10 days each month, in athleticwomen who had stopped having a menstrualcycle. The regimen led to signicant increases inspinal bone density. 132These studies indicate that progesterone and MPA appear to have osteo-tropic (bone-building) effects. This is some of theresearch that alternative practitioners cite whenmaking a case for administering natural proges-terone for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. An error is often made when practi-tioners assume that administering bio-identicalprogesterone is the same as administering the synthetic analogue MPA, and this often occurswhen advocates of bio-identical progesteroneattempt to make a case for its use in osteoporosismanagement. There is good theoretical evidence from these studies and additional laboratory and animalstudies that the body's progesterone and MPAhave a stimulatory effect on bone formation and reduce bone turnover. What is not clear iswhether giving bio-identical progesterone in apill or cream has similar effects. When it comesto preventing or reversing osteoporosis, no otherproduct has been the subject of as much contro-versy as the use of topically applied bio-identicalprogesterone. A large segment of women seekingalternatives to conventional hormone replace-ment therapy and many alternative practitionershave accepted the premise, most often promotedby the late Dr. John Lee, that topically appliednatural progesterone cream will not only preventosteoporosis but will actually increase bone min-259OSTEOPOROSIS eral density and prevent fractures. In his publica- tions, Dr. Lee had become the strongest advocateof the role of progesterone in preventing andreversing osteoporosis. He asserts that almost allwomen can successfully prevent and reverseosteoporosis and improve their bone density byas much as 15 percent with this cream and thatestrogen replacement therapy is very seldom anecessary component. Although I respect much of the groundbreak- ing work done by Dr. Lee, this particular prem-ise is based almost exclusively on a hypothesisthat lacks adequate scientic evidence. Otherresearchers have investigated the therapeuticeffects of natural progesterone cream, includingits effects on bone in menopausal women. Onerandomized clinical trial compared the effect of atransdermal natural progesterone cream (32 mgdaily) with a placebo cream. Eighty postmeno-pausal women in Australia were randomlyassigned to each group. Women were evaluatedusing the familiar Greene Climacteric Scale andthe Menopause Quality of Life Questionnaire, aswell as blood lipids and bone markers, over 12weeks. 133No detectable change was seen in vaso- motor symptoms, moods, libido, lipids, or meta-bolic markers of bone turnover. There was aslight elevation of blood levels of progesterone.The authors concluded that the use of 32 mg oftransdermal progesterone was not sufcientlyabsorbed into the bloodstream to achieve biolog-ical effects. At least two studies, though, have shown that transdermal natural progesterone of 30 mg perday 134and 40 mg per day135did modestly elevate levels of progesterone in the blood after 15 daysand 42 days respectively. A transdermal cream of 20 mg daily in a randomized clinical trialresulted in statistically signicant improvementin vasomotor symptoms, but no improvement inmood or bone mineral content. 136 T ransdermal progesterone cream for vasomo- tor symptoms does have efcacy, which is dis-cussed in the chapter on menopause (Chapter12). That said, too many women are inappropri- ately selecting natural progesterone cream astheir main and possibly only treatment interven-tion for osteoporosis. A careful process of siftingthrough the benets of alternative and conven-tional medicine and the weaknesses or downsideof any natural or conventional therapy is espe-cially warranted when it comes to osteoporosis. Another way to take bio-identical proges- terone is as oral micronized progesterone (OMP).It is also often used in menopause management, although it has not received the attention andcommercial interests for general consumer usebecause it is available only by prescription.Results from the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions T rial (PEPI) have alsoprovided us with some insight on natural proges-terone and bone density. 137Participants in the placebo group lost an average of 1.8 percent ofspinal bone density and 1.7 percent of hip bonedensity by the 36-month visit, while thoseassigned to one of the four treatment groupsgained bone density at both sites ranging from3.5 to 5.0 percent and a total increase of 1.7 per-cent bone density in the hip. Although thechanges in bone density were signicantly greaterin the treatment groups when compared toplacebo, the results among the treatment groupswere not signicantly different from each other. T reatment groups were either (1) 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) daily alone;(2) 0.625 mg CEE and 10 mg MPA per day for12 days per month; (3) 0.625 mg CEE and 2.5mg MPA daily; or (4) 0.625 mg CEE and 200mg OMP per day for 12 days per month. I ampresenting this in some detail because, in thisstudy, it appears that it was the estrogen therapycomponent that increased bone density and notthe various progestogen regimens, either syn-thetic or natural. So does natural progesterone alone, without estrogen, either topically or orally, have an abilityto increase bone density? From the data we haveso far, I would have to say no, it does not seem260WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE to. Estrogen, not progesterone, is the main hor- mone that provides benets for the bone. Natural or Bio-Identical Estrogens. Natural or bio-identical estrogens are made in the sameway as natural or bio-identical progesterone, except that the end product is either estrone,estradiol, or estriol. Compounded estrone usedby alternative practitioners is the same hormonethat is used in at least two prescription conven-tional estrogens (Ogen and Ortho-est), with the caveat that the prescription drug has llers,binders, preservatives, and/or excipients. Theseare added in order for the particular product to receive a patent; a particular individual mayabsorb and tolerate one form better than another. Bio-identical estrone is also available, by pre- scription, from a compounding pharmacy. Thesepharmacies are able to formulate the dose re-quested by the practitioner and adjust the dosingand the delivery method based on very individualneeds. Bio-identical estrogens are free of unneces-sary llers and available in individualized dosesand delivery forms (capsules, tablets, sublingualtablets, lozenges, creams, gels), an important advantage in using natural estrogens. In addition,estrone can be used either alone or in combina-tion with estradiol and estriol as is appropriate toeach woman and each set of circumstances. Bio-identical estradiol is also available from a compounding pharmacist and also individual-ized by dose and delivery for each woman. Bio-identical estradiol is the same hormone as theestradiol that is used in many conventional pre-scription estrogens (Estrace, Gynediol, and that it isdevoid of the binders, llers, preservatives, andadhesives found product. As estrone, compoundedbio-identical estradiol also carries with it theextra of very individualized dosing,combined options with estriol or estrone, and numerous delivery methods depending onpatient preference or tolerance. Whether it is compounded estrone/estradiol or the commercial pharmaceutical companyform, these forms of estrogen have bone mineraldensity effects similar to those of conventionalconjugated equine estrogens (CEE). A study of32 postmenopausal women compared mgCEE and 5.0 mg MPA with micronized 1.0 mgestradiol (considered to be an equivalent dose to0.625 CEE) and 200 mg OMP , administereddaily and continuously for 13 cycles. 138Lumbar bone density improved by 5 percent in theCEE/MPA group and 3.8 percent in themicronized estradiol/OMP group. Hipbone den-sity improved by 2.6 percent in the CEE/MPAgroup, and 3.1 percent in the micronized estra-diol/OMP group. Statistically, the numbers forthe two groups are considered similar. Low-doseestradiol (0.5 mg), equivalent to 0.3 mg of CEE,has also been shown to be effective in maintain-ing vertebral mass. 139Although the authors of this study were able to show that 0.5 mg of estra-diol effectively preserved spinal bone density,more traditional (1.0 mg) and higher-dose (2.0mg) estradiol actually increased spinal bone massby 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Based on this information, it seems that 0.5 mg estradiol can be used to maintain bone mass,whereas 1.0 mg of micronized 17 beta-estradiolis considered the optimal for enhance-ment of bone mass in postmenopausal women.No signicant differences were seen with usingthe synthetic progestin (MPA) compared withthe natural progesterone (OMP). Even the newlowest dose transdermal patch, Menostar 14 mcgpatch (.014 mg), which delivers one-quarter ofan average dose of estradiol, shows some abilityto slow bone loss, although not to as great adegree as the average-dose patches of .05 mg. Most people have not heard much about estriol, and I discuss it in more detail in Chapter12. The question in this chapter is whether261OSTEOPOROSIS estriol will effectively prevent bone loss. A few studies done in the last couple of years in othercountries have been able to shed some light onthe effects of estriol on bone. Although not allestriol studies have shown positive results withbone mass, several Japanese studies have. Seventy-ve postmenopausal women with bone densitiesat least 10 percent or more below peak bone den-sity were given estriol, 2 mg/day, with 800 mgdaily of calcium lactate. After 50 weeks, an averageincrease in bone mineral density of 1.79 percentwas seen on the routine DXA scan. 140 In another Japanese study, 17 women who were 10 years postmenopause were given estriol,2 mg/day, and 2 g/day of calcium lactate for one year. Another group was given only the calcium lactate. Bone density was signicantlyreduced after one year in the calcium-only group,while the estriol-plus-calcium group had a 1.66percent increase in bone density, using the DXAscan again. 141A third Japanese study compared 50- to 65-year-old women and elderly womenwho received either estriol, 2 mg/day, 1g/day calcium 2 mg/day of estriol alonefor 10 months. 142Increases of about 5 percent in the lumbar spine were seen in both age groups ofwomen who took the estriol and the calcium.Women of both age groups in the calcium-alonegroup had a decrease in bone mineral density ofthe lumbar spine. High doses of estriol, one at 4to 6 mg/day and one as high as 12 mg/day, werestudied in Scotland, but they were not provedprotective against bone loss. 143 As with bio-identical progesterone, studies on estriol also leave us with a lack of sufcient con-rmation about its bone-protective benets. Exercise When bones are stressed by weight, the bone cells (osteocytes) sense it. Osteocytes, in cooper-ation with other bone cells, initiate a cascade ofevents leading to increased bone mass that limitsthe deformation to a predetermined set point(0.1 to 0.5 percent) in any given dimension.When the load on bone exceeds the set point, more bone is deposited than removed. When theload is below the set point, the opposite effecttakes place, and bone is lost. 144, 145 This statement explains why swimming and moderate walking generally do not lead toincreased bone mineral density (BMD), 146but weight lifting,147-149 jogging/running,150gym- nastics,151, 152 and certain sports like basketball do. The set point theory of bone mass increase inresponse to strain also explains why a few studies showed no effect 153or a negative effect154of exer- cise on BMD\u2014a load below the set point fails totrigger a response. Regular physical exercise of appropriate intensity and duration that overloads the skeletalsystem above its set point increases BMD inwomen of all ages within the limits set by hered-itary factors, nutrition, and the hormonal statusof the individual. In children and adolescents; 155 in college-age women;156, 157 in women in their 40s; and in young,158, 159 older,160, 161 and very old162postmenopausal women, exercise has been shown to be essential to the development andmaintenance of bone health. In sedentary women, trabecular bone loss begins to occur in the third decade of life andcortical bone loss in the sixth. 163, 164 The 35 to 45 percent reduction in muscle strength observed inwomen at 80 years of age parallels the observedbone loss at that same age. 165Conversely, the age-related loss of bone parallels decreased phys-ical activity. 166Moreover, women who exercise retain bone mass throughout life,167achieve greater peak bone mass that contributes to theconsolidation and strength of bone following theend of linear growth, 168and have signicantly lower risk of fractures in later life.154, 169 Furthermore, Recker and associates demon- strated that, independent of calcium intake ororal contraceptive use, the more college-agewomen exercised, the greater BMD theyachieved. These increases were highly signicantdespite relatively small increments in exercise. A262WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE 1996 review of the literature on peak bone mass and exercise conrms these results and adds thatexercise can maintain normal bones sufcientlystrong until very old age and can strengthenweak bones when used in concert with adequatenutrition. 170The author of this review con- cludes\u2014as is the case in many studies\u2014that evensmall increases in initial bone mass grow to a sub-stantial difference if the increased bone mass ismaintained by a lifetime of regular exercise. Exercises that involve weight training can increase the mass of bones if the exercise alsoincreases muscle mass and muscle strength. Women who are in the early postmenopausal years can achieve small but statistically signicantbenets on bone mass from strength training. 171 A meta-analysis found that women who exer-cised could increase their spinal BMD byapproximately 2 percent. 172Menopausal women who use estrogen along with weight training havebetter BMD increases than do women who useestrogen alone. 173 Strength or weight training can be done as little as twice a week to achieve these benets and can bedone on very inexpensive home equipment thatincludes as little as a chair, a bench, and some handweights. One word of caution is for women whoalready have osteoporosis. Heavy weight-bearingexercises and vigorous stretching and lifting can beenough to trigger a fracture of the spine. One of the more important aspects of physi- cal activity, especially in women who are 75 andolder, is its role in reducing the risk of falls.Muscle strengthening and exercises to improvebalance have been shown to reduce the risk offalls and related injuries by 75 percent. 174Exercise Recommendations If you are not already exercising regularly, consult with your licensed health-care professional in cooper- ation with a qualied exercise expert. Together with them establish: A schedule of exercise The types, intensity, and duration of exercise Consider the following guidelines: Begin slowly. Increase intensity very gradually. Train with weights for six weeks before intro- ducing intensive aerobic exercise (such as run- ning or speed walking) into your program. Begin each exercise session with joint warming exercises (see Appendix A) for 5 minutes. End each exercise session with 5 to 10 minutes of stretching exercises. Use caution and moderation throughout your lifetime of exercise.Therapeutic Scheme for Management of Osteoporosis Determine risk for osteoporosis: mild, moderate, or severe. Be aware of seven levels of intervention that cover the majority of clinical situations: Level 1: Diet, exercise, lifestyle, and stress management Level 2: Nutritional supplementation Level 3: Botanicals Level 4: Compounded bio-identical hormones Level 5: Pharmaceutical company bio- identical hormones (Use with oralmicronized progesterone if uterus is still intact.) Level 6: Synthetic and semisynthetic non- bio-identical hormones in cases thatdo not respond to other medicines(Use with oral micronized proges-terone if uterus is still intact.) Level 7: Prescription bone-specic medications Recommendations according to risk: Level Mild Moderate Severe 1. X X X 2. X X X3. X 4. X X 5. X X6. X X 7. X X263OSTEOPOROSIS Exercise throughout life is as critical as a life- time of adequate nutrition. The important ques-tion for doctors is not to help their femalepatients of any age decide whether or not to exer-cise. It is rather to study ways to personalize theexercise prescription and motivate the patient tobegin and continue exercising for life. Numerous books are now available that pro- vide an excellent introduction to your lifetime of exercise. Use simple low-impact exercises andstretching for two or three months before youbranch out into the more comprehensive exercise program described in Appendix A. If you are already exercising regularly, con- sider introducing into your program: Variations of speed in your aerobic exercises Different exercise positions, particularly in weight training, that challenge your bonesfrom different angles Alternating practicing sports such as basket- ball, volleyball, tennis, and so on with a reg-ular exercise routineSample Treatment Plan for Osteoporosis Prevention See the conventional medicine section if you have a diagnosis of borderline osteoporosis or osteoporosis or have already had a fracture postmenopause. The dietary and nutritional supplement recommendationsshould then be used in combination with conven- tional therapy. If you do not want to take or are not able to take hormone therapy or conventional osteoporosis-specic medications despite a diagnosis of osteoporosis, this sample treatment plan may not be adequate to prevent bone loss or reduce the riskof fracture. Continue to see a licensed health-carepractitioner and monitor bone density. Dietary Recommendations Soy foods: 1 to 2 servings per day Dark leafy greens: 1 to 3 servings per day Low-fat dairy, especially low-fat cultured yogurt: 1 serving per day Decrease animal meats (except for sh) and substitute vegetarian choices, but with ade- quate vegetarian and/or sh protein Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and sugar Regular Exercise Weight-bearing and aerobic exercise 150 min- utes per week Weight training twice per week Most important, keep nding ways to motivate yourself: Be moderate\u2014avoid burnout. Form a circle of friends who also love to exercise.Nutritional Supplementation Calcium: 1,200-1,500 mg per day Magnesium: 400-750 mg per day Vitamin D: 400-800 IU per day minimum for women 51 to 70 and 800 IU per day forwomen over 70; consider even higher amounts of 1,000-2,000 IU if you have been tested and have a vitamin D deciency Trace minerals: boron (3 mg), zinc (15 mg), chromium (100 mcg), manganese (15 mg), andcopper (1.5 mg) Other nutritional cofactors such as vitamin K 2, 45 mg per day Essential fatty acid supplement: 2-4 g sh oil or 4 g sh oil/evening primrose oil per day Women at low risk: recommended diet, regular weight-bearing exercise, nutritional supple- mentation, no hormone therapy necessary Women at medium risk: recommended diet, daily weight-bearing exercise, nutritional sup- plementation, or estriol, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone; dose equivalent to 0.3 mg or 0.625 mg Premarin, depending onindividual\u2014see Appendix C), or conventional HRT or bone-specic medications Women at high risk: recommended diet, daily weight-bearing exercise, nutritional supplemen-tation, conventional estradiol (1 mg per day) and oral micronized progesterone (200 mg per day for 12 days per month or 100 mg daily), orconventional HRT or bone-specic medications264WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Once the diagnosis of osteoporosis has been made, the most frequently instituted medicationsare the bisphosphonates, nonhormonal in-hibitors of bone resorption that act by decreasingosteoclast activity (the cells that destroy bone).These drugs have very poor gastrointestinal ab-sorption and can cause esophageal ulcers, gastriculcers, and possibly gastrointestinal bleeding.The instructions for the use of these medicationsare very specic: the patient should take the med-ication immediately upon awakening and withan empty stomach, following the ingestion of themedication with a full glass of water. It is impor-tant that she remain upright for 30 to 45 minutesto prevent reflux and medication problems in theesophagus. Initially, these medications were useddaily, and patient compliance was quite poor;being able to take these medications weekly ormonthly has been one of the biggest advances inbisphosphonate therapy. The medications that are most commonly used these days are alendronate (Fosamax), a 70-mg tablet once weekly for treatment or a 35-mgtablet once weekly for prevention in patients whoare at very high risk for osteoporosis and haverapid bone loss but have not actually been diag-nosed as having osteoporosis yet. The next inorder of frequency of use is risedronate (Actonel),a 35-mg tablet once weekly. The newest is iban-dronate (Boniva), which is a 150-mg pill oncemonthly. There are intravenous forms of bispho-sphonates that can be used on a quarterly basis,but because of their cost and the need for IVadministration, they are not frequently used. Concerns have been raised about bisphospho- nates causing osteonecrosis of the jaw. While aserious problem, it is incredibly rare. Approxi-mately 150 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw asso-ciated with bisphosphonate therapy have nowbeen reported. Most of these patients, but not all,have received intravenous therapy, have malignan-cies, and have had dental intervention. Dental implant failures have also been seen in patientsreceiving oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. Itcould be, especially in those patients who have suf-fered necrosis after dental procedures, that there iscompromised postoperative healing of the bonedue to the inhibition of bone turnover caused bythe bisphosphonate. A nonhealing wound couldthen lead to osteomyelitis, and then necrosis.Another mechanism may be that the bisphospho-nates are decreasing the levels of vascular endothe-lial growth factor. Assuring dental health anddental status may be smart preventive advice priorto even oral bisphosphonate therapy, especially inthose patients who have metastatic cancer, forwhom oral or IV bisphosphonate therapy mayslow their disease progression in the bones. Estrogen and/or progestin therapy works in the same manner by decreasing the activity of thecells (osteoclasts) that remove bone. Hormonetherapy was a mainstay for more than 40 yearsfor prevention of bone loss, treatment of osteo-porosis, and reduction of fracture risk. In theaftermath of the Women's Health Initiative studyin 2002, more women have changed to bisphos-phonate use due to fears about hormone therapy.Currently, however, hormone therapy is FDA-approved for treatment of osteoporosis in womenwho do not tolerate the bisphosphonates, such aswomen who have had esophagitis, gastric ulcers,or GI bleeds and women whose bone densitydoesn't improve on bisphosphonates. Somewomen are changed to a selective estrogen recep-tor modulator (SERM) also. None of these agents will work optimally without the presence of an adequate amount ofcalcium, and in order to absorb the calcium, oneneeds an adequate amount of vitamin D. Newstudies suggest that 400 units of vitamin D dailyare not adequate for calcium absorption and that800 to 1,000 units per day may be more effec-tive. Vitamin D deciency is a leading cause ofosteoporosis. When women present with post-menopausal osteoporosis, it is assumed that it is265OSTEOPOROSIS related to being female and postmenopausal with low estrogen, but it is also important, as discussedearlier, to rule out other causes of osteoporosissuch as parathyroid hormone problems, concomi-tant steroid use, and vitamin D deciency. Calcium is also very important, and many women do not tolerate the most common andleast expensive form of calcium, calcium carbon-ate. All calciums appear to be absorbed equallywell when taken with food and in the presence ofvitamin D, but calcium carbonate seems to createmore gastrointestinal symptoms. When bloating,constipation, diarrhea, or gas is present, the cit-rate variety is frequently substituted. The recom-mended daily dosage of calcium between diet andsupplements remains 1,000 mg in women under50 and 1,200 to 1,500 mg in women over 50. Androgens have had renewed interest as a therapy for osteoporosis. Tibolone, an anabolicsteroid, has been used in many years in Europefor treatment of osteoporosis and is being studiedin the United States. There is concern abouteffects on lipids and the endometrium, as well asbasic side-effect proles that present with andro-gens, such as acne, facial hair growth, and bodyhair loss. Typically, androgens are not recom-mended for osteoporosis treatment. Calcitonin is a less well-known medication that is primarily used for vertebral compressionfracture pain. It is a peptide that inhibits bone resorption and causes a modest increase in verte-bral bone. Calcitonin does not seem to have anysignicant effect on trabecular bone. Initially, itwas very difcult to obtain, but recombinantDNA production of the medication has increasedits availability. It is an intranasal medication usedonce daily, but its ability to treat general skeletalosteoporosis is limited. It has a very signicanteffect, however, on pain improvement in vertebralcompression fractures. SERMs are selective estrogen receptor modu- lators. They have estrogen-like effects in selecttissues while not actually being estrogen. Theyare called selective receptor modulators becausethey have a proestrogen effect on certain tissues such as bone and endometrium and an anti-estrogen effect on other tissues such as breasttissue. Clomiphene citrate used for infertility isessentially a SERM. probably themost widely recommended SERM. It has beenused for many years in breast cancer treatment. Itimproves skeletal bone density in the same waythat estrogen works, by decreasing osteoclastactivity, but it does have a signicant stimulatoryeffect on endometrium and has increasedendometrial cancer in patients. The third and currently recommended osteo- porosis treatment SERM is raloxifene (Evista). Itdiffers it no activity onthe endometrium. It stimulates bone growth byreducing the activity of the osteoclasts and reducesserum lipids just like estrogen, but it does notstimulate the endometrium or the breast and hasactually been shown in several studies to reducelifetime risk of breast cancer by 50 to 74 percent.The side effects of raloxifene are vasomotor symp-toms, unexplained leg cramps, and a risk of deepvein thrombosis (DVT) approximately equal tothat of estrogen. The newest, but very limited, drug for osteo- porosis treatment is parathyroid hormone. It iscalled teriparatide (Forteo), it actually stim-ulates osteoblast activity, the cells that buildbone. Its effect on the bone is uniquely differentfrom any of the other medications. It is a dailysubcutaneous injectable medication that is mod-erately expensive and used for severe osteoporosisin patients who are not responding to the othermedications or are having a lot of fractures. Themain side effects are dizziness, nausea, jointaches, and leg cramps. For perimenopausal and young postmeno- pausal women with osteopenia and a T-score notworse than /H110022.0, I would consider the use of any of these conventional approaches overtreatment.Other prevention strategies include dietaryadvice, exercise including strength training, vita-min D, calcium, trace minerals and nutrients,266WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE and low alcohol intake. The practitioner should monitor the bone density over time. For womenof this age who actually have osteoporosis, bis-phosphonates may be a good choice. Calciumand vitamin D have important but modest ben-ets in women who already have osteoporosis. Older postmenopausal women (over 65) who have either signicant osteopenia or osteoporosisare more certain candidates for bisphosphonatesand other conventional treatments, which areproven to reduce the risk of fracture by 50 percent.Hopefully, research will determine the shortestamount of time that is necessary to be treated andthe lowest dose that is required to achieve this sig-nicant benet, which is not currently known forsome of these medications. Fortunately, there is norapid bone loss after discontinuing bisphosphonatetreatment, compared to the rapid loss that doesoccur after discontinuation of estrogen. Also in time, research on natural medicines can be expanded to include the role of nutrientsnot only in bone density, but in bone strength andbone architecture. Some of these areas could bethe use of signicantly higher doses of vitamin D,as well as red clover isoflavones, soy isoflavones,manganese, boron, sh oils, and more. In this way,natural therapies could play an increasinglyimportant role in slowing bone loss and reducingfracture rates. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Osteoporosis is one of the most important age- associated disorders and should be considered apotentially disabling disease that warrants sub-stantial preventive efforts and management inter-ventions. Early identication of risk factors forosteoporosis, prevention strategies, vitamin Dstatus, and assessment of calcium metabolism and bone density provide the basis for determin-ing what is appropriate for each woman. Alicensed health-care practitioner who is educatedabout when to rule out secondary causes of boneloss and the importance of early identication,prevention, and treatment, and who is also awareof the spectrum of alternative and conventionaloptions, is especially crucial for women who areat higher risk or who already have osteoporosis.Your family physician, internist, or endocrinolo-gist is probably the cornerstone for medical ther-apy. Some gynecologists can provide advice andtreatment as well. Some licensed alternative prac-titioners may have expertise in osteoporosis man-agement as well. Many physicians do not even discuss osteo- porosis, and you may have to insist on a DXA scanto measure bone density. An ultrasound test of theheel, which is much less expensive, may be a help-ful screening test for some women. There is someevidence that a heel test is 85 to 90 percent accu-rate compared with the bone density of the hip ona DXA scan. Many insurance companies do notcover routine osteoporosis screening for womenunder 65 unless they have signicant risk factors,but if you have a heel test that shows your bonedensity is below normal, this can be the stimulusfor obtaining a DXA scan. Some practitioners rec-ommend screening women with heel ultrasounds,but by and large the heel test is not yet consideredan accurate test to replace DXA scans for eitherearly detection or monitoring. The more risk factors you have for osteoporo- sis, the greater the need to have laboratory andbone density testing. Women are especiallyencouraged to seek a licensed health-care practi-tioner who is well educated in the diagnosis andmanagement of osteoporosis.267OVERVIEW Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) includes a spectrum of infections of the upper genital tract.These include endometritis (infection of thelining of the uterus), salpingitis (infection of thefallopian tubes), tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvicperitonitis (infection of the serous membranelining the abdominal and pelvic walls). Morethan one million women in the United Statesdevelop PID each year, and one-fourth of themrequire hospitalization. The infection typically results from the spread of microorganisms that ascend from the endo-cervix (the canal leading from the cervix into theuterus) to the upper genital organs. The mostcommon organisms are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis . Chlamydia causes 50 percent of PID in Europe and 20 to 30 per-cent of cases in the United States, though the realincidence may be even higher. Gonorrhea remainsthe single most frequent cause in the UnitedStates. Additional organisms implicated in to the many organ-isms involved. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) producesenzymes that dissolve cervical mucous, and there-fore if you have BV, there is an increased risk ofendometritis (PID in the uterus), and womenwith the highest bacterial loads have increasedrisk of PID of at least twofold. The problems associated with PID involve its ability to ascend from the lower to the uppergenital tract. How it ascends is not exactly clear.Uterine contractions may be responsible, andeven sperm may play a role in enhancing thespread of the organisms. Another possibility isthat the bacteria may be transferred into the fallopian tube due to the common occurrence ofretrograde menstruation. The pathogenic organ-isms may spread along with the blood, contribut-ing to PID. Once the pathogen ascends to the uterus or fallopian tubes, it adheres to mucus-secretingcells and then invades just below the epithelialsurface (the surface of the tissue lining the fallop-ian tubes). An acute inflammatory responseoccurs, causing cell death and tissue damage, andcan result in scarring and tubal adhesions. One in four women diagnosed with PID may develop complications, including ectopic preg-nancy, infertility, recurrent pelvic pain, andrecurrent PID. It is important to recognize thepossibility of PID because of its potential fordeveloping into a lethal condition, a more com-plicated condition, or a condition with long-term consequences. It is also important to bealert to possible surgical emergencies. SometimesPID can be elusive, and there is little clinical evi-dence to support a suspicion of PID, especiallywhen the symptoms are mild and insidious. Theclassic symptoms of lower abdominal pain andtenderness with examination or motion of thecervix occurs in only 20 to 25 percent of patients.A much more common presentation is often amild or subtle pelvic pain. Some women withPID will have discomfort with urination and urinary frequency as well as other urinary tractsymptoms. An increased number of risk factorsfor PID increases the suspicion. These mayinclude the following: Age 14 to 24 Heterosexual and sexually active 15PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASECHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 268WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Multiple heterosexual sex partners New heterosexual sex partner Low socioeconomic status History of sexually transmitted disease History of PID Oral contraceptive users have increased risk of acquiring gonorrhea or chlamydia ifexposed but a decreased risk of upper tractinfection Use of IUD for contraception Never having been pregnant Cigarette, alcohol, or illicit drug use Any instrumentation of the uterus\u2014such as a uterine biopsy, diagnostic scope, or surgi-cal abortion Pelvic or bowel surgery Adolescents and young single heterosexual adults have the highest incidence of gonorrhea.This organism is believed to be the cause in 33 to80 percent of the PID cases, although mixed gon-orrhea and chlamydial infections occur frequently.About 15 percent of endocervical gonorrhea infec-tions result in PID. A diagnosis of PID in childrenwarrants an evaluation for child abuse. PID symptoms more often occur during or within one week of menses because the openingof the cervix is wider due to menstruation.Microorganisms can then more easily ascend intothe upper genital region and use the flow ofblood as nutrition for their growth. Women with new heterosexual partners within the last 30 to 60 days or multiple sex partners aremore likely to develop PID. If a woman's partneris not monogamous, then she is also at increasedrisk. A history of a sexually transmitted infection(STI) increases the likelihood of contracting sub-sequent STIs, as does a history of PID. Barrier contraceptive methods such as con- doms, diaphragms, and cervical caps (FemCap)reduce the risk of STIs, PID, and infertility. 1 Their protective benet comes from decreasingthe risk of acquiring a STI. In addition, thecondom may decrease the risk for developingPID by eliminating the sperm as the method in which the STI can ascend. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are associated with an increased risk of PID, particularly in therst four months after insertion, but then riskreturns to normal at ve months. 2The thinking is that microorganisms in the vagina and cervixare introduced into the uterus during the IUDinsertion. The incidence of PID in IUD users istwo to nine times that of nonusers in most pop-ulations of women studied. 1If a woman with suspected PID has an IUD, it must be removed.Oral contraceptives (OCs) have both a positiveand a negative effect on the risk of PID. They canincrease the risk of chlamydia infecting the cervix(mucopurulent cervicitis), but they are also asso-ciated with a decreased risk of symptomatic PID.It is thought that the progestin component in theOCs causes the cervical mucus to become thickerand the STI cannot penetrate this. OCs alsodecrease the heaviness of the menstrual flow, andthis decreased blood may result in less retrogrademenstrual flow, making it harder for the bacteriato ascend and cause PID. If a woman using oral contraceptives does acquire PID, it is oftenmilder or possibly even asymptomatic. 3 Use of illicit drugs (especially crack cocaine), alcohol, or cigarettes has been associated with anincreased risk of STDs and PID. Substance abusealso increases the potential for HIV infection.Women with HIV are far more likely to have PID. Vaginal douching may be associated with PID and even ectopic pregnancy. In several studies,women with PID are more likely to use douchingthan women without PID. One study found thatdouching within the previous two months wasassociated with a 70 percent increase in PID. 4 Diagnosis of PID starts with a combination of a good medical history and physical exam. Themedical history should include a thorough sexualhistory. Symptoms include but are not limited tovaginal discharge, fever, chills, urinary symp-toms, heavy menstrual bleeding, intermenstrualbleeding, and lower abdominal/pelvic pain. A269PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE physical exam includes taking the temperature; a pelvic and abdominal exam with any tendernessof the uterus, fallopian tubes, or cervix serving asa red flag; observing the cervix and looking forredness, swelling, and friability (easy bleeding) ofthe cervix; and evaluating genital tract secretions,particularly for mucopurulent (green or yellow)discharge. The vaginal secretions should be evaluated for the presence of white blood cells during micro-scopy. Laboratory testing includes cervical samplesforNeisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) mass; andacute and/or chronic endometritis on endometrialbiopsy. The gold standard in diagnosing PID is alaparoscopy. During this surgical procedure, thesurgeon looks for swelling of fallopian tubes,tubal adhesions, (redness), tubalpurulent or tubo-ovarianmass. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Gonorrhea is a reportable disease. This means that a practitioner must call the public healthdepartment and report the disease if this organ- ism has been cultured. Due to the potential com-plications and seriousness of PID, in concertwith a lack of proven therapeutic results in usingnatural treatments for this disorder, alternativetherapies should be seen as secondary to conven-tional treatment. Women who suffer from PIDand have strong opinions about not being treatedwith antibiotics should be fully educated andinformed so that their decision to decline antibi-otic therapy can be fully considered. A shortcourse of antibiotic therapy is rarely detrimentalto one's health. In this case, the benet of thetherapy far outweighs the risk of its use. Like-wise, alternative practitioners should understandthat the integration of antibiotic therapy for thebenet of the patient is not a failure of naturalmedicine. There are old texts that make referenceto treating PID with natural therapies, but theylack modern methods of evaluation and follow-up. It could be that botanicals used in India,China, or elsewhere have a tradition substanti-ated by modern conrmation testing, but I amnot aware of any conrmed treatments. Using alternative therapies to support the immune system, assist in managing pain and PREVENTION Use barrier methods of contraception. Avoid illicit drugs and cigarettes, and limit alcohol. Treat previous STIs with appropriate therapy and be certain of resolution. Avoid douching. (It is possible that douching will cause a vaginal infection of GC, CT, or BV toascend into the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes.) Know the sexual history of your partner. Heterosexual women who have multiple partners and do not use condoms, cervical caps, or diaphragms are at higher risk for PID. Women with HIV are at even higher risk and need to practice even greater caution.KEY CONCEPTS Acute or chronic pelvic pain warrants a visit to a qualied licensed health-care practitioner for diagnosis. PID must be differentiated from other causes of pelvic and abdominal pain. PID should be treated primarily with antibiotic therapy, while alternative medicine can offersupportive and adjunct therapies to conven- tional treatment. Seek prompt medical attention if you have the symptoms described in this chapter or suspect you have PID. The sex partner must also be evaluated and treated. Reinfection will almost certainly occur if the sex partner is not treated.270WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE discomfort, reduce inflammation, and counter- act some of the side effects of the antibiotics arethe main priorities. Drinking plenty of water,getting rest, eating simple light foods, and avoid-ing stimulants are basic guidelines during anyacute infection, including pelvic infections. General immune support to complement conventional antibiotic treatment is just goodplain common sense. Nutritional and botanicalsupport can stimulate white blood cells thatengulf and destroy bacteria. Herbs and nutrientscan enhance the function of T cells, B cells, andnatural killer cells that support the immunesystem's response to infection. Vitamin A, vita-min C, the carotenes, vitamin E, zinc, and the Bvitamins all play an important role in immuneenhancement. Increasing antibody response,stimulating helper T cells, enhancing whiteblood cell response and function, and directlykilling the virus or bacteria are just some of theways in which these supplements can be helpfulduring an infection of any kind. Many herbs have also been shown to have antimicrobial and immunostimulating effects. Allicin extracts from garlic may hold the mostpromise for inhibiting bacterial infections. Gold-enseal and Oregon grape root also have the abilityto inhibit the overgrowth of numerous organisms,although this does not include BV and CT. Themost commonly used herb for immune support is echinacea. Echinacea can increase the produc-tion of T cells, stimulate the white blood cells thatengulf and destroy bacteria, stimulate naturalkiller cell activity, and increase the number of circulating white blood cells in order to deal withthe infection. 5The end result is a strengthened immune system. Curcumin is one of the bestherbs to reduce inflammation. The best complement to counteract the side effects of antibiotic use is to add or increase theintake of Lactobacillus acidophilus to help prevent a vaginal yeast infection. This can be accom-plished by eating yogurt daily or by taking oralcapsules of Lactobacillus acidophilus . Four toeight ounces of unsweetened acidophilus yogurt or at least three capsules of Lactobacillus aci- dophilus daily for two weeks may be able to pre- vent the overgrowth of vaginal yeast that oftenoccurs when taking antibiotics. Additionaldietary advice, plus botanical and nutritionaltherapies for the prevention and treatment ofyeast vaginitis, is discussed in Chapter 20. Ice packs over the pelvic region can reduce inflammation and pain in cases of acute PID.Cold or ice packs placed over the region of theuterus while putting the feet in a tub of hot watercan further assist in reducing the inflammation,congestion, and pain in the pelvic area. Alternat-ing hot and cold sitz baths can also be used toimprove circulation in the pelvic area andimprove the healing time from the infection.This is done by sitting in a bath of hot water,with the water level just above the waist, for threeminutes, followed by sitting in a small secondportable metal or plastic tub of ice cold water forSample Adjunct Treatment Plan for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease This plan should be used as a complement to antibi- otic therapy. Eat a light diet during acute infection: veg- etable broths, steamed vegetables, salads, and fruits Acidophilus yogurt: 4-8 oz per day as a pre- ventive of yeast vaginitis Vitamin E: 400 units twice daily Vitamin C: 1,000-2,000 mg 3 times daily Vitamin A: 25,000 units per day and up to 50,000 units for a maximum of 2 weeks Zinc: 45-60 mg per day Ice pack over the uterus with a hot footbath Echinacea: 12tsp liquid extract or 2 cap- sules/tablets every 3 hours during course of infection High-dose allicin extract: 2 capsules 4 times daily for the rst 3-6 days, then 2 capsules twice daily for 1 week, and then 2 capsules daily until infection is gone271PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE one minute. This procedure is repeated three times in succession, once or twice daily through-out the course of the pain and infection. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Conventional practitioners rely on their judg- ment in assessing the severity of the disease andthe ability of the patient to carry out the treat-ment successfully. It is essential for the practi-tioner to educate the patient about the exacttreatment regimen. If she is able to comply withthe recommendations, she may be a candidatefor outpatient treatment. Infertility may be moresuccessfully prevented by prompt administrationof IV (intravenous) antibiotics, even if thewoman is not acutely ill. In the case of outpatienttreatment, once antibiotics are administered, the patient must have a follow-up visit within 72hours. With the advent of home IV therapy,sometimes IV antibiotic treatment can bereceived at home. PID therapy must provide broad-spectrum coverage of the most likely offending organisms.Although several antimicrobial regimens havebeen effective in achieving cure in randomizedclinical trials, few studies have been done toassess and compare elimination of infection ofthe lining of the uterus and the fallopian tubes orthe incidence of long-term complications such asinfertility and ectopic pregnancy. No singleantibiotic regimen has been established. Health-care providers select treatment regimens based on drug availability, cost, the patient's toleranceof the drug, and other individuating factors.Most practitioners follow the Centers for DiseaseControl treatment guidelines, which wereupdated in 2006: Regimen A Levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily for 14 days) or Ofloxacin (400 mg orally once daily for 14 days)Regimen B Ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose) plus doxycycline (100 mg orallytwice a day for 14 days) or Cefoxitin (2 g intramuscularly in a single dose) plus probenecid (1 g orally adminis-tered concurrently in a single dose) plusdoxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for14 days) or Another parenteral third-generation cepha- losporin or cefo-taxime) plus doxycycline (100 mg orallytwice a day for 14 days) These regimens can be used with or without metronidazole (500 mg orally twice a day for 14days). The addition of metronidazole should beconsidered, as anaerobic organisms are suspectedin the majority of PID cases. Metronidazole willalso treat bacterial vaginosis, which is frequentlyassociated with PID and/or follows antibiotictherapy. It is important to realize how critical it is to follow the practitioner's directions and to com-plete the drug regimen as prescribed on the bottle.There may be side effects about which the patientshould be informed to improve compliance. There are certain criteria for hospitalization of a woman with PID that include but are notlimited to: Concern about the ability of the patient to comply with treatment and to follow up A fever greater than 101 degrees Signs of an acute abdomen (acute onset of abdominal pain/tenderness/bloating, nausea,vomiting) Lack of improvement within 72 hours If hospitalization occurs, a more complex regi- men is administered with several combinationsof IV antibiotics. After the patient leaves the hos-pital, two weeks of doxycycline is given. Intravenous treatment recommendations of PID are as follows:272WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Levofloxacin (500 mg IV once daily) with or without metronidazole (500 mg IV every 8hours) or Ofloxacin (400 mg IV every 12 hours) with or without metronidazole (500 mg IV every8 hours) or Ampicillin/sulbactam (3 g IV every 6 hours) plus doxycycline (100 mg orally or IV every12 hours) These medications are used in the hospital until the patient's fever has been absent for one or twodays, her pelvic pain has dramatically reduced,she is taking oral food and able to get up and outof bed and take care of herself, and any of theother criteria that a physician chooses to releasethe patient from the hospital. T reatment of a tubal ovarian abscess, which is a common complication of PID, is more com-plex. If the patient has a fever, with an acuteabdomen, the rst line of treatment is surgicaldrainage of the tubal ovarian abscess followed bymultiple IV antibiotics. Sometimes, if a patienthas minimal tenderness, does not have a fever,and is a good candidate for outpatient therapy,she can be given oral medications for two tothree weeks and followed in the ofce. T reatment of PID should eliminate signs and symptoms of the infection and eradicate themicroorganisms while minimizing the damage tothe fallopian tubes as well as long-term complica-tions. Follow-up for outpatient treatment is crit-ical within 72 hours to assure that the patient istaking the medicine accurately and to evaluatethe effectiveness of the treatment. Pregnant women with suspected PID should be seen immediately and have an ectopic preg-nancy ruled out. PID in pregnancy is uncom-mon and is more likely to occur when HIV ispresent. Hospitalization and IV antimicrobialtherapy are recommended. Conventional practitioners take great care in educating the patient about the disease; the im-portance of treatment; the possible consequences;the importance of treating her male partners, if applicable; and the importance of barrier contra-ceptives and other methods to reduce the risk ofSTIs. To a patient not accustomed to dealing withsevere infections and the need for antibiotics,some practitioners may seem overly aggressive intheir recommendations and insistence. Althoughthis may offend some women, it is important thatthey do not let a less-than-optimal bedside styledistract their attention from the value of whatphysicians know and have to offer. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Women with pelvic pain need to consider not only PID but also other conditions that canoccur with similar discomfort. Ectopic the gallblad-der), cystitis (inflammation of the bladder),diverticulitis (inflammation of a small pouchalong the border of the colon), hepatitis, and atwisted fallopian tube are among the otherpotentially serious disorders that require differen-tiation from PID. Women with PID typically describe pain that is sharp, localized, and on both sides of the body.They may also have an oral temperature above101 degrees. Ectopic pregnancy typically pres-ents with one-sided pain but no fever. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor immediately. A licensed health-care practitioner(naturopathic doctor, medical doctor, osteopathicdoctor, nurse-practitioner, or physician's assistant)will proceed with a history, physical examination,and diagnostic testing, including blood work, cul-tures, and possible pelvic ultrasound. An abdomi-nal exam will be done to check for pain in variouslocations. A pelvic exam will check the externalgenital region; a speculum exam will check forinflammation and discharge. A thick, transparent,yellow, gray, or brown discharge coming through273PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE the cervix suggests a chlamydial or gonococcal infection. An internal exam will check for anenlarged uterus or pain and tenderness. Culturesfor the infectious agents require two to three daysto process and are important in conrming a diag-nosis, but severe symptoms and the potentiallyserious consequences of acute PID require imme-diate treatment even if conrmation has not yetbeen obtained. Since more than one organism can cause PID, a negative culture result can be misleading. Newerand more accurate tests using antigen detectionmethods or fluorescence antibody marker tech-niques are available for the rapid detection ofchlamydial infection. They can be especially usefulin detecting mild cases or cases that have no symp-toms. Pelvic ultrasound examinations are per-formed when a pelvic mass or abscess is suspected.They may be able to reveal a cyst, an ectopic preg- nancy, an abscess, or an enlarged tube. Laparoscopy is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing PID. Because diagnosticlaparoscopy is expensive and invasive, requiresspecial training, and may not affect the decisionto treat the patient for pelvic infection, it is notroutinely used in the emergency management ofpatients with PID. A procedure called culdocen-tesis aspirates fluid that has collected behind theuterus. It is rarely used unless the diagnosis isuncertain or a complication is suspected. Thepresence of blood in the fluid sample suggests anectopic pregnancy or a ruptured ovarian cyst.Cloudy or purulent fluid suggests an infection,and the fluid is then tested with cultures for PID. About 25 percent of women with PID will require hospitalization. Criteria for hospitaliza-tion have been established by the CDC. If yourpractitioner recommends that you be admittedto the hospital, I would urge you to entrust your-self to his or her care. You can always use naturaltherapies to augment the treatment. The CDCcriteria for hospitalization include: Adolescent patient A surgical abdomen, a serious condition characterized by sudden onset of abdominal/pelvic pain, tenderness, and muscular rigid-ity (possibility of appendicitis) HIV infection The diagnosis of PID is uncertain The patient has not responded to outpatient treatment The patient has not been able to tolerate or follow the outpatient regimen A surgical emergency is possible Pregnancy The patient has a septic appearance (fever, chills, shaking, or other flu-like symptoms) Severe illness or nausea and vomiting Suspected pelvic abscessDiagnostic Criteria for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease All three criteria must be present for a clinical diag- nosis (without the use of tests) of PID: Lower abdominal tenderness Bilateral adnexal tenderness Cervical motion tenderness Additional criteria useful in diagnosis: Oral temperature greater than 101 \u00b0F Mucopurulent cervical or vaginal discharge Palpable pelvic mass Elevated sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein\u2014both markers of inflammation White blood cell count greater than 10,000 Evidence of cervical infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae orChlamydia trachomatis Tubo-ovarian abscess or fluid-lled and/or chronic endometritis on endome- trial biopsy Laparoscopic abnormalities consistent with PIDThis page intentionally left blank 275OVERVIEW All women want to do everything they possibly can to optimize the health and well-being ofthemselves and their children. There is no othercondition that inspires women to care for them-selves as well as pregnancy. That said, MotherNature's talent in producing healthy babies isawesome indeed, and no matter the range ofone's individual decisions regarding optimalhealth care, most babies arrive intact and healthy.Women who receive prenatal care enjoy thelowest risk of maternal and infant mortality inhistory. It is important to recognize those things we have control over and those we don't. Whilewomen should do their best to take excellent careof themselves during pregnancy, they must notassume personal responsibility for vagaries ofbiology like miscarriages and rare abnormalities.Ninety-eight percent or more of babies are bornhealthy. Keep that number in mind as you readthrough this information. Remember that fetusesare strong little creatures. They pull what theyneed from our bodies pretty effectively. It is thewoman carrying the child, in all but extremecases, who suffers from any deciencies in nutri-tion or health\u2014the fetus gets preferential treat-ment. Welcome to motherhood! Pregnancy and birthing are normal physio- logical processes that can be positively supportedthrough adequate rest, preventive nutrition, andthe avoidance of harmful substances. Minimizingstress, getting plenty of low-impact exercise andfresh air, and sleeping well are important factorsleading to a positive overall experience of preg-nancy and birth. The important thing to remem-ber is that each pregnancy is unique, andalthough there are certain universal factors toconsider, the most important preventive medi-cine is the mother's relationship to her own bodyand her emotional and physical connection tothe child she is carrying. During pregnancy, hormone secretion changes radically, causing the physical and emotionalchanges experienced by most women fairly earlyin the rst trimester. Estrogen and progesteronelevels are about 100 times higher than usualduring pregnancy, dropping immediately afterbirth to prepregnancy levels as prolactin (thepituitary hormone) is produced to stimulate theproduction of breast milk. Throughout preg-nancy, the placenta produces a hormone calledrelaxin, which softens the connective tissues and ligaments that support the uterus, allowing it to expand. The production of endorphins(morphine-like hormones that are the body's natu-ral painkillers and tranquilizers) is increased duringpregnancy and continues to rise during labor, whenthey reach peak levels. 1These hormonal changes can lead to the experience of morning sickness ornausea in the rst trimester, especially when thereare nutritional deciencies as well. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CONSIDERATIONS Nearly all pregnant women can benet from nutri- tional and multivitamin supplementation one yearbefore and all during pregnancy, as well asthroughout labor, delivery, and breast-feeding. Theeffects of poor nutrition during pregnancy can beseen in the increase of birth defects during times offamine. 2But a standard Western diet (high in fats, salt, and sugar and low in complex carbohydrates)also lacks essential vitamins and minerals neededduring pregnancy and breast-feeding, which cancompromise your baby's health. 3The appropriate16PREGNANCY CHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 276WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE diet is well balanced and varied and includes fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, beans,and sh, with a limit on rened sugars, processedfoods, and saturated fats. Organically grown pro-duce, meats, and poultry are preferable, or inor-ganic produce that has been carefully washed toremove agricultural chemicals. 4 In an observational study involving 76 healthy pregnant women, 78 percent had \"one or moreglaring nutritional deciencies.\" 5Another study showed for preventionof special importance are folate (folic acid) and calcium intake, since the requirementfor both of these doubles during pregnancy. One study found that \"The fetus, the neonate, and the pregnant woman have anincreased requirement for folic acid and vitaminB 12, and are more likely to suffer from a de- ciency of these vitamins.\"7Nutrients such as folic acid and vitamins B 6and B 12have been corre- lated with prevention of the complications, such as spontaneousabortion, placental abruption, preterm delivery,low and anencephaly). 8Supple- calcium\u2014the only mineralwhose requirement doubles during pregnancy 9\u2014 has been positively correlated with prevention ofpregnancy hypertension, 10preeclampsia,11, 12 preterm (postpartum depres-sion). 15Magnesium supplementation has also been shown to reduce the complications of preg-nancy and improve the health of the infant. 16 In addition to taking nutritional supple- ments, certain substances should be avoided inpreparation for and during pregnancy. Smokingduring pregnancy increases the incidence of pre-mature labor, 17low birth weight,18and infant complications.19These complications may not be alleviated by increased maternal caloric intake.In addition, women who abuse alcohol and useillicit drugs are more likely to have inadequate nutrition as well as birth abnormalities anddevelopmental problems in the infant. Nutrition During pregnancy, a woman's physiology changes dramatically to allow for the development of ahealthy fetus. To support the rapidly growingfetus, changes in metabolism, biochemistry, andhormone status are needed to provide the environ-ment and energy required. Appropriate nutritionis important for both the mother and child duringpregnancy and plays a pivotal role in a healthypregnancy. Members of the health-care team assessmaternal nutritional risk, assign goals for weightgain, and recommend dietary changes to achieveKEY CONCEPTS Eat a healthy, whole foods diet, high in healthy oils (low-mercury sh high in omega-3 oils), complex carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables,organic meats and dairy, legumes, and nuts and seeds. Avoid situations that would increase risk of acute illness. Manage medical problems safely and effectively, as necessary. Have regular prenatal health checks. Seek assistance from a qualied health-care practitioner. TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS Avoid alcohol. Avoid nicotine. Reduce exposure to mercury-containing foods. Avoid recreational drugs. Avoid over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and herbs that may adversely affect the fetus. Consult with knowledgeable medical per-sonnel about these choices. Exercise regularly; avoid injuries, falls, and high- risk athletics.277PREGNANCY those goals. Prenatal evaluation and continued health care are important to monitor the progressof the pregnancy and intervene with correctivechanges when needed. The nutritional assessment includes informa- tion about diet, eating habits, daily activities, medical and medication history, and the use oftobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs. An initialphysical examination followed by ongoing examsis essential in assessing the mother's body massindex (BMI) and appropriate weight gain and fetalgrowth. BMI relates weight to height and thusprovides a better estimate of body fat distributionthan weight alone. The practitioner uses the BMIto determine whether the mother is underweight,normal weight, overweight, or obese. Weight is avery important indicator of fetal health andrequires precise and regular measurement. At eachvisit with your prenatal health-care worker, youshould be weighed to assess your weight gain com-pared to the target goals. Low prepregnant weight and inadequate weight gain during pregnancy are dominant con-tributors to intrauterine growth retardation 20and low birth weight.21Maternal prepregnant weight and weight gain in pregnancy also have an impacton early infant death rates. For women who areunderweight prior to pregnancy, the perinatalmortality risk at birth is lowest when their weightgain during pregnancy is greater than 37 pounds.For women who had normal weight prior to preg-nancy, the lowest risk is with a weight gain of 30to 37 pounds. 22Women who are obese prior to pregnancy need to gain less weight for an optimalfetal outcome. Signicant risk occurs in obesewomen if there is a greater than 25-pound weightgain during the pregnancy. 23Weight loss in obese women is not recommended during pregnancy.Teenagers, especially, often need careful educationabout the importance of nutrition, nutritionalchoices, the importance of healthy weight gain,and guidance throughout the pregnancy. All pregnant women will benet from prena- tal nutritional education that focuses on healthynutritional practices. Women with limited or potentially imbalanced dietary habits vegans, diets) receive specialattention and be educated on the potential com-plications and risks of these habits to both themother and the fetus. Women with a history ofanorexia, bulimia, obesity, diabetes, chronickidney disease, chronic gastrointestinal disease, orextreme diets may need more individualized edu-cation and nutritional therapy. Vegetarian, vegan,and macrobiotic diets are not necessarily inappro-priate as long as certain parameters are monitored.These include regular physical exams and prenatalchecks, appropriate weight gain, and laboratorytesting. Even women that have done well or seem-ingly well on these diets prior to pregnancy maynot do well when pregnant or nursing. Other women may suffer from an inadequate caloric intake because of their fear of weight gain,inadequate education about pregnancy, or insuf-cient money to purchase enough nutritiousfood. For low-income pregnant and postpartumlactating women, for infants, and for children upto the age of ve years at nutritional risk, assis-tance is available through the federal Supplemen-tal Food Program for Women, Infants andChildren (WIC). Food stamp programs and Aidto Families with Dependent Children may alsobe available for women. Other local, private,church, county, and state organizations may alsobe a source of assistance. Some women are potentially at nutritional risk. These include women who have had several full-term pregnancies, previous low birth weight deliv-eries, and short intervals between births. Womenwith medical conditions such as diabetes, chronicrenal disease, anemia, and phenylketonuria allrequire special attention to dietary counseling. Useof prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs,vitamin and mineral supplements, laxatives, anddiet aids should all be reviewed by a qualiedhealth-care practitioner.278WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE The average amount of weight gain is 28 pounds. The maternal component of weightaccumulation starts in the rst trimester and ismost prominent in the rst half of the pregnancy.The growth of the fetus is most rapid in thesecond half of the pregnancy. In the last 12weeks, the weight of the fetus more than triples. Optimal health during pregnancy not only helps to ensure a healthy baby but also helps toensure good health for the mother after the birth.A strong nutritional foundation during pregnancycan provide mothers necessary support in thepostpartum period, throughout breast-feeding,and during the years to come when the demandsof raising young children are high. When contem-plating pregnancy, the rst step a woman needs totake is to commit to eat healthfully. Support offamily and friends during days of not feeling wellalong with assistance with shopping and cookingcan help in keeping that commitment. Almostevery pregnant woman will experience cravings.The main problem with cravings arises when crav-ings for chocolate, sodas, sweets, and ice creambecome substitutes for nutritious foods. Cravingsoften can also be clues about specic nutritionalneeds. A craving for ice cream may indicate anincreased need for protein, fat, or calcium. A crav-ing for acidic foods like pickles may be a clue toincreased need for calcium or salt. A craving forsweets may indicate a need for more protein in thediet. Cravings for chips can indicate a need formore salt and fats. A continued effort should bemade to replace these junk foods with healthiernutritious choices. The best way to ensure that you are eating well is to establish a balanced, wide variety of foods,including whole-grain cereals and breads, vegeta-bles and fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and comple-mentary amounts of dairy products and meats,especially sh and poultry. If you are unfamiliarwith natural foods, try to nd a nutritional practi-tioner who can advise you and begin to makeappropriate changes in your diet. Books on nutri-tion and cooking also can be of help as you incor-porate healthy foods into your diet. If you already eat a very healthy diet, then it is important toensure that you are eating adequate amounts offood. If you are on a restricted diet or follow a spe-cic dietary system, I advise you to seek the adviceof a health-care practitioner knowledgeable in thearea of nutrition. Generally this would be a licensednaturopathic physician or a nutritionist/dietitian.The following general guidelines for daily foodservings have been proposed as the \"daily dozen\" inthe book What to Eat When You're Expecting . 24 Calories: plenty of healthy foods to ensure adequate calories (2,300 daily) Protein: four servings (either vegetable or animal sources\u201474 g total) Calcium foods: four servings daily (dairy and nondairy sources) Vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables: two servings Green leafy vegetables and yellow fruits and vegetables: three servings Other veggies and fruits: one or two servings Whole grains and other complex carbohy- drates: four to six servings Iron-rich foods: one or more servings daily High-fat foods: two servings Salt: in moderation, to taste Fluids: at least six to eight glasses Supplements: nutritious herbs, highly con- centrated food supplements (soy or greendrinks), and a prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement The Food and Nutrition Board of the Insti- tute of Medicine has published recommendeddietary allowances (RDAs) periodically since1943. The RDAs are listed by nutrient in thenutritional supplement section that follows. The question of how many calories per day to consume is dependent upon many variables. Theinput portion of the energy equation includes the consumed food plus the amount of stored fuelin the body. The output variable in the equationincludes the metabolic rate, thermogenesis (heat279PREGNANCY production), and physical activity. The caloric con- tent of the diet required to supply daily energyneeds and achieve optimal weight gain can be esti-mated by multiplying your optimal body weight inpounds by 15.9 and adding 300 to the total. (Al-ternatively, you can multiply your optimal weightin kilograms by 35 and add 300 to the total.) The postnatal period is another time when the physiological demands of lactation andbreast-feed ing put additional nutritional strain on the mother. Optimal milk production requires atotal daily caloric intake of at least 1,800 calories.The energy sources are fat stores and diet, whichneed to supply an additional 500 calories per day.Intake of water, juice, and milk (this can be cow,goat, almond, soy, oat, or rice milk) to satisfy thirstis sufcient for breast milk production needs. The well-balanced, varied whole foods diet that was consumed prenatally should be main-tained postnatally. The monthly loss of iron withbreast-feeding is about half that of regular men-struation, and because women do not menstruateduring breast-feeding, their iron stores are usu-ally replenished. Some vitamins and other miner-als, however, may be depleted during lactation.Continued nutritional supplementation with aprenatal vitamin or, even better, a postnatal vita-min, can prevent deciencies and is importanteven if the diet is sufcient. After rapid weight loss in the rst month, the lactating mother of normal weight may loseweight at a rate of about two pounds a monthwithout affecting milk volume. For the obesewoman, losing four pounds a month is also safe.Intentional weight reduction diets or rapidweight loss during lactation are not advisable. Atone year after delivery, a two-pound residualadditional weight is considered average. Nutritional Supplements Folic Acid. Folate is the only vitamin whose requirement doubles in pregnancy. 9Deciencies of folic acid have been linked in studies to lowbirth weight infants and neural tube defects.According to one controlled study, women at high risk (having previously given birth to babieswith neural tube defects) who were given folatesupplementation showed a 72 percent protectiveeffect compared to the placebo group. 25In one study, a group of pregnant women given folatesupplementation gave birth to infants withincreased birth weight and Apgar scores and hada decreased incidence of fetal growth retardationand maternal infections. 26 Other studies also showed signicant preven- tion with supplementation.27-30 Because of rmly established connections between decien-cies of folic acid and low-birth weight infants and neural tube defects, the U.S. Public Health Service recommends that all women of child-bearing age take daily folic acid supplementationto reduce the risk of congenital birth defects. Dietary folic acid is a mixture of folates in the form of polyglutamates, which are readilydestroyed by cooking. Higher levels of dietaryfolate intake has been shown in some cases todecrease the incidence of neural tube defects, butwomen hereditarily predisposed to such defectsmay need to take in more folic acid through supplements in order to reach optimal levels. 31 Folic acid can be found in green leafy vegetables,nuts, whole grains, liver, watercress (avoid in rsttrimester), parsley, and dandelion. With articialsupplementation, care must be taken, becauselarge doses of folic acid have been associated witha decrease in zinc absorption, a mineral requiredfor proper fetal growth and immunity, 32as well as with maternal infection and abnormally slowfetal heart rate. 33 Folic Acid Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 600 mcg per day Nursing: 500 mcg per day Food sources: green leafy vegetables, nuts, whole grains, liver, watercress (avoid in rst trimester), parsley, dandelion280WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Vitamin B 3(Niacin, Nicotinic Acid). Vitamin B3(niacin) supplementation in the rst trimester has been positively correlated in studies with higherbirth weight, longer length, and greater newbornhead circumference, all signs of healthier infants. 34 Good food sources of niacin are wheat germ, sh,and garlic. Herbal sources are alfalfa, burdock rootand seed, dandelion, and parsley. Vitamin B 3(Niacin) Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Age 18 and younger, pregnant or nursing: 30 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 35 mg per day Food sources: wheat germ, sh, garlic Herbal sources: alfalfa, burdock root and seed, dande- lion, parsley Vitamin B 2(Riboflavin). Studies show that vitamin B 2(riboflavin) depletion is common during pregnancy (up to 40 percent less at termthan nonpregnant women and men), so ribo-flavin supplementation is recommended pre-vent metabolic disturbances. 35Good sources of riboflavin are watercress (avoid in rst trimester)and brown rice. include rose hips,parsley, saffron, dandelion, dulse (seaweed), allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 1.4 mg per dayNursing: 1.6 mg per day Food sources: watercress (avoid in rst trimester), brown rice Herbal sources: rose hips, parsley, saffron, dandelion, dulse (seaweed), kelp, fenugreek Vitamin B 1(Thiamine). correlation has been shown between supplementation ofvitamin B 1(thiamine) early in pregnancy and higher infant birth weight and size.34Thiamine depletion is common during pregnancy, and sup-plementation is recommended. 36Food sourcesare green peas, bell peppers, and sunflower seeds. Herbal sources include alfalfa, dandelion, fenu-greek, raspberry leaf, red clover, and seaweed. Vitamin B 1(Thiamine) Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant or nursing: 1.4 mg per day Food sources: bell peppers, green peas, sunflower seeds Herbal ry \"marginally decient\" in about 50 percent ofpregnant women. 37Supplementation has been linked to relief of nausea and morning sickness,especially in extreme cases that include vomit-ing. 38, 39In one experimental study, 75 percent of women taking vitamin B 6experienced complete relief from symptoms of morning sickness.40 Higher doses were used for treatment of rsttrimester morning sickness (25 to 200 mg threetimes daily), but are not recommended beforedelivery, as higher doses may shut off breast milkin nursing mothers or cause the baby to havewithdrawal seizures if commercial formula isgiven that does not include enough pyridoxine(B 6).41, 42 However, when given during labor, vitamin B 6may prevent many postnatal adapta- tion problems by increasing the oxygen-carryingcapacity of the blood that supplies the fetus. 43 Vitamin B 6(Pyridoxine) Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 1.9 mg per day Nursing: 2.0 mg per day Tolerable upper intake level (UL):Age 18 and younger, pregnant or nursing: 80 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 100 mg per day Food sources: whole grains, wheat germ, egg yolk, peas, carrots281PREGNANCY Local application of B 6as a lozenge provided women with protection from dental cavities,which are more common during pregnancy. 44 Supplementation may also prevent toxemia ofpregnancy (preeclampsia). 45Food sources are whole grains, wheat germ, egg yolks, peas, andcarrots. Vitamin B 12(Cobalamin). The coenzyme form of vitamin B 12is a very complex molecule containing cobalt, designated in humans ascobalamin, which is required for proper homo-cysteine metabolism. At least 12 different inher-ited inborn errors of metabolism related tocobalamin are known; low plasma vitamin B 12 levels have been shown to be an independent riskfactor for neural tube defect in one study. 46Sup- plementation is recommended and may also helpprevent anemia. Food sources are cauliflower andbroccoli. Herbal sources are alfalfa, comfrey,miso, seaweed, and catnip. B 12(Cobalamin) Recommended Pregnant: 2.6 comfrey, It is important to avoid oversup- plementation of vitamin A during pregnancy.Daily doses of 40,000 units or more of vitamin A during pregnancy may be toxic, 47while doses lower than 10,000 units appear to be safe.48In a study of 22,000 pregnant women, those whoconsumed more than 15,000 units of vitamin A per day from food and supplements, or 10,000units as a supplement, showed a signicant in-crease in birth defects associated with cranial-neural-crest tissue (several-fold higher incidenceof birth defects). 49Most of these women con- sumed the vitamin A before the seventh week ofpregnancy. Rat studies show a possible link tofolic acid metabolism. 50Elevated levels of vita-min A in the blood have also been correlated with low birth weight.51 Preterm infants have been shown to be de- cient in vitamin A, which may predispose themto development of chronic lung disease. 52 Healthy pregnant women who developed pre-eclampsia were shown to be decient in vitaminA (but not beta-carotene). 53Preeclampsia is a potentially dangerous condition characterized byhigh blood pressure, swelling, and/or proteinspilling into the urine. To avoid complications, supplementation with no more than 6,000 units of vitamin A isoptimal and recommended. 54Beta-carotene, which has the same positive effects as vitamin A,has not been associated with toxicity or terato-genicity in humans or animals. 55Plant sources of the nontoxic \"provitamin A\" beta-carotene areorganic fruits and vegetables, especially yellowand orange ones; for example, one sweet potatoor one cup of carrot juice contains 25,000 IU of 56Herbal seaweed.Vitamin A Recommended Age 18 and younger, pregnant: 2,500 IU per dayAge 18 and younger, nursing: 4,000 IU per dayAge 19 and older, pregnant: 2,600 IU per dayAge 19 and older, nursing: 4,300 IU per day Tolerable upper intake level (UL): Age 18 and younger, pregnant or nursing: 9,000 IU per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 10,000 IU per day Beta-carotene:No recommended doses or insufcient reliable infor- mation. Consider UL to be 10,000 IU per day. Anywhere between 10 IU and 10,000 IU per day isan option. Food sources: yellow and orange fruits and vegetables comfrey, dandelion, elderberries, lamb's quarters, seaweed282WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Vitamin C. Vitamin C plays a vital role in the formation of collagen\u2014a major proteinfound in connective tissue, cartilage, and bone. Itis essential to the nerves, healthy gums, and teethand prevents infection. Although one studyshowed that women who took 5,000 mg of vita-min C daily during pregnancy delivered healthyinfants who developed scurvy, 57this \"rebound scurvy\" is very rare, and the infant recoversquickly without treatment. Supplementationwith vitamin C may be as effective as calcium for leg cramps during pregnancy. 58 Food sources of vitamin C are fruits (particu- larly citrus), green chilies, tomatoes, honey, alfalfa, cayenne.Vitamin 3 Adequate intake (AI): Pregnant or nursing: 200 IU per dayTolerable upper (UL):Pregnant 2,000 per source: sunshine Food sources: sh Herbal sources: alfalfa, nettles Vitamin E. Vitamin E declines during preg- nancy, creating deciencies, and fetal vitamin Elevels are usually low. 59Lower plasma levels in the mother may be associated with increased riskof preeclampsia, as well as premature andlow-birth weight infants. 60Supplementation has been shown to be effective in preventing chronicmiscarriages. 61Good food sources are parsley, brown rice, and wheat germ. Herbal sourcesinclude alfalfa, rosehips, raspberry leaf, dande-lion, and seaweed. Vitamin E Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 15 mg or 22 IU per day Nursing: 19 mg or 28 IU per dayTolerable upper intake level (UL):Pregnant or nursing: 400 IU per day and up to 900 IU per day during the last two months of pregnancy Food sources: brown rice, parsley, wheat germ Herbal sources: alfalfa, rosehips, raspberry leaf, dan- delion, seaweed, watercress (avoid in rst trimester) Vitamin K. Vitamin K is necessary for bone metabolism. In most states it is required by lawthat vitamin K be given to newborns in the hos-pital by injection in the foot immediately afterbirth or a shot during labor to prevent hemolyticdisease, which is characterized by anemia, jaun-dice, enlargement of the liver and spleen, andgeneralized edema. Naturopathic doctors recom-mend checking the pregnant mother's diet forvitamin K deciency and adding oral supple-mentation of vitamin K in the last month ofVitamin C Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Age 18 or younger, pregnant or nursing: 115 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 120 mg per day Tolerable upper intake level (UL):Age 18 or younger, pregnant or nursing: 1,800 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 2,000 mg per day Food sources: fruits (especially citrus), green chilies, tomatoes, cabbage, cucumbers, greens, nettles, alfalfa, and cayenne Vitamin D. The absorption of vitamin D (as well as calcium, which vitamin D helps metabo-lize) is enhanced during pregnancy, and sincevitamin D tends toward toxicity, supplementa-tion should be judicious to prevent excessiveamounts of it from spilling into the urine. Fishoil and sunshine are good sources of natural vita-min D, which benets the development of goodteeth and bones. Herbal sources of vitamin D arealfalfa and nettles.283PREGNANCY pregnancy, if needed, rather than automatically giving the shots, which have been shown in somestudies to link with childhood cancer. 62 Vitamin K (along with vitamin C) is effective in preventing the nausea and vomiting of earlypregnancy, and it may reduce the risk of intraven-tricular hemorrhage in premature infants. 63Some food sources are parsley and brown rice. Nettle oralfalfa leaf infusion or tea taken throughout thepregnancy will increase available vitamin K andhemoglobin in the blood; kelp is also helpful. Vitamin K Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant or nursing: 65 mg per dayFood sources: parsley, brown rice Herbal sources: alfalfa, nettles, kelp Calcium. Calcium is the only mineral whose requirement doubles during pregnancy. Lowdietary intake is associated with preeclampsia, 64, 65 a potentially dangerous (but preventable) condi-tion characterized by high blood pressure (hyper-tension), swelling, and/or protein spilling intothe urine. Supplementation with calcium mayreduce the risk of preterm delivery, often associ-ated with preeclampsia, and may also prevent thehypertensive disorders of pregnancy. 66Calcium supplementation can also help to ease leg crampsduring pregnancy. 67 Excessive levels of calcium in the body, how- ever, can result in spillage into the urine and anincreased possibility of kidney stones. Supplementwith the form of calcium that does not cause youindigestion or constipation. And attention mustbe paid to the relationship between calcium andother minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. Raspberry leaf infusion contains calcium in its most absorbable form, as do nettle infusions, freshparsley, and watercress. Other food sources of cal-cium include milk products (although consump-tion of these can lead to allergies in the baby), darkgreen leafy vegetables, asparagus, and pumpkinseeds. Avoid bone meal or oyster shell calciumtablets, which have been found to be high in lead, mercury, cadmium, and other toxic metals. Calcium Adequate intake (AI): Age 18 or younger, pregnant or nursing: 1,300 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 1,000 mg per day Food sources: parsley, watercress (avoid in rst tri- mester), dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables,asparagus, pumpkin seeds Herbal sources: raspberry leaf, nettles, horsetail Chromium, Cobalt, and Copper. These three trace minerals were positively associated instudies with higher infant birth weights, and sup-plementation is therefore recommended. 68 Chromium Adequate intake (AI): Age 18 and younger, pregnant: 29 mcg per day Age 18 and younger, nursing: 44 mcg per dayAge 19 and older, pregnant: 30 mcg per day Age 19 and older, nursing: 45 mcg per day Cobalt Adequate intake (AI):Pregnant or nursing: presumably as part of B 12, 2 mcg per day, and sufcient if you are taking vita- min B 12 Copper Adequate intake (AI): Pregnant or nursing: 2 mg per day Iron. Some researchers have concluded that iron supplementation is essential during preg-nancy in order to maintain adequate maternaliron stores. However, because iron supplementa-tion can exacerbate zinc depletion, supplementa-tion is only warranted if iron deciency isdetected and routine iron supplementationduring pregnancy is clearly indicated. 69 If a woman gets sufcient iron in the rst trimester of pregnancy, studies show a denitepositive association with infant birth weight and284WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE size, although the same is not true for the second and third trimesters.34Good food sources are almonds, honey, beets (including greens), andhigh-quality protein foods like egg yolks andorgan meats (liver, kidney, heart), preferablyorganic. Herbs high in iron are nettles, dande-lion, and alfalfa, as well as kelp. Iron Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 27 mg per day Age 18 and younger, nursing: 10 mg per dayAge 19 and older, nursing: 9 mg per day Tolerable upper intake level (UL): Pregnant or nursing: 45 mg, if not iron decientFood sources: almonds, beets (including greens), egg yolks, honey, organ meats (liver, kidney, heart) Herbal sources: be in the rst trimester topositively affect birth weight and size. Researchersthink that magnesium may act by opposing calcium-dependent arterial vasoconstriction andmay also prevent cell damage and death, the \"drug of choice\" in thetreatment of preeclampsia. general, supple- mentation may reduce the complications of preg-nancy and improve infant health.74In studies, magnesium-treated women had a 29.5 percentreduction in the risk of hospitalization, as well as a37 percent reduction in days spent in the hospital.Food sources are honey, almonds, barley, driedfruits, and potatoes. Herbs are dandelion, alfalfa,and watercress (avoid in rst trimester), as well asseaweed (also called dulse). Potassium. Potassium levels may be decient in pregnancy, with the lowest concentrations inwomen with preeclampsia. 75Supplementation is recommended. Food sources are bananas, pota-toes (especially peels), olives, bran, and greenleafy vegetables. Herbs are nettles, dandelion,alfalfa, and chamomile. Potassium Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant or nursing: 99 mg per day; should not be taken unless prescribed by your practitioner Tolerable upper intake level (UL): Pregnant or nursing: 99 mg per day; should not be taken unless prescribed by your practitioner Food sources: bananas, potatoes (especially peels), olives, bran, green leafy vegetables Herbal sources: nettles, dandelion, alfalfa, chamomile Zinc. Zinc is required for proper fetal growth and immunity. Plasma zinc levels decline about30 percent during pregnancy, 76and low zinc intake is associated with spontaneous abortionand premature delivery, 77as well as complica- tions and labor abnormalities.78Low zinc was also associated with the specic complication offetal distress 79and may be associated with central nervous system abnormalities in infants, includ-ing neural tube defects, 80 81as well as low birth weight infants82-84 and toxemia of pregnancy.85 Supplementation, especially if zinc levels are low,is recommended to reduce the risk of fetal andmaternal complications. 86In one study, labor complications (vaginal bleeding, fetal acidosis,uterine inertia) were improved. 87Another studyMagnesium Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Age 18 and younger, pregnant: 400 mg per day Age 18 and younger, nursing: 360 mg per dayAge 19-30, pregnant: 350 mg per day Age 19-30, nursing: 310 mg per day Age 31-50, pregnant: 380 mg per dayAge 31-50, nursing: 320 mg per day Tolerable upper intake level (UL): Do not exceed 400 mg per day during pregnancy Food sources: honey, almonds, barley, dried fruits, potatoes Herbal sources: alfalfa, dandelion, seaweed (dulse), watercress (avoid in rst trimester)285PREGNANCY showed a lower incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (which is associated with pre-eclampsia and preterm labor). 88Some food sources of zinc are oysters, beets, broccoli, wheatgerm, wheat bran, sh, lentils, and watercress(avoid in the rst trimester). Herbs are garlic,ginger root, and parsley. Zinc Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): Pregnant: 15 mg per day Nursing: 15 mg per dayTolerable upper intake level (UL): Age 18 and younger, pregnant or nursing: 34 mg per day Age 19 and older, pregnant or nursing: 40 mg per day Food sources: beets, broccoli, sh, lentils, oysters, wheat bran, and wheat germ Herbal sources: garlic, ginger root, and parsleyimmune system have all been associated with ade- quate intake of docahexaenoic acid (DHA) duringthe development of the fetus. Essential fatty acids have a unique role during pregnancy because of the rapid cell growth anddevelopment of new tissues and new organ sys- tems in a developing fetus. Fetal development isassociated with a high EFA requirement, and thissupply is dependent on the amount and avail-ability of EFAs from the mother. Infants born ofmothers with low DHA levels have shorter atten-tion spans, 91and this may have long-term effects on future learning, development, and perform-ance. Children born to mothers who had taken10 ml per day of cod liver oil during their preg-nancy and lactation had higher IQs at age fourcompared to those born to mothers who hadtaken corn oil or placebo. 92 Maternal levels of omega-3 fatty acids, espe- cially DHA, decrease during pregnancy.93EFAs are components of breast milk, and maternallevels may be reduced further in nursing women.For the fetus, a deciency of EFAs, particularlyeicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA, may leadto a poorly developed central nervous system.EFA deciency may also lead to intrauterinegrowth retardation leading to a lower bodyweight and slower growth of the brain. Supple-mentation with a daily complex of essential fattyacids and sh oils during pregnancy providesvital nutrients that supply the necessary EFAs forthe increased nutritional and metabolic demandthroughout the nine months of gestation. Fishoil supplementation has been shown to improvethe DHA status of not only infants at birth butmothers too. 94Other research has shown that supplementation with sh oils is a good means ofimproving omega-3s in pregnant women 95and of improving the DHA status in breast milk.96 T rials on omega-3 fatty acids conducted in pregnant women have shown a signicant reduc-tion in the incidence of premature delivery. 97In one such study, sh oil was investigated for itseffects on pregnancy duration, birth weight,Bioflavonoids. Bioflavonoids are benecial for women who have recurring miscarriages.When placed on citrus bioflavonoids daily as soonas a period was missed, many stopped aborting. 89 One study demonstrated that previously Rh-immunized mothers treated with bioflavonoids during their pregnancy delivered babies who wereless erythroblastotic than expected. 90 Omega-3 and Other Fatty Acids (EFAs). There is a growing body of evidence about theimportance of omega-3 fats for human health anddevelopment, not the least of which starts withinfant exposure during fetal development. Doca-hexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important componentof phospholipids in the central nervous system andis found in high amounts in the retina, about 25percent. DHA makes up 12 to 20 percent of thefatty acids in the gray matter of the cortex of thebrain and in the brain stem. Inadequate intake ofomega-3s has signicant implications for bothmother and infant. The development of the centralnervous system, the brain, the eyes, and the286WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE intrauterine growth restriction, and pregnancy- induced hypertension.98Omega-3 fatty acid sup- plementation of 2.7 grams per day was comparedto olive oil and/or no supplement. The shoil-supplemented pregnancies lasted four dayslonger and birth weight was 107 g greater. Inanother study, infants born of mothers who hadbeen given cod liver oil had higher levels of DHAin their umbilical cord, longer gestational length(longer to develop in the uterus), and moremature brain functioning measurements on thesecond day of life. 99Fish oil also appeared to be related to a reduction in the risk of preterm deliv-ery in those women who had had a previouspreterm delivery. There was no effect of sh oilon intrauterine growth restriction or pregnancy-induced hypertension. 100In addition, this study reported that preterm delivery and low birthweight of the infants occurs when little to noomega-3 fats from sh or sh oil are consumed. A more recent study of pregnant women in Iceland showed that consuming liquid cod liveroil in the rst 15 weeks of pregnancy resulted inbabies with higher birth weight. 101Higher infant birth weight is related to a lower prevalence ofcardiac disease, high hypertension, and glucoseintolerance in the future. 102, 103 Additional good news was that the women did not gain moreweight, despite their consumption of increasedcalories and fat from the oil. Hormone-like substances called prostaglandins are also involved in the development and clinicalexpression of preeclampsia. These prostaglandinsare modulators frequently associatedwith increased platelet aggregation, reduced utero-placental blood flow, and premature delivery. In aplacebo-controlled clinical trial, a group of preg-nant women receiving a combination of eveningprimrose oil and sh oil had a signicantly lowerincidence of edema. 104Evening primrose oil has also been shown effective in preventing pregnancy-induced hypertension105(associated with pre- eclampsia and preterm labor). There is some evidence that evening primrose oil (EPO), taken both orally and vaginally, can be used to promote the preparation of the cervixfor the birth (cervical ripening). Clinically, EPOsupplementation during pregnancy has beenfound by practitioners of natural childbirth to bean efcacious method to stimulate cervical ripen-ing during labor, and the prostaglandin PgE1 isknown to stimulate cervical ripening and hastenthe progression of labor. 106Although practitioners using this supplement report no adverse effects, a retrospective trial comparing the oil to no sup-plement did not note a difference between groups,and there was a suggestion that there was anincreased incidence of premature rupture of mem-branes, labor augmentation, and assisted vaginaldelivery in the evening primrose oil group. 107 The main food sources of essential fatty acids are raw seeds and nuts or sh. Whole and groundflaxseed and puried flaxseed oil are excellentsources of the two essential oils, linoleic acid andlinolenic acid. Borage oil and black current oilcan be taken in capsule form as nutritional sup-plements. It should be stated, though, that allseed oils are not the same in their makeup ofessential fatty acids, and substituting a seed oildoes not necessarily give the same benets as thesh oils and vice versa. Although research clearly shows that moder- ate EFA supplementation is benecial and safefor pregnant women, caution should be exercisedwhen consuming large doses. Also, there may besome caution about increased sh intake andenvironmental contamination. The U.S. Foodand Drug Administration and the Environmen-tal Protection Agency advise that pregnant andnursing mothers and young children avoid certaintypes of sh and shellsh and limit others. Inpart, this may be due to the methylmercury con-tent in sh such as albacore tuna, shark, sword-sh, king mackerel, and tilesh. Methylmercuryis a known neurotoxin.287PREGNANCY Supplementing with sh oils should be done with puried sh oil supplements, which canreduce or practically eliminate exposure to mer-cury, PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides. Due to howwe have contaminated our ocean waters and thewildlife that inhabits these waters, high-qualitysh oils supplements may in fact be a safer alter-native to sh in food form and enable us to gainthe benets of omega-3s while reducing the riskof toxicity. 108, 109 Omega-3 Fatty Acids No recommendations have been established by the FDA but the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommends 2.87 mg per dayof omega-3 fatty acids with a minimal intake of 300 mg per day of DHA for pregnancy or lactation. Food sources: sh high in omega-3 fatty acids include tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, and herring in text); seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, and lbertsPhosphatidylcholine (PC). PC is a primary component of lecithin, sometimes referred to aspure lecithin, from which dietary choline isderived. Dietary choline, after absorption by theintestinal mucosa, is metabolized in the liver tocholine, a critical nutrient for brain and nervedevelopment and function. In mammals, amni-otic fluid has a tenfold greater concentration ofcholine than that in maternal blood, 113and at birth, all mammals studied have plasma cholineconcentrations much higher than those found in adults. 114When rats were supplemented with choline, the spatial memory of their offspringwas permanently enhanced, and they showedmore accurate performance on both working andreference memory components of tasks. Fromthese studies, 115researchers believe that choline is critical for optimal brain development, andtherefore supplementation is suggested. No recommended dose available. Lecithin. Lecithin, a derivative of the soy- bean, is needed by the brain to function properlyand helps to break down fatty cholesteroldeposits in the body. Lecithin contains phospho-rus and stimulates the metabolism. Lecithin isalso found in fertile eggs, soy products, and, insmall amounts, in all vegetables that have beenvine ripened. No recommended dose available. Taurine. Taurine is an amino acid found widely distributed in foods of animal origin (but not milk or milk products). Taurine isbiosynthesized from methionine or from cysteineduring the metabolic process, and disturbancesin enzymatic reactions that take place in thisprocess can lead to mental retardation. Vegetar-ian mothers who consume no meat productsduring their pregnancy, and therefore have a low-taurine diet, as well as others on a protein-,methionine-, or vitamin B 6-decient diet might be at particular risk.116 Although dietary deciency of taurine has not been demonstrated to impact fetal develop-Coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is a fat- soluble quinone occurring in the mitochondriaof every cell that is a cofactor in the electrontransport chain on which most cellular functionsrely, making it essential for the health of virtuallyall human tissues. Plasma levels of this enzymerise during normal pregnancy, reaching highs of50 percent above normal by the 36th week.Decreased levels have been linked in studies tospontaneous abortion and threatened abortion,particularly before 12 weeks. 110 No recommended dose available. Methionine (SAM). Methionine is a compo- nent of many proteins, serving as a source ofavailable sulfur for synthesizing both cysteineand taurine, crucial to cellular metabolism. Sup-plementation with methionine in mice reducedneural tube defects by 47 percent 111and also pos- itively affected birth weight and size.112 No recommended dose available.288WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE ment in humans, researchers recommend that vegetarian women who intend to have childrenoptimize dietary levels of protein and vitamin B 6, since there is no taurine present in plants andvegetables. Meat eaters are advised to eat onlyorganic or \"free-range\" animals in order to avoidthe high concentrations of hormones and pesti-cides found in animal products in industrializedcountries. No recommended dose available. Botanicals There are many herbs that can be used safely during pregnancy. Some herbs are characterizedas tonics, others are spices that improve taste anddigestion, other herbs contain specic vitaminsand minerals that aid different organ systems,and still others can be used as medicines to inter-vene and treat conditions or illnesses related tothe pregnancy. However, there are some herbsthat are commonly contraindicated for useduring pregnancy. Although some of these herbsmay be used in very small amounts for specicconditions, it is prudent to avoid them unlessunder the supervision of an expert in herbalmedicine. Some of these contraindicated herbscan be used safely late in the pregnancy or duringlabor with the guidance of an experienced practi-tioner (see the following sidebar). The following herbs are some of the most common medicinal plants used in traditionalherbal practice for promoting and maintaininghealth during pregnancy. Dandelion Leaf and Root ( is a potent source of vita- mins and minerals, especially vitamin A, cal-cium, potassium, and iron. Mildly diuretic andstimulating to bile flow, dandelion leaf complaints of pregnancy,and its root cleanses and tones the liver. 117In early pregnancy, dandelion can help to alleviatenausea, upset stomach, and indigestion. As adiuretic, the most active part of the plant is theleaf. The root or the leaf can be taken as a tea, in capsule form, or as a liquid tincture (a mixture ofplant, alcohol, and water). It can be safely takenthroughout pregnancy as a tonic or to addressone of the indicated specic problems Chamaelirium unicorn has traditionally been used as auterine tonic before, during, and after pregnancy,especially for women who have a history of mis-carriage. Similar to dandelion, it is used to sup-port liver and digestive function. Due to its bittertaste, this herb is probably best tolerated in cap-sule or tincture form rather than as a tea. Ginger ( Zingiber Ofcinale ).Ginger is probably best known for its treatment of nauseaand vomiting, whether pregnant or not. Therehave been several good scientic studies on theuse of ginger in nausea of pregnancy and themore severe state called hyperemesis gravidarum(severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy).In these studies, ginger brought about a signi-cant reduction in both the severity of the nauseaand the number of attacks of vomiting in themajority of the patients. In all of these studies,there were no adverse effects on pregnancy andpregnancy outcome. In fact, in the most recentstudy of 70 women, there were three sponta-neous abortions in the placebo group and onlyone in the ginger group. More full-term pregnan-cies occurred in the ginger group than in theplacebo group as well. No infants had any con-genital anomalies. 118 In a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial that studied the effectiveness of ginger in hyper-emesis gravidarum, the most severe form of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, early inpregnancy, 250 mg of ginger root powder takenfour times a day signicantly reduced the severityof the nausea and the number of attacks of vom-iting in 19 of 27 women. 119Ginger is safe to use at any time during pregnancy and is a welcomealternative to some of the antinausea pharmaceu-289PREGNANCY ticals, which may be associated with teratogenic- ity (physical defects in the fetus in utero). Information that has appeared in the writings of traditional herbalists and the lay press orherbal resources about the danger of gingerduring pregnancy appears to be out of date andnot based on scientic facts. Select sensitive indi-viduals may get some stomach-burning sensa-tions when using ginger. Taking it with food willmost likely relieve that discomfort. Nettle ( Urtica Dioica ).Nettle is one of the best herbs to use in pregnancy due to its appre-ciable amounts of vitamins and minerals, includ-ing calcium and iron. Used throughout thepregnancy, nettle can help to improve energy, strengthen the blood vessels, reduce varicose veins,alleviate leg cramps, prevent anemia, and decreasethe likelihood of hemorrhage during childbirth.This is an herb that can be taken in all forms,including freshly picked young leaves and as a leafygreen addition to steamed vegetables or salads. Partridgeberry ( Mitchella Repens ).Par- tridgeberry or squaw vine is considered one ofthe best uterine tonics. It should be taken for several weeks before the due date. Squaw vine isoften used in combination with raspberry leaf. Itcan be taken as a tea, in capsule form, or as atincture.Herbs Contraindicated During Pregnancy The following herbs should not pregnancy: sage used in cooking are OK. Note: Some of the herbs listed may be recommended by a licensed practitioner with expertise in the use of botani- cals during pregnancy and labor.290WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Red Raspberry ( Rubus Idaeus ).Red rasp- berry leaf is the most often mentioned traditionalherbal tonic for general support of pregnancyand breast-feeding. Rich in vitamins C and Eand minerals, especially high in naturallychelated iron (which is well assimilated), it tonesthe uterus, increases the flow of milk, andrestores the reproductive system after childbirth.Raspberry leaf contains fragrine, an alkaloid thatgives tone to the muscles of the pelvic region,including the uterus itself. In addition to tonify-ing the uterus, raspberry is used to prevent hem-orrhage. It deserves its reputation as a pregnancyherb par excellence. Wild Yam ( Dioscorea Villosa and Bar- basco ).Wild yam can be used to help prevent miscarriage due to its calming and antispasmodicaction on the uterus. Even though wild yam hasacquired a considerable reputation as a \"femaleherb,\" perhaps its most traditional uses are as adigestive aid in treating nausea, as an antispas-modic for intestinal and gallbladder colic, and asa liver herb. This herb is best used in capsule ortincture form. To help prevent miscarriage,higher doses of the tincture can be used ( 14to12 teaspoon every three to four hours). SUBSTANCES TO AVOID DURING PREGNANCY Besides supplementing with multivitamins, min- erals, and other appropriate nutrients, a pregnantwoman improves her chances for a complication-free pregnancy and birth by avoiding harmfulsubstances such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine,and recreational and prescription drugs. Terato-gens are substances that cause birth defects, mis-carriage, or pregnancy complication when apregnant woman is exposed to them, especiallyin the early stages of pregnancy. Environmentalchemicals such as mercury and lead, many pre-scription drugs such as Dilantin and Accutane,recreational drugs including cocaine and alcohol,and even some illnesses including rubella, dia-betes, and herpes are all potentially teratogenic agents and able to cause loss of a pregnancy, birthdefects, or pregnancy complications. Pesticidesand other contaminants found in the environ-ment (including our food and water) can disruptthe hormonal and chromosomal cycles, leadingto breaks in the DNA and a wide range of defor-mities and abnormalities in all animal species,including humans. Alcohol Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is an established cause of serious birth defects anddevelopmental delay, described as fetal alcoholsyndrome (FAS). FAS is caused by in utero alcohol-induced damages and results in mentalretardation. Infants born with FAS have facialabnormalities and slow growth. They showimpairment in their intellectual developmentand have difculties in learning, memory, prob-lem solving, and attention span. They can alsoexperience mental health problems and difcul-ties with social behaviors. 120It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the United Statesranges between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live births.Much higher rates can occur in some communi-ties. The focus should be on prevention andaggressively promoting no alcohol use duringpregnancy. Even mild alcohol ingestion during pregnancy is said to result in hyperactivity, short attentionspan, and emotional problems in children. 121 Alcohol consumption during pregnancy con-tributes to birth abnormalities whether the motherdrinks a little or a lot. 122There are two periods of pregnancy when the maternal consumption ofalcohol is particularly threatening to the develop-ment of the fetus: from the 12th to the 18th weekand from the 24th to the 35th week. Three or fourbeers or glasses of wine a day can cause any one ormore of the following defects: mental retardation,hyperactivity, a heart murmur, facial deformitysuch as a small head, or low-set ears. 123291PREGNANCY Cigarettes The sad news is that more than 20 percent of women in the United States smoke. The num-bers are similar in other developed countries andonly slightly lower in developing countries.Unfortunately, many of these women also smokeduring pregnancy\u2014about 11 percent. Not onlydoes smoking harm a woman's long-term health,it can increase numerous complications andcause serious problems for newborn infants.According to statistics, we could reduce the rateof stillbirths by 11 percent, and newborn deathsby 5 percent, if all pregnant women stoppedsmoking. 124 Cigarette smoke contains more than 2,500 chemicals, and both nicotine and carbon monox-ide are thought to be related to adverse outcomesin pregnancy. Smoking nicotine has been associ-ated with several complications of pregnancy. Itappears to double a woman's risk of developingplacental problems, 124including placenta previa (a low-lying placenta that covers theopening of the uterus), placental abruption (theplacenta peels partially or completely away fromthe uterine wall prior to delivery), and prematurerupture of the membranes. Cigarette smoking isknown to cause lower birth weight and size; moth-ers who smoke 13 or more high-tar cigarettes aday have smaller babies in poorer condition thanthose of nonsmoking mothers. 125Smokers have a miscarriage rate twice as high as that of nonsmok-ers, 126and babies born to mothers who smoke have more than double the risk of dying of suddeninfant death syndrome. 127 Women who smoke may experience more ectopic pregnancies (a potentially dangerous sit-uation in which the fertilized egg attaches to, andgrows on, the fallopian tube outside the uterus).Children of smokers may have far more respira-tory illnesses (like asthma) than those of non-smokers. Even secondhand smoke is seriouslyharmful to mother and baby and should beavoided when possible.The more a woman smokes, the greater the risk to her baby. However, if she stops smokingbefore the end of her rst trimester, she is no morelikely to have a lower birth weight baby than anonsmoking woman. Even stopping by the thirdtrimester can improve the baby's growth. The good news is that it is possible to stop smoking and there are numerous resources tohelp you. The National Partnership to HelpPregnant Smokers Quit provides information forwomen and resources for health-care profession-als. The American Legacy Foundation is anotherorganization that helps smokers quit. Smokefree.gov is an online resource for individuals whowant to stop smoking that is sponsored by thefederal government. The American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists provides goodinformation for health-care providers to offerassistance to their patients. There are many otheradditional resources as well, and some may belocal to your community. Caffeinated Beverages A small amount of caffeine will probably not be harmful for most women and their infants. How-ever, there are some studies of concern. Caffeinehas been shown to contribute to growth-retardedor low-birth weight infants. 128Researchers have suggested that women limit their intake of caf-feine to approximately 300 mg per day duringpregnancy, and since caffeine is known to enterbreast milk, that level might be appropriate fornursing mothers as well. 129One cup of regular coffee contains about 120 mg of caffeine. Evenwith this limited amount, the coffee or teashould be organic in order to avoid the pesticidesused in agricultural processes. Pesticides and Environmental Hazards Environmental factors are becoming more and more problematic to each generation of pregnantwomen, as many articial compounds (such asPCBs from plastics) build up in the environment292WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE over time without degrading, become part of the food chain, and are incorporated into ourbodies. Theo Colburn's groundbreaking study of the links between pesticides, PCBs, and otherorganochlorides in the food chain and hormonaldisruption and birth defects makes clear thatwhatever an individual woman can do to avoidthese compounds in her food and water is wellworth doing. 130Because humans are high on the food chain, the effects of these compounds onhuman reproduction are potentially exponential and devastating. Hazardous substances such as pesticides, lead, and other chemicals brought home from the workenvironment on a parent's clothing can harm anunborn child. 131Also potentially harmful to the fetus are the mother's exposure to x-rays duringpregnancy or the father's preconception exposureto x-rays. 132One study showed that high amounts of lead and barium in drinking water caused anincreased risk of miscarriages. 133Elevated lead in the body has also been linked to preeclampsia134 and lower birth weight. Mercury has received perhaps the most atten- tion of any of the pesticides and heavy metals.Methylmercury crosses the placenta and canimpair the development of the central nervoussystem in the fetus. As a result, the federal government has issued guidelines regarding shintake for pregnant women and for all agegroups. The intake of sh appears to be stronglycorrelated with the concentration of mercury inhair, and it has been observed that women instates with sh advisories who ate 20 or moreservings of sh in a three-month time span hadmercury concentrations in their hair that wassevenfold higher than those of women who ateno sh. The majority of these women exceededthe recommended limit for lead. 135Canned alba- core tuna (or white tuna) and tuna steaks aregenerally considered to be higher in mercurythan light canned tuna. The USFDA currentlyrecommends that pregnant women eat no morethan six ounces of sh per week.Over-the-Counter and Prescription Drugs Seemingly harmless over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, taken by mothers in the rst half of the pregnancy, have been linked to lower-than-average IQs in their offspring. 136Valium oil administered to egg-laying chickens inducedimpaired muscle cell development, suggestingpotential harm from the use of Valium in preg-nancy. 137Medications such as lithium (used to treat bipolar disorder, formerly called manicdepression) and tetracycline (an antibiotic) canharm the fetus; if at all possible, avoidance ofthese substances is recommended. Some anti-seizure medications are folate antagonists and, assuch, can increase the risk for fetal neural tubedefects unless folic acid supplementation isimplemented along with the medication. 138, 139 In addition to the products already men- tioned, herbalist Susun Weed provides the fol-lowing list of products to avoid: dentists' ofces, steroids, hormones, andAccutane (an acne medication). 140 Your health-care practitioner can make avail- able a full list of over-the-counter and prescrip-tion medications rated in terms of safety and sideeffects for the fetus during pregnancy and for theinfant during lactation. Please ask your health-care provider(s) before taking any over-the-counter medication, prescription medication, orherbal and nutritional supplements. Recreational Drugs Before conception and during pregnancy, espe- cially the rst trimester, it is important to avoidusing recreational drugs, even those that mayseem harmless at other times, as consequences toa developing fetus may be serious. Genetic mate-293PREGNANCY rial can be damaged by marijuana, for example; in animals, it has been linked to an increase infetal deaths and malformations. 141Cocaine may decrease sperm concentration in semen, inducedeformities in the shape of the sperm, and reducethe motility after ejaculation. 142Men's precon- ceptual use of cocaine has been linked to cases ofneurological damage in children. EXERCISE The appropriate take-home message on exercise during pregnancy is not that women should exer- cise during pregnancy but that they may. Too often, women have heard that maybe they shouldlimit their exercise. It is not necessary to be sorestrictive in exercise during pregnancy, althoughcertain precautions should be observed. Despiteconflicting opinions, information on exercise and pregnancy is plentiful, and its message isclear: low-impact, moderate exercise is safeduring pregnancy. In certain instances, exercise can prove bene- cial to the pregnant woman and her child. Exer-cise can reduce the length of hospitalization,reduce the incidence of cesarean section, andresult in a healthier baby with a higher birthweight. The advantages also extend to the preg-nant mom to be. Women who exercise duringpregnancy seem to do a better job at maintainingtheir ideal body weight after pregnancy and haveless discomfort during their pregnancy. See the sidebars for some helpful guidelines for exercising during pregnancy. Contraindications to Exercise During Pregnancy There are instances when exercise should be avoided during pregnancy. These include: pre-eclampsia, pr preterm labor, persistent second or thirdtrimester bleeding, incompetent cervix, or signs ofintrauterine growth retardation.COMMON COMPLAINTS AND DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY Most problems experienced during pregnancy are a result of the immense hormonal changes, nutri-tional deciencies, and shift in weight distributionthat happens as a result of sudden weight gain.Backache, digestive discomfort, fatigue, swelling,and mood changes are almost inevitable. With the judicious use of rest, exercise, and nutrition, most women can successfully weatherthe hormonal roller coaster ride of pregnancy.Walking a mile a day is unanimously recom- Safety Tips for Exercising While Pregnant 1. Drink enough water or other fluids during and after exercise to prevent dehydration and hypovolemia. 2. Wear clothing that allows for adequate ventila- tion and prevention of hyperthermia while exercising. 3. Your exercise regimen should emphasize low- impact activities, such as stationary bicycling, swimming, walking, and low-impact aerobics. 4. Do not exercise if you have a fever.5. Supine exercise (exercises in which you lie on your back) should be avoided, especially in the third trimester, as they may reduce blood supply to the fetus. 6. Exercises that require repetitive bouncing and jerky movements and exercises requiring balanceshould be avoided, especially in the third trimester. 7. Activities that involve potential low-oxygen states, such as scuba diving and mountainclimbing, are contraindicated. 8. Be sure to follow a diet that emphasizes com- plex carbohydrates to replace muscle glycogen lost during exercise, thereby minimizing the riskof fetal ketosis (elevated ketones in the bodytissues). 9. Participation in competitive team sports is acceptable in the rst 15 weeks of pregnancy,although there are potential but unproved risksfor fetal loss from pelvic trauma, abdominaltrauma, or both. 10. Avoid exercises such as weight lifting, especially in the third trimester.294WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE although it may be linked to an increase in thy- roid hormone (T4) effects on smooth musclerelaxation in the stomach. Physical exercise, espe-cially walking, is recommended for morningsickness. Low blood sugar is implicated in thenausea of early pregnancy and can be regulatedby eating smaller meals more often, eating high-protein snacks before sleeping, and eatingunsalted crackers or matzo before getting out ofbed in the morning. Insufcient B vitamins may be associated with morning sickness; pregnant women areoften decient in B 6as well as folic acid (the need for which increases during pregnancy). Foodsrich in B vitamins\u2014such as nutritional yeast,yogurt, bee pollen, spirulina, wheat germ, wholegrains, egg yolk, cabbage, and organic organmeats\u2014might be sufcient to alleviate morningsickness; if not, a B-50 vitamin supplement maybe needed during the rst trimester. Anise, fennel, peppermint, chamomile, or spearmint teas are all helpful; raspberry leaf tea,sipped before getting out of bed in the morning,may help. Wild yam root, according to herbalistSusun Weed, is \"specic and powerful for nauseaof pregnancy.\" 140As we discussed earlier in this chapter, studies have shown ginger root to beextremely effective in the treatment of the nauseaSummary of Exercise Guidelines 1. Regular frequency of exercise is preferable to sporadic physical activity. 2. Guidelines for exercising safely during pregnancy should be followed. (See other sidebars in thissection.) 3. Intensity of exercise should be monitored according to symptoms, and exhaustive exerciseshould be avoided. 4. Adequate caloric and nutrient intake should be maintained. 5. Adequate hydration, proper clothing, and avoid- ance of hot, humid environments should aug-ment heat dissipation, especially in the rst trimester. mended by researchers and birth supporters, as is eating healthy (preferably organic) foods everyday (including protein, whole grains, fruits, andvegetables). I recommend that if a pregnantwoman eats meat and/or dairy products, theseshould be \"free range\" and organic, or at least freefrom the articial hormones and pesticides usedin the agricultural processes. Dairy products havesome of the highest concentration of estrogen-mimicking articial compounds and growth hor-mones. Xenoestrogens from pesticides are alsosuspected of causing genetic damage. Morning Sickness One of the rst and perhaps most annoying com- plaints of pregnancy is the nausea (and vomiting)of \"morning sickness,\" which generally stopsbeing a problem after the rst trimester. No onereally knows what causes morning sickness,Tips for Safe Weight Training During Pregnancy 1. Do not compete, not even with yourself. 2. Begin with very light weights. 3. Avoid holding your breath while lifting. Breathe in during relaxing part of exercise and breatheout during effort part of exercise. 4. Rest between exercises. 5. Take a mouthful of pure water between exercises. 6. Do not lift while lying on your back. Pregnant women should not lie on their backs while exer-cising, especially after the sixth month, because blood supply may be reduced to the fetus. 7. Stay cool. Exercise increases body temperature, which may threaten the health of the fetus.Keep your temperature below 100 degrees. Dress lightly in warm weather. 8. Warm up for three to ve minutes before per- forming weight-lifting exercises. (See \"JointWarming Exercises\" in Appendix A.) 9. Perform a few basic stretches of muscles used during the exercise session at the end of the workout. (See Appendix A.) 10. See Appendix A for the \"Speak Pregnancy Exercises.\"295PREGNANCY and vomiting of severe morning sickness. Start with 250 mg of ginger root powder four timesdaily; increase if necessary. Fresh ginger root teacan be made by simmering slices of ginger root inboiling water for 15 minutes. Add honey to taste. Chronic Miscarriage/Abortion Ten percent of rst trimester pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. Women who miscarry always feel guilty; they often feelresponsible for the miscarriage. The fact is, how- ever, that nature is not perfect; all conceptions are not destined to become a child. Having twomiscarriages\u2014even in a row\u2014is not necessarilyabnormal. The causes of miscarriage includeunknown factors, stressors, environmental factors(toxic substances in food, water, and air and pollu-tants in the workplace), smoking, drinking alco-hol, dietary deciencies, and fetal abnormalities.As discussed earlier in the nutrition section, lowzinc intake has been associated with spontaneousabortion and premature delivery, and vitamin Esupplementation and bioflavonoids may help toprevent miscarriage. In addition, Susun Weed liststhe following herbs as being used in traditionalherbal medicine for preventing miscarriage: 140 Black haw root. This is especially effective. Drink one or two cups of tea or one-halfcup of infusion daily as soon as pregnancy isknown; use throughout entire pregnancy ifdesired. False unicorn root. This is recommended especially for women who have experiencedrepeated miscarriages. Take three drops oftincture four to ve times daily from pre-conception through the rst trimester. Wild yam root. For threatened miscarriage, make a strong tea by steeping one teaspoonof wild yam root in two cups hot water for15 minutes; take two to four ounces every30 minutes. The tincture is less effective andmay induce nausea or vomiting.Preeclampsia or Eclampsia (Toxemia) Preeclampsia is a dangerous condition that may develop in the third trimester of pregnancy. Itincludes hypertension (high blood pressure),edema, and protein in the urine. About 6 percentof all pregnant women will develop preeclampsiasometime after completing 20 weeks of gesta-tion; eclampsia occurs in 0.1 percent of cases. 143 Western medicine believes that there is no way to prevent preeclampsia but that it can bekept from progressing to eclampsia with goodprenatal care. disagrees,calling preeclampsia \"the of malnutritionduring pregnancy,\" and says it is easily preventedby eating 60 to 80 grams of protein daily, gettingenough salt, foods high in calcium, adequatecalories, and nourishing herbal supports likeraspberry, nettle, and dandelion leaves through-out pregnancy. 140TheHarvard Guide to Women's Health links preeclampsia to very young or much older women (over 45), women with underlyingmedical problems (high blood pressure, kidneydisorders, autoimmune disorders, and diabetes),and multiple births. 144 Once preeclampsia is diagnosed, a skilled professional must be called in to help manage thetreatment, since the condition is serious enoughto threaten the mother's life and damage thefetus. Potassium levels must be increased (inaddition to prescription potassium, eating potatopeels and bananas helps; also mint, chicory, anddandelion leaves). The sodium-potassium rationeeds balancing (drink raw beet juice, up to fourounces daily); supplement with seaweed to your daily diet. TheHarvard Guide expresses the current allo- pathic medical perspective when it states unequiv-ocally: \"The only denitive cure for preeclampsiais delivery of the baby.\" 144However, women with preeclampsia are generally sent to bedrest unlessthe diastolic blood pressure signicantly preterm, efforts are296WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE made to conrm fetal maturity or mature fetal lungs medically before delivery. Usually the earlierin the pregnancy that pregnancy-induced hyper-tension occurs, the more severe it becomes. Themajority of cases at term are usually benign andeasily managed. Catastrophic outcomes of tox-emia include seizures, strokes, and failure of theheart, liver, lungs, or kidneys. Since preeclampsia is characterized by high blood pressure, it stands to reason that yoga,meditation, and stress reduction techniqueswould be a useful complement to nutritional,botanical, and conventional medications. Heartburn, Gas, and Constipation Hormonal imbalances during pregnancy may result in softening of the smooth muscle found inthe walls of the digestive tract. The consequentreduction in peristaltic movement causes food topass more slowly through the esophagus, stom-ach, and small and large intestines to the rectum,inducing gas and constipation. Heartburn can becaused by the softening of the muscular valvebetween the esophagus and the stomach so thatpartially digested, acidic food may leak back upinto the esophagus, causing a burning sensation inthe chest. Heartburn and constipation are gener-ally experienced in the later stages of pregnancy. Susun Weed 140and Rosemary Gladstar145 emphasize eating small meals frequently, chewingfood carefully, and avoiding acid-causing andgreasy foods. Both recommend papaya (especiallyraw, but also in tablets and papaya leaf) for theenzymes, as well as fennel and anise seeds; Glad-star also recommends cumin and dill seeds inaddition to the fennel and anise, suggesting anold-fashioned remedy for digestive disturbances:combine these four seeds and chew them beforeand after meals. Be aware that coffee and cigarettes increase heartburn by irritating the stomach, and remem-ber that whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetablescombined with nonstressful exercise are the bestsolutions to constipation.Varicose Veins Varicose veins can occur in the legs or in the anal or vulvar areas in pregnancy, due to hormonalsoftening of the muscular walls of the veins com-bined with the extra weight of pregnancy. Simpleyoga and other nonstressful exercise can help byimproving circulation from the lower body up tothe trunk; it is also good to get your weight offyour legs and put your feet up whenever possible. A lack of nutritional elements in the diet, especially vitamin C, rutin, and other bioflavo-noids, combined with the extra stress on the cir-culatory system, can cause the fragile capillariesto break. A tendency toward varicose veins andhemorrhoids may also be inherited. Eat foodshigh in vitamin C and bioflavonoids, such asbuckwheat, nettles, rose hips, oranges, lemons,grapefruit, peppers, whole and the white rinds organically growncitrus fruits; also include garlic, onion, chives,and leeks. These help maintain elasticity in theveins and capillaries. Lecithin, vitamin E, andrutin supplements are also recommended for pre-venting and repairing varicose veins. Backache It may not be possible to nd an herb that is safe during pregnancy that is also a good treatment for backache. Gentle yoga stretches; walking andswimming; chiropractic adjustments; physicaltherapy; sleeping with pillows to support the legs,back, and belly; wearing flat heels; and gettingplenty of minerals can all help in easing backache. Bladder Infections Blood volume increases 50 percent during preg- nancy, causing the kidneys to work harder andmaking the urinary system more vulnerable tostress and infection. Especially in the lasttrimester, burning or frequent urination orcramping in the abdomen may indicate a bladderinfection. Many herbs and nutrients can be usedto treat urinary tract infections, although not allof them are safe while pregnant.297PREGNANCY Uva ursi is safe and is one of the most effec- tive herbs to prevent recurrent bladder infectionswhile also having antimicrobial activity in acuteinfections. Used in leaf form, place the leaf in atea ball and place in water that has already cometo a boil. Let it steep for ve minutes, then drinkone cup every three hours for two days, then onecup three times a day for an additional week. Vitamin C and unsweetened cranberry juice can be used to acidify the urine and ght theinfection by interfering with the ability of thebacteria to stick to the bladder wall. Take 1,000mg of vitamin C three to four times per day for up to one week. Eight to sixteen ounces ofunsweetened cranberry juice per day is recom-mended. Mannose, the simple sugar contained incranberries, is a very effective and safe treatmentduring pregnancy. D-mannose adheres to thebladder epithelium and interferes with the abilityof infection-causing bacteria such as E. coli to adhere to the bladder wall. 146 Lactobacillus supplements are also safe in pregnancy. From the studies that are available,probiotics appear to be benecial for preventingrecurrent bladder infections in women. SeeChapter 5 for further directions on treating blad-der infections. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Nothing would be better in the realm of child- birth than for peace to be made between thosewho endorse modern obstetrics and hospitalbirths and those who applaud the naturalness of pregnancy and labor and prefer home birthwhen uncomplicated. There is merit in bothapproaches. Like all options in health care, onlythe pregnant woman can decide which is rightfor her\u2014but with better cooperation betweenthe groups, her choice would be easier. When childbirth goes normally\u2014which is most of the time\u2014it can be safely managed athome. Unfortunately, we have no way of know-ing if a low-risk birth will go awry, and homebirths are not equipped to handle complications such as profound fetal distress, prolapsed umbil-ical cords, and maternal hemorrhage. Moreover,these complications can be signicantly wors-ened during emergency transport to the hospital. Modern obstetrics was born after a time when all births occurred at home, no matterwhat, and maternal mortality was substantiallyhigher than now. Forceps\u2014we now groan attheir mention\u2014were a lifesaving invention formothers as well as their babies, because prior totheir use, both mother and baby sometimes diedof the \"obstructed\" pelvis, often after laboring fordays. Life without cesarean sections was also lifewith many more maternal deaths. Where is the happy medium? How can we avail ourselves of the truly lifesaving aspects ofobstetrics and eliminate the excess? The bestanswer I have is to be as educated as possibleabout options and be open to the obstetrical real-ity that things do not always go as we hope andplan. Be flexible. If possible, have a relationshipwith a conventional provider that you see at leastonce during your pregnancy. One good option is to consider hospital- based midwife services. The midwives are verycommitted to natural childbirth and, unlike thetypical hospital birth, are present and supportivethroughout your whole labor. They work with a backup physician, someone presumably of their choosing. Even if the physician is called, themidwife will continue to attend you as her pri-mary patient and advocate for your wishes. TheC-section rates for midwife-assisted births arelow, their respect for the birthing process high. Ifyou choose an out-of-hospital birth, be awarethat the main reasons women eventually come tothe hospital are for prolonged labor and/orpain\u2014not emergencies. Have a plan worked outfor what you will do in that situation. Conventional obstetrics need not be as off- putting as many assume. There are providers whosupport a woman's wish to have her birth natu-rally. They also support women who choose to298WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE have their labor pains assuaged. Women are offered the choice of intravenous medication orepidural medication. When an epidural is givenat no sooner than 4 to 5 cm dilation in a womandelivering her rst child, the cesarean section rateis not increased over the rate of those womenwho go without epidural anesthesia. Cesarean section rates vary among physicians and institutions; it is reasonable to ask a providerfor numbers. Around 15 percent is acceptable,although some will be as high as 20 percent; itdepends somewhat on how \"high-risk\" the prac-tice is. Moms or babies at higher risk may need tobe delivered more urgently, and therefore moreoften by C-section. Most doctors do not take thedecision to operate lightly, and your doctorshould always discuss the issues with you clearly.Nothing will ever happen without your informedconsent. You never need to have the drug Pitocinto stimulate labor or any other adjunct to laborunless you are in agreement. I encourage womento make their needs and wishes known in allaspects of their health care. That is the only waythe system can become responsive to the evolvingand varied needs of women. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Healthy women with normal pregnancies have the lowest risk of complications, so medical man-agement choices are largely personal. Most non-M.D. providers use a list of criteria to determinethe low-risk or high-risk status of a pregnantwoman. The criteria should address the mother'sblood pressure, the risk of bleeding, and the lie orposition of the baby in the uterus, as explained inthe following sections. Blood Pressure Hypertensive disorders are the most common disorder of pregnancy, affecting as many as 5 to10 percent of pregnant women. 147One of the main reasons practitioners see pregnant womenso often is to check their blood pressure. Most women's blood pressures goes way down in preg-nancy. Women with chronic hypertension thatdoes not stabilize at a safe level during pregnancyhave a higher risk of smaller, more at-risk babies.The women themselves are at risk of developingthe complications of hypertension, such as renaldisease. Labor is sometimes induced at term\u201438 weeks or so\u2014to lighten the load on motherand baby. Preeclampsia is a different hypertensive disor- der of pregnancy. It is most often a mild disease,characterized by the development of hyperten-sion toward the end of pregnancy. At its worst, itcan cause seizures or eclampsia and signicanthematological abnormalities, including loss ofthe ability to clot blood. Kidney failure canoccur. Usually none of these things happen, butbecause the severity of disease does not predictwhich women will have seizures, women withpreeclampsia require protection against this riskwith magnesium sulfate that is given duringlabor and for 24 hours afterward. Mild forms of preeclampsia are treated with bedrest. Severe forms are treated with bedrest inthe hospital. All efforts are made to avoid deliv-ering babies very prematurely. However, whenmaternal health is signicantly compromised,this measure may need to be taken. When severe,there is no cure for this disorder but delivery. It isthought to be caused when the mother's immunesystem is intolerant of the fetus's foreign geneticmakeup, and thus it is extremely rare to have asecond severe case in subsequent pregnancieswith the same partner. Bleeding Bleeding is never normal in pregnancy. Although it doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem,it must be assumed to do so until proven other-wise. Placental abruption is a disorder in whichthe placenta pulls away from the uterus prema-turely, causing bleeding and contractions thatcan be life threatening to both the woman and299PREGNANCY the fetus. Because the placenta is so large, a lot can pull away before things are hugely compro-mised, but an evaluation is in order. Placenta previa\u2014in which the placenta covers the opening to the cervical canal\u2014canalso cause signicant hemorrhage and is classi- cally heralded by a small, otherwise insignicant\"sentinel bleed.\" Ultrasound can diagnose thiseasily. No pregnant woman should have a vaginalexam in the third trimester without rst usingultrasound to locate the placenta. Digital explo-ration can cause signicant blood loss in the caseof placenta previa. Abnormal Lie Many hospitals will support the vaginal birth of a healthy frank breech infant (butt rst).Footling breech\u2014with the feet rst\u2014is unsafevaginally, because the feet can come downthrough the partially dilated cervix\u2014as can thecord\u2014before the entire infant will t. An alter-native to delivering an infant in the frank breechposition is to rotate the fetus, or rather coax thefetus to rotate, from outside, which is successfulabout half the time. Neither of these procedures should be undertaken at home. If the fetus measures signicantly large or small at any point, this should prompt at least anultrasound. Fetal abnormalities associated withpoor growth or too much or too little fluid canpresent this way, and these are best prepared forin advance of delivery. Size discrepancy is often assimple as an error in dating, but guring out theright due date is still very helpful. The pregnancies of women with any major underlying health problem\u2014such as diabetes orheart or respiratory disorders signicant enoughto require ongoing surveillance in the nonpreg-nant state\u2014should be managed with input froma licensed provider. So should those of womenwith kidney disease or autoimmune disorderslike lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. All of theseconditions can make a pregnancy much riskierfor both mother and child. Ultrasound can beinvaluable in assessing fetal growth and well-being. Ongoing surveillance of the pregnancycan alert the woman to any medical problems asearly as possible.This page intentionally left blank 301OVERVIEW When nally we understand premenstrual syn- drome (PMS), we will have gone a long waytoward understanding the interplay between thecultural, physiologic, and emotional factors thatregularly affect women's lives during the premen-struum. A huge piece of work will have beendone toward improving women's health. Dr. Maria Gurevich has written, \"The persist- ence of PMS as a medical category despite theinconclusiveness of the research, suggests thatPMS is not simply a biomedical entity . . . of unarticu-lated, beliefs about the nature ofscience, biology, health and femaleness.\" 1 Maintaining good health and attitude through all phases of the menstrual cycle is just not assimple as correcting female physiology gone awrybut also involves on some level transforming ourcultural image of women's reproductive health,specically menstruation, from negative (the\"curse\") to positive. However far-reaching these ideals, what we are after is practical help for the woman who suffers premenstrually. While precisely dening PMSremains scientically challenging, any woman cantell you what it is, and a great many will tell youthat they have it. Dening terms carefully helps toextract \"pure\" PMS from an assortment of over-lapping conditions. Eighty percent of women experience premen- strual emotional or physical changes, whereas only about 20 to 40 percent of these women havedifculties as a result. A much smaller number,about 2.5 to 5 percent, 2feel these changes have a signicantly negative impact on their lives to thepoint where work, relationships, or home life arejeopardized. Most women who have symptomsdo not seek medical care but instead self-treat,making this an ideal arena for natural self-care. Some 150 symptoms have been ascribed to PMS\u2014most commonly feelings of anxiousness(premenstrual tension was the rst name given to this syndrome), irritability, and anger ormoods vacillating unpredictably among thethree. Some women feel predominantly sad orself-deprecating, others simply fatigued andlethargic. Physical changes include bloating,breast tenderness, food cravings, headache, andgastric upset. No particular assortment of symp-toms is diagnostic; it is the regular recurrence of symptoms on a monthly basis, just before the menstrual period, that matters. Symptomsusually last a few days to a week before menses,sometimes two weeks, beginning at midcyclewith ovulation and lasting until the menses startsor into the rst few days of the flow. As important as the regular timing of the arrival of these symptoms is the predictable reliefand complete resolution experienced with theonset of menses or within one to two days of themenstrual flow beginning. PMS symptoms,whatever they may be for a particular woman, goaway completely just as regularly as they arrive.Most who study this entity require that a womanbe able to predict in advance for at least a coupleof cycles when symptoms will come and whenthey will leave to warrant a diagnosis of PMS. 3 It is important to check for other possible sources of the symptoms that might indicate med-ical conditions a woman may suffer from evenmore dramatically in the premenstruum. Womenwho are afflicted with asthma, migraines, epilepsy,herpes, or disordered eating, 4for example, often worsening, a premenstrual magnica-17PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMECHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

In addition, obesity has been found to be anindependent risk factor for PMS, and those with abody mass index of greater than 30 had a threefoldincrease in risk for PMS. 5T reatment for the under- lying condition in these cases is more likely to eliminate the premenstrual aggravation than istreatment aimed solely at PMS. Among women self-presenting to PMS clin- ics for medical care, fully 75 percent had anotherdiagnosis that contributed signicantly to theirsymptoms\u2014major depressive or other mood dis-orders being most prominent. 6About 10 percent had early menopausal symptoms, 10 percentwere affected by hormonal contraceptives, andabout 5 percent each were found to have eatingdisorders or substance abuse issues predominat-ing. Anyone who considers her PMS to be signif-icantly bothersome might be wise to check withher practitioner should her efforts with self-carefail. There may be other, more effective treat-ments, either for the PMS itself or for an under-lying condition. Most women feel different emotionally and physically during the premenstruum. The termmolimina refers to those changes women notice that let them know their menses is approaching:appetite changes, swelling, or menstrual-likecramps. A recurrent pattern of mild but noticeablechanges provides evidence that cycles are ovulatory.Some women enjoy positive changes: enhancedcreativity, heightened sexual desire, intellectualclarity, and feelings of happiness and well-being. 7 It is difcult to identify cause in a condition that overlaps so broadly with normal physiology,affects so many, and has such a wide array ofsymptoms. Many theories have been exploredand none found completely satisfying. Mostlikely this is because there is such a complexinteraction of factors both physiologic and social.While absolute levels of estrogen and proges-terone are no different in PMS sufferers, weknow that in women in whom both hormonesare pharmaceutically blocked, PMS diminishesby 75 percent. 3Blocking progesterone only using Ru-486 did not have this effect, nor did itworsen symptoms. 8It is likely that ovarian hor- mones affect the neurotransmitter, neuroen-docrine, and circadian systems that influencemood and behavior differently in each of us. Asresearch continues, we are learning more aboutthe role of neurotransmitters, neurophysiology,and electrical conduction in the brain in thedevelopment, severity, and treatment of PMS. It is interesting to look at the work done on serotonin to appreciate the role our social envi-ronment may have on PMS. Anita Rapkin, M.D.,studied serotonin levels in women with and with-out PMS and found that serotonin levels fell afterovulation in women with PMS. 9Those without PMS had much higher levels of serotonin duringthe last half of the menstrual cycle. Abnormalserotonin metabolism has long been linked todepression. Elevating serotonin levels is how thepopular antidepressant Prozac works. There is evidence that estrogen levels affect the serotonin system. More interesting, studies inanimals and humans have demonstrated howsocial interactions in groups can affect our sero-tonin levels. Dominant animals in groups havehigher levels of serotonin, which then fall if theyare removed from their prominent position.Serotonin levels rise in the animals that replacethem in dominance. 9Rapkin postulates that women without PMS may offset ovulation-induced susceptibility to low serotonin and isola-tion behavior through interacting more with\"desirable others.\" In other words, women ableto manipulate their social environment success-fully are less susceptible to the mood conse-quences of low serotonin. One begins to see how our culture's historical attitude of embarrassment or distaste around men-struation might contribute to susceptible women'sneurotransmitters being adversely affected at aphysiologically critical time, resulting in moodswings, anger, and irritability. This is congruentwith the views of feminist writers who criticize the303PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME medicalization of PMS symptoms as disease, argu- ing that medicine has tended to pathologizebehaviors that do not conform to the unnaturalyet pervasive female stereotype. Certainly, noother named condition in women is so commonand so little understood and yet contains so manysignicant pieces to our lives. In the last few years, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) has been proposed by some tobe a distinct entity clinically different from PMS.Many consider it a new psychiatric disorder.Other experts believe that PMDD is simplysevere PMS with more impairment of normal lifefunctions. However it is classied, PMDD ismore severe than PMS, and the diagnostic crite-ria for this severity are met by only 3 to 8 percentof women. PMDD includes a minimum of ve specic symptoms that occur during the latterpart of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle,right before the onset of menses. 10 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) , a woman would be diagnosed with PMDD if she experi-enced ve or more of the following symptomsduring most of the week before her menses, theyinterfere signicantly with daily life and relation-ships, and they have occurred in the last year. Atleast one of the rst four symptoms must also bepresent to lead to a diagnosis of PMDD. 1. Signicantly depressed mood, hopeless- ness, self-defeating thoughts 2. Signicant anxiety, tension, feeling irritable, uptight 3. Sudden mood changes of sadness, weepiness, or easily feeling rejected 4. Anger or irritability or increased conflict with others 5. Lack of motivation for usual activities6. Difculty concentrating7. Lethargy, easily fatigued, low energy8. Changes in appetite, overeating, food cravings 9. Hypersomnia or insomnia 10. Overwhelmed, feeling out of control11. Additional physical symptoms: breast tenderness, swelling, headaches, joint ormuscle pain, bloating, weight gainKEY CONCEPTS PMS is characterized by cyclic symptoms during the second half of the menstrual cycle with a symptom-free phase during the rst half of thecycle. Premenstrual magnication may manifest as an increase in chronic symptoms during the secondhalf of the cycle. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is thought by some to be distinct from PMS, and by others to be a more severe form of PMS. Thehallmarks are when a woman experiences 5 or more of 11 key symptoms. The best evaluation and determination of PMS is a symptom diary relating symptoms to the men- strual cycle. Testing should be limited but should rule out thyroid problems and blood sugar problems in particular. Medical evaluation should be done to reveal concurrent disorders of depression and anxiety. Treatment should provide symptom relief while also addressing any need for lifestyle changesand treating problems in the neuroendocrineconnections (central nervous system brain chem- istry as it is affected by estrogen and proges- terone in particular).PREVENTION A whole foods diet with minimal intake of sugar, rened carbohydrates, dairy products, caffeine, and saturated fats Increase dietary ber including whole grains Increase essential fatty acids from nuts, seeds, and sh Stress management Regular aerobic exercise Weight loss304WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE The specic cause of PMDD has not been deter- mined, but the dysregulation of serotonin ap-pears to be a key feature. 11 OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Historically, conventional mainstream medicine has not been able to offer women a known causefor PMS, nor has it been able to offer a manage-ment approach short of pharmaceuticals with asmany side effects as relief. Fortunately, newresearch has led to a better understanding ofPMS and to new and more successful conven-tional and natural treatments. Self-care with nat-ural therapies is the dominant method womenuse to manage PMS. Women have clearly takenthis familiar monthly problem into their ownhands and more often than not have determinedwhat works for them. Fortunately, PMS is a con-dition for which inadequate self-treatment yieldsdissatisfaction rather than dangerous side effectsor progression of a serious disease. In an attempt to offer women rationales for viable natural treatments for the relief of PMS,many theories have been offered. While comfort-ing in their attempts to analyze the syndrome,these theories are poorly conrmed in researchstudies yet are still used as a basis for many natu-ral therapies. Popular models such as hormonal-based therapeutics, including elevated estrogenlevels and reduced progesterone levels; elevatedprolactin; and increased aldosterone are not ade-quately conrmed in research. Even though agiven therapy may work for a number of women,its mechanism may still elude our true under-standing. These models are tidy and convenientfor a logical train of thought, but, due to theirlimited ability to help many women, they distractus from potentially having a more accurate under-standing and more effective treatment options. Clinically, I have not usually found it useful to use classication systems commonly used byalternative practitioners like PMS-A (anxiety),PMS-C (carbohydrate craving), PMS-D (depres-sion), or PMS-H (hyperhydration). Yes, women may have one or more of these symptoms char-acterized in the particular classication, buttreating women for the correlating hormonalimbalance has not typically been productive inmy experience. In the more difcult cases, it isoften necessary to expand one's thinking, how-ever, and it may occasionally be helpful toexplore some of these theories. Another basic foundation for many alterna- tive practitioners in treating PMS is the conceptof the liver's role in the detoxication process. Ifthe liver function is compromised, then estrogenmetabolism is inadequate, leading to excess estro-gen levels and what is often described as estrogendominance. A \"sluggish liver\" is then addressedwith various dietary, nutrient, and herbal inter-ventions. It is important to understand that thisis a theory with much speculation and minimalscientic support in its connection with PMS.One cannot argue, however, about the centralrole of the liver and its varied metabolic processeswith subsequent influence on the biochemistryof hormone and enzymatic pathways. There mayin fact be a role for liver function in PMS, butwhat that is remains unknown. On the otherhand, improving liver function pays off in otherways, like exercise does, with many positivehealth benets to numerous body systems. Numerous natural alternative therapies are available, including lifestyle changes, vitamin andmineral supplementation, herbal medicines, andnatural hormones. Many of these have demon-strated their effectiveness in standard scienticstudies. But at least an equal number have eithershown no effect or an effect that was not signi-cantly greater than the placebo effect. Herein liesone of the curiosities of medicine, elegantly por-trayed with PMS: why do conventional scienticstudies fail to demonstrate success with many ofthese natural therapies that women consistentlyrely on for successful monthly treatments? Perhaps the answer is as simple as that statis- tically signicant is not the same as clinically 305PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME relevant: what works for one person is different than what works for another. We are truly indi-viduals with our own unique physiology, stres-sors, and psychological makeup. Double-blind,placebo-controlled scientic studies attempt tond what works for as many people as possible,not what works best for an individual. Even in studies where the placebo response is given credit, perhaps the belief that the mind canheal the body is the real explanation. The inter-action between neurotransmitters, neurophysiol-ogy, the body's steroids, circadian systems, mood,and behavior plus plants and nutrients fromnature may remain scientically elusive, but, tothe credit of women, we have instinctually comeupon safe and effective natural solutions. One of the signicant benets of treating PMS naturally is that it serves as a touchstone to moti-vate women to make lifestyle changes that have apositive cascade effect on their general health. Nutrition Women who have PMS typically have dietary habits that are worse than the standard Americandiet. In a nutritional analysis published in 1983,Guy Abraham reported that PMS patients con-sumed 62 percent more rened carbohydratesthan women who did not have PMS, 275 percentmore rened sugar, 79 percent more dairy prod-ucts, 78 percent more sodium, 53 percent lessiron, 77 percent less manganese, and 52 percentless zinc. 12A diet higher in dairy products can also contribute to PMS symptoms such as anxiety, irri-tability, and nervous tension. A dietary survey of39 patients with PMS and 14 women with noPMS found that the women with PMS consumedvefold more dairy products and threefold morerened sugar than those women without PMS. 13 Dairy products and calcium interfere with magne-sium absorption, and rened sugar increases theurinary excretion of magnesium. 14 Further data conrm these ndings by showing that women with PMS have increasedconsumption of dietary fat, carbohydrates, andsimple sugars and decreased consumption of pro- tein. This study also showed that PMS sufferershad a higher number of \"eating incidences\" thanwomen who did not meet the criteria for PMS. 15 These increases in eating incidence and carbohy-drate craving in general during PMS may be due in part to a decrease in serotonin during theluteal phase in PMS sufferers, and it follows thatserotonergic treatments like SSRIs or 5HTP maybe helpful in controlling not only mood changesduring this period but also food cravings. 16 It is these same food cravings that often serve to worsen PMS symptoms, leading to a viciouscycle of poor dietary choices and mood distur-bance. It has been suggested, however, thatingesting high amounts of carbohydrates may bea form of \"self-medication\" in that it leads to atransient increase in tryptophan, a precursor toserotonin, and in moodand energy. 17Choosing high-quality carbohy- drates (including whole grains such as oatmeal,brown rice, barley, rye, and whole wheat)throughout the luteal phase may help decreasePMS mood symptoms. Another nutritional factor in PMS is the effect of rened sugars on the retention ofsodium. After a large intake of sugar, insulinincreases quickly, which causes sodium and waterretention. Symptoms such as swelling in thehands and feet, abdominal bloating, and breastengorgement and tenderness result. Complexcarbohydrates are preferred over simple sugars(white sugar, white flour, white rice, etc.) becausethey stimulate insulin release much more slowlyand in a more sustained manner, thereby pre-venting many of these water-retention symp-toms. In fact, one study found that consumptionof a low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diet alle-viated premenstrual breast tenderness. 18Many other symptoms of PMS may be exacerbated bythe intake of sugary foods and beverages. 19 Excessive and incorrect prostaglandin (PG) synthesis has been implicated in the pathogenesisof PMS, and a deciency of prostaglandin E1306WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE (PgE1) in the central nervous system has been proposed to be involved in PMS.20Many nutri- ents are important for the synthesis of PgE1.These include magnesium, linoleic acid (anessential fatty acid), vitamin B 6, zinc, vitamin C, and vitamin B 3. On the other hand, arachidonic acid is a precursor to PgE2, which has antagonis-tic effects with regard to PgE1. Think of PgE1 asthe good guy and PgE2 as the bad guy. Vegetableoils are rich sources of linoleic acid, and animalfats are the main dietary sources of arachidonicacid; therefore, patients with PMS would be wiseto decrease their consumption of animal fats andincrease their consumption of polyunsaturatedvegetable oils so that they have more of the goodguy, PgE1. A diet high in the other nutrientsmentioned would also promote the synthesis ofPgE1. We will discuss these more in the nutri-tional supplement section. A recent study showed that an increase in C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, was positively correlated with the severity of both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS, 21providing more support for the use of anti- inflammatory dietary choices for PMS sufferers.Foods that can stimulate inflammatory pathwaysinclude, among others, sugar, poultry, eggs, cheese,milk, white flour, white rice, and partially hydro-genated oils. Foods that can reduce inflammationinclude fresh fruits and vegetables, sh, grass-fedbeef, nuts, seeds, curry powder, garlic, and onions. Limiting the dietary intake of salt can be helpful to some women. Table salt enhances theresponse to the ingestion of glucose, conse-quently increasing the insulin response. As men-tioned earlier, an increase in insulin causesswelling through water retention. Many women with breast symptoms in their premenstrual phase benet from avoiding caf-feine. Even though scientic studies are contro-versial on this subject, the practical results speakfor themselves. Restricting the intake of coffee(both caffeinated and decaffeinated), black tea,chocolate, and caffeine-containing soft drinkswill especially benet those with fluid-retention symptoms. (See Chapter 7 on brocystic breastsfor more information about the detrimentaleffects of caffeine.) It is estimated that there are two million alco- holic women in the reproductive age group inthe United States. 22Sixty-seven percent of these women relate their drinking to their menstrualcycles, and drinking bouts occur usually duringthe premenstrual phase. 23Alcohol may also play a role in the reactive hypoglycemia of PMS aswell as worsening a variety of other PMS-relatedsymptoms. 24 Soy isoflavones may be benecial for PMS in addition to the other women's health conditionsthey seem to positively affect. A recent study sug-gests that increased consumption of dietary soymay be related to a reduction in PMS symp-toms. 25Another study compared the effect of isolated soy protein containing 68 mg/day soyisoflavones with a placebo in a double-blind fash-ion and found that the soy protein was effectiveat reducing headache, breast tenderness, cramps,and edema after two cycles of treatment. 26 Nutritional Supplements It has been hypothesized that women with PMS are decient in certain nutrients. Nutritionalproles and biochemical and hematological eval-uations in 11 women with PMS showed thatthey did indeed have various nutritional decien-cies. 27Other biochemical investigations have found no evidence that premenstrual symptomsare caused by either absolute or relative nutri-tional deciencies. 28, 29Dietary Recommendations Reduce the intake of alcohol, caffeine, salt, sugar, rened carbohydrates, and dairy products. Increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, sh, soy, and healthy oils such as sh, flaxseed, and olive oils.307PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Nutritional supplements are widely used in the treatment of PMS despite the inconsistentevidence to support their use. Again we have adiscrepancy between scientic information andwhat a signicant number of women report. Apossible explanation for this discrepancy mightbe that vitamin and mineral levels in the periph-eral blood (which is measured in a laboratory) donot parallel the levels in the central nervoussystem (CNS). Researchers J. C. Chuong and E. B. Dawson state, \"It is possible that thebioavailability of vitamins and minerals in theCNS, which is related to the activities of severalneurotransmitters (including serotonin), couldchange during the luteal phase in some patientswith PMS. As a result, premenstrual symptomsoccur. However, these changes in vitamin andmineral lev els in the CNS may not show up in the peripheral blood levels.\" 30 Positive results seen in some studies with nutritional supplementation most likely repre-sent a pharmacological response to therapeuticdoses of vitamins or minerals rather than revers-ing an underlying deciency. Multiple vitamin and mineral supplements may be helpful for women with PMS. A studywas done in 1985 of Optivite, a rather typicalmultiple vitamin/mineral supplement. The quan-tities and proportions of vitamins and minerals in this supplement either met or exceeded the rec-ommended daily allowances except for calciumand vitamin D. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, 16 of 23 subjectsreported feeling better during the cycles in whichthey took the supplement, and 7 reported feelingbetter during the placebo cycles. 31These researchers also classied the patients into fourdifferent subgroups (PMS-A, PMS-C, PMS-D,PMS-H) and found that only two of the four sub-groups responded to this particular supplement. A second study on the same product was done in 1991 32to assess the effectiveness of a vitamin/mineral supplement in controllingsymptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Thisdouble-blind, randomized study of 44 women divided women with PMS into four subgroupsdepending on their symptoms. Subjects wererandomly assigned to receive either placebo or 6or 12 tablets of the supplement a day for threemenstrual cycles. All subjects had signicant dif-ferences in severity of symptoms between the fol-licular and luteal phase of the control cycle. T woPMS subgroups especially improved: PMS-A(nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, anxi-ety) and PMS-C (headaches, craving for sweets,increased appetite, heart pounding, fatigue).Supplementation with six tablets of Optivitedaily was associated with signicant reduction inall symptom categories, including those withPMS-D (depression, insomnia, forgetfulness,crying, and confusion). Those with PMS-H (premenstrual weight gain, breast tenderness,abdominal bloating, and swelling of the armsand legs) did not receive any benet. If 12 tabletswere taken, then there were signicant reduc-tions of symptoms in all groups. When selecting a multiple vitamin and min- eral supplement, I recommend one that has beenformulated especially for women, as these takeinto account the special nutritional needs ofwomen. Vitamin B 6.A rational basis for the use of vitamin B 6(pyridoxine) in the treatment of PMS was rst indicated by the work of Adams and hiscolleagues in 1973, 33although it had been pre- scribed since the 1940s. They reported successfultreatment with vitamin B 6of patients complain- ing of depression associated with oral contracep-tion. Since that time there have been over onedozen studies on vitamin B 6and PMS. Some of these have shown no effect from vitamin B 6, but most of the studies have shown that there was asubstantial and broad effect on the whole rangeof PMS symptoms. An overview of these studieshas been published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology . 34The studies have used anywhere from 50 to 500 mg per day.308WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Vitamin B 6is thought to be unique in its ability to increase the synthesis of several neuro-transmitters in the brain. These neurotransmittersinclude serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine,epinephrine, taurine, histamine. 35Lower levels of brain neurotransmitters such as serotoninand dopamine have been implicated in the etiol-ogy of PMS. 36In fact, a double-blind crossover trial demonstrated that 50 mg of B 6per day was effective at decreasing premenstrual depression,fatigue, and irritability. 37In addition, another study showed a synergistic effect of 50 mg of B 6 combined with 200 mg of magnesium in reducingpremenstrual anxiety. 38 Vitamin B 6supplementation is generally considered safe in dosages of 50 to 100 mg daily.When using dosages greater than 50 mg, it may be important to divide it into 50 mg dosagesthroughout the day to assure appropriate utiliza-tion by the liver. One should not exceed 200 mgtotal in one day in order to assure safety. Chronicintake of dosages greater than 500 mg per day canbe toxic if taken daily for many months or years.There are also a few rare reports of toxicity atchronic long-term dosages of 150 mg per day. 39 Vitamin B 6 50 mg 2-4 times per day Vitamin D. We don't normally think of vita- min D as a treatment for PMS. Recent researchhas shown, however, that increased intake of vita-min D in both dietary and supplement forms isinversely related to PMS symptoms. 40A combi- nation of vitamin D and calcium decreased thefrequency and severity of menstrual migrainesand other PMS symptoms. 41 Vitamin D Age 19-50: 200 IU per day Tolerable upper limit: 2,000 IU Vitamin E. Vitamin E is probably not a big player in PMS relief, although some studies have demonstrated a reduction in premenstrual nervous tension, headache, fatigue, depression,insomnia, and breast tenderness. 12, 42 Aberrant prostaglandin (PG) synthesis has been implicatedin PMS, and a deciency of prostaglandin E1(PgE1) has been proposed to be involved in PMSas well as an increase in another prostaglandincalled PgF2-alpha. It has been hypothesized thatvitamin E inhibits the negative prostaglandin(PgF2) and increases the PgE1. Women continueto use vitamin E to relieve the symptoms of breasttenderness before the period. Despite science thatdoes not conrm a statistically signicant benet,vitamin E remains an important part of self-care.This is discussed more in Chapter 7. Vitamin E 400-800 IU per day Essential Fatty Acids. The main strategy of supplementing with essential fatty acids is anattempt to raise the body's own formation ofPgE1. The most popular method of doing so hasbeen to supplement with evening primrose oil(EPO) products in order to supply increasedlevels of gamma linolenic acid. Although thereare several studies that show positive results,some of the studies did not include a placebogroup, and other studies did not show a statisti-cally signicant difference between the treatmentgroup and the placebo group. 43-45 Four double-blind, crossover, controlled trials of EPO have demonstrated a signicant effectover the placebo group. 46-49 One of these studies used three grams of EPO per day; the others usedfour grams per day. EPO has been shown to bemost effective for relieving clumsiness and head-aches, although all symptoms, including depres-sion, irritability, bloating, and breast tenderness,showed a marked improvement. Other sources ofoils that contain gamma linolenic acid (GLA)and raise PgE1 levels include borage oil, blackcurrant oil, and canola oil. Hemp oil contains avery small amount of GLA.309PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Another study looked at krill oil and its effec- tiveness at reducing symptoms of PMS. Krill oil isderived from plankton and is high in omega-3 fattyacids, bioflavonoids, and vitamins E and A. Thisstudy looked at two 1-gram capsules of krill oilversus sh oil in the management of PMS symp-toms and found it to be comparable at decreasingswelling, bloating, and weight gain and superior tosh oil in decreasing analgesic use, breast tender-ness, joint pain, dysmenorrhea, and emotionalsymptoms after 45 to 90 days of treatment. 50 Evening Primrose Oil 3-4 g per day Krill Oil 2 g per day Magnesium. Magnesium has shown some benecial effect in the treatment of PMS. Mag-nesium is depleted by changes in the female sexhormones in the luteal phase leading to a varietyof PMS symptoms, notably migraines and bloat-ing. 51One study suggests that 200 mg of magne- sium daily may reduce premenstrual fluidretention and resultant symptoms like breast dis-tension, peripheral edema, and abdominal bloat-ing after two months of treatment. 52 In another study involving 32 women with PMS, 360 mg of magnesium three times dailywas given from midcycle to the onset of men-strual flow. 53In menstrual distress questionnaire scores, relief of premenstrual mood fluctuationsand depression during magnesium treatment wassignicant. Although blood serum levels of mag-nesium are not found to be different betweenwomen who have PMS and women who don't, itseems there is a signicant decrease in red bloodcell magnesium levels in PMS patients. 54 The mechanism of magnesium and its possible role in PMS are not well understood, but we doknow that magnesium is involved in essential fattyacid metabolism and B 6activity. In fact, as men- tioned in the section on vitamin B 6, one studyshowed a synergistic effect of 50 mg of B 6com- bined with 200 mg of magnesium in reducing pre-menstrual anxiety. 38In addition, another study suggests that cyclical hormonal changes may causea relative deciency state that can exacerbate symp-toms associated with PMS. 55 Magnesium 300 mg 1-3 times per day Calcium. Reports have suggested that prob- lems in calcium regulation and frank calcium de-ciency actually mimic many PMS symptoms 56-58 and may underlie some of the symptoms of PMS.Therefore, dietary and supplemental forms of cal-cium may have a therapeutic benet. 40, 59 An important randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial wasconducted to test this hypothesis. A group of 479women were given either 1,200 mg of calciumcarbonate or a placebo for three menstrualcycles. 60During the luteal phase of the treatment cycle (from ovulation to menses), a signicantlylower symptom complex score was observed inthe calcium group for both the second and thirdmonths. By the third month, calcium effectivelyresulted in a 48 percent reduction in total symp-tom scores from baseline compared with a 30percent reduction in the placebo group. All foursymptom factors (negative mood affect, waterretention, food cravings, and pain) were signi-cantly reduced by the third treatment cycle. In addition, as mentioned earlier in the nutri- tional supplement section, research suggests thata combination of vitamin D and calcium maydecrease the frequency and severity of menstrualmigraines and other PMS symptoms with onlytwo months of treatment. 41 Calcium 1,200 mg per day Tryptophan. As alluded to previously, de- creased serotonin and its precursor tryptophan310WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE may exacerbate PMS mood changes, including depression, anxiety, and aggression.61, 62 In addi- tion, trials done in recent years to test the effec-tiveness of supplementation of L-tryptophan inreducing symptoms of PMS have shown promis-ing results. These studies, which used daily dosesof 6 grams for 17 days from ovulation to day 3 ofmenses led to signicant reductions in moodswings, insomnia, carbohydrate craving, tension,irritability, and dysphoria. 63, 64 Tryptophan 6 g per day for 17 days, from ovulation to day 3 of menses Botanicals Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ).The single most important plant treatment ofpremenstrual syndrome is Vitex agnus castus , also known as chaste tree. The fruits of chaste treecontain essential oils, irridoids, pseudoindicans,and flavonoids. The effect of chaste tree is on thehypothalamus-hypophysis axis. It increases secre-tion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and also has aneffect that favors progesterone. 65-67 Chaste tree has also been substantiated in its ability to inhibitprolactin. 68Elevated prolactin levels may be a factor in PMS. Studies of chaste tree for cyclicbreast tenderness conrm its effectiveness in thisdisorder. 69, 70 Chaste tree is also thought to posi- tively influence PMS symptoms by affectingopioid receptors in the brain. 71 Three studies found that chaste tree reduced a variety of premenstrual symptoms after threecycles of active treatment in a large number ofwomen. 72-74 An additional study looked at the effectiveness of chaste tree versus fluoxetine(Prozac) in decreasing PMS symptoms andfound the two treatments comparable, exceptthat fluoxetine was more effective with psycho-logical symptoms and chaste tree was more effec-tive with physical symptoms. 75Older research led up to these more recent and rigorous studies. T wo surveys were done covering1,542 women with premenstrual syndrome whohad been treated with a German liquid extract ofchaste tree for periods of up to 16 years. The meanduration of treatment was 166 days, and the average dose was 42 drops daily. Effectiveness asrecorded by the patients' doctors was either verygood, good, or satisfactory in 92 percent of thecases. 76Only 2.1 percent of the women noted side effects during treatment, and 1.1 percent of themdiscontinued the medicine because of them. Chaste tree has also been found to be safe for use with most patients, but caution should be ex-ercised with those on medications that inhibitdopamine. A recent review of research found thatthe most frequent adverse events reported wereheadache, gastrointestinal disturbances, men-strual disorders, acne, itching, and rash, and noknown drug interactions were reported. 77 Chaste Tree ( Vitex Agnus Castus ) 40 drops liquid or extract per day or Capsules of standardized extract: 175 mg per day Ginkgo ( Ginkgo Biloba ).We don't normally think of ginkgo for PMS. But when you considerthat some PMS symptoms have to do with conges-tion, it makes sense that it might be useful. Adouble-blind, placebo-controlled study was donein 1993 to determine the effectiveness of ginkgoextract on PMS symptoms. A group of 165 womenbetween the ages of 18 and 45 who had fluid reten-tion, breast tenderness, and vascular congestionwere studied. The patients were assigned to receiveeither a ginkgo extract of 24 percent ginkgoflavonglycoside content at 80 mg twice daily or aplacebo from day 16 of their cycle to day 5 of thenext cycle. Based on symptom evaluation by both Ginkgo ( Ginkgo Biloba ) 80 mg standardized extract twice daily311PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME patient and doctor, ginkgo extract was effective against the congestive symptoms of PMS, particu-larly breast pain or tenderness. 78 Saint John's Wort ( Hypericum Perforatum ). Saint John's wort has shown promise in prelimi-nary studies of its effectiveness at alleviating PMS mood dysfunction, but more research is stillneeded. 79-81 In one observational pilot study, Saint-John's-wort standardized extract was given ata dose of 300 mg three times daily. 81Nineteen women with PMS underwent a preliminaryscreening interview and completed a daily symp-tom rating for one cycle. After taking the Saint John'swort for two complete menstrual cycles, dailysymptoms were rated again. The degree ofimprovement in overall premenstrual syndrome scores between baseline and the end of the trial was51 percent, with more than two-thirds of thesample demonstrating at least a 50 percent decreasein symptom severity. The mood subscale showedthe most improvement (57 percent), and thesymptoms with the greatest reductions in scoreswere crying (92 percent), depression (85 percent),confusion (75 percent), feeling out of control (72percent), nervous tension (71 percent), anxiety (69percent), and insomnia (69 percent). Saint John's Wort 300 mg 3 times daily Additional Herbs. Many other herbs that have not been subjected to scientic research have alsobeen used successfully by women and practitionersfor decades. These include many species of wildyam, licorice root, dong quai, black cohosh, andmore. One study on black cohosh and PMSdemonstrated that it was effective in improvinganxiety, tension, and depression. 82Currently, there is some thought that black cohosh may act as amild serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which wouldmake it an appealing option for PMS. 83 Other plants are used because of their benet with specic symptoms; for example, kava extractfor anxiety, dandelion leaf for water weight gain, valerian for sleep problems, and lemon balm forherpes eruptions. You will often nd one or moreof these herbs in combination herbal and nutri-tional products that have been specically formu-lated for PMS symptom relief. Exercise Specic exercises are conspicuously absent from scientic studies looking at the effects of exerciseon PMS. In contrast, although mechanisms ofaction remain elusive, general regular physicalexercise has been the subject of several controlledtrials. In all of these, the results show that womenwho exercise regularly have less strong or fewerPMS symptoms. Aerobic training (walking, jogging, swim- ming, cycling) appears more effective at reducingPMS symptoms than strength training (weightlifting). 84Frequency of exercise, but not inten- sity, relates to decreased rating of selected men-strual distress symptom clusters; 85gradual increase in running distances correlates directlywith greater reductions in PMS symptoms. 86 Regular exercisers show improvement in all PMSparameters, including concentration, affect,pain, hostility, fear, guilt, and sadness. 87 Regularly exercising women report a signi- cant decrease in anxiety following baseline relax-ation but show greater increase in anxiety duringa stress task than nonexercisers. 88 T wo reviews of the literature on exercise and PMS emphasize the obvious fact that controlledtrials of exercise training and PMS cannot be per-formed under double-blind conditions, makingit difcult to formulate probable mechanisms forthe observed effects of regular training on PMSsymptoms. According to L. Gannon, exercisemay reduce PMS symptoms by (1) decreasingestrogen levels, (2) improving glucose tolerance,(3) decreasing catecholamines, and (4) elevatingendorphins. 89Gannon concludes, \"If PMS symptoms are caused or exacerbated by dramatic312WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE variations in endorphin levels, exercise may serve to prevent exaggerated elevations and abruptdeclines and, ultimately, to reduce symptoms.\" Yoga postures are another form of exercise that appears to have benet and may suit somewomen more. A study of 40 women was done foralmost one year to investigate the effect of yogain relieving premenstrual and menstrual prob-lems. 90The women assigned to the treatment group did yoga postures and meditation. At theend of the 10 months, there were signicantlylower scores on the menstrual distress question-naires for those in the yoga group compared tothose in the control group. Progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing can also signicantly reduce the moodsymptoms associated with PMS. 91 Natural (or Bio-Identical) Progesterone Perhaps no other PMS therapy has been the target of so much controversy as natural proges-terone. This has as much to do with the lack ofscientic research and agreement to support aunied theory as to the cause of PMS as it has todo with the efcacy of natural progesterone itself.Raymond Green and Katharina Dalton advanceda theory in the 1950s that PMS was caused byunopposed estrogen during the luteal phase(second half) of the menstrual cycle. Dr. Dalton'soriginal work with progesterone therapy is the historical root on which the use of natural pro-gesterone is based today. Research scientists, andtherefore the majority of the conventional med-ical community, ultimately did not embrace Dr.Dalton's conclusions about the efcacy of proges-terone therapy for PMS. This was largely basedon what they thought to be inadequate scienticresearch studies, although it is also fair to specu-late that other matters of medical politics and thebusiness of medicine were at play here as well. Natural progesterone (also called bio-identical progesterone) is a white crystalline powderderived from extracts of the Mexican wild yam orsoybean. It requires laboratory manufacturingprocesses and is something altogether differentthan what we know as botanical medicine. Whatmakes natural progesterone natural is not somuch the original plant material but rather thatthe progesterone molecules that result are chem-ically identical to the progesterone hormone pro-duced by a woman's own ovaries and adrenalglands. Confusion exists when people think that bio- identical progesterone is found in wild yam andsoybeans or that the human body can convertwild yam and soybean extracts to natural proges-terone. Neither of these is true. Further confus-ing the issue is that many people mistakenly callsynthetic progestogens or progestins proges-terone. Progestins are chemically different thanprogesterone and also chemically different thanbio-identical progesterone. Dr. Dalton reports that she has used natural progesterone via injections (25 to 100 mg daily),vaginal and rectal suppositories (400 to 1,600 mgdaily), and subcutaneous pellets (500 to 1,600 mgevery 3 to 12 months) with results as good as com-plete relief of PMS symptoms in 83 percent ofwomen. 92There have been several studies that demonstrated a lack of efcacy of rectal and vaginal suppositories in the treatment of PMS.Sampson and Freeman found these forms of prog-esterone to be no better than placebo. 93, 94Exercise Recommendations Follow the \"General Exercise Program\" and exercise instructions outlined in Appendix A. The key words in exercising are regularity and diversity. It is important to schedule exercise along with the other vital activities of the day\u2014meals,sleep, and rest. Equally important is to enjoy the exercise you choose, remembering that best results areobtained from a combination of types of exer- cise\u2014flexibility, stretching, strength, and car- diovascular.313PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Although the suppository method of deliver- ing natural progesterone for PMS has not heldup to scientic scrutiny, oral micronized naturalprogesterone has. A study by Dennerstein andcolleagues in 1985 found an overall benecialeffect of using 300 mg per day (100 mg in themorning and 200 mg in the evening) for 10 daysof each menstrual cycle starting three days afterovulation. 95After only one month of treatment, those receiving progesterone could be clearly distinguished from those receiving placebo on measures of stress, anxiety, and concentration.Most other symptoms also continued to improvewith each menstrual cycle. The only premen-strual complaint not consistently improved byprogesterone was arousal. A 1993 study alsoreported successful use of progesterone in dosesof 300 mg oral micronized progesterone daily or3 cc rectal solution twice daily. 96 More recently, Dr. John Lee had become the most outspoken proponent of the use of naturalprogesterone by using transdermal creams thatare applied to specied areas of the skin. Hereported signicant success in his medical prac-tice and has written about it in his treatise onnatural progesterone. 97 The availability of natural progesterone in transdermal creams in the retail over-the-countermarket has created perhaps the greatest confu-sion yet in the use of this valuable medicine. It isimportant for the consumer and practitioner tounderstand the difference between wild yam andsoy extracts versus natural progesterone productsderived from these extracts. Wild yam extracts donot contain natural progesterone unless they saythat natural progesterone has been added. Also,different products contain different amounts ofprogesterone. The range is as little as 2 mg perounce to more than 400 mg per ounce. The ruleis user beware and be educated. These productsall have their value, but not necessarily for thetreatment of PMS. In my clinical practice, I largely use the trans- dermal creams that contain at least 400 mg progesterone per ounce of cream. For severe PMS symptoms that have not responded tonutritional, botanical, and lifestyle changes, andfor those whose symptoms start from a few days toone week before the menses, I recommend apply-ing one-quarter teaspoon natural progesteronecream twice daily starting at midcycle and stop-ping the day before the menses is due. For womenwhose signicant symptoms begin at ovulation, Irecommend one-quarter teaspoon per day fromday 8 to day 14 (do not use during days 1 to 7while bleeding), and then one-quarter teaspoontwice daily until the menses begins, as describedabove. The best sites for rubbing in the creaminclude the palms, inner forearms, chest, andinner thighs. Also, it is best utilized when rotatingsites of application. Individual uses may varydepending on symptoms or menstrual pattern. Since bio-identical progesterone is a hor- mone, I think it is best to seek the advice of aqualied health-care practitioner who is experi-enced with its use for those who use it long term. This assures proper usage and thereforemaximum results. Oral micronized progesteroneand some of the other delivery methods of prog-esterone are prescription items. These productsare used mainly by licensed naturopathic physi-cians but also by progressive medical doctorsand a growing number of chiropractors andacupuncturists. Natural (Bio-Identical) Progesterone Cream If symptoms start from a few days to 1 week before the menses, apply 14tsp twice daily beginning at midcycle (day 15) and stopping approximately day 26 or a day or two before the menses is due. If symptoms begin at ovulation, apply 14tsp per day on days 8-14 (do not use during days 1-7 while bleeding), and then 14tsp twice daily until the menses begins. Oral Micronized Progesterone 50-200 mg per day on days 15-26314WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH In perhaps no other diagnostic category has the advice of conventional physicians so overlappedwith that of their naturopathic colleagues. All aresearching! Basic lifestyle issues such as exercise,diet, nutritional supplements, and stress and moodassessment have all been studied and are always thestarting point of treatment. Probably in partbecause we had no consistently effective therapy,conventional physicians have borrowed eagerlyfrom natural medicine, and enthusiastic interest innatural progesterone occurred in the early 1980s.The rst, and most important, step in treat- ing PMS is recognizing it. The woman shouldundergo accurate assessment for other mentaland physical diseases, and then do at least threemonths of symptom charting, possibly with helpfrom her partner. Once the diagnosis of PMS ismade, then the therapy consists of the following: 1. Lifestyle therapies. Nonpharmacological therapies are more effective in less severePMS/PMDD. The rst is making lifestylechanges that support the use of aerobic exerciseto maintain a normal BMI and possibly increaseendorphins that may be lacking in the lutealphase. Next are dietary modications thatinclude having small, frequent meals; reducingintake of caffeine, sugar, alcohol, articial sweet-eners, salt, red meat, saturated fat, and simplecarbohydrates; and increasing the intake ofcomplex carbohydrates; and foods that are richin calcium and magnesium. A general multivita-min supplement is also recommended. 2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a short-term,structured psychotherapeutic treatment thathelps emphasize the role of the patient's currentthinking in determining behavior. The patient istaught behavioral techniques to help alter herresponse to the premenstrual symptoms. CBThelps in stress management and in teaching thewoman how to alter or cope with her lifestyle. 3. Pharmacological therapies. The most common medication recommended forPMS/PMDD of moderate to severe intensity isan SSRI. These medications can be used just onthe severe-symptom days each month. They areeffective the day they are taken, which suggeststhat SSRIs in this case are not helping byincreasing neurotransmitters. They seem towork in PMS by altering the neurophysiologyand electrical conduction in the brain. SeveralSSRIs have been used. Suggested doses are flu-oxetine (20 mg a day) or the once-weekly tabletsertraline or paroxetine controlled-release (12.5to 25.0 mg per day). biggest problem withSample Treatment Plan for Premenstrual Syndrome 3-Month Plan Reduce the intake of alcohol, caffeine, salt, sugar, rened carbohydrates, and dairy products. Increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, soy, sh, and flaxseedoil. Exercise regularly, focusing especially on aerobic exercise. Take a combination nutritional/botanical PMS product (available at natural food stores or alternative health practitioners). It shouldinclude vitamin B 6; magnesium; gamma linolenic acid (vitex); vitamin E; Saint John's wort; and possibly some traditional herbs for PMS, including dandelion leaf, dong quai, black cohosh, andwild yam. (See the Resources section for for- mulation sources.) Take a multiple vitamin/mineral supplement, 1 to 6 capsules per day. Take 1,000-1,200 mg of calcium per day. If this plan doesn't relieve PMS after three cycles, then use bio-identical progesteronecreams with greater than 400 mg per ounce or prescription oral micronized progesterone.315PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME the use of these drugs is the high incidence of side effects that can include nausea, headache,fatigue, hyperexcitability, and sexual dysfunctionas well as weight gain. The new serotonin andnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine,with doses anywhere from 50 mg to 200 mg perday, was shown to have a better effect than theplacebo in reducing PMDD. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, used as a diuretic. It has been successful in treat-ing symptoms of irritability, depressed mood,edema, breast tenderness, and food craving. Oral contraceptives are commonly prescribed for PMS/PMDD and have reports of as many fail-ures as successes. Probably the most signicantproblem with oral contraceptives is the current reg-imen of taking them 21 days on and 7 days off. The7-day drug-free interval allows for less suppressionof ovulation. During that 7-day pill-free interval,follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) rises, folliclesbegin to grow, and ovulation frequently occurs.Since PMS is only seen in ovulating women, thislack of ovulation suppression may be the reason for the frequent failure of OCs in PMS. There are several new studies that show that a 4-day pill-freeinterval reduces the FSH volumes by 50 percent,helps suppress the development of new follicles,and appears to signicantly suppress ovulation. Ashorter hormone-free interval may thus be moreeffective in treating PMS. There is also a birth control pill that contains drospirenone, which isderived from 17 alpha-spironolactone and has antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogen effects. Ithelps prevent fluid retention, and studies haveshown excellent efcacy in symptom relief of PMS. Uncommonly prescribed medications for PMS/PMDD are the GnRH agonists that sup-press ovulation and make women in effect tem-porarily menopausal. The use of GnRH agonistsplaces women in a low estrogenic state that func-tions like a reversible medical removal of ovaries.These agents have been shown to decrease symp-toms of severe PMS, but they cannot be used for extended periods of time and have a high incidence of side effects. Add-back therapy withestradiol or a progestogen to reduce the sideeffects also seems to reduce the effectiveness fortreatment of PMS. Short-acting, water-soluble sedatives such as alprazolam and lorazepam have also been usefuleither in a scheduled dosing (for example, a smalldose three times daily from cycle day 20 untilmenses) or on an as-needed basis to reduce anxi-ety and agitation. Correction of PMS through surgical removal of the ovaries has been done and remains a veryhigh-risk, symptomatic (due to the abrupt loss ofestrogen), and expensive treatment for PMS. It isdone only in the most extreme circumstancesafter extensive consultations. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) PMS is an excellent condition for self-treatment most of the time. Mild to moderate PMS is welladdressed by lifestyle changes and safe and effec-tive nutritional and botanical supplements mostof the time. When these measures are not effec-tive or when the symptoms are severe, a licensednaturopathic physician can readily utilize naturalprogesterone therapy, more aggressive dosing of nutritional and botanical supplements, orselected nutrients that specically and moreassertively target serotonin and other neurotrans-mitters and neurophysiology. Few conventional medical doctors are trained in these therapies, although increasing numbersare integrating them into their practice. Severesymptoms of depression, headaches, breast pain,or others may require the use of pharmaceuticalintervention, although this is rarely necessary. Inthese cases, temporary use of such drugs must berecommended judiciously, while the continueduse of natural medicines is integrated into thelong-term plan. Only rarely will PMS not respondto a comprehensive natural medicine approach.This page intentionally left blank 317OVERVIEW Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their complications continue to infect women at epi-demic rates. Each year, more than 15 millionAmerican men and women contract an STI. 1 Worldwide, the estimated incidence of STIs isover 250 million cases per year. All women whoare sexually active are at risk for acquiring infec-tion and related reproductive tract problems,although heterosexual women are at substantiallyincreased risk compared to lesbian women. Gon-orrhea and chlamydial infections may produceurethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and are the two types of bacteriathat most frequently cause PID. Human papillo-mavirus (HPV) is the cause of genital warts andcervical dysplasia. Syphilis is responsible formyriad systemic and tissue abnormalities. virus (HSV) infection is associated withsmall blisterlike skin eruptions and ulcerations.Scabies and pediculosis are fraught with itchingof the skin. As many as 60 percent of hepatitis Bcases are sexually transmitted. HIV infection andAIDS (the most advanced stage of HIV infection)are sexually transmitted diseases as well. Lesscommon STIs, such as lymphogranuloma vener-eum and chancroid, present as pimple-like orulcerative genital lesions. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss some of the alternative approaches and conventionaltherapies used in the treatment of chlamydia andgonorrhea. Please refer to Chapter 20 (vaginitis),Chapter 3 (cervical dysplasia), Chapter 8 (genitalherpes), and Chapter 15 (pelvic inflammatorydisease) for further information and treatmentrecommendations regarding other conditionsthat can be transmitted through sexual contact.Chlamydia Trachomatis Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most common STI causing a female pelvic infection in the United States. The infection rate is consid-ered epidemic in women and is estimated at fourmillion new cases each year. Chlamydia is evi-dent in about 20 to 40 percent of sexually activewomen in the United States. 2It can be deceptive because as many as 80 percent of women withthis infection do not exhibit symptoms. 3This is of particular concern, because chlamydia canprogress to an asymptomatic pelvic infectionresulting in infertility. Women between the agesof 15 and 25 are at greatest risk of chlamydia, butall heterosexually active women are at risk. 4, 5The rate of C. trachomatis pelvic infection among sex- ually active women is from 5 to 20 percent.6The chlamydia organism invades the columnar cellsof the cervix, invades the immune system, andcan either lie in a latent state in the cervix formonths, create asymptomatic cervical infection,or ascend to the upper genital tract, where it canalso be asymptomatic or cause infections of thefallopian tubes or uterus. When symptoms dooccur, it commonly causes urethritis, cervicitis,and PID in women. Common symptoms thatoccur include uncomfortable urination, fre-quency of urination, vaginal spotting, increaseddischarge that may be yellowish, pelvic pain, andpain or spotting with intercourse. Due to the high incidence of chlamydia and the high rate of asymptomatic infections, it is rec-ommended that all heterosexually active womenbetween ages 15 and 25 be screened yearly. Byscreening regularly, the incidence of PID can bereduced signicantly. Chlamydia is diagnosed onphysical examination, with a smear of the dis-18SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONSCHAPTER Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson .

The rectum should also beexamined for a purulent discharge. The vaginaldischarge should also be tested for the presence ofbacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and gonorrhea.The cervix is also examined for hypertrophy(enlargement) of the endocervical epithelium (thecells in the cervical canal), looking for intense ery-thema (redness) and friability (bleeds easily whenit is touched with a cotton-tipped applicator). Thepresence of a mucopurulent discharge from thecervix is a tip-off to a cervical infection. Thisyellow discharge is then tested for chlamydia andgonorrhea. Being infected with chlamydia is of special concern for the pregnant woman because it cancause spontaneous abortion, premature ruptureof the membranes, premature labor and delivery,and postpartum endometritis (infection of theuterus). Due to the frequent asymptomaticnature of chlamydia infection, examinations ofall women suspected of having an STI duringpregnancy should include testing for chlamydiaand gonorrhea. About 60 to 70 percent ofuntreated cases in pregnant women result inneonatal infection in the eyes or lungs. 2 Due to the ability of chlamydia infection to be asymptomatic, it is a particularly problematicpelvic infection. It can ascend to the upper genital tract without detection and then causesignicant damage to the reproductive tractaffecting fertility. Lower abdominal or pelvicpain in a heterosexually active woman may be asymptom of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),especially when it occurs with cervical inflamma-tion and vaginal and/or purulent endocervicaldischarge. Pain and tenderness on the physicalexam in addition would be enough to have aclinical diagnosis of PID and should be followedwith appropriate testing. (See Chapter 15 formore information on PID.) Because of the number of women who have contracted chlamydia and do not exhibit symp-toms, many women go untreated. Unfortunately, many of these women nd out later that their fal-lopian tubes have been scarred, which leads toinfertility. Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second most common STI causing a female pelvic infection. In 2003,the rate of reported cases in the United States was116.2 cases per 100,000 individuals. Rates havebeen decreasing each year since 1999, and we arecurrently at our lowest reported rate. Approxi-mately 75 percent of the cases occur in women,and the highest rate is among women aged 20 to24 years. 7The highest group at risk is heterosex- ually active women aged 15 to 19.8 The southern United States has the highest rates of gonorrhea, and the rates are 20 timeshigher for African-Americans than for Cau-casians. Young women (and men) who are non-white, unmarried, less educated, and who live inurban settings are the group most commonlyaffected. 9 Gonorrhea is most easily transmitted from males to females assuming lack of condom use.Oral gonorrhea occurs in about 20 percent ofwomen who practice fellatio with males whohave an infection of their urethra. T ransmissionbetween women is not impossible, but extremelyrare. The incubation period of gonococcal infec-tion averages 3 to 5 days, with a range of 1 to 14days. The majority of women with gonorrheahave no symptoms, but one-third of womenobserve a vaginal discharge. Urethritis withuncomfortable urination and frequency, cervici-tis, a puslike discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain,vaginal spotting, and pain with intercourse aresymptoms that warrant a suspicion of gonorrhea. Mucopurulent cervicitis is the most common STI pelvic infection in women. Cervicitis is usu-ally caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes simplex, or a combination, with chlamydia infec-tions being the most common cause. A vaginalinfection along with cervicitis may be due to 319SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS candida or trichomonas, or the candida or trichomonas may coexist along with the otherorganisms. Symptoms often do not show up until PID develops. Abdominal pelvic pain is generally anindication of endometritis, salpingitis, or an abscess, and it generally develops a few days fol-lowing the onset of menses. The physical exam ofa woman with gonorrhea reveals a mucopurulentdischarge from the cervical opening, a swollenand friable cervix, and/or bleeding from the cer-vical canal. Infected mothers may transmit gonorrhea to their babies during pregnancy or at the time ofdelivery. It most commonly causes conjunctivitisin the baby and can also cause blindness in newborns. Other complications can includeincreased risks of spontaneous abortion, prema-ture labor, early rupture of the fetal membranes,and perinatal infant mortality. As many as 30 to 60 percent of women with gonorrhea are also infected with chlamydia, 10 and therefore gonorrhea and chlamydia shouldbe tested together. Testing for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2001) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)(2006) provide the following guidelines and recommendations for who should be tested forchlamydia and gonorrhea. Their guidelines areslightly different, so I have combined them for optimal recommendations. The followingwomen should be tested for chlamydia: Women with mucopurulent cervicitis or PID All sexually active or pregnant women 25 years old or younger Any woman who is at risk, dened liberally as inconsistent condom use and having anew partner or multiple partners Pregnant women at increased risk for chlamydial infection, including women whoare unmarried, are African-American, have a prior history of STI, have new or multipleheterosexual partners, have cervical ectopy (achange in the cervix exposing more colum-nar cells to potential infection), or showinconsistent use of barrier contraception Women who are treated for chlamydia should be rescreened three to four months after treatment. The optimum frequency of how often to screen for chlamydia is uncertain. For womenwho have previously tested negative during ascreening test, rescreening should occur if there isa change in sexual partners. Once older than 25,or for women who are in a mutually monoga-mous relationship and have a history of negativescreening tests for chlamydia infection, screeningcan be much less frequent and based on clinicaljudgment. Women who have a history of beingpreviously infected need to be rescreened every 6to 12 months due to high rates of reinfection. Asstated earlier, women with positive infectionsshould be treated and retested after treatment. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2005), the following women shouldbe tested for gonorrhea: All sexually active women age 25 or younger All women, especially pregnant women, who are at higher risk, including women who areunmarried, are African-American, have aprior history of STI, have new or multipleheterosexual partners, are sex workers, usedrugs, have cervical ectopy (a change in thecervix exposing more columnar cells topotential infection), or show inconsistentuse of barrier contraception All pregnant women who are 25 years old or younger or are at risk (screen at the rst pre-natal visit) Women who live in communities with a higher prevalence of gonorrhea Using cultures to test for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae has historically been the gold320WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE standard and the reference against which all other tests have been compared. However, theseculture methods are more difcult and expensive,so new testing methods have been sought. Therst nonculture screening tests that were trachomatis which detect C. trachomatis- specic or N. gonorrhoeae- specic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid(RNA) sequences. The main disadvantage ofthese tests, especially for C. trachomatis , is that they aren't able to detect a fair number of theinfections. This has led to a new generation oftests, called nucleic acid amplication tests(NAATs), that are signicantly more sensitive than previous nonculture tests in detecting DNA or RNA sequences. The Gen-Probe PACE2 and the Digene Hybrid Capture II can detectfor both organisms in a single specimen. Rapidin-ofce tests may be used by some clinics to testfor chlamydia; liquid-based Pap smears and urinetests can also be used to detect chlamydia. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B (HBV) is a virus that infects more than 300,000 Americans annually. It is estimatedthat 1.5 million people in the United States arecarriers of the disease but experience no symp-toms at all. Sexual contact, especially anal sex, isthe leading method of transmitting HBV. Othermethods of transmission include the sharing ofneedles among drug users, exposure to infectedbody tissues or fluids through an open cut orsore, and infected mothers who pass the virus onto their babies. The most common early symp-toms are flulike. Symptoms that arise laterinclude jaundice (yellowing of the skin andwhites of the eyes), abdominal pain, and darkand foamy urine. With treatment, most peoplePREVENTION Know the sexual disease history of your poten- tial sexual partner. The best protection against acquiring a sexually transmitted disease is for the male partner to use latex condoms. All heterosexual women who engage in unpro- tected sex with one or more men are at risk forSTIs. Women with frequent partners or multiple partners have more STIs. Oral contraceptive use may predispose women to chlamydial infection. 11 Patients diagnosed with one STI should be screened for other common STIs. IV drug users should avoid sharing needles. Health-care workers should be focused and care- ful and practice universal precautions in their workplace.KEY CONCEPTS All heterosexually active women age 25 or younger should be screened annually for gonor- rhea and chlamydia. Any sexual contact with a person with gonor- rhea or chlamydia warrants a visit to the doctor for a physical exam and tests. Antibiotic treatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea should be considered the primary treatment, with alternative treatments used as complements. Complications of gonorrhea and chlamydia can be serious and even life threatening, and a pregnant woman can pass the infection to herbaby. Symptoms of chlamydia and gonorrhea include cervical discharge, difcult or painful urination,bleeding between periods or after intercourse, pain in the pelvic area during sex, a swollen cervix and/or bleeding from the cervix, andacute or chronic pelvic pain. However, manywomen have no symptoms at all. Appropriate management of an STI includes seeing a health-care practitioner who can iden-tify the disease and treat the woman and her current sexual partner.321SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS begin to feel better within two to three weeks and recover within four to eight weeks. A very smallpercentage of people who are chronic carriers ofHBV will develop potentially severe and fatalliver diseases such as active hepatitis, cirrhosis, orcancer. Blood tests are used to diagnose both theactive form of HBV and the carrier state. Preg-nant women can be screened for the virus duringtheir prenatal care. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Due to potential infertility from the scarring of acute PID as well as some of the other complica-tions of chlamydial infection and gonorrhea, myadvice is to consider alternative medicine as anadjunct to conventional antibiotics rather than aprimary treatment. Using alternative therapies tosupport the immune system, to assist in manag-ing pain and discomfort, and to counteract someof the side effects of the antibiotics are the mainpriorities. Drinking plenty of water, gettingenough rest, eating simple light foods, and avoid-ing stimulants are basic guidelines during anyacute infection, including pelvic infections. General immune support to complement conventional antibiotic treatment is just goodplain common sense. Nutritional and botanicalsupport can stimulate the white blood cells thatengulf and destroy bacteria and enhance thefunction of T cells, B cells, and natural killer cellsthat modulate the immune system in reaction tobacteria and viruses. Such supplements as vita-min A, vitamin C, the carotenes, vitamin E, zinc,and the B vitamins play an important role inimmune enhancement. Increasing antibodyresponse, stimulating helper T cells, enhancingwhite blood cell response and function, anddirectly killing the virus or bacteria are just someof the ways in which these supplements can behelpful during an acute infection of any kind. Many herbs have also been shown to have antibacterial, antiviral, and immunostimulatingeffects. The most commonly used herb forimmune support is echinacea. Echinacea can increase the production of T cells, stimulatephagocytosis of bacteria, stimulate natural killercell activity, and multiply the number of whiteblood cells that circulate in order to deal with theinfection. 12Many herbs have also been shown to have antimicrobial and immunostimulatingeffects. Allicin extracts from garlic may hold themost promise for inhibiting bacterial infections.Goldenseal and Oregon grape root also have theability to inhibit the overgrowth of numerousorganisms, although this does not include bacte-rial vaginosis or chlamydia. Curcumin is one ofthe best herbs to reduce inflammation. The endresult is a strengthened immune system. The best complement to counteract the side effects of antibiotic use is to add or increase theintake of Lactobacillus acidophilus to support intestinal health and to help prevent a vaginalyeast infection. This can often be accomplishedby eating yogurt containing Lactobacillus aci- dophilus daily or by taking oral capsules of Lactobacillus acidophilus . Four to eight ounces of unsweetened acidophilus yogurt or at least threecapsules of Lactobacillus acidophilus daily for two weeks should prevent the overgrowth of vaginalyeast that often occurs when taking antibiotics.In addition, Lactobacillus has been shown to inhibit both gonorrhea and chlamydia and to beinversely related to PID. 13-16 Ice packs over the pelvic region can reduce inflammation and pain in cases of acute PID.Cold or ice packs placed over the region of theuterus while putting the feet in a tub of hot watercan further assist in reducing the inflammation,congestion, and pain in the pelvic area. Alternat-ing hot and cold sitz baths can also be used toimprove circulation in the pelvic area andimprove the healing time from the infection.This is done by sitting in a bath of hot water,with the water level just above the waist, for threeminutes, followed by sitting in a small secondportable metal or plastic tub of ice cold water forone minute. This procedure is repeated three322WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE times in succession, once or twice daily through- out the course of the pain and infection. Nutrition The nutritional goals during an active STI are to eat health-promoting and immune supportivefoods. Generally, this refers to a diet that is highin ber, plant-based foods, essential fatty acids,and antioxidant nutrients and low in saturated fat and rened sugar. The best dietary sources of antioxidants, and especially the carotenes, are green leafy vegetablesand yellow-orange fruits and vegetables such ascarrots, apricots, peaches, mangoes, yams, andsquash. Beans, whole grains, and many seeds arealso good sources of carotenes. Eliminating rened sugar and simple sugars (corn syrup, honey, fructose, maple syrup, whitegrape juice concentrate, and others) will help toassure optimal immune function. Eliminatingsaturated fats such as red meat, butter, cheese,and ice cream, even in the short run, will enablethe body to utilize essential fatty acids such as thefats from olive oil, canola oil, and ocean sh.These essential fatty acids are important in thepromotion of the anti-inflammatory prostaglan-dins PgE1 and PgE3; reducing inflammation is aprimary goal in healing a sexually transmittedinfection. Keeping the digestion in order with regular bowel habits and free of constipation can beaccomplished with a high-ber diet rich in wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, and beans. This will notonly minimize digestive side effects if antibioticsare used in the STI treatment, but will also max-imize the elimination of metabolic toxins that areincreased during the infection. Some naturopathic physicians advocate a very light diet or even fasting during an active acuteinfection. The rationale is to minimize theburden on the body so that all of its resources canbe utilized for an immune response to ght theinfection. Fasting is also presumably a more ef-cient way of eliminating the metabolic toxins. Ifyou're not used to fasting, I would not suggest trying this approach for any longer than threedays on your own. Drink plenty of water as well.Better yet, you may want to seek advice from aknowledgeable practitioner about this approach. If you are taking antibiotics, be sure to eat eight ounces of unsweetened lactobacillus yogurtdaily to help maintain intestinal health and tohelp prevent the possibility of a yeast vaginitisinfection caused by the antibiotics. Botanicals An Indian study of Azadirachta indica (neem seed oil), Sapindus mukerossi (reetha saponin extract), and quinine included 58 women whopresented to a gynecology clinic in India with an Sample Treatment Plan for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea This plan should be used as a complement to antibiotics.

Thecreams were applied intravaginally at bedtime for14 days. Ten of the 12 patients with chlamydiawho received the treatment cream recoveredwithin two weeks. Ten of the 17 women with bac-terial vaginosis who received the treatment creamrecovered within two weeks. There was no bene-t in women with candidiasis or trichomoniasis.There was no improvement in symptoms or labtest results in any of the women in the placebogroup. Although there were not enough womento achieve statistical signicance, the creamshowed encouraging results and should clearly beinvestigated further. It would be very appropriateto try this cream in bacterial vaginosis. In chlamy-dia infection, it could be used as an adjunct treat-ment along with antibiotics or following theantibiotics to help prevent recurrence. 17 CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Chlamydia is the most common reportable sexu- ally transmitted infection in the United States,with gonorrhea following second. Both of thesebacterial illnesses can be present without symp-toms, and they are highly transmittable. Both arevery preventable with the use of a condom. Thecurrent CDC guidelines (2006) recommend thatall women under the age of 25 have annualscreenings for both chlamydia and gonorrhea,and then anytime a woman has a new partner,screening is recommended. Return visits for arepeat test for cure were recommended in thepast, but now they are only done in the cases ofpregnant women. Single-dose therapy is highlyeffective, especially when administered in theprovider's ofce. It is thus recommended that, ifpossible, providers carry a supply of medicationsfor administration to the patient before she leavesthe ofce or clinic. The sexual partner should be tested if at all possible, but the partner shouldalso be treated with antibiotics, regardless of test-ing. Current CDC recommendations are thatany partner exposure within 60 days should beevaluated and then treated. It is often the casethat partner evaluation does not occur or is noteconomically feasible, so many providers rou-tinely treat the partner as well. The ability to testfor chlamydia and gonorrhea has signicantlyimproved and now can be done using vaginal,cervical, or rectal swabs, as well as urine testing.Some labs can now also test for chlamydia andgonorrhea on the liquid left over from a liquidPap test. Pregnant women should always bescreened for chlamydia and gonorrhea. The CDC now recommends that all women with positive chlamydia tests have a reevaluationand testing at three months after their therapy tolook for reinfection. This differs from the test-of-cure evaluations that have been done extensivelyin the past and are currently not recommended.Repeating the test in three months to make surethat the patient is not reinfected is important forpreservation of future fertility and prevention oftubo-ovarian abscesses. T reating infected patientsprevents transmission to sex partners. Also, treat-ing pregnant women often prevents transmissionof chlamydia to infants during birth. T reatmentof sex partners also helps to prevent reinfection ofthe initial patient and the infection of other part-ners. Coinfection with chlamydia and gonorrheaoccurs frequently, and patients should be treatedfor both diseases when one is found unless test-ing for the other is negative when tested for both. The standard antibiotic regimen for treat- ment of chlamydia would include one of the following: Azithromycin (1 g orally in a single dose) Doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) Alternative antibiotic regimens would include one of the following:324WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Erythromycin base (500 mg orally 4 times a day for 7 days) Erythromycin ethylsuccinate (800 mg orally 4 times a day for 7 days) Ofloxacin (300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) Levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily for 7 days) Since doxycycline, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnant women, azithromy-cin is probably the drug of choice. The standard antibiotic treatment of uncom- plicated gonorrhea infections involves one of thefollowing: Ceftizoxime (125 mg intramuscularly in a single dose) Cexime (400 mg orally in a single dose) Ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally in a single dose) Ofloxacin (400 mg orally in a single dose) Levofloxacin (250 mg orally in a single dose) Quinolone-resistant gonorrhea is on the rise, and quinolones are not recommended for thetreatment of gonorrhea in regions where the rateof resistant gonorrhea is high. The main areas inthe United States where quinolones use is notrecommended are California and Hawaii. Someinner-city areas and other regions also have thesewarnings, so it is important for the practitionerto be aware of regional resistance patterns. TheCDC recommends the following treatment forpatients at high risk for quinolone resistance: Ceftriaxone (125 mg intramuscularly in a single dose) Cexime (400 mg orally in a single dose) Other antibiotic regimens for gonorrhea treatment include single-dose injectable cepha-losporin regimens the following: Ceftizoxime (500 mg intramuscularly) Cefoxitin (2 g IV) administered with probenecid (1 g orally) Cefotaxime (500 mg administered once intramuscularly) None of the injectable cephalosporins offers any advantage over ceftriaxone, which is morecommonly stocked in ofces and clinics.Azithromycin (2 g orally) is effective againstuncomplicated gonorrhea, but it is expensiveand causes signicant gastrointestinal distressand therefore is not currently recommended for treatment of gonorrhea. The gonorrhea in the United States is not adequately suscepti-ble to penicillins, tetracyclines, and macrolides(erythromycin) for these to be used in treat-ment. Again, a person being treated for gonorrhea would also be treated for chlamydia, unless testshave shown that chlamydia is not present. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) If you have unprotected sexual contact with someone who has chlamydia, gonorrhea, or hep-atitis B, I strongly urge you to see a licensed prac-titioner (naturopathic doctor, medical doctor,osteopathic doctor, nurse-practitioner, or physi-cian's assistant) who is trained and qualied toperform a physical exam and take samples fortesting and also capable of administering ormaking available prescription antibiotics andvaccine. This does not necessarily require a gyne-cologist or other conventional practitioner.Licensed naturopathic physicians are trained toperform and provide these services. State lawdetermines which antibiotics naturopathic physi-cians may prescribe. If a practitioner cannot pre-scribe a particular antibiotic, he or she can eitherrefer you to a conventional practitioner or workin cooperation with a conventional practitionerwho can make a prescription available to you.Nutritional and herbal supplements can then beused in addition to your conventional treatment.325SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS A naturopathic physician can also provide natu- ral therapies to augment your immune sup-port, prevent side effects from the medications,and help you to recover optimally from theinfection.If you have severe liver disease due to hepati- tis B, I would strongly consider alternative treat-ments as the primary treatment, with carefulmonitoring of liver enzymes and liver biopsywith the help of a specialist.This page intentionally left blank 327OVERVIEW Uterine broids (also known as leiomyomas or myomas) occur in 20 to 25 percent of women byage 40, 1more than 50 percent of women overall. They are the most common solid pelvic tumorsin women and the most common indication formajor surgery in women, and they account forapproximately one-third of hysterectomies eachyear. 2According to some studies, in African- American women the incidence of broids isthree to nine times higher and the broids' rateof growth is increased. 3, 4 You would think for a condition as common as this that we would have a good understandingof the cause and cure. Nevertheless, the cause ofbroids remains poorly understood. Uterinebroids are not actually brous but consist ofmuscle, probably uterine smooth-muscle cellsbut possibly connective tissue or the smooth-muscle cells of uterine arteries. The growth ofbroids may be stimulated by estrogen. The ten-dency of broids to arise during the reproductiveyears, grow during pregnancy, and regress post-menopausally does implicate estrogen as onefactor in the cause and growth of broid tumors.A growth spurt in broids is frequently seen inthe perimenopausal period and is likely due toanovulatory cycles with a relative estrogen excessthat commonly occur during this period. Preg-nancy is a condition of elevated estrogen andprogesterone, and even though progesterone isan antiestrogen, the increased blood supplyduring pregnancy leads to an overall stimulatingeffect on the uterine broids. 5 There have been reports that concentrations of estrogen receptors in broid tissue are higherthan in the surrounding uterine muscle tissue(myometrium) 6but lower than in the uterinelining (endometrium). Although these ndingsmay help to explain why broids are sensitive toestrogen, they have not been consistently sub-stantiated in other studies. 7, 8This higher con- centration of estrogen receptors may be due tochanges in estrogen metabolism within the broiditself. Pollow and nicantly lower intoestrone in myometrium, sug-gesting that local, concentrated estradiol increaseswithin the broid may play a role in the cause andgrowth of broids. The prevalence and size of broids are greater in women who do not ovulate or who haveendometrial hyperplasia or a granulosa cell tumorof the ovary. Even though broids do not lead tocancer and are not a cause of uterine cancer, theyare associated with a fourfold increase in the riskof endometrial carcinoma. This is probablybecause too much estrogen without any or enoughprogesterone (called unopposed estrogen) is a con-tributing factor in both conditions. Fibroids come in all sizes and shapes and usu- ally occur as multiple tumors, although eachbroid is discrete. Most discernible broids arebetween the size of a walnut and the size of anorange, but unusual tumors have been reported up to 100 pounds. Fibroids are classied accord-ing to their location. They are either submucosal(just under the endometrium), intramural (withinthe uterine muscle wall), or subserosal (from theouter wall of the uterus). They can also beintraligamentous (in the cervix between the twolayers of the broad ligament), pedunculated anddangling from a stalk into the uterine cavity(pedunculated submucous), pedunculated onthe broids19UTERINE 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 328WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE can on occasion protrude through the cervix into the vagina. Other pedunculated broids on a longstalk outside the uterus can be mistaken for anovarian mass or attach to the bowel. The majority of broids (an estimated 50 to 80 percent) 9don't cause any symptoms, but when symptoms do occur they often begin as a vaguefeeling of discomfort and may include a feeling of pressure, congestion, bloating, heaviness, painwith vaginal sex, urinary frequency, backache,abdominal enlargement, and abnormal bleeding.Abnormal bleeding occurs in only 30 percent ofwomen with broids. Heavy bleeding (menor-rhagia) results when intramural tumors enlargethe endometrial cavity and increase the surfacearea of endometrium and cause congestion of thesurrounding blood vessels. Fibroids can undergo degenerative changes. One type of degenerative change is when the con-tinued growth of the broid outgrows the bloodsupply. A more common type of degenerativechange is when there is a loss of cellular detail(hyaline degeneration) as a result of a decrease inthe vascularity of the tumor. Necrosis (cell death)results in cystic degeneration, which lends itself toa softer than usual consistency and can be con-fused with an ovarian mass on exam or pelvicultrasound. Calcication can occur over time andis usually seen in postmenopausal women. The historical perspective has been that broids are not usually associated with pain exceptwhen degeneration occurs or when the uterus contracts in its efforts to expel a submucousbroid. Feelings of pressure pains may develop ifthe uterus becomes excessively enlarged withbroids, or if a single broid is larger than 5 cm atits greatest diameter. 10However, if we look a little harder at some of the research, clinic-based studiessuggest that gynecologic pain is often related tothe presence of broids. 11-15 Fibroids are com- monly found in women with chronic pelvic pain,although they may not be the cause or the only cause of the pain.16, 17 There may also be racial differences when it comes to pelvic pain and uterine broids. Onestudy reported that 41 percent of white and 59percent of black hysterectomy patients with apresurgical diagnosis of broids reported severepelvic pain. 18Another study reported a series of studies in which pelvic pain and/or menstrual painwas experienced in 34 percent of patients withbroids. 19In a recent study, the rst population- based study of gynecologic pain symptoms andbroids, dyspareunia (pain with vaginal sexualactivity) and noncyclic pelvic pain, but not dys-menorrhea (menstrual pain), increased in severitywith the presence of uterine broids. 20Pregnant women with broids also have reported pelvicpain more frequently, and it seems that the pelvicpain is related to the size of the broid(s) and theirlocation. 21, 22 So you might now be confused: do broids cause pelvic pain or not? The majority of thetime, uterine broids do not cause pelvic pain;however, if you have chronic pelvic pain, broidsmay in fact be a cause of that chronic pelvic pain,especially if they can be palpated on the pelvicexam. Some of the urinary complications thatoccur in 5 percent of broids are cause for con-cern because they may be due to compression ofthe ureter (outflow tract from kidney to bladder)that can cause enlargement of the kidneys andcompromise of kidney function. Fibroids are thought to be the cause of 2 to 10 percent of cases of infertility. There are several pos-sible reasons for this. The tumors may interferewith implantation of the fertilized ovum, they maycause compression on the fallopian tubes and inter-fere with motility of sperm or egg, or they maycause early miscarriage. They may also cause peri-odic anovulation or abnormal uterine blood flowand may obstruct sperm. Large broids may affectpregnancy by interfering with the fetus growth,leading to potential intrauterine growth retarda-tion, premature rupture of membranes, retained329UTERINE FIBROIDS placenta, postpartum hemorrhage, abnormal labor, or an abnormal lie of the fetus. Not all practicingobstetricians would agree with these reports, andtheir main observations with pregnant women andlarge broids are an abnormal lie or postpartumhemorrhage. The incidence of miscarriage due tobroids is unknown but estimated to be two tothree times greater than normal. If a broid uterus is present, it can often be felt during a pelvic examination. It usually feelsrm but can vary from soft to rock-hard. Theuterus can be irregularly shaped or irregularlyenlarged and often feels like it has protrusions.Most of the time it is not painful during theexam. Many times women don't realize they havea broid until the practitioner nds it. This is notcause for alarm. Fibroids are benign growthsmost of the time. The worrisome broid is a rap-idly growing one; the rare malignant uterine sar-coma may have to be considered in these cases. After the pelvic exam, a pelvic ultrasound is the most useful tool in diagnosing a broid. Thisimaging test is able to identify broids and delin- eate the size and to some degree the location, aswell as identify that the ovaries are normal in size.The ultrasound detects the contours of theuterus, the broids (called hypechoic masses),compression of the ureters, any potential enlarge-ment of the kidneys caused by the compression,and, of course, the presence of an enlarged uterus.It is difcult for the ultrasound to detect broidssmaller than 2 cm. A magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) test is more accurate in assessing thenumber, size, and location of broids, but it doesnot provide signicant enough additional infor-mation to be worth the cost. A hysteroscopy candetect submucous tumors. An x-ray can diagnosecalcied broids. The main diagnostic consideration is differ- entiating a possible broid from the followingconditions: ovarian malignant tumor, an abscessin the fallopian tube/ovarian region, a diverticu-lum from the colon, a pelvic kidney (rare), endo-metriosis, adenomyosis (endometriosis withinthe muscle wall of the uterus), congenital anom-alies, adhesions in the pelvis, or a rare retroperi-toneal tumor. Not all of these considerations canbe distinguished from the medical history, phys-ical exam, and pelvic ultrasound. Surgery may berequired to distinguish one condition from theKEY CONCEPTS Uterine broids are benign and common. We do not know what causes broids. Fibroids are estrogen dependent (some may even be progesterone dependent). The majority of the time there are no symptoms, but when there is pelvic pain, abnormal bleed-ing, or infertility, uterine broids must be considered. Abnormal bleeding may be caused by uterine broids. Abnormal bleeding warrants a visit to your health-care practitioner. There are several kinds of broids based on location. An enlarged uterus or abnormal nding on a pelvic exam may require further testing to determine the diagnosis. Less than 1 percent of broids are malignant, but rapidly growing broids warrant furtherexploration.PREVENTION Ensure regular ovulation. Avoid situations that promote lack of ovulation, such as stress. Avoid estrogen-only medications. Dietary phytoestrogens (soy, flax, red clover) do not appear to stimulate the growth of broids. Practice good nutritional habits with a diet that is higher in complex carbohydrates, higher in fruits and vegetables, and low in saturated fats, alcohol, sugar, or other foods that interfere withthe liver's role in metabolizing hormones. Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can lead to higher estrogen effects on the uterus.330WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE other. Laparoscopy is the denitive method of excluding these other diagnoses from broids,even though laparoscopy is not typically done todiagnose broids. Only when there is great con-cern or lack of clarity about the diagnosis will theprocedure be warranted. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Over the more than 23 years I have been in clin- ical practice, not many health problems haveeluded successful treatment as consistently asuterine broids. Women who are seeking analternative to drug or surgical treatment for uter-ine broids will not nd an easy, reliable alterna-tive to shrink the tumors with natural medicine.Using the protocols in this book, we are usuallyable to successfully resolve or improve mostsymptoms that relate to the broids such asabnormal bleeding, pelvic pain or pressure, andbackache. In addition, there are natural therapiesthat may be able to slow the growth of thebroids to avoid further problems. When it comes to shrinking broids, espe- cially the large ones, natural therapies can onlysignicantly shrink a small minority of cases.There are individual cases that report reductionin size on pelvic ultrasound, disappearance ofsymptoms, and even total disappearance of anyevidence of broids. I myself can report caseswhere broid growth and the size of the uterushave been signicantly reduced. The problem isthat the results are very inconsistent. Often thecases that have shown the most dramaticimprovements are the women who are nearingmenopause or postmenopausal whose broidsshrink because of the natural decrease in theirestrogen levels. It may be possible to reduce uterine broids through alternative means and avoid a surgery ordrug treatment that your gynecologist has rec-ommended, but, more likely than not, largebroids that are causing symptoms that have notbeen successfully dealt with will indeed requiresome kind of conventional intervention. My main goals with women who have large broidsare to (1) deal with problem symptoms, (2) try tostabilize the situation and hold out until meno-pause, and (3) recognize the clinical situationswhen conventional treatment intervention isappropriate and reasonable. One aspect of being a naturopathic physician is to more fully educate patients about theirhealth and health problems so that they canmake informed decisions about their health care.With uterine broids, I have often been in theposition of discussing surgical options or proce-dures that not all gynecologists discussed withtheir patients. Educating the woman who isfaced with a possible hysterectomy and nding asurgeon or gynecologist who is skilled in thesealternatives may be the most important servicean alternative provider can offer. There are manynew conventional therapies that can be alterna-tives to a hysterectomy in many cases. These new therapies include hysteroscopic resection,embolization, and laparoscopic surgery. How-ever, not all cases of broids may be successfullytreated with these methods. Nutrition Even though diet changes alone are unlikely to shrink broids, good dietary habits are stillimportant. Clinical observation has taught methat all natural therapies work best in the contextof a healthy lifestyle. Improving one's diet mayhelp in small ways, to decrease heavy bleeding orthe pain and discomfort caused by the broids.Besides these potential benets, dietary improve-ments will improve your general well-being. Also, women with uterine broids may be at higher risk for endometrial cancer due to thehigher estrogen levels. A diet high in saturatedfats is associated with higher blood levels of estro-gen, potentially exacerbating the problem. Low-ber diets are associated with elevated estrogenlevels and poor excretion of estrogen. Poor nutri-tional habits can also lead to dysfunctional estrogen331UTERINE FIBROIDS metabolism and inhibit the body's ability to break down and excrete excess estrogen. The tradition of naturopathic medicine holds that the health and vitality of an individualdepends on the health of the liver and the wholedigestive system. The liver's basic functions arevascular, secretory, and metabolic. As a vascularorgan, the liver is a major reservoir of blood and lters over one quart of blood per minute.The liver removes bacteria, endotoxins, antigen-antibody complexes, and other particles from thecirculatory system. The liver's secretory functionsare the synthesis and secretion of bile. The livermanufactures about one quart of bile daily. Bileis required for the absorption of fat-soluble sub-stances, including some vitamins. The majorityof the bile secreted from the liver into the intes-tines is reabsorbed. The metabolic functions ofthe liver are involved in carbohydrate, fat, andprotein metabolism; the storage of vitamins andminerals; the formation of numerous biochemi-cal factors; and the detoxication or excretioninto the bile of hormones such as estrogen as wellas histamines, drugs, and pesticides. The liver not only has to process the foods that we eat every day but also detoxies harmfulsubstances, both those we produce from normalmetabolism and those we are exposed to in ourenvironment. In addition, it metabolizes anddeactivates hormones. The liver metabolizesestrogen so it can be eliminated from the body byconverting it to estrone and nally to estriol, aweaker form of estrogen that has very little abil-ity to stimulate the uterus. If the liver cannoteffectively metabolize estradiol, the uterus maybecome overestrogenized and respond withbroid growths. Saturated fats, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and junk foods are unhealthy and problematic for tworeasons: (1) they interfere with the body's abilityto metabolize estradiol to estrone to estriol, foods are decient in B vitaminsor interfere with B-vitamin metabolism. If B vita-mins are lacking in the diet, the liver is missingsome of the raw materials it needs to carry out its metabolic processes and regulate estrogen levels.A recent animal study suggests that lycopene sup-plementation (high in yellow/orange fruits andvegetables and especially high in tomatoes,tomato sauce, and tomato juice) may decrease theincidence and size of leiomyomas. 23Another study extolled the benets of a vegetarian diet bynding that women who suffered from broidswere more likely to have high consumption of redmeat and ham and have low consumption offruits and green vegetables. 24 Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, buck- wheat, millet, and rye are excellent sources of Bvitamins. Whole grains also help the body toexcrete estrogens through the bowel. The role ofwhole-grain ber in lowering estrogen levels wasrst reported in 1982. 25This study found that vegetarian women who eat a high-ber, low-fatdiet have lower blood estrogen levels thanomnivorous women with low-ber diets. Onceagain, we can see why a high-ber diet mightprevent and perhaps reduce uterine broidsthrough the estrogen connection. A high-ber diet may also help relieve some of the bloating and congestion associated withbroids. By bulking up the stool and regulatingbowel movements, some of these symptoms mayimprove. Some women have a hard time tolerat-ing increased ber in their diet because of com-promised digestive function. In these cases, itmay be necessary to increase ber slowly andinclude digestive support such as enzymes or acidophilus. Because there is an association between having uterine broids and a fourfold increase inthe risk of endometrial cancer, 1three dietary rec- ommendations stand out above all else: increaseber, decrease dietary fat, and increase soy prod-ucts and other legumes. Researchers at theCancer Research Center at the University ofHawaii published a case-controlled, multiethnic(Japanese, Caucasian, Native Hawaiian, Filipino,and Chinese) population study to examine the332WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE role of dietary soy, ber, and related foods and nutrients on the risk of endometrial cancer.26 The diets of 300 women with endometrialcancer were compared with women in the gen-eral multiethnic population. The researchersfound that high fat intake was positively associ-ated with endometrial cancer, whereas a diet richin ber, soy, and other legumes reduced the riskof endometrial cancer. The study concluded thatplant-based diets low in calories from fat, high inber, and rich in legumes (especially soybeans),whole-grain foods, vegetables, and fruits reducethe risk of endometrial cancer. While I can't say that lowering fat and increasing soy and ber intake will denitely pre-vent or treat broids, these nutritional habits dolower the risk of endometrial cancer. Since uter-ine broids are associated with an increase in therisk of endometrial cancer, it logically followsthat these diet recommendations could help withbroids. Some people have raised the concern that women with uterine broids should avoid soyfoods for their high content of phytoestrogens(specically isoflavones) because phytoestrogensmay have a weak estrogenic effect. The answerappears to be that this is not necessary. Soyphytoestrogens do not have an estrogenic effecton the uterus, at least in the usual doses. This wasmost recently conrmed in a Chinese study. 27 This population-based, case-controlled studyobtained detailed information from a food-frequency questionnaire on soy food intake overve years. The participants were 832 women,ages 30 to 69, who were diagnosed with endome-trial cancer from 1997 to 2001. This group wascompared with 846 control-matched womenselected from the Shanghai Residential Registry,who had an average intake of 42.5 mg of soy-based isoflavones per day. This study demonstrated that regular con- sumption of soy foods, as either soy protein orsoy isoflavones, was inversely associated with therisk of endometrial cancer. Moreover, this studyindicated that isoflavones are selectively estro- genic and antiestrogenic; they have an estrogeniceffect on some tissues and organs and an anti-estrogenic effect on others. Soy foods may beanalogous to a class of drugs called selective estro-gen receptor modulators (SERMs). In the uterus,soy isoflavones appear to have an antiestrogeniceffect, with the possible exception of when they areused in high doses daily for a longer term. Long-term high-dose use of soy may be dif- ferent than the usual average typical daily con-sumption of soy. In one study, one group ofpostmenopausal women were given soy tabletscontaining 150 mg of soy isoflavones per day for ve years. 28The second group received an identical placebo tablet for ve years. Results ofendometrial biopsies were obtained at baseline,30 months, and ve years after the beginning of the treatment. At the ve-year endpoint, 70percent of the women on the 150 mg of soyisoflavones had atrophic tissue versus 81 percentwho received the placebo. After ve years, theincidence of endometrial hyperplasia was signi-cantly higher in the isoflavone-treated group,3.37 percent versus 0 percent. There were vecases of simple hyperplasia and one of complexhyperplasia. No cases of atypical hyperplasia orendometrial cancer occurred during the veyears. This is the rst study that raises concernsabout long-term, high-dose isoflavone supple-mentation and its effects on the endometrium. Itwould typically take three to ve servings of soyfoods per day to achieve 150 mg. One servingper day of soy foods is only 25 to 60 mg per day,depending on the soy food item. Isoflavones appear to be able to act as a par- tial agonist, binding to the estrogen receptor.Because the action of isoflavones is weaker thanthat of estrogens at low doses and forshort durations, these phytoestrogens seem to be antagonistic. They are able to counteract theeffects of endogenous estrogens. When treatmentis prolonged and at a higher dose, the agonisteffects are more evident and the isoflavones have333UTERINE FIBROIDS an estrogenic effect. It is important to note that at 30 months there was no difference betweenthe isoflavone-treated group and the placebogroup. It was only after ve years that the dose of 150 mg per day produced an estrogenic effectin a small number of women. The subject of phytoestrogens is discussed in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapter12 in the discussion of menopause. Nutritional Supplements As mentioned earlier, many of the symptoms of enlarged broids can be effectively treated usingnatural therapies. For abnormal bleeding andpelvic pain, refer to Chapters 1 and 13. In thissection, I will largely be discussing the traditionalnaturopathic methods of trying to reduce the sizeof uterine broids or to inhibit their growth.These recommendations are based more on tra-dition, theory, logic, and clinical experience thanon scientic evidence. Lipotropic Factors. Supplements such as inositol and choline exert a lipotropic effect,meaning they promote the removal of fat fromthe liver. Lipotropic supplements are usually acombination vitamin and herbal formulationand sometimes an animal liver extract designedto support the liver's function in removing fat,detoxifying the body's wastes, detoxifying exter-nal and and excreting estrogens.These lipotropic products vary in their formula-tions depending on the manufacturer, but theyare all similar and have the same uses in mind.Because the liver is the most important organ ofmetabolism, naturopathic physicians believe thatwhen the liver function improves, metabolismimproves, making this treatment fundamental tothe treatment of many chronic diseases. Lipotropic Factors 1-4 tablets per day with mealsPancreatic Enzymes. There are three cate- gories of pancreatic enzymes: Lipases: enzymes that help digest along with bile. A deciency of lipase results inmalabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Amylases: enzymes that break down starch molecules into smaller sugars. Proteases: trypsin, chymotrypsin, and car- boxypeptidase break down protein moleculesinto single amino acids. Supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is usually done to treat pancreatic insufciency.Pancreative insufciency manifests itself insymptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, athleticinjuries, and\u2014one of the most controversialuses\u2014the treatment of cancer. The logic for the treatment of uterine broids is similar to the logic for the treatment of cancer.Enzyme preparations have been used at the Con-treras Clinic in Mexico and by Drs. WilliamKelley and Nicholas Gonzalez as part of a cancertreatment protocol. There is little evidence in the scientic literature to support their use, butthe logic is that the pancreatic enzymes willdigest the protein cell membrane surroundingthe malignant cells. By doing so, the immunecells will then be able to enter the cancer cells andalter the abnormal cell division of the cancercells. In the case of uterine broids, the belief isthat the pancreatic enzymes will help to digestthe brous/smooth muscle tissue and dissolve thebroids. When used for this purpose, the pancre-atic enzyme supplement must be taken betweenmeals rather than with meals. Pancreatic Enzymes 2-4 capsules 3 times per day between meals334WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Botanical Medicines Traditional Herbs. Many plants have been used in traditional herbal medicines designed totreat women with uterine broids. The plantsand herbal formulations talked about here areused to try to shrink uterine broids; herbs usedto deal with abnormal bleeding and uterinecramping are discussed in Chapters 1 and 13. Scutellaria barbata , commonly used in tradi- tional Chinese medicine for its purported antitu-mor properties, was shown to inhibit theproliferation of uterine smooth muscle cells andact as an aromatase inhibitor contributing todecreased broid growth in vitro. 29-31 Other botanicals used in traditional Chinese medicinethat show some promise in treating broids invivo include poria and cinnamon. 32 T raditional herbalists have developed various botanical uterine broid protocols and reportmodest success in reducing the size and numberof uterine broids. I have used many herbs andherbal formulations over the years in an attemptto shrink broids, and I present the protocolbelow from one of the traditional herbalists, RickScalzo, as an option for your consideration.

There are three types of estrogen-like substancescalled phytoestrogens found in plants: resorcylicacid lactones, steroids and phenolics.Phytoestrogens are present in virtually every plantin at least modest levels, with some plants havingparticularly high levels. Resorcylic acid lactonesare not true phytoestrogens but are mycotoxinsproduced by soil-dwelling molds. Their presencein plants is the result of contamination withmolds. Steroids are the classic steroidal estrogens(estradiol and estrone) and are found in veryminute amounts in a few plants such as apple seed,date palm, and pomegranate seed in the range ofone to ten parts per billion. 26, 33, 34 Diosgenin is a steroid derivative and is found in at least 20 plants,including wild yam species. Beta-sitosterol is themost common phytosterol and is distributedwidely through the plant kingdom. It is found inplant oils such as wheat germ oil, cottonseed oil,and soybean oil. Beta-sitosterol is the dominantphytosterol found in licorice root, palmetto, andred clover. Stigmasterol is closely related to beta-sitosterol. Soybean oil is an important source ofstigmasterol and is a better source for laboratorysynthesis of progesterone than is beta-sitosterol.Some herbal sources include burdock, fennel,licorice, alfalfa, anise, and sage. The phenolic phytoestrogens are members of the flavonoids, the largest single family of plantsubstances, which has over 4,000 individual mem-bers. The term flavonoid derives from the Latin flavus meaning \"yellow\" because the flavonoids are responsible for the yellow, red, white, and bluepigments in plants. Phenolics include isoflavones,which are higher in legumes and especially soy-beans any plants; coumestans, with estrogenic that isapproximately more estrogenic than theisoflavones; 35, 36 and lignans, high in grains and cereals and highest in flaxseed. There has been some concern and contro- versy about how phytoestrogens affect the uterus;if they have an estrogenic effect, they should be avoided by women with uterine broids orendometrial cancer. We talked earlier about soy-beans and how they are actually associated with areduced incidence of uterine cancer. 26I do not believe that eating a high soy diet is something tobe concerned about; in fact I recommendincreasing the soy foods in the diet in order toreduce the estrogen burden in the body. Most of the research on the effects of phyto- estrogens on the uterus is found in relationshipto the agricultural industry and the health ofgrazing animals. In the 1940s, it was reportedthat the red clover sheep grazed on in Australiawas responsible for their infertility. 37A Finnish study of pasture legumes determined that redclover contained the highest concentrations ofphytoestrogens 38and that abundant intake of red clover resulted in fertility problems in cattle.39 In one study on the effects of phytoestrogens in sheep, it was noted that both coumestans andisoflavones produce changes in the typical stimula-tion with steroidal hormones such as estradiol inall of the target organs. 40Among these changes was an increase in uterine weight. Other investigatorshave examined the binding of phytoestrogens tothe uterus and vagina. Coumestrol has temporarilyenhanced the uptake of estradiol by the uterus andvagina only one hour after being injected intomice. 41Researchers also noted that coumestrol actually inhibited the uptake of estradiol by theuterus over the long term, and they postulated thatthere was actually an inhibitory effect at the estra-diol receptor sites. Other researchers have notedthat coumestans and isoflavones compete withestradiol for uterine receptor sites but have lessafnity for them than estradiol. 42 Coumestrol has been found to increase uterine weight at a 100 mcg dose when given to rats at acertain time in the development of glands. 43It appears that the weak estrogenic effect of phyto-estrogens is variable and can even be weakly anti-estrogenic. Variability is based on dose, target tissue,the woman's hormonal environment, and more. 336WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Higher does of phytoestrogens have stimu- lated some concern. However, it is reassuring thatin countries with a high intake of phytoestrogens(Japan, Thailand, China), women do not have anincrease in uterine broids. However, they dohave a four- to sixfold lower incidence of breastcancer 44(also an estradiol target tissue), although how a substance affects one tissue is not necessar-ily translated to how it affects another. Again, though, I must come back to the effects of soy on the endometrium, which may bedifferent than some of the other plants, mostnotably red clover. Like data on breast cancer,data on women of different cultures support theconclusion that soy phytoestrogens are not anestrogen stimulus for the endometrium. Rather,they probably act as an estrogen antagonist andare associated with low rates of endometrialcancer in countries where soy phytoestrogenintake is high. 45 Based on these studies, my recommendation to those with uterine broids is to eat a diet highin soy products; however, my current cautionaryadvice would be to avoid the use of red clover. In cases where conventional treatment with GnRH inhibitors is needed, thus causing a phar-maceutically induced menopause, Ipriflavone (asemisynthetic soy derivative) supplementationhas been helpful at preventing side effects such asbone loss and increased LDL. 46, 47 Natural (Bio-Identical) Progesterone. His- torically, studies have suggested that proges-terone may inhibit growth of uterine broids. A. Lipschutz demonstrated that progesteroneadministered to guinea pigs prevented formationof tumors that had been induced by estrogen. 48 In 1946, A. Goodman reported six cases of clin-ically diagnosed uterine broids that regressedafter using progesterone therapy. 49 Dr. John Lee proposes that because uterine broids are a result of estrogen stimulation andwhat he calls estrogen dominance, progesteroneis the solution. He asserts that estrogen domi-nance is a much greater problem than is recog- nized by conventional medicine. \"Since manywomen in their mid-thirties begin to havenonovulating cycles, they are producing muchless progesterone than expected, but still produc-ing normal (or more) estrogen. They retain waterand salt, their breasts swell and become brocys-tic, they gain weight (especially around the hipsand torso), they become depressed and lose sexdrive, their bones suffer mineral loss, and theydevelop broids. All are signs of estrogen domi-nance relative to a progesterone deciency. Whensufcient natural progesterone is replaced,broid tumors no longer grow in size (they gen-erally decrease in size) and can be kept fromgrowing until menopause, after which they willatrophy. This is the effect of reversing estrogendominance.\" 50The preferred form of natural progesterone for treating broids (unless heavybleeding is involved) is a topical cream with atleast 400 mg of progesterone per ounce. Be advised, however, that there is a counter theory about the relationship of progesterone touterine broids. Dr. Mitchell Rein and his col-leagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital pub-lished a report in 1995 stating that not only isthere no evidence that estrogen directly stimu-lates myoma growth, but that it is actually prog-esterone and progestins that promote the growthof broids. 51The authors cite the biochemical, histologic, and clinical evidence that supports animportant role for progesterone and progestins inthe growth of uterine myomas. Their compre-hensive hypothesis is based on an analysis ofmany different technical studies, which they con-clude suggest that the development and growthof myomas involves a multistep chain of events. Since both of these schools of thought are theoretical, I encourage all women and theirhealth-care practitioners to educate themselves soas to make the best individual decision. Fibroidsare generally not urgent or life threatening, sothere is room for experimentation and observa-tion to determine the best course of treatment.337UTERINE FIBROIDS Natural (Bio-Identical) Progesterone Cream 14tsp of a cream containing at least 400 mg/oz 1 to 2 times daily for 1 week after menses; 14to12tsp twice daily for the next 2 weeks. Discontinue for 1 week dur-ing menses. Apply the cream to the inner arms, chest, inner thighs, and/or palms. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH Small broids that cause few symptoms require no treatment, only observation of growth, which canbe done with annual pelvic exams. If the patientnotices new symptoms, or the physician thinksthere is a change in the broid, ultrasound canfollow and assess the location and size of broids.Because there is some concern about estrogen'srole in promoting the growth of broids, use oforal contraceptives in premenopausal women andhormone therapy in postmenopausal womenshould be prescribed with care, close follow-up,and the lowest doses possible.In cases of broids where heavy bleeding exists, progestogens or estrogen is used to manage thebleeding, and any anemia is treated with iron supplements. T reatment of broids with progesta-tional agents (norethindrone, megestrol, medroxy-progesterone acetate) has been used, but there isno consensus regarding the routine use of thesedrugs to shrink broids. The progestational agentsproduce a hypoestrogenic effect by inhibitinggonadotropin secretion and suppressing ovarianfunction. They may also have a direct antiestrogeneffect. Even though estrogen and progestogensmay be necessary to control bleeding frombroids, most practitioners do not consider themuseful in shrinking broids. When used to controlbleeding, there is always a concern about the pos-sible effect on the increase in growth of the broid,so broids need to be periodically evaluated byphysical exam and/or pelvic ultrasound. Agents such as leuprolide acetate (Lupron) have been used to temporarily control bleeding,correct anemia, and shrink tumors. This allows alarge tumor to shrink to a more manageable size.Sample Treatment Plan for Uterine Fibroids Diet Eat a high-ber, low-fat diet. Eat a diet high in whole grains (brown rice, oats, buckwheat, millet, rye, whole wheat). Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables. Eat a diet high in flaxseed, particularly ground flaxseed. Eat a diet high in legumes, especially soy products, 1 serving per day. Avoid saturated fats, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and junk foods.

See Chapter 13 for pelvic and menstrual pains.338WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Lupron can be used to change the need for an abdominal hysterectomy to a vaginal or laparo-scopic type, which shortens patient recovery.Lupron suppresses ovarian estrogen secretion,thereby causing temporary med-ical menopause. The use of GnRH analogs hassuccessfully reduced uterine and tumor size by 40 to 65 percent. Most reduction occurs within8 weeks, and maximum reduction occurs withinabout 12 weeks. After the treatment is discontin-ued, the uterus and broids often return to theiroriginal size within three months. On occasion,the use of Lupron may make surgical treatmentunnecessary, but usually the solution is tempo-rary and surgery is inevitable. One of the most signicant disadvantages of Lupron is that it is expensive, costing approxi-mately $600 per month. The other is that it putsthe patient into an instant menopausal state withhot flashes and other side effects, which can becontrolled with very small add-back doses ofeither estrogen or a progestogen. The GnRHanalogs cannot be used long-term (more than sixmonths) because they can lead to irreversiblebone loss and elevated total cholesterol. The standard surgical treatments for uterine broids are a hysterectomy or a myomectomy.Hysterectomy, the removal of the uterus, is theonly approach that provides a permanent solutionfor broids. Myomectomies are surgeries thatremove the broids uterus. There aretwo basic approaches: abdominal myomectomies,which are used primarily for pedunculated, intramural myomas. Hysterectomies can be done with an abdomi- nal incision, a vaginal incision, or by laparoscopy.Except in vaginal hysterectomies, it is possible to leave the cervix, removing the uterine fundus(body) only, which contains the uterine broids.There is really no reason to remove either ovariesor cervix to treat the symptoms of broids. Byleaving the cervix, the normal length and sensa-tions of the vagina are maintained. With a vaginal hysterectomy, the entire uterus, including thecervix, is removed. In either case, the decision toleave the ovaries depends on the patient and herdoctor. Most doctors would recommend leavingovaries in women under 45 and might recom-mend removing them in women over 45 becausethey will soon be menopausal, oftentimes to pre-vent ovarian cancer. However, we cannot removeall of our organs to reduce the risk of cancer. Sincethe lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1 in 70,women with healthy ovaries should be encouragedto leave them in place when possible. Special cir-cumstances, such as a strong family history ofovarian cancer, might warrant their removal. Myomectomies are particularly appropriate for women who wish to retain their childbearingoption or in women with a small submucousmyoma that causes a bleeding problem. there are only a few physicians in the UnitedStates capable of performing them. Abdominalmyomectomies have many of the same risks asso-ciated with a hysterectomy and can often be associated with more blood loss. Many womenfeel much more comfortable with retaining theirreproductive organs and should be encouraged to nd a physician who is comfortable with the concept of myomectomy when the patientprefers that approach. Hysteroscopic myomectomies are done with an instrument inserted through the vagina, upthe cervical canal, and into the uterine cavity,providing a view of the interior of the uterus andan instrument that can slice or cauterize the sub-mucous broid. Sometimes, when a woman ispast childbearing age, an associated destructionof the uterine lining tissue is performed at thesame time. This is called an ablation and furtherhelps to reduce menstrual flow. There are other treatments for broids, some of which are gaining more popularity and some339UTERINE FIBROIDS of which are still experimental. Uterine artery embolization is designed to reduce broids byobstructing the blood supply that nourishesthem. The procedure is done by a radiologist inthe x-ray department. It entails making a smallincision in the groin and threading a smallcatheter into the femoral artery. The doctorworks the catheter up to the vessels that supplythe uterus under guidance with dye and x-rays.Microscopic plastic particles are injected to closeoff the uterine vessels, temporarily creating acondition of shock for the uterus. Becausebroids only have one blood supply, the shock isoften enough to cause them to begin to degener-ate (necrose). The uterus, however, has bloodsupply through the uterotubal ligaments andvaginal arteries as well and recovers from the ini-tial loss of blood flow most of the time. Embolizations have been done for about 10 years, and now there is enough data to indicatethat there is a less than 1 percent chance that awoman will need an emergency hysterectomybecause of uterine necrosis after an embolization.There is a 1 to 5 percent chance that the patientcould become menopausal because of a decreasein the blood supply to the ovaries occurringunintentionally at the time of the embolization.The patient can expect signicant pain or cramp-ing for up to six months, treatable with painmedications and anti-inflammatories, and mostbroids will reduce approximately 50 percent intheir size. This is more successful for treatment ofpain from broids than bleeding, but it canimprove bleeding. The new broid treatment that conventional medicine is investigating is selective progesteronereceptor modulators (SPRMs). Ru-486, the onlycurrently used SPRM, is in investigative trials fortreatment of broid pain and bleeding and helpsby reducing the size of broids. Most of thesetrials suggest that the medication is well toleratedwith minimal side effects. A second SPRM calledasoprisnil has been shown to signicantly shrinkbroids with minimal side effects and is currentlyin phase III trials. It is not known if this is a tem- porary or permanent treatment. The other area of medical research involves antibrinolytic agents. There are other brindeposition diseases such as keloids (excessivegrowth of scar tissue) and pulmonary brosisthat serve as brin disease models. Researchersare beginning to look at medications that reducethe growth and deposition of brin for treatmentof broids. There are no signicant investiga-tional trials underway at the present time. The newest nonmedical technique being used to treat broids is high-intensity focused ultra-sound. This is done in the radiology departmentwith MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultra-sound. The uterus is scanned for broids anddivided into plains at different depths, and theultrasound is directed in small increments intothe broid. It is completely noninvasive and isjust beginning to be used. The setups are veryexpensive and the machines are few and farbetween at this point. The thermal ablation treatment techniques that transfer laser, radio frequency, microwave, orcryotherapy through either a percutaneous or atransvaginal probe (which were evaluatedbetween 2000 and 2003) are largely outdatednow and are not thought to be an effective formof treatment. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) Four clinical problems that require special con- sideration in broid cases are heavy, prolonged,or frequent bleeding; infertility; enlarged kid-neys; and pregnancy complications. Menstrual flows that are longer than 7 days in duration, more frequent than every 21 days,involve intermenstrual spotting/bleeding orexcessive blood loss (more than 80 ml per cyclecompared to the normal average of 33 ml)deserve a visit to your licensed primary care prac-titioner. It is difcult to quantify the number of340WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE pads or tampons used as a criterion for determin- ing excessive blood loss. Bleeding that meets orexceeds saturation of a super tampon or heavypad every hour for six to eight hours or morerequires immediate intervention. Bleeding thatexceeds this deserves an immediate phone call toyour practitioner and urgent management forhemorrhage. Some women tolerate excessiveblood loss better than others. If you are feelinglightheaded, this is cause for concern. A hemo-globin and hematocrit test can determine if youare anemic from blood loss. Additional tests maybe done to determine if your iron stores are low. Infertile women who have uterine broids may need to consider the causal relationship. Eventhough broids may be a cause of only a small per-centage of infertility cases, if it is the cause, thesolutions aren't particularly optimistic. It isreported that only a 16 percent pregnancy rate fol-lows myomectomy for infertility. Postoperativeadhesions and the low return question the value ofmyomectomy for this set of circumstances. Pregnancy in women with uterine broids is generally problem-free, but each situation is differ-ent. Even though broids can grow during preg-nancy, only a very few actually do have continuedgrowth. Six weeks after delivery, many uterinebroids will decrease in size to become similar tothe size it was prior to pregnancy. That said, some complications can occur during pregnancy. An enlarging broid duringpregnancy can degenerate and cause pain, infec-tion, and fever. Though debatable, the presenceof broids can also affect implantation of the fer-tilized egg with the potential for an early miscar-riage, bleeding later in the pregnancy, prematurerupture of membranes, and postpartum hemor-rhage. Other potential complications include adecrease in the ability of the uterus to contractduring labor or obstruction of the birth canal. Inwomen who have previously had a myomectomy, the safety of a vaginal delivery is controversial.One school of thought holds that if there hasbeen an incision into the uterine cavity, the deliv-ery must be by cesarean section. Other practi-tioners believe that if there was no infection afterthe myomectomy, the incision into a nonpreg-nant uterus is of no concern in subsequent vagi-nal deliveries. Remember, the mere presence of uterine broids does not require treatment. If you havesymptoms, they can most often be managed withalternative therapies, although excessive bleedingmay require drug or surgical intervention. Even if you have no symptoms, a licensed primaryhealth-care practitioner should examine youevery six months to rule out rapid enlargement.This is especially true for women who are plan-ning pregnancies or approaching menopause.Rapidly enlarging broids warrant special atten-tion because of the potential for malignancy. Ayoung woman whose uterus is larger than a 12-to 14-week pregnancy should carefully monitorthe broid growth and consider the need for sur-gical intervention, because there are many moreyears for potential further growth and the biggerthe uterus and broids, the more technically dif-cult the surgery. Women rarely need to rush to any decision about surgical intervention, except in the case ofexcessive bleeding problems, a rapidly enlargingbroid uterus, or prolonged or severe pain. If sur-gical intervention becomes appropriate, remem-ber that you may have a number of surgicaloptions and explore some of the newer tech-niques. If a hysterectomy is indeed the bestoption, and sometimes it is, then be sure to dis-cuss with your surgeon whether you would liketo keep your ovaries; most of the time, there is nopressing medical need to remove them.34120CHAPTER OVERVIEW Vaginal infections are responsible for an estimated 10 percent of all women's visits to health-carepractitioners. There are three general categories ofvaginitis: hormonal, irritant, and infectious. Hor-monal vaginitis, isusually found in young girls beforepuberty. (Atrophic vaginitis in menopausalwomen is addressed in greater detail in Chapter12.) Irritant vaginitis can be due to allergies tosuch substances as latex in condoms, spermicides,deodorants, soaps, perfumes, semen, or douches. 1 Irritation may also be due to hot tubs, mechanicalabrasion, sanitary napkins, tampons, toilet tissue,or topical medications. However, most vaginitis is due to a vaginal infection. More than 90 percent of vaginitis inreproductive-age women is caused by bacterialvaginosis, candidiasis, or trichomoniasis. gonorrhea, mycoplasma, campy-lobacter, and these, gonorrhea, chlamydia, andtrichomona are sexually transmitted. Women whohave sexually transmitted vaginitis require treat-ment with antibiotics to prevent pelvic inflamma-tory disorder; testing and treatment should beoffered to partners as well. To learn more aboutsexually transmitted infections, see Chapter 18. General symptoms of infectious vaginitis include a vaginal discharge, irritation, itching, andodor. Not all infectious causes of vaginitis have thesame symptoms, but they all are associated with avaginal discharge. Though vaginitis is often easilytreated, some women may experience chronic orrecurrent infections that may be resistant to usualtreatments. In addition, untreated vaginitis mayresult in more serious complications such as acuteor chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Vaginitis mayalso increase the transmission of other sexuallytransmitted infections like human immunode-ciency virus (HIV) and genital herpes. Vaginitis is most often a disorder of imbalance of the normal vaginal flora. Many of the organ-isms that are responsible for vaginitis, like gard-nerella, mycoplasma, staph, E. coli , and candida are naturally occurring in the healthy vagina.These organisms only become problematic whenthe delicate balance of the benecial bacterial, likeaerobic lactobacillus, is disrupted. There are anumber of factors that may adversely affect thisbalance by reducing the lactobacilli population,such as lubricants, nonoxynal-9 (spermicide), oralcontraceptives (OCs), hormonal changes, andantibiotics. Though self-diagnosis is common, it is not recommended, because it is difcult to make anaccurate diagnosis based on discharge, itching,and odor and because of the possibility of dualinfection. To properly treat vaginitis and avoidpotential treatment complications, it is essentialto know the exact diagnosis. Bacterial Vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal infections and abnormal vaginaldischarge and odor. Unfortunately, it can also beone of the infections most resistant to treatment.BV consists of a signicant polymicrobial over-growth. It is the result of alterations in the vagi-nal ecosystem rather than an infection caused byany single microorganism. In BV, the ordinarilylactobacilli-dominant vaginal environment isovergrown with anaerobes (mainly Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 342WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Peptostreptococcus ). This overgrowth results in the degradation of themucus membrane and shedding of the vaginal epithelium, resulting in a discharge, and maylead to potential complications in the uterus andfallopian tubes. The destruction of these mucinsexposes the epithelium to other organisms, withthe subsequent appearance of clue cells (cells thatline the vagina and now have clusters of bacteriaadhered to their surface). 2These are visualized with microscopy and are unique to BV. BV is characterized by decreased or absent Lactobacillus species and increased concentra- tions of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Othercharacteristic changes include elevated pH,greater than 4.5; formation of clue cells; odordue to increased vaginal fluid concentrations of diamines, polyamines, organic acids; 3-5 an upregulation suchas interleukin (IL)-1beta, a noticeable absence orrare presence of white blood cells in the vaginaldischarge; and a decrease in naturally protectivemolecules like secretory leukocyte proteaseinhibitor. Four diagnostic criteria, of which threemust be present, conrm a diagnosis of bacterialvaginosis. There are three main factors that are respon- sible for the decline of lactobacilli and conse-quential BV: 1. Intercourse without condoms: sperm alkalinizes the vagina, which depletes lactobacilli. 2. Douching, which also depletes lactobacilli.3. The absence of the kind of lactobacilli that produce peroxide. Broad-spectrum antibi-otics can also eliminate healthy vaginal lactobacilli. 6 Bacterial vaginosis may be merely an acute orepisodic condition, may become persistent, ormay resolve itself spontaneously.More than 50 percent of women with BV are asymptomatic. BV most often occurs among het-erosexual, sexually active women, but is not con-sidered a sexually transmitted disease. 7, 8Among those who are heterosexually active, BV is more fre-quent in women who have had intercourse at anearly age, those with more sexual partners, andamong women with concurrent or prior sexually transmitted diseases. 9BV can also exist among sexually abused children and lesbian partners of women with bacterial vaginosis. 10, 11 Several factors have been associated with the devel-opment of BV, such as cigarette smoking and racialbackground. Hispanic women are 50 percent morelikely than Caucasian women to develop BV, andAfrican-American women are twice as likely asCaucasian women to have BV. 12The reasons for these differences are not clear but may be due toless condom use in Hispanic women and increaseddouching in African-American women. The alterations in vaginal immune response and vaginal microflora associated with BV leavewomen more susceptible to other infections,including HIV and gonorrhea. 13-16Women with BV are also more likely to shed HIV, and there-fore BV may increase the transmission of HIV. 17 There are some potential consequences ofuntreated or undertreated BV. 18The bacteria can migrate into the uterus and the upper genitaltract and cause pelvic inflammatory disease in aminority of women who have the infection. Theloss of lactobacilli and the resulting degradationof the mucin layer, as well as loss of the localDiagnostic Criteria Three of the following criteria must be present to conrm a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. 1. A thin, frothy, gray, odorous discharge 2. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 with pH paper3. A wet-mount lab sample that reveals clue cells4. A positive whiff test (a sh odor detected when 10 percent potassium hydroxide is added to the discharge)343VAGINITIS immune response, may allow pathogens to ascend to the uterus and fallopian tubes. In preg-nant women, BV can cause premature rupture of membranes and premature labor, and it isresponsible for 70 to 80 percent of all perinataldeaths. 19BV is also responsible for approximately one-third of postpartum endometritis (infectionof the uterus). 20Additionally, women with sub- optimal vaginal flora are at increased risk forinfections following gynecologic surgery. It has been estimated that about 30 percent of women experience a recurrence of symptomaticBV within 30 to 90 days of treatment, and 70percent will have a recurrence within ninemonths. 21With BV, it may not be clear whether the repeat episode is a reinfection or a relapse.Reinfection implies that the original problemwas reversed and the patient was completelyasymptomatic before recurrence; relapse indi-cates that the symptoms and microbiology havenever returned to normal even though there mayhave been improvement or a period of improve-ment. Reinfection is a possibility due to exposureto the same factors that caused the rst episode.In heterosexual women not using condoms, rein-fection may be due to the alkalinizing effect ofsemen. This alkaline environment fosters over-growth of BV. The treatment for recurrent BVshould focus on preventing relapse, as this is themost common cause of recurrence. Possible rea-sons for relapse include (1) lack of reestablishingthe lactobacillus-dominant vaginal flora, (2) per-sistent overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, and (3) some of the pathogens have sequestered them-selves in inaccessible sites such as the endometrialcavity. A simple and useful method for monitoring patients during treatment for BV is pH paper. Ifa woman has a vaginal pH of less than 4.5 (somesay of less than or equal to 5.0), she has adequatenumbers of lactobacilli and does not have BV. The goal of treatment is to restore the vaginal pH to less than 4.5 and reestablish normal vagi-nal ecology. T reatment is considered successful ifit clears up the clue cells and amine shy odor and restores the vaginal flora to healthy levels of lactobacilli. Reexamination following treat-ment is fundamental to assure that the pH hasdecreased to less than 4.5. If it has not, then youare at risk for developing a recurrence. If pHremains greater than 4.5 following treatment,more aggressive use of lactobacillus and/or vagi-nal boric acid suppositories should be utilized.The rst follow-up should occur after the desig-nated treatment time of usually 7 to 14 days,then again in one month. T reatment of BV in nonpregnant women will reduce vaginal symptoms, lower the risk ofpostabortion and posthysterectomy infectiouscomplications, and may reduce transmission ofand infection with other sexually transmittedinfections. Women should refrain from sexual Prevention of Bacterial Vaginosis Practice safe sex, which is helpful in prevent- ing even infections not clearly considered tobe sexually transmitted, such as bacterial vaginosis. Consider regular condom use to prevent vaginitis and maintain a normal pH. Use condoms until treatment regimen is com- plete to prevent recurrence. Eat a diet rich in whole foods with little to no sugar or rened carbohydrates. Determine possible allergies to food, pollen, clothing detergent, and semen for recurrentcases. Determine possible infection with other organ- isms for recurrent cases. Increase intake of acidophilus yogurt and/or take supplemental lactobacillus supplements, especially when using antibiotics. Vaginal estrogen may be necessary to maintain an acidic vaginal environment in postmeno- pausal women. In cases of relapse, take boric acid and lacto- bacillus vaginally for 1 to 2 weeks, plus lacto- bacillus orally for 2 to 6 months.344WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE intercourse during the treatment period and until their vaginal ecology is normal. Women who haverecurrent BV following intercourse may need touse condoms or consider having the sexual partnertreated at the same time. Unfortunately, BV canbe the most difcult vaginal infection to treat sat-isfactorily with alternative treatments. However,even conventional treatments can be insufcientwithout a lot of patience and time. Candida Vaginitis Although vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as a candida or yeast infection,is often assumed to be the cause of vaginitis, only33 percent of vaginitis cases are in fact VVC.VVC is frequently misdiagnosed by both patientsand practitioners. It encompasses a broad rangeof issues, ranging from those who have coloniza-tion of yeast but are asymptomatic to those who have frequent, recurrent, and symptomaticepisodes. It is estimated that 75 percent of allwomen will have at least one VVC infection intheir life, 45 percent will have multiple episodes,and 5 to 8 percent will have recurrent episodes(RVVC, dened as four or more episodes withinone year). 22 Studies throughout the world have shown thatCandida albicans is the most common cause of VVC. It is the organism identied in 85 to 90percent of positive vaginal yeast cultures. How-ever, there are infections with nonalbicans speciessuch as C. glabrata ,C. tropicallis , and C. krusei , which are becoming more prevalent in theUnited States. Of the nonalbicans species, Can- dida glabrata is the most common. The number of VVC cases that are due to nonalbicans speciesis increasing and rose from 9.9 percent in 1988to 17.2 percent in 1995. 23It is thought that this increase is due at least in part to the increased useof over-the-counter treatment medications andthat nonalbicans species are becoming less andless susceptible to these agents. 24 A diagnosis of VVC is made by a combina- tion of history, clinical examination, microscopy,and, if necessary, a culture. The usual symptoms of VVC are acute itching and vaginal discharge.The discharge is typically described as cottagecheese-like in character, but it may actually varyfrom watery to thick. Symptoms may alsoinclude vaginal soreness, irritation, vulvar burn-ing, inflammation and swelling of both the inter-nal and external genital tissue, redness, pain withvaginal sexual activity, and urinary discomfort.The symptoms are often worse the week preced-ing the onset of menses with some relief after themenstrual flow. Self-diagnosis of VVC is unreliable and often results in misdiagnosis. There is even a concernthat physicians are frequently inaccurate in diag-nosing vaginal infections. 25The most candida- specic symptom is itching without discharge,and even this criterion correctly predicts VVC inonly 38 percent of patients. 26 The greatest concern in self-diagnosing and self-treating VVC is in women who have recur-rent VVC, dened as four or more candida-conrmed episodes of symptomatic infectionwithin one year. This occurs in approximately 5 percent of women 27and can be dangerous, as the underlying condition could go undiagnosedbecause the woman is repeatedly treating whatshe thinks are simple vaginal yeast infections.Recurrent VVC commonly affects women whoare immunocompromised as the result of AIDSor other predisposing conditions such as dia-betes, Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, hypo-or hyperthyroidism, or leukemia. There are otherpredisposing factors in recurrent infections thatmay also need to be addressed: high-estrogenmedication, antibiotics, hormones, contraceptivedevices, cytotoxic drugs, immunosuppressivedrugs, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, tightclothing, nylon underwear, pregnancy, and exces-sive sugar in the diet. Reinfection may also come from extravaginal sources. Although the sexual transmission of can-dida is still controversial, there is evidence thatsexual transmission might be a likely source of345VAGINITIS recurrent infection. In one study, the researchers found identical strains of candida in the malesexual partners of 48 percent of women withrecurrent VVC. 28, 29 Reservoirs of infection were found in the oral cavities of 36 percent of 33 het-erosexual couples, the rectums of 33 percent, andthe ejaculate of 15 percent of the men. 30This data suggests that oral-genital contact constitutesa probable mode of sexual transmission. Manyalternative practitioners treat the overgrowth ofcandida in the digestive track as well to addressthe possibility of migration from rectum to vagina.In fact, a 1977 study found that in 98 womenwith recurrent VVC, candida was always found inthe feces of women with current VVC and was notfound in women without VVC. 31Although numerous studies have failed to yield denitiveresults, it may provide a useful avenue of treat-ment in especially chronic and resistant cases. 32 The rst step in the physical evaluation is to determine if there is a vulvitis (inflammation ofthe external genital tissue) and/or vaginitis. Somewomen vulvar hyperplasia (prolifera-tive cell growth), vestibulitis tissue to thevagina), genital ulcerations, lichen sclerosis, orother dermatitis conditions. oftenhave vulvar and vaginal redness, swelling, anditching. A thick white discharge may be present,but many women with VVC do not have a dis-charge or do not have the typical thick and whitedischarge. The diagnosis can often be made in the prac- titioner's ofce by using 10 percent potassiumhydroxide (KOH) and microscopy that demon-strates features of yeast. Another diagnostic toolis pH paper. A vaginal pH of less than 4.5 helpsto exclude bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis,atrophic vaginitis, or a mixed bacterial/yeastinfection. A vaginal culture may help to establishthat yeast is in fact present for symptomatic women with negative microscopic ndings andto identify the genus and species. It cannot be overemphasized how the health of the entire body affects the internal ecosystemof the vagina. The vaginal pH and microflora,the hormonal cycles, and the vaginal immunetissue are all influenced by our general health anddietary habits, and this in turn determines oursusceptibility to vaginitis. A healthy diet assuresour body's defense system. A diet low in sugarsand rened carbohydrates is particularly impor-tant in preventing fact, arecent study conrmed that women withimpaired glucose tolerance were at higher risk forrecurrent vaginal candidiasis. 33In general, a well- balanced whole foods diet that is low in fat,sugars, rened foods, and alcohol is optimal inpreventing all infections. Some women who have severe, stubborn cases of chronic candida vaginitis may benetfrom stricter diets \"anti-candida\" diets can be rigor-ous and unnecessarily stressful. Some of thesediets are so restricted that they actually causeother health problems. Women who have self-diagnosed or who have been diagnosed with \"sys-temic candida\" by an alternative practitionermight want to make sure of this popular over-used diagnosis. Conventional medicine uses theterm systemic candidiasis to describe the situation when candida contaminates the blood streamand spreads throughout the body, causing pro-found illness affecting a wide variety of organ sys-tems. This state, according to this denition,only occurs in seriously immunocompromisedpatients, such as HIV-positive individuals. Inindividuals who have no serious immune de-ciency, any exposed warm, moist part of the bodyis susceptible to candida infection. Commonexamples of this would include vulvovaginitis,oral thrush, conjunctivitis (infection of the innereyelid), diaper rash, and infections of the nail,rectum, and other skin folds. In immuno-346WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE compromised individuals, systemic illnesses such as myocarditis (infection of the heart muscle),hepatosplenic abscess, pulmonary infection, cen-tral nervous system (CNS) infection, and chronicdisease states may occur. Alternative medicine has used the term sys- temic candidiasis to describe less intense situa- tions, in an attempt to explain a multitude ofgeneral symptoms such as headache, fatigue, gasand bloating, depression, and more. Perhaps abetter term for this would be systemic candida syndrome . Ruling out other causes of these gen- eral symptoms is important, and testing the stooland vaginal secretions for candida overgrowthand the blood for the candida antigen providesthe best hope for accurately diagnosing true sys-temic candida infections. The main concepts of managing VVC are accurate diagnosis, management of other influ-ences, and being creative and persistent whentreatment does not provide relief or recurrencesoccur. Taking shortcuts in history, physical exam, and testing can result in misdiagnosis, unneces-sary treatments, and delays in effective treatment.Most cases of VVC will be very effectively treatedwith natural methods. When this does not work, there are various oral and vaginal regimensincluding butoconazole cream, clotrimazolecream or vaginal tablet, miconazole cream or suppository,fluconazole oral vaginaltablets. T reatment options for flucona-zole and terconazole regimens, flucytosinevaginally, and boric acid vaginal capsules. While VVC may seem trivial to many, for some the discomfort, the chronicity, and thehealth-care costs incurred are excessive. T reat-ment strategies for candida vaginitis with naturaltherapies will focus on maintaining a normalvaginal pH, restoring normal ecology of thevagina, reducing inflammation, relieving symp-toms, and using natural either Chlamydia trachomatis orNeisseria gonorrhoeae . About 6 per- cent of all cases of a vaginal discharge are due totrichomoniasis, and about 5 million new casesappear annually. 36, 37 The prevalence of disease varies widely by population. Multiple sexual part-ners, African-American race, previous history gonorrhoeae , and nonuse of either barrier or hormonal contraceptives are known risk factors for acquisition of trichomoniasis. 38 T richomoniasis is associated with several signi-cant health consequences, including the transmis-sion of the human immunodeciency virus(HIV), infertility, atypical pelvic inflammatorydisease (PID), increased risk of postoperativeinfection, preterm births, and cervical dysplasia aswell as adverse pregnancy outcomes such asPrevention of Candida Vaginitis Preventing infections is almost always easier than treating them. Here are some simple strategies: Avoid wearing tight clothing.34 Avoid wearing pantyhose.35 Consider using condoms to prevent all types of vaginitis and maintain a normal pH in the vagina. Eat a whole foods diet with very little to no sugar and rened carbohydrates. Determine possible allergies to food, pollen, clothing detergent, and semen for recurrent cases. Determine possible infection with other organ- isms for recurrent cases. Increase intake of acidophilus yogurt and/or take lactobacillus supplements, especially when using antibiotics. Vaginal estrogen may be necessary to maintain an acidic vaginal environment in postmeno- pausal women.347VAGINITIS preterm delivery, premature rupture of mem- branes, and low-birth weight infants. The sexual transmission rates are higher from man to woman than from woman to man, andtransmission is considered rare from woman towoman. T richomoniasis is rarely transmitted toinfants born to infected mothers, and althoughthe trichomonas organism can survive for shortperiods on moist objects (toilet seats, benches,towels) or exposed bodily fluids (urine, vaginalexudate, semen), no cases of transmission byindirect or inanimate exposure have been docu-mented. Prevalence of trichomoniasis is highestamong women with multiple sexual partners and in women with other sexually transmittedinfections. 39-41 The most common complaints associated with trichomoniasis are vaginal discharge andvulvovaginal irritation and itching. Discharge ispresent in 50 to 75 percent of infected womenand is classically described as frothy or bubblyand (painful urination), and, in asmall number of patients, some degree of lowerabdominal pain. Vulvar redness is an uncommonnding, but vaginal redness is noted in as manyas 75 percent of patients. A \"strawberry cervix\" iscreated by dilatation of capillaries on the cervixwith small hemorrhages and is seen through amagnication device called a colposcope in asmany as 90 percent of cases. 42With the naked eye it is seen in only 2 percent of cases, but whenit is seen it is an almost sure sign of trichomoni-asis. As these clinical signs and symptoms are notsensitive enough or specic enough to be usedalone, it's most important to somehow identifythe organism. The time-honored method for diagnosing trichomonal infections has been microscopic(wet prep) evaluation. The diagnosis is made by directly observing the motile parasite. Thisprocedure detects 60 to 80 percent of cases. Theadvantage of the microscopic examination of thevaginal discharge is that it can be done in the practitioner's ofce; it's fast, easy, and low cost;and an immediate diagnosis can be made. If the trichomonad was not seen, a culture is more sensitive for diagnosis. A culture in Dia-mond's medium is both sensitive and specic. However, there is a diagnostic delay because ofthe time it takes for the culture to detect theorganism. Pap smears are not very sensitive intesting trichomoniasis, only 56 percent effectivein one study, 43and are therefore not a very reli- able method. Newer tests are available now that increase accuracy and ease diagnosis. A DNA-based test KEY CONCEPTS Diagnosis is necessary to determine the cause of the vaginal infection. Be aware of underlying metabolic or immune problems in chronic resistant cases of candida vaginitis. In recurrent cases of candida vaginitis and bac- terial vaginosis, consider the possibility of sexual transmission, even though they are nottypically considered STIs. The sexual partner should be treated in all cases of trichomoniasis. Consider additional testing methods such as cultures and DNA probes in cases that elude diagnosis. Self-diagnosis is usually inaccurate and can inhibit successful treatment. PREVENTION Use condoms to prevent all types of vaginitis and maintain a normal vaginal pH. Eat a whole foods diet with very little to no sugar and few rened carbohydrates. Determine possible infection with other organ- isms for recurrent cases. Increase intake of acidophilus yogurt and/or take lactobacillus supplements.348WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE called the Afrm VP system uses a probe inserted in the vagina that can detect trichomoniasis, bac-terial vaginosis, and candida species from a singlevaginal swab. diagnostic methodsinclude polymerase chain reaction tests, but mostdoctors' ofces do not yet use these. A new 10-minute antigen test for trichomonas is also avail-able. Women who are found to have an infectionofT. vaginalis should also be tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and, if positive for one or both, should then bescreened for additional sexually transmitted infec-tions, including syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV,herpes type 2 virus, and human papillomavirus. The treatment strategy is to kill the tri- chomonads, reduce inflammation, support thevaginal ecology and immune system, and preventrecurrence. OVERVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS An important aspect of treating vaginal infec- tions is looking at the problem holistically andsystemically rather than just nding drug alterna-tives to kill unwanted organisms. To this end, we try to improve the vaginal immune system,support the systemic immune system, restore the proper balance of normal microflora in thevagina, restore the normal pH of the vagina,decrease the inflammation and irritation of thetissue itself, provide symptomatic relief, and,when necessary, curb the overgrowth of theoffending organism. Although this approach sounds basic and log- ical, it is radically different than the conventionalapproach, which is essentially to kill the over-growth of the causative organism. Although insevere acute cases pharmaceutical antifungalsmay ultimately be necessary, organisms arebecoming resistant to these products due to theiroveruse, and newer, stronger treatments are con-tinually developed to address these resistantstrains. Thus, even when the pharmaceuticalover-the-counter or prescription medications need to be used, the principles and methods ofthe natural treatments can be an important partof ensuring a healthy vaginal ecosystem andimmunity for the future. The health of the ecosystem of the vagina is the most important concept in treating vaginitis.While the vaginal flora and ecosystem is in a variable state throughout a woman's lifetime,largely affected by hormonal influences, nothingis more key to this ecosystem than lactobacillus.The vaginal microflora of healthy asymptomaticwomen consist of a wide variety of anaerobic andaerobic bacteria dominated by lactobacillus. The rst extensive study of the human vaginalmicroflora was published in 1892 by Doder-lein. 44Since then we have learned that a wide variety of microorganisms are present in ahealthy vaginal ecosystem. The range of bacterialtypes is immense, including Staphylococcus species, Gardnerella vaginalis ,Streptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Lactobacillus most com- monly Candida albicans , and more. Yet the predominant organisms are members of theLactobacillus genus. The body's ability to control the vaginal microflora is no easy feat. The normal vaginalmicroflora defend against abnormal vaginal colo-nization. Factors controlling this defense systeminclude the content of the vaginal tissue itself(called the squamous epithelium), the domi-nance of lactobacilli, the subsequent low oracidic pH balance, hydrogen peroxide produc-tion, and hormonal influences (over one's lifetime as well as monthly cyclic changes). Highor low estrogen states such as pregnancy ormenopause; hormonal medications such as con-traceptive devices, including OCs; femininehygiene products; and vaginal sexual activity,including friction, lubricants, and semen can allcreate a challenge for the vaginal ecology tomaintain homeostasis.349VAGINITIS Nutrition I cannot overemphasize how the health of the entire body affects the internal ecosystem of thevagina. The pH of the vagina, the microflora thatlive there, the hormonal cycles, and the immunetissue in the vagina are all influenced by our gen-eral health and dietary habits, and this in turndetermines how susceptible we are to vaginitis. A generally healthy diet\u2014well balanced, rich inwhole foods, and low in fat, sugars, rened foods,and alcohol\u2014is optimal in preventing infections.A diet low and rened carbohydrates isparticularly important in preventing candidavaginitis. Some women who have severe, stub-born cases of chronic candida vaginitis may ben-et from stricter diets that avoid fermentedfoods; however, most of the time these \"anti-candida\" diets are not necessary. Nutritional Supplements Vitamin E. We most often think of using nutritional supplements orally, but in this case Irecommend the use of vitamin E intravaginallyand topically. This use of vitamin E dates back atleast to 1954. 45As demonstrated then as well as in my practice, vitamin E provides a very sooth-ing effect. The tissue becomes less irritated witha decrease in redness, swelling, and congestion.Vitamin E usually relieves burning and itchingwithin one to three days. It can be administeredas either a suppository or from a gelatin capsulethat is inserted into the vagina once or twicedaily for seven or more days. Vitamin E oil orointment can also be applied externally to thevulvar tissue to relieve discomfort there. Vitamin E is especially useful in cases of allergic and irritant-induced vaginitis because it is so soothing. Vitamin E Intravaginal suppository or gelatin capsule once or twice daily for 7 or more days Vitamin C. Vitamin C has long been touted for its benecial effects on the immune system.According to a recent study, administering 250 mg of vitamin C vaginally for six days signicantly improves both subjective and objective parametersof vaginitis, like eradicating bacteria and clue cells,increasing lactobacilli, and lowering pH. 46 Vitamin C Insert 250 mg vitamin C tablet in the vagina for 6 days Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene. Both vita- min A and beta-carotene are necessary for thenormal healthy growth of epithelial tissues thatmake up the vaginal mucosa. Vitamin A andbeta-carotene enhance the immune response inepithelial tissues and thereby help mucous mem-branes resist infection. Vitamin A and beta-carotene can be used orally to enhance theimmune response, and vitamin A can be usedintravaginally to stimulate the local immunetissue of the vaginal mucosa. Vitamin A in a cap-sule can sufce, but vitamin A suppositories areavailable in higher doses than a standard capsule.Vitamin A intravaginally is useful in cases ofinfectious vaginitis as well as allergic and irritant-induced vaginitis. Daily use for up to one week is Nutrition Avoid sugar, rened carbohydrates, fruit juice, and alcohol. Reduce fats. Eat 8 oz of unsweetened acidophilus yogurt daily. Increase garlic in the diet.Vitamin A Intravaginal suppository or gelatin capsule once daily for 7 days; use vitamin E, lactobacillus, or mixed herbal suppository daily for 1 week before repeatingthis dosage.350WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE typical. It can be repeated after one week without suppositories or one week of some alternate likevitamin E, lactobacillus, or a mixed herbal sup-pository to avoid any possible side effects. Botanicals Garlic ( Allium Sativum ).Garlic extracts have been shown to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans by blocking the lipid production. 47, 48 The major growth inhibitory component in garlic extract is allicin, and garlic products thathave the highest amount of allicin are the mostdesirable for treatment. Look specically forproducts with high allicin and the stabilized formof allicin. Garlic is diverse in its uses for vaginitisbecause it is both antibacterial and antifungal. 49, 50 I recommend garlic vaginal suppositories forboth candida (yeast) vaginitis and bacterial vagi-nosis. A clove peeled carefully so as not to nickthe garlic can be inserted into the vagina for 6 to 8 hours. The garlic can be threaded like anecklace so that it can be easily removed like atampon. Garlic or garlic capsules can be insertedintravaginally in the evening, and then lacto-bacillus capsules can be inserted in the morningto inhibit growth of the offending organism andrepopulate the called berberine that acts both as anantibacterial and as an immune enhancer. Thisimmune effect is especially specic in epithelialmucus membrane tissue as is found in the vagina,mouth, and even the stomach. Berberine hasbeen shown to possess antimicrobial activityagainst a wide variety of microorganisms, includ-ing those found in the vagina, such as Candida albicans ,Escherichia coli ,Staphylococcus aureus others. 51Preparations of goldenseal and Oregon grape root have been used both orally inteas, caps, and liquid extracts and intravaginallyin douches and suppositories. Because of theirability to affect both yeast and bacteria, these two herbs would seem a logical choice in cases wheremultiple infectious agents are involved. Goldenseal or Oregon Grape Root Orally (capsules or liquid extracts) or intravaginally in suppositories Tea Tree ( Melaleuca Alternifolia ).Tea tree oil has been studied for trichomoniasis, candidiasis,and other vaginal infections. Most of the evidence supports its use against candida species. 52-54 One study found tea tree effectively inhibited both fluconazole-susceptible and fluconazole-resistantcases of candidiasis in vitro and in animals. 55, 56 Perhaps the most impressive study used an emulsi-ed 40 percent solution of Australian tea tree oilwith 13 percent isopropyl alcohol. In the 96 casesof trichomonal vaginitis, clinical cures were seenwith the application of six treatments applied onceweekly with a solution-saturated tampon left inplace for 24 \"Sample T reatment Plan forTrichomonas Vaginalis \" sidebar later in this chapter for specics). 57Various tea tree oil preparations have demonstrated antimicrobial activity againstStaphylococcus aureus andCandida albicans , thereby showing its usefulness in diverse situations. 58 Tea Tree Oil Emulsied 40 percent solution of Melaleuca alternifolia oil with 13 percent isopropyl alcohol: wash vaginalcanal for 30 seconds once a week for 4 weeks, then use vaginal tampon saturated with solution for 24 hours following each washing. Other Therapeutic Agents Lactobacillus. Several species of lactobacillus populate the vagina. Although we often think ofLactobacillus acidophilus as being the most dominant, other species, such as L. crispatus , L. jensenii ,L. fermentum , and L. gasseri are at least as or more dominant than Lactobacillus acidophilus .351VAGINITIS Several factors explain how and why lacto- bacillus does its remarkable job. Through its production of lactic acid, lactobacilli contributeto the low vaginal pH that is instrumental inmaintaining a healthy vaginal microflora.Because vaginal infections are associated with aloss of lactobacilli, it seems logical and hopefulthat lactobacilli would make for a good treat-ment. 59Lactobacilli thrive at an acidic pH of 3.5 to 4.5, lev els that are found in the healthy, normal vagina throughout the menstrual cycle. Lacto-bacilli have also been shown to interfere with theadherence and colonization of pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria. 60In addition, strains of lacto- bacilli that hydrogenperoxide (H well-recognized antago- nist to bacterial populations. Lacto-bacilli also act directly as antibacterials 61and may function as a local immune stimulant in control-ling microbial levels in the vagina. For these reasons, administering lactobacillus orally and intravaginally is one of the mostimportant aspects of effectively treating and pre-venting yeast and bacterial vaginitis, although thescientic literature has inconsistent results.Women who have hydrogen peroxide-producinglactobacilli in the vagina are less to havebacterial vaginosis or candida Gardnerella vaginalis , the predominant organism in the vagina of women with BV.63In addition, the bac- teria that cause bacterial vaginosis thrive in ahigher pH of 5.0 to 6.0 and cannot readily sur-vive in the lower pH, more acid environmentthat lactobacilli promotes. The concept that lactobacilli might be useful when supplemented in the diet or administeredintravaginally dates back to the 1890s. While sci-entists have vacillated on the value of lactobacilliin prevention or in treatment, patients in needhave not. It has been difcult to conrm the \"ifs,ands, or buts\" in using L. acidophilus in the pre- vention and treatment of infectious vaginitisbecause there are few clinical trials. When you consider the logic, the safety, the affordability,the lack of side effects, the ease, and the researchthat does conrm a benet, continuing to pro-mote the use of L. acidophilus is a compelling one. Lactobacillus therapy is quite popular bothwith alternative practitioners and with womenwho seek simple self-treatment methods. A study was done in 1992 on the daily inges- tion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus aci- dophilus in pregnant women with recurrent candidal vaginitis. The women who ate eightounces daily of the yogurt had a threefolddecrease in infections when compared to thewomen who did not eat the yogurt. 64It is now also popular to ingest Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements in oral form in place of or in addi-tion to eating yogurt or to apply lactobacillidirectly into the vagina. A number of studies have supported the use of lactobacillus in preventing and treating vaginitis.A recently published study on treating BV foundthat both vaginal administration and oral-plus-vaginal administration of lactobacilli were effectiveat reducing the vaginal pH, treating the currentinfection, and preventing recurrence over the sub-sequent three months. 65Another study examined the effectiveness of weekly intravaginal Lacto- bacillus acidophilus versus clotrimazole (antifun- gal) tablets in women, a grouphighly susceptible to recurrent yeast vaginitis, andfound the two treatments to be similarly effectiveat preventing candidiasis. 66After any conventional treatment with antibiotics, vaginal lactobacilluscan be restored by the coadministration of lacto-bacillus and low-dose vaginal estriol. 67This is especially important for preventing VVC afterconventional treatment of BV. A review of lactobacillus treatments for VVC in 2003 68found that vaginally administered or orally ingested lactobacillus is able to colonizethe vaginal ecosystem and that most supplemen-tation needed to continue for two to six months352WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE in order to sustain continued colonization. The author also concluded that controlled trials areencouraging but few, and that these trials hadsmall numbers of women, inadequate controls,lack of blinding, high attrition rates, and werenot consistent in the form of lactobacillus used.In addition, they had conflicting results. Douching used to be a popular method of administering lactobacillus, but research hasshown that douching may contribute to infertil-ity and pelvic infections. A safer and more con-venient method is to administer lactobacilluscapsules or tablets intravaginally. 69 I believe that lactobacillus, alone or in combi- nation with other vaginal or oral therapies, is thekey to establishing normal vaginal microflora andpreventing recurring infections, as well as treat-ing acute candida and bacterial infections of thevagina. A word to the wise, however, is buyerbeware. There is a great deal of variability in lactobacillus products. For yogurt, make sure thelabel lists lactobacillus, and choose a brand with-out sweeteners. Some yogurts and encapsulatedproducts make claims that they contain L. aci- dophilus but, when tested, 70they did not; more- over, they contained contaminants. Whenpurchasing encapsulated products, it may be worth requesting product analysis information toassure quality and choosing human strain lacto-bacillus to enhance adherence to the intestinaland vaginal mucosa. Vaginal Estrogen. One of my most reliable treatments for chronic or chronic recurring yeastvaginitis or bacterial vaginosis is the use of vaginal estrogen. This is best seen in peri- andpostmenopausal women, but it can be used fordifcult cases in younger women as well. Suf-cient estrogen promotes the growth of the lacto-bacillus species that maintain the normal vaginalecology. Using this concept as a treatment waswell illustrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of 32 premenopausal bacterial vaginosis 71that used hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus vaginal tabletsdelivered with 0.03 mg of vaginal estriol (a Euro-pean product called Gynoflor). The study foundthat estrogen enhances the acid production of thelactobacilli and assists in their proliferation, inaddition to helping maintain normal vaginaltissue health. At two weeks, a 75 percent curerate occurred in the treatment group comparedwith a 25 percent cure rate in the placebo group.At four weeks, there was an 88 percent cure rateversus a 22 percent placebo rate. Although this product is not available in the United States, vaginal estriol is available by pre-scription from a compounding pharmacy. Yourpractitioner could either request that the phar-macy formulate an estriol/ Lactobacillus acidophilus suppository or cream, or a vaginal estriol cream(0.03 mg/g; insert one gram daily for two weeks)and L. acidophilus capsule or suppository (one daily for two weeks) could be inserted separately. Boric Acid. The most successful natural treatment for VVC that I've encountered is boricacid suppositories. Laboratory tests and humantrials support its use for both Candida glabrata andalbicans , even in cases of resistance to anti- fungal prescription drugs. 72, 73 Several studiesLactobacillus Prevention Eat 8 oz unsweetened live-culture acidophilus yogurt daily. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus or combination multispecies of probiotics daily. Doses may range from 2 to 10 billion organisms per dayfor as short as 2 weeks and as high as 24 to 48 billion organisms per day for 2 to 6 months to maintain vaginal colonization. Treatment For acute infections: intravaginal tablet, gela- tin capsule, or suppository once or twice dailyfor a few days to 2 weeks.353VAGINITIS conrm its success, ranging from 64 to 98 per- cent effective.74-76In one study, 100 women with chronic resistant yeast infections who had failedextensive and prolonged conventional therapywere treated with 600 mg boric acid vaginal suppositories twice a day for two or four weeks;the regimen was effective in curing 98 percent ofthe women. 77Once daily boric acid suppositories used for four days per month during the mensesfor four consecutive months was also clearly indi-cated as the treatment of choice for preventing recurrence. Clinical effectiveness doesn't really get any better than this. Boric acid works most of thetime, it's inexpensive, and it's easy to use. Theonly downside I have observed is that if the tissuehas been irritated by the infection, the boric acidmay burn during urination. Using vitamin E oil,lanolin, or even Vaseline on the external genitaliaprotects the tissue from the boric acid and avertsany signicant discomfort. In a study that com-pared boric acid with the more conventionally prescribed nystatin, the boric acid cured 92 per-cent after 10 days and 72 percent after 30 days,compared to 64 percent and 50 percent, respec-tively, of nystatin. 78 Boric Acid Acute: 600 mg vaginal suppositories twice a day for 3-7 days Chronic: 600 mg vaginal suppositories twice a day for 2-4 weeks Prevention: 600 mg vaginal suppositories 4 days per month during menses for 4 consecutive months Arden's Powder. A colleague of mine has been using a vaginal douche powder calledArden's Powder for over 20 years. She attributesits antifungal properties to the essential oils ofeucalyptus, thyme, and boric acid powder. Thementhol crystals in the oils provide quick relieffrom itching and burning even before the infec- Sample Treatment Plan for Bacterial Vaginosis Guidelines Provide systemic and local immune enhancement. Restore vaginal flora and normal vaginal pH. Use natural antimicrobials. Relieve symptoms. 2-Week Minimum Regimen See the Resources section for natural products andformulations used in this regimen. Avoid rened foods and simple carbohydrates. Avoid vaginal sexual activity during course of treatment to avoid reinfection and reduce irritation. Insert one herbal suppository (containing myrrh, echinacea, slippery elm, golden sealroot, marshmallow, geranium, and yarrow) into vagina every evening, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Insert a more potent suppository containing a combination of thuja oil, tea tree oil,bitter orange oil, and vitamin A (as palmi- tate) 2 days per week for the same 2 weeks as the herbal suppositories. Follow with vaginal lactobacillus supposi- tory: insert daily for 6 days. Oral lactobacillus: take 1 daily for 2 to 6 months to restore normal vaginal ecology. If there is a recurrence, add boric acid sup- positories; insert 1 daily for 2 weeks. Other Considerations Use boric acid suppositories (600 mg) to acidify the vagina either as a primary treat- ment or after antibiotic regimens. Paint the cervix and vagina with povidone- iodine twice each week. (A speculum exam would be the most desirable method of doing this.)354WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE Sample Treatment Plan for Candida Vaginitis Guidelines Provide systemic and local immune enhance- ment, especially in chronic cases. Restore vaginal flora and maintain normal vaginal pH. Natural antifungal agents will be effective in most cases. Relieve symptoms. Acute Infection Follow these guidelines for a minimum of 1 week: Avoid sugars, rened carbohydrates, and alcohol. Eat 8 oz unsweetened acidophilus yogurt daily. Lactobacillus species capsules: 8 billion or more organisms per day. Boric acid powder capsules: insert morning and evening for 3-7 days in mild cases and up to 14 days for resistant cases. Chronic Infection Avoid sugars, rened carbohydrates, alcohol, and fermented foods. Eat 8 oz unsweetened acidophilus yogurt daily. Lactobacillus species capsules: 8-48 billion organisms per day. Garlic (allicin) capsules: 1-2 capsules 2 to 4 times daily. Boric acid powder capsules: insert morning and evening for 14 days; repeat for an addi- tional 14 days if responding but not com-pletely resolved after the rst 2 weeks. Prophylaxis for Prevention of Recurrence Avoid sugars, rened carbohydrates, alcohol, and fermented foods. Eat 8 oz. unsweetened acidophilus yogurt daily.

Although I have not been a strong proponent of douching, this old-fashionedapproach can most likely be used safely for yeastvaginitis. Arden's Powder Mix 1 tsp Arden's Powder in 1 pint warm water; douche with 2 applications daily for the rst 2 days, then reduce to 1 application daily for 5 more days. Avoid dur- ing menstrual period or during pregnancy. Herbal Combinations. Many different herbs can be prepared in combinations for suppositoryuse or even douching. In vitro research supports the effectiveness of propolis, cayenne, clove, and bergamot oil against a number of Candida species. 79Other in vitro evidence showed berg- amot oil alone and in combination with boricacid to be effective against Candida species, sug- gesting a potential role for topical treatment ofcandida infections. 80 Powdered herbal mixes of myrrh, echinacea, usnea, goldenseal, marshmallow, geranium,yarrow, and calendula are often used by herbalists and naturopathic physicians. Each herb has itsown special feature, whether antimicrobial,355VAGINITIS immune enhancing, soothing to the membranes, or antifungal. These suppositories can be made athome with powdered herbs and cocoa butter orcan be purchased from a natural food store oralternative health-care practitioner. Gentian Violet. Most herbal suppositories, including boric acid and tea tree oil, should beavoided during pregnancy. However, gentian violet is effective for the mother-to-be and safefor the fetus. In the 1950s, this was the mostcommonly used and favorite treatment of gyne-cologists. It can be painted onto the cervix andthe vaginal wall, but leaves a disconcerting, sig-nature blue stain; moreover, it requires a specu-lum insertion to apply. A gentian violet gel madeup according to the following formula is moredesirable and appropriate for home use: 0.2 base.This preparation was proven effective in a 1950study. 81Of 191 cases studied, 78 percent were considered cured, 12 percent were signicantlyimproved, 3 percent had modest improvement, and 7 percent showed no improvement. Gentian violet is available only by prescrip- tion in certain states. You may be able to nd amilder strength available without a prescription.Put a few drops of the over-the-counter concen-tration onto a tampon if you want to try using iton your own. Gentian Violet See a licensed health-care practitioner for a prescrip- tion. Use 1 vaginal applicator daily at bedtime for 12 days. Iodine. Yeast and trichomonal vaginitis infec- tions can often occur simultaneously. Moreover,after treatment for trichomoniasis, a yeast infectionmay flare up. Local therapy that can treat bothwould obviously be desirable. Iodine in the form ofpovidone-iodine preparations is a logical solution.This is another example of an older successful treat-ment that got left behind in the face of more Sample Treatment Plan for Trichomonas Vaginalis Guidelines Provide systemic and local immune enhancement.

Tea 40% 40% M. alternifolia oil and 13% isopropyl alcohol. Repeat the following treatment once per week for up to 6 weeks: Thoroughly wash the vulva and vagina with pHisoHex followed by a thor- ough water rinse. Dry the area and swab thevulva and vagina with a 1% solution of the basic medication (i.e., 0.4% M. alternifolia oil), using approximately 15 cc. Then insert a tampon that has been saturated with the solution and keep it in place for 24 hours. Douche daily for up to 7 weeks with a solu- tion of 1% of the basic M. alternifolia oil solution in 1 quart of water (0.4% oil). Eat 8 oz unsweetened acidophilus yogurt daily for 1 month. Lactobacillus species capsules: 8 to 48 bil- lion organisms per day. Garlic (allicin) capsules: 1-2 capsules 2 to 4 times daily. Consider goldenseal, echinacea, garlic, licorice, and myrrh for systemic botanical immune support.356WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE modern, mass-market pharmaceuticals. In addition to candidiasis and trichomoniasis, povidone-iodinehas been proven effective against potentially patho-genic microorganisms like Gardnerella ,Bacteroides, andEnterobacteria without adversely affecting the lactobacillus population. 82, 83 One study combined a povidone-iodine solu- tion for swabbing, a povidone-iodine vaginal gelfor application at night, and a povidone-iodinedouche for use in the morning in 93 courses of treatment in 87 patients with yeast or tri-chomonal vaginitis, or a combination of both. Inthe yeast vaginitis cases, symptoms were clearedin one to three weeks in all 74 courses of treat-ment. In four of ve patients with trichomonalvaginitis, symptoms were cleared within threeweeks. In 14 courses for combined infections,symptoms were cleared within three weeks in 13patients. 84Another study found that nearly 75 percent of cases (trichomoniasis, candidiasis, andnonspecic vaginitis) had complete resolutionwith povidone-iodine treatment. 85 See licensed health-care practitioner for 6-day regimen using povidone-iodine preparations. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPROACH The accurate diagnosis of vaginitis is critical. Incorrect self-diagnosis or guesswork by the prac-titioner can lead to unnecessary and ineffectivetreatment, thus prolonging the symptoms. Bacterial Vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis is more common than can- didiasis and is frequently overlooked or misdiag-nosed. The initial evaluation suggests candidiasis;the candidiasis is treated and the bacterial vagi-nosis is overlooked, left untreated, and continuesto provide a hospitable environment for candida(yeast). Again, an accurate diagnosis is impor-tant, and risk factors for BV should be discussed.The mainstay of therapy is metronidazole, either orally or in a vaginal gel. Other treatmentregimens involve clindamycin, either orally or ina vaginal cream. Tinidazole, FDA-approved forthe treatment of trichomoniasis, has also beenused for treatment of BV in patients who havefailure of clindamycin and have nausea and vom-iting problems with metronidazole. This shouldnot be used in people who are allergic to metron-idazole because they are members of the sameclass of drugs. Alcohol intake should be avoidedwhile using metronidazole due to a drug interac-tion causing violent vomiting. Recurrent BV is common and is often associ- ated with high levels of stress. Recommendedprevention regimens include metronidazole(0.75 mg gel, or one full applicator) one to twotimes per week for six months or metronidazolegel for 10 days on the initial treatment. There isno need to treat the sexual partner. Candida Vaginitis Uncomplicated, acute candidal infections can be treated with one of a variety of products. Cur-rently, there are over 100 prescription and over-the-counter preparations that are marketed to Treatment of Acute Bacterial Vaginosis Recommended Oral Medications Oral metronidazole: 500 mg twice daily for 7 days Oral metronidazole: 250 mg 3 times daily for 7 daysClindamycin: 300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days Recommended Vaginal Medications Metronidazole gel (0.75%): 5 g vaginally once daily at bedtime for 5 days Clindamycin cream (2%): 1 full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at for 7 days Sustained-release clindamycin (2%): (100 g): intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days357VAGINITIS deal with this problem. Despite the latest \"third- generation\" anticandidal preparations, womencontinue to be plagued by the occurrence andrecurrence of candidal vulvovaginal infections.While this is sometimes because of undiagnosedand untreated bacterial vaginosis, chronic yeastinfections do occur. The 2006 CDC recommen-dations for treatment of candidiasis are listed inTable 20.1. Topical azoles are more effective than nystatin and provide for symptom relief and completetreatment in 80 to 90 percent of patients whofollow recommended treatment guidelines.Creams and suppositories are oil-based and canweaken latex condoms and diaphragms, however,so it is important to be warned of this possibility.For recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, extendthe initial topical or oral therapy. The rst treat-ment of recurrence would involve a longer 7- to14-day topical therapy regimen or a dose of flu-conazole orally every three days for a total ofthree doses. If this does not work, then consideroral fluconazole once weekly for six months. If this treatment is not feasible, one can also usetopical clotrimazole (200 mg twice a week) oronce-weekly clotrimazole (500 mg) vaginal sup-positories for six months. Emergence of azole-resistant candidiasis is increasing. For non-albicans candidiasis, the recur-rence treatment recommendation is 600 mg ofboric acid in a gelatin capsule vaginally once dailyfor two weeks following the original oral or vaginaltreatment. Sometimes adding oral Lactobacillus aci- dophilus , especially for women who are using oral contraceptives, daily or every other day helps toreduce recurrences. This is discussed in more detailin the alternative medicine section of this chapter.Instruction in proper hygiene (in terms of alwayswiping from front to back) is also helpful. There isno need to treat the sexual partner. Trichomoniasis The treatment of trichomoniasis has not changed very much over time; it calls for treating the patient Table 20.1 CDC Guidelines for Intravaginal Treatment of Yeast Vaginitis Intravaginal Drug Regimen Butoconazole 2% cream 5 g single intravaginal application Clotrimazole 1% (OTC) 5 g intravaginally for 7-14 days Clotrimazole 100-mg vaginal tablet 2 per day for 3 days Miconazole 2% cream (OTC) 5 g intravaginally for 7 daysMiconazole 100-mg vaginal suppository (OTC) 1 per day for 7 days Miconazole 200-mg vaginal suppository (OTC) 1 per day for 3 days Miconazole 1200-mg vaginal suppository (OTC) 1 in a single doseNystatin 100,000-unit vaginal tablet 1 per day for 14 days Tioconazole 6.5% ointment (OTC) 5 g intravaginally in a single application Terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally for 7 daysTerconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally for 3 days Terconazole 80-mg vaginal suppository 1 per day for 3 days Oral Drug Regimen Fluconazole 150-mg oral tablet 1 in a single dose358WOMEN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE and her partner with oral metronidazole. Recom- mended medications are metronidazole 2 g dose; the new Tindamax (tinidazole) 2 gorally in a single dose; or metronidazole 500 mgorally twice daily for seven days. For pregnantwomen, metronidazole is the safe treatment ofchoice with 2 g metronidazole in a single oral doseduring pregnancy. Nursing women should with-hold breast-feeding for 12 to 24 hours after thedose of metronidazole. If you are taking Tindamax,practitioners recommend that you interrupt breast-feeding for three days after the dose. SEEING A LICENSED PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE PRACTITIONER(N.D., M.D., D.O., N.P., P.A.) The most appropriate way to assure an accurate diagnosis is to see a licensed health-care practi-tioner (naturopathic doctor; medical doctor;osteopathic doctor; nurse-practitioner, or physi-cian's assistant) who is familiar with the clinical picture of various forms of vaginitis, can performa physical exam, knows what to test for, and cancollect those samples during your exam. Accuratediagnosis is the most important key to efcientand appropriate treatment, whether the therapiesare natural or pharmaceutical. If you know whatkind of infection you currently have and chooseself-treatment, it is essential to recognize when andif self-treatment isn't working and to seek profes-sional care at that time. It is most important toseek professional care when infections recur morethan three times per year, if you have a chronicinfection that doesn't fully resolve, or when youare pregnant. Specic testing can be done, but,more important, a licensed practitioner can helpdetermine if underlying disorders are contributingto the vaginal infection. All the alternative thera-pies discussed in this chapter are generally safe forhome use, except for pregnant women.359APPENDIX There is strong and rapidly accumulating evidence that muscular exertion reduces cancer risk. The following recommendations arebased on a review of recent scientic literature onphysical exercise and cancer risk reduction: 1. To prevent injuries, begin each exercise ses- sion with Joint Warming Exercises and endeach exercise session with Basic Stretches(see the following pages). 2. Exercise six days a week. Walk or do moder- ate hiking on your day off. 3. Alternate aerobic (cardiovascular) with strength (weight lifting) exercises. 4. Take one day off each week: Forget about your work, your bills, your problems. Seek peace in the woods ormountains. Refresh your being with pure air, pure water, simple food, and communion withnature. Hike moderately, read a good book, lie down and look at the sky or the birds, ortake a nap. This is your day of recreation. Let nothing interfere with it. 5. Calculate your training heart rate (THR) for aerobic exercise. THR is dened as the rangeof heart rates that is safe for your heart andwill strengthen it. To do this, rst calculateyour maximum heart rate (MHR): MHR /H11005220/H11002your age (in years) Next calculate your training heart rate(THR) as a percentage of MHR. If you arejust beginning, multiply MHR by 60 per-cent and 70 percent to get the bottom andtop of the range: Bottom THR /H11005MHR/H11003.60 Top THR /H11005MHR/H11003.70 Top THR /H11005MHR/H11003.85 Divide the results by 6 to calculate THR per10 seconds. As an example, let us calculate THR for a 50-year-old woman who is beginning to exercise. MHR /H11005220/H1100250/H11005170 beats per minute Bottom THR /H11005170/H11003.60/H11005102 beats per minuteTop THR /H11005170/H11003.70/H11005119 beats seconds: 102/H110046/H1100517 119/H110046/H1100520 THR range /H1100517-20 beats per 10 seconds For this example, the recommendation would be, after three minutes of aerobicexercise, check your pulse for 10 seconds. Ifit is less than 17, increase your pace. If morethan 20, reduce your pace. Repeat this pro-cedure every three minutes or so throughoutyour exercise session.AGENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM Copyright \u00a9 200 8 by Tori Hudson . Click here for te rms of use. 360APPENDIX A JOINT WARMING EXERCISES The following exercises are designed to protect the joints against injury from weight-bearingexercise. These exercises should be performedbefore any cardiovascular or strength workout. 1.Neck Rotate neck gently to left 5 times, then toright 5 times. 2.Shoulders Rotate shoulders forward 10 times, thenbackward 10 times. 3.Elbows, Wrists, and Fingers Begin with arms bent, elbows against thesides of body, hands forming a st againstshoulders. Then extend arms fully, directlyin front of you, while opening hands andextending ngers. Return to initial position.Repeat 10 times. Repeat motion, but this time raise your hands above your head. Don't forget to openyour hands and your extend ngers as youextend your arms above your head. Repeat10 times. 4.Trunk and Waist Bend your trunk at the waist from right toleft and from left to right. Avoid stiffeningyour muscles or applying force as you dothis exercise. Perform the exercise as a gentlerocking movement from side to side. Alter-nate right to left for 20 counts. 5.Hips \"Hula-hoop\" exercise. Perform full circleswith your hips rotating clockwise 10 times.Repeat rotating counterclockwise 10 times. 6.Hips and Knees Bring right knee close to chest by using bothhands around knee and gently pulling withyour arms. Count to 20. Repeat with leftknee. 7.Knees Standing on left leg, gently bend and extendthe right leg 20 times. Repeat exercise withthe left leg, 20 times while standing on right leg. 8.Ankles Standing on left foot, rotate right ankleinward 10 times and then outward 10 times.Repeat exercise with left ankle while stand-ing on right foot. BASIC STRETCHES Here are some general guidelines for stretching: Stretch at the end of the exercise session, when muscles are warm. Hold stretch steadily\u2014do not bounce. Accept a bit of discomfort but avoid pain\u2014 do not push. 1.Calves, Hamstrings, Back, Neck Stand, feet apart about shoulder width, toes pointing forward, knees straight. Let head and trunk fall forward and down. Let arms hang down. Allow gravityto push down your trunk so that your n-gertips will get closer and closer to yourtoes, without forcing. Relax in this position for 30 seconds (over several weeks, increase gradually to 60 seconds). 2.Inner Thigh, Low Back Standing, separate feet as much as possi- ble, knees straight. Bend trunk forward at the hips, let arms and head hang down comfortably. Relax in this position for 20 seconds. 3.Inner Thigh, Right Side of the Body, Left Hamstrings Same position as in stretch 2. Rotate trunk over left leg and let your trunk andarms hang along the left leg with handstrying to reach the left foot. Relax in this position for 20 seconds. Repeat with trunk and arms hanging along the right leg. Relax in this position for 20 seconds.361GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM 4.Tibialis, Quadriceps, Abdominals, Chest, Front of Neck Kneel on hands and knees, with thighs and arms perpendicular to the floor. Keeping hands and knees in place and arms extended, move trunk forward untilyour abdomen touches the floor. Thenraise your head up and back so that youcan see the ceiling. Hold this position for about 20 seconds. Keeping hands and knees in place and arms extended, move trunk backwarduntil your buttocks touch your heels. Lethead down, forehead against the floor. Relax in this position for 20 seconds. PREVENTING EXERCISE INJURIES Prevention of exercise injuries revolves around several guidelines: 1. Stretching. Stretching exercises should be engaged in afterevery exercise session, especially concentrating on the muscle groups that havebeen utilized during the exercise session. For walk-ers and runners, this means concentrating on pos-terior leg muscles, the lower back, and the front ofthe chest. For cyclers, this means the quadriceps,posterior leg muscles, and upper back. For swim-mers, the shoulder joints especially should bestretched as well as the lower back and calves. 2. Strengthening. Often muscle imbalances can create injury problems. For knee problems in run-ners, for example, often the hamstrings are toostrong and the quadriceps are too weak, so pro-gressive resistance exercises for the knee (exten-sion) can be performed, both for prevention andtreatment. If the shin area is giving problems ormight potentially be a future problem, the ante-rior leg muscles can be strengthened through toe-raising resistive exercises (with stretching of thecalf muscle, which is often too strong). 3. Warming up and down. Slow aerobic exer- cises should always precede and follow hard aer-obic exertion. Five- to ten-minute transition periods between rest and exercise and then restare important to help the metabolic, circulatory,and neuromuscular systems adapt withoutinjury or trauma. A recommended warm-up isJoint Warming Exercises (see instructions). 4. Proper equipment. Safety equipment and quality footwear are important for all sports.For the runner this may mean reflective tapeand $50 to $100 shoes; for helmet; for the racquetball player,goggles, etc. 5. Gradual progression. The number-one cause of musculoskeletal problems is overuse\u2014too much, too fast, too soon. A conservativebeginning, with gradual progression, is the mostimportant injury-prevention practice and isreadily available. Many beginner exercisers areoverzealous initially and soon acquire injuriesthat thwart future exercise. 6. Moderation. Avoid too much of any one activity. Engaging in several different activitiescan help prevent overspecialization and resultingmuscle imbalances and overcompulsion. 7. Responsibility of the individual. The indi- vidual's responsibility is to stay within the toler-ance of her or his own musculoskeletal system.Individual judgment and common sense shouldbe utilized to \"listen\" to one's body, makingadjustments when necessary. This can meanavoiding that extra three miles of running orthat extra set of squats, being regular in train-ing, obtaining adequate rest and optimal nutri-tion, and seeking a balanced approach. 8. Be willing to rest. An important equation in exercise is \"Exercise plus rest equals tness.\"In other words, it takes both exercise and ade-quate rest to build tness. Either alone will notdo it. Often beginner exercisers will sacricesleep time to get up and exercise. Chronicfatigue may result, and the whole purpose ofexercise\u2014to feel better\u2014is negated. It's impor-tant to get both rest and exercise.362APPENDIX A 9. Exercise technique. Various aerobic activi- ties require special techniques to avoid injury.Flexibility exercises demand stretching belowthe pain threshold. Regarding aerobic activitiessuch as running or jogging, it is important tokeep the body in an upright posture and thearms at a 90-degree angle, swinging from theshoulder. The feet should land almost flat-footed with the weight well back toward theheel. Only sprinters should run on their toes.Breathing should be through the mouth andnose in a regular fashion. Overall, the bodyshould be loose, natural, and poised. Each sport should be studied to ensure adequate technique. ABBREVIATED GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM Aerobic Exercise Beginner Allow at least 6 weeks for conditioning of your heart: exercise very moderately. Exercise at a training heart rate (THR) that is 60-70 percent of your maximum heartrate (MHR). Walk for 15 minutes. Increase time of exer- cise gradually to 30 minutes over the 6-weekperiod. More Advanced For 10 weeks, increase THR to 65-75 per- cent of MHR. Walk for 30-45 minutes. Advanced Increase THR to 70-85 percent of MRH. Walk for 45-60 minutes. Introduce variations in program. For exam- ple, do interval training: walk fast for 5 min-utes and then jog for 30 seconds. Repeatcombination three times during workout.Strength Exercise Beginner Follow program of exercise planned for you by an exercise specialist. Allow at least 8 weeks for conditioning of your muscles and joints: exercise very mod-erately and increase weight gradually everyweek as you get stronger. More Advanced For 6 weeks, do 10 reps, 2 sets. Keep increasing weight every week, gradually. Advanced Divide workout into upper body exercises on alternate days. Do 10 reps, 3 sets of each exercise. Preventing Injury from Strength Training Work with an exercise specialist who can show you the safe way to use weights. Do not compete with anyone but yourself. Begin with very light weight, so that you can perform 12-15 repetitions of the exer-cise easily. Increase weight very gradually. Avoid holding your breath while lifting. Breathe in during relaxing part of exerciseand breathe out during effort part of exercise. Rest and take a mouthful of pure water between exercises. Warm up for 3-5 minutes before weight lift- ing exercises and stretch the muscles usedduring the exercise session after the workout. SPEAK PREGNANCY EXERCISES These exercises for pregnant women are adapted from Health magazine (December 1993: 28-30). 1. Cobbler's Pose. This exercise helps the pelvic organs by promoting circulation of blood in this363GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM area. It also helps to assure the correct position of the pelvis. This exercise can be done as often asyou like and can be used in general as a sittingposition. When sitting in this position, youshould be able to feel a stretch on the inside ofyour thighs, vagina, and hip joints. You may alsofeel stretching in your knees and ankles. Sit on the floor with your back straight and legs stretched out in front. You can sitagainst a wall to support the lower back. Bend your knees and let your knees relax away from each other to each side, bringingthe bottom of your feet together. The solesof your feet should now be touching withthe outside ankle region resting on the floor. Pull your pressed-together feet as close to the opening of your vagina as possible.Open out your thighs and let your kneeslower toward the floor. Breathe deeply. 2. Kneeling with Knees Apart. This position helps to alleviate low back pain and decreasetension in the pelvis and pelvic joints. Thepelvic joints open and the muscles are able torelax and lengthen in the low back and pelvis.Stretch only as far as you can without bendingyour back, and then hold this position whilebreathing deeply. You should be able to feel thestretch in the vaginal region and in the kneesand ankles. Kneel on the floor with knees as wide apart as possible, the top of your feet on the floor, andyour toes pointing in toward each other. T ryto sit between your feet with your buttockson the floor or sit on top of your heels. Move slowly forward from the hips, keeping your buttocks down as much as possible andthen lean forward and place your palms onthe floor in front of you with both armsstraight. T ry resting on your arms, keepingyour back straight. You should feel a stretchin the vagina. T ry a gently rocking movement, shifting your weight from your arms to your legs. Breathe deeply while trying to stay in this position for a minute or longer, and thencome up and resume a normal sitting position. 3. Pelvic Floor Exercises. This exercise will help your pelvic floor muscles relax if you do itoften enough. This will prove to be helpful inthe second stage of labor, and it may prevent atear when giving birth. This exercise should bedone daily, especially in the third trimester. Stand with your feet about two feet apart. Squat down and end up squatting on theballs of your feet. Lean forward onto yourhands, keeping your arms and back straight,and open your knees wide apart, pointingthem to the outside. Tighten your pelvic floor muscles, pulling them in as if you are trying to stop yourselffrom urinating. Hold for several seconds, andthen slowly let go. Repeat three to ve times. Repeat the exercise again, but this time let go in four stages, a little at a time. Repeat the exercise again, and this time pic- ture your baby's head passing through yourpelvis during the second stage of labor. Eachtime you breathe out, imagine that yourbaby is continuing to pass through yourvagina as you release your pelvic muscles. 4. Pelvic Tuck-In. One of the health problems during pregnancy can be strain on the lowerback due to the extra weight. This exercisestrengthens the buttocks muscles, increases sup-port to the lower back, and stabilizes the pelvis,which can help prevent back pain. A gentlerocking movement added to the exercise can begood practice for labor and lessen pain and easethe passage of the baby through the birth canal. Position yourself on the floor on your hands and knees. Your knees should be about onefoot apart.364APPENDIX A Pull in and tighten your buttocks, pulling your pelvis so that your back arches like acat's back when it's afraid or angry. Hold thisfor 10 to 15 seconds, and then let go. Repeat this at least six times, and then do the exercise a little bit faster, rocking yourpelvis gently up and down along with yourback motion.More Advanced Strength Training: Weeks 9-16 To continue with strength training, it is probably best to join a health club, tness club, gymnasium, or a similar organization. Divide your workouts into body parts and do two sets per exercise. Begin each workout by warming upfor 5 to 10 minutes and end each workout with 5 to10 minutes of Basic Stretches. Exercise Day Part (2 sets each) Reps Day 1 Chest Bench press 8-10 Biceps Arm curl 8-10 Abdominals Easy crunches 8-10 Day Pull-down to 8-10 Triceps Arm extension 8-10 Abdominals Easy crunches 8-10 Day 3 Legs Squat or leg press 8-10 Calves Heel raise 8-10 Shoulders Press behind neck 8-10 Weight Lifting Guidelines 1. Work out on alternate days. 2. Take a mouthful of water between sets.3. For each repetition, breathe out during the effort phase of the repetition, breathe in during the relaxation phase. 4. If, after a workout, the exercised muscles are sore for more than 48 hours, reduce the weightand/or the number of repetitions. 5. Most injuries from exercise result from doing \"too much, too fast, too soon.\" 6. Warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before the work- out. Joint mobility exercises are excellent forthis purpose. 7. From week to week increase weight slightly so that you can continue to perform the samenumber of repetitions per exercise as in the pre-vious week. 8. After 16 weeks of this conditioning program, you may Increase the number of sets per exercise Modify your routine to include other exercisesConcentrate on body areas that need extra workSample Conditioning Exercise Program: 8 Weeks Aerobic (Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday) Joint Warming Exercises (see instructions). Walk briskly for 15 minutes. Gradually increase to 30, 45, or 60 minutes over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. (Other possibilities: Jog, run, swim, cycle, row, play a sport such as tennis, skate,ski, or water exercise.) Basic Stretches (see instructions). Friction entire body, from feet up (30 sec- onds), with dry washcloth. Shower. Strength (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) Joint Warming Exercises (see instructions). Walk briskly for 15 minutes.
