The concept of, \"the whole equals the sum of its parts\" is one that we live by and is practiced across the board by all of our practitioners. The idea that fuels our holistic approach is that any symptom, ailment, or stress we perceive is directly related to our entire functioning body, not just problem \"areas\". When treating any ailment, we not only focus on the illness but the root of that illness to achieve optimal health. Many factors can trigger an imbalance in the body. Some of these can be environmental, lifestyle choices, or physiological and psychological factors among many others. Since there are endless ways of obtaining imbalances in the body, we believe the treatment of every patient should be unique and tailored to that individual. Eastern Acupuncture And Wellness specialize in Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Nutrition, Homeopathy, Medical Massage, Stretch Therapy, and Chiropractic to treat a wide array of physical and emotional challenges. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is a healing art that originated in China. It is a modality used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. CHINESE MEDICINE More people have been treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine than any other medical practice in the world. Traditional Chinese medicine employs many different protocols and techniques. CUPPING Cupping uses glass \"fire\" or plastic cups to create a localized suction vacuum effect that helps to alleviate pain and increase circulation to the tissues, releasing toxins, inflammation, relieving injury and imbalance. GUA SHA Gua sha translates directly from the Chinese language as, \"to scrape away fever.\" Traditional Chinese Medicine has long believed illnesses, such as colds, get trapped on the exterior of our bodies. PEDIATRIC SERVICES Our pediatric consultations are designed to meet the unique needs of each child. Traditional Chinese Medicine for children is a gentle and effective way to boost immunity, improve energy levels and address many common childhood conditions without the need for harsh medication. HERBAL MEDICINE There are approximately 1800 herbs that have proven to be effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with disease and imbalance. FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE Functional Medicine is an integrative, science-based approach using Advanced Laboratory Testing to analyze the genetic predispositions that influence your health. HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating the individual with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet form, with the aim of triggering the body's natural system of healing. INJECTION THERAPY Here at Eastern Acupuncture and Wellness we use injection therapy for the treatment of many conditions such as pain, fatigue and much more. STRETCH THERAPY Stretch Therapy is a system designed to help lengthen tight muscles by activating the \"stretch reflex\" while your body is in perfect alignment. MEDICAL MASSAGE Medical massage involves working on the body with a combination of Deep Tissue, Shiatsu, Sports Massage and Neuro Muscular techniques to provide pain relief. CHIROPRACTIC CARE Chiropractic therapy is a safe and effective form of treatment for many different conditions.
