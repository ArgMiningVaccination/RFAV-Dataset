WAYNE HUIZENGA COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP The Huizenga Coll ege of Business in Fort Lauderdale, Florida is the only business school in Florida with entrepreneurship in its name. That says a lot about who we are, a school committed to delivering an up -to-date curriculum that fosters the spirit of innovative thinking in the workplace. Here, students learn to face the critical issues of today and tomorrow, head on. Over thirty years ago, when few other institutions considered customer's needs, the Huizenga College accommodated working professionals by creating weekend programs. Today, that tradition continues. The Huizenga College serves over 2, 000 bachelor's and master's students in a variety of degree programs tailored to meet the demands of today's workforce. The Huizenga College also offers a number of enriching se minars and workshops through the Hudson Center of Entrepreneurship and Executive Education.

Courses are continually refined to the most current and relevant practices. Students at the Huizenga College encounter some of the most exciting, enriching coursework available anywhere in education today; courses designed to challenge critical thinking skills, to widen perspectives on traditi onal business practices, and to foster an entrepreneurial spirit.

We are still absorbing the impact of a pandemic. However, there is hope that our lives will return to \"normal\" as vaccines are distributed. The vaccine distribution process was unsteady, which is to be expected given the enormity of the effort and perhaps, to remind us of how important planning is to every endeavor big and small. To be sure, there has bee n a great deal of learning that has occurred resulting from the pandemic. We see that our lives, medicine, and business can be conducted with less \"in -office\" time and more telecommuting. Perhaps there will be less traffic going ahead, which means reductio ns in greenhouse emissions. Combining the need for planning and learning from the pandemic, we have sought the input of all stakeholders in the college, from students to alumni to faculty and the NSU community. We have created a vision that \"Graduates of HCBE will innovate, influence, and transform organizations that are 'best for our world'.\" The vision speaks to the role of the Huizenga College of Business and Entrepreneurship in our community (on campus and beyond) so that among other things our gradua tes will be the ones to either help lead to prevent pandemics or will lead us out of them. The vision leads to a new mission, \"We prepare business and entrepreneurial leaders to embody values -based decision making as they adapt, innovate, influence, and tr ansform organizations to tackle tomorrow's challenges and opportunities,\" and a new strategic plan. Among the important paths forward as we live our new vision is to transform existing courses to be \"best for our world\" and create new programs. For examp le, we will teach micro and macro -economic courses within contexts that speak to our values such as \"the economics of poverty,\" \"economics of inequality,\" and/or the \"economics of healthcare.\" We have developed a new BSBA major in the Business of Health th at equips graduates with the skills to pursue important careers in healthcare or seek admission to medical school. Our dedicated faculty will continue to enhance existing curricula and innovate with new offerings guided by the vision of HCBE and NSU. I lo ok forward to sharing additional news with you over the coming months. My best to you and your families as we continue to live our lives in the new normal. Best wishes for a better 2021 and 2022. Please consider reaching out to me to let me know how I ca n help. Sincerely, Andrew Rosman, Ph.D. Dean, H. Wayne Huizenga College of Business & Entrepreneurship 6 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog HCBE MISSION STATEMENT We prepare business and entrepreneurial leaders to embody values -based decision making as they adapt, innovate, influence, a nd transform organizations to tackle tomorrow's challenges and opportunities.

In order for students to receive any Federal Title IV or state financial aid (grants, scho larships, student employment, and loans), they must be enrolled in a minimum number of credits that are required for degree completion (degree -applicable) as published in the catalog for the year they matriculated. Therefore, financial aid funds are only d isbursed to students who meet the minimum enrollment requirements for financial aid eligibility with degree -applicable courses. A student may maintain maximum financial aid eligibility while enrolled in non -degree - applicable courses if the student meets the enrollment requirements for each respective Title IV program with degree -applicable courses. For instance, in order to be eligible for federal loans, a student must be enrolled at least half time. If half -time enrollment is defined as 6 credits per sem ester/term, the student must be enrolled in at least 6 degree -applicable credits to be eligible for federal loans. If a student enrolls in one 3 - credit course that is degree -applicable and one 3 -credit course that is not degree - applicable, the student wi ll not be eligible for federal loans, even though the student is enrolled half time.

Violations of academic and/or supplementary stand ards will be handled through the student's academic college. 17 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog Students should refer to the full Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility in the NSU Student Handbook found on the student affairs webpage (https://www.nova.edu/studentaffairs/past -studenthandbooks.html ). Conduct standards, supplementary standards, and university policies and procedures are handled by the NSU's Office of the Vice President of Student Affai rs or by the individual colleges and schools, as deemed appropriate. Nova Southeastern University has established clear expectations regarding student conduct and academic responsibility. When these standards are violated, significant disciplinary action can be expected, including expulsion from the university. Students are expected to abide by all university, college, school, and program rules and regulations as well as all federal, state, and local laws. Students are also expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of their chosen fields of study. The university is an academic community and expects its students to manifest a commitment to academic integrity through rigid observance of standards for academic honesty. Facult y members are committed to uphold the standards of academic integrity and do their utmost to prevent academic misconduct by being alert to its possibility. If academic misconduct is detected, the faculty member communicates with the student and imposes app ropriate sanctions within the scope of the course. Faculty members are required to report violations of academic integrity to their department chair who must then report it to the Office of the Assistant Dean. If the department chair is the instructor for the course, then the chair must report it to the Office of the Assistant Dean. The academic leadership may impose institutional sanctions in addition to any imposed by the instructor within the classroom (hereafter referred to as within -class sanctions). Deans, assistant deans, or department chairs, at their discretion, may immediately suspend students pending a hearing on charges of violations. Sanctions may include academic misconduct warning, academic misconduct suspension, or a cademic misconduct dismissal, including notation on the student's academic transcript. Students found responsible for violations of academic integrity have the option of appealing the sanctions using the Academic Misconduct grievance procedure (page 20). 18 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog ACADEMIC STANDARDS Excerpt from the NSU Student Handbook (https://www.nova.edu/studentaffairs/past - studenthandbooks.html ) provided here for reference only. At any given point of time, there is only one handbook in effect as posted on the relevant website and it supersedes the details posted herewith. The university is an academic community and expects its students to manifest a commitment to academic integrity through ri gid observance of standards for academic honesty. The university can function properly only when its members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Accordingly, the academic standards are designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty are upheld. The following acts violate the academic honesty standards: Cheating: intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise Fabrication: intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise Facilitating: Academic Dishonesty: intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this code Plagiarism: the adoption or reproduction of ide as, words, or statements of another person as one's own without proper acknowledgment Students are expected to submit tests and assignments that they have completed without aid or assistance from other sources. Using sources to provide information without giving credit to the original source is dishonest. Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Students are expected to comply with the following acade mic standards: Original Work: Assignments such as course preparations, exams, texts, projects, term papers, practicum, or any work submitted for academic credit must be the original work of the student. Original work may include the thoughts and words of another author. Entire thought s or words of another author should be identified using quotation marks. At all times, students are expected to comply with the university and/or program center's recognized form and style manual and accepted citation practice and policy. 19 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog Work is not origi nal when it has been submitted previously by the author or by anyone else for academic credit. Work is not original when it has been copied or partially copied from any other source, including another student, unless such copying is acknowledged by the per son submitting the work for the credit at the time the work is being submitted, or unless copying, sharing, or joint authorship is an express part of the assignment. Exams and tests are original work when no unauthorized aid is given, received, or used before or during the course of the examination, re -examination, and/or remediation. Referencing the Works of another Author: All academic work submitted for credit or as partial fulfillment of course requirements must adhere to each program center's specific accepted reference manuals and rules of documentation. Standards of scholarship require that the writer give proper acknowledgment when the thoughts and words of another author are used. Students must acquire a style manual approved by their center and be come familiar with accepted scholarly and editorial practice in their program. Students' work must comport with the adopted citation manual for their particular center. At Nova Southeastern University, it is plagiarism to represent another person's work, w ords, or ideas as one's own without use of a center -recognized method of citation. Deviating from center standards (see above) is considered plagiarism at Nova Southeastern University. Tendering of Information: All academic work must be the original work of the student. Knowingly giving or allowing one's work to be copied, giving out exam questions or answers, or releasing or selling term papers is prohibited. Prohibited Acts: Students should avoid any impropriety, or the appearance thereof, in taking exa minations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Violations of academic responsibility include, but are not limited to the following: Plagiarism Any form of cheating Conspiracy to commit academic dishonesty Misrepresentation Bribery i n an attempt to gain an academic advantage Forging or altering documents or credentials Knowingly furnishing false information to the institution Students in violation will be subjected to disciplinary action. Additional Matters of Ethical Concern: Where circumstances are such as to place students in positions of power over university personnel, inside or outside the institution, students should avoid any reasonable suspicion that they have used that power for personal benefit or in a capricious or ar bitrary manner. 20 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT REPORTING AND SANCTIONS Faculty members are responsible for assessing classroom conduct including academic misconduct. Faculty members are required to report any incident of misconduct to their department chair, who is then responsible for reporting it to the college's Office of the Assistant Dean. These reports are reviewed for institutional sanction, which is distinct from a class sanction administered by the faculty member. Academic misconduct in the classroom is first dealt with by the instructor for within -class sanction(s). Once the infraction is reported to the faculty's chair and then to the Office of the Dean, further institutional sanctions may be imposed up to and including suspension and/or di smissal. Records of each reported incident are retained in the Office of the Dean. All incidents of misconduct retained on record will be disclosed to outside agencies and graduate/professional programs as required. Each department and program within the college reserves the right to impose a more severe sanction, which may result in immediate suspension or dismissal from that major or program. When differing levels of conduct requirement apply to a situation, the highest standard of conduct will be applie d. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Students charged with academic misconduct will be notified in writing of all impending sanctions including within -class as imposed by the instructor and any further sanctions imposed by the institution. FOR WITHIN -CLASS ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT CHARGE AND/OR SANCTION GRIEVANCES): STEP ONE: MEET WITH THE INSTRUCTOR Students must discuss their grievance with the instructor for the course as soon as feasible but no later than 20 days after the con clusion of the course or receipt of the sanctions notification letter (whichever is later). The student must contact the instructor via email to set up a meeting to discuss the grievance. STEP TWO: MEET WITH THE CHAIR Students who feel that their grievan ce was not satisfactorily resolved after meeting with the instructor may meet with the applicable chair of the department that offers the course (or Assistant Dean if the course instructor is also the department chair). If the student cannot meet the chair because they are the course faculty, he/she must send the following information to the chair/Assistant Dean using their NSU official email account. This information must be received no later than 20 days after the conclusion of Step One above. 21 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog 1. Student Name 2. Student ID number 3. Major/Program 4. Day/Evening Phone Number 5. Course CRN 6. Email Address 7. Instructor Name 8. Problem: Provide an explanation of the problem and include any pertinent documentation as support. 9. Action Requested: Provide an explanation of the requested action. 10. Prior Action Taken or any other pertinent information After receiving the communication from the student, the chair will communicate with the instructor and other parties involved. The instructor will provide a copy of all relevant documents to the chair, as needed. After reviewing the matter, the chair will make a decision and inform the student, the instructor, and the Office of the Dean. If the chair is the instructor for the course, the Assistant Dean will make a de cision and inform the student, the instructor, and the Dean. FOR INSTITUTION -IMPOSED ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT SANCTION GRIEVANCES: REQUEST A HEARING BY THE AIC A student may appeal any institutionally imposed academic misconduct -related sanctions as outlined below. This appeal will only address the sanction(s) and not whether academic misconduct took place, for this is only addressed in the within -class grievance process discussed earlier in this document. All appeals must be initiated within 20 days of the sa nction notification letter or the end of the semester following the occurrence, whichever is later. The student may submit an appeal request in writing to the Office of the Dean for a hearing by the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC) with any new informat ion and/or documentation. Students will receive a formal response either by mail to the address on record and/or to their NSU email account. If the Office of the Dean approves the student's request of hearing by the AIC, it will be convened, comprised of an appointee from the Office of the Dean, a representative from the applicable department, and a faculty member from a different department in the college. The instructor of the course in question may not be part of the AIC. Following review of the studen t's presentations and all the facts and finding pertinent to the matter, the AIC will make a recommendation to the Dean, who will then make a decision. This decision is final and binding and cannot be appealed further. All academic misconduct grievance s must begin at the first level contact. Grievances brought to higher level contacts without previously going through the appropriate 22 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog grievance procedure will be referred to the appropriate step in the process, thus delaying problem resolution. 23 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog DEGREE PROG RAMS MASTER'S PROGRAMS The Huizenga College of Business awards six master's degrees: Master of Accounting With Concentrations in: Accounting Analytics Managerial Accounting Public Accounting Tax One Year M aster of Business Administration Master of Business Administration With Majors in: Business Business Intelligence / Analytics Complex Health Systems Entrepreneurship Finance Human Resource Management International Business Management Marketing Process Improvement Sport Revenue Generation Supply Chain Management and Operational Systems Master of Public Administration Master of Science in Human Resource Management Master of Science in Philanthropy and Non -Profit Management With Concentrations in: No Concentration Religious Organization Management Master of Science in Real Estate Development Certificates in: Accounting Analytics Business Intelligence/Analytics Complex Health Systems Entrepreneurship 24 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog Finance Human Resource Management Marketing Public Accounting Process Improvement Religious Organization Management Supply Chain Management and Operational Systems 25 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog MASTER 'S DIVISION COURSE FORMATS The Huizenga College of Business offers master's degree programs and graduate certificates in person as well as online.

The GPA is calculated based on letter grades and attempted credits. Overall academic standing is indicated by the cumulative GPA (CGPA). GPA calculations include all coursework in the Huizenga College of Business, based on the following formulas and definitions. Quality points = A letter grade's numeric al GPA value MULTIPLIED BY the number of credits assigned to the course GPA hours = Attempted credits, excluding withdrawals, successfully -completed pass/fail courses, and incompletes Current semester or term GPA = The total number of quality points for the semester or term DIVIDED BY the total GPA hours for the semester or term Cumulative GPA (CGPA) = Total quality points DIVIDED BY total GPA hours Note: Students earn grades based on their performance relative to the established criteria and benchmarks for each class. Professors qualified to make that judgment assign student grades. Appropriately, all assignments, projects, cases, exams and/or final cours e grades are matters for faculty and students only. This includes any work for which students earn a grade. Grade appeals follow the Grade Dispute Grievance Procedure in the Student Code of Conduct section of this catalog. 51 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog Students who register for a cour se and do not attend will receive the grade of F on their transcript. It is the student's responsibility to ensure he or she is officially dropped from a course. This is verified by viewing registrations in SharkLink. The University Registrar records and maintains the official student progress records for the university. Official grades are posted at the end of each term. INCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY A student who is unable to complete a course due to exceptional circumstances, such as medical emergency, may request an incomplete. The grade of Incomplete (I) will be granted only in cases of extreme hardship. In such cases, a student requiring an incomp lete must submit a written appeal with full rationale to the course professor prior to the end of the course. The student does not have a right to an incomplete, which may be granted only when there is clear evidence of just cause. A student who is absent at or misses the final examination without prior approval is not eligible to receive an incomplete unless extenuating circumstances exist. In order to qualify for a grade of Incomplete (I), students must have completed over 50% of the graded work in the co urse and must have a passing grade in that work. Should the student meet the incomplete policy criteria and the course professor agree, the professor would prepare an incomplete contract. The incomplete contract must contain a description of the work to b e completed and a completion date. The completion period should be the shortest time possible. In no case may the completion date extend beyond one term (two months). The incomplete contract must be submitted to the academic department offering the course no later than when final grades are due. During the incomplete grade period, the student is required to engage in active communication with the professor to complete the remaining coursework. Earning an Incomplete in a course may affect SAP and cause the loss of financial aid eligibility for the next academic year. The academic department offering the course monitors each incomplete contract. If a change of grade form is not submitted by the scheduled completion date, the grade will be changed automatica lly from I to F. When a student retakes the course, the higher of the earned grade will be calculated into the GPA. However, all grades will remain part of the student's academic transcript. The department chair reserves the right to disallow an incomplet e grade contract if the student does not qualify based on the above criteria or believes the student is abusing the policy by repeatedly requesting an incomplete grade. 52 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog I Incomplete See incomplete grade policy F Incomplete Failure Given when students fail to satisfy an incomplete contract within the designated time period or when an incomplete contract has not been signed. W Withdrawal See drop and refund policies. CHANGE OF GRADE POLICY A change of grade is only entertained if a clear miscalculation has occurred. If a student believes an error has occurred with the grade calculation, the student should immediately contact the professor. A student has 20 days, from the end of the semester in which the course was ta ken to seek clarification from the professor. Grade changes will not be accepted after that time. The Department Chair retains the final authority to accept or deny grade changes. Please refer to student grievance procedure for any other course related iss ues. REPEATING A COURSE A student who has earned the grade of A in a course may not repeat the same course for credit. If a student repeats a course one or two times, the highest grade of the attempts is calculated in the overall GPA. If a course is repeated three or more times (four or more attempts total), only the two lowest grades will be excluded from the GPA. All grades from attempts of the same course will remain on the transcript as a matter of academic record. However, course credit will only calculate once towards degree completion. Failing grades earned by students convicted of academic misconduct are not excluded from the GPA calculation. A hold can be placed on the student record to prevent future enrollment once all degree requirements h ave been met and if a degree application has not been filed by the student to prohibit enrollment in future semesters providing the student meets criteria for degree conferral. Students seeking to repeat course work once all degree requi rements have been m et will need to supply documentation to the Dean's Office regarding the need to repeat course work to improve the academic GPA. GRADE REPORTS Students may view their grades online through SharkLink, located https://sharklink.nova.edu , typically 7 - 10 days after the end of the term (Master's: for eight -week classes October, December, March, May, and July; for full semester classes December, May, and August). Students may contact their academic advisor if grades are not posted by stated times. Students will not receive grade reports through regular mail. 53 2021 - 2022 Graduate Catalog Students who submit tuition and fees to their employer should use SharkLink to access the course fees and grades.
