Results26 to 31 of 31 Research Studies Displayed Weitlauf AS, Sathe N, McPheeters ML Interventions targeting sensory challenges in autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review. This review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of interventions targeting sensory challenges in ASD. It concluded that some interventions may yield modest short-term (<6 months) improvements in sensory- and ASD symptom severity-related outcomes; the evidence base is small, and the durability of the effects is unclear. Although some therapies may hold promise, substantial needs exist for continuing improvements in methodologic rigor. AHRQ-funded; 290201500003I. Citation: Weitlauf AS, Sathe N, McPheeters .

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions or nutritional supplements in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since the studies reviewed were small and short-term, and there were few fully categorized populations or concomitant interventions, the researchers concluded that there is little evidence to support the use of nutritional supplements or dietary therapies for children with ASD.

This study used structured interviews with nine parents to examine perceptions of electronic health records and related patient portals in the treatment of their children. The authors recommend further research to increase portal registration and integration in patient care. AHRQ-funded; HS022404. Citation: Bush RA, Stahmer AC, Connelly CD .

Education: Patient and Caregiver Bauer NS, Carroll AE, Saha C Computer decision support changes physician practice but not knowledge regarding autism spectrum disorders. This study examined whether adding an autism module promoting adherence to clinical guidelines to an existing computer decision support system (CDSS) changed physician knowledge and self-reported clinical practice. It found that a CDSS module to improve primary care management of ASD in pediatric practice led to significant improvements in physician-reported use of validated screening tools to screen for ASDs.

This study examined the types of social support messages exchanged between parents and/or caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) who communicate via Facebook. It found that the highest percentage of messages offered dealt with informational support (30.7 percent) followed by emotional support (27.8 percent). Network and esteem support messages were responsible for 20.97 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. AHRQ-funded; HS018809. Citation: Mohd Roffeei SH, Abdullah N, Basar SK .

CF, Giauque A Residents' knowledge and comfort with caring for children with autism spectrum disorder. The authors evaluated a cohort of pediatric residents' knowledge of and comfort with caring for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their data suggest that more education is needed to increase resident competence in caring for individuals with ASD. Residents reported very low rates of direct communication with patients with ASD and no residents had used pictures to communicate with these patients. The authors found it concerning that few residents had found resources to help these patients with their communication needs. At the same time, comfort with using pictures to communicate was scored higher than other domains. AHRQ-funded; HS000063. Citation: Broder-Fingert S, Ferrone CF, Giauque A .
