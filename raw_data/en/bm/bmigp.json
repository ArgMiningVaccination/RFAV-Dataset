McKinney School of Law-Indianapolis in the fall. For additional information about the application and admission process, see www.indylaw.indiana.edu. General Requirements All students who have received a baccalaureate degree from an approved college or university will be granted the Doctor of Jurisprudence degree upon completion of the law school's degree requirements. Prior to matricul ation, all entering students should review the Student Handbook, which contains a detaile d description of degree requirements and academic regulations. The Stude nt Handbook is available here: http://indylaw.indiana.edu/students/handbook/ 5Non-Joint Degree Students are required to complete a total of 90 J.D. credit hours for graduation. Joint degree students are required to complete a lesser number of J.D. credits for graduation from the law school because some credits completed in the relevant other program are accepted for credit toward the J.D. HOWEVER, NO CREDIT TOWARD THE J.D. DEGREE MAY BE GIVEN FOR COURSE WORK TAKEN BEFORE MATRICULATION IN THE LAW SCHOOL. Other graduation requirements include the following: 1. A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.3 on a 4.0 scale 2. Completion of all required courses 3. Completion of a substantial research paper 4. Completion of the equivalent of six semesters of full-time resident study or eight semesters of part-time resident study 5. Completion of all degree requirements w ithin 84 months of matriculation Bar Requirements Upon completion of the degree requirements, stude nts will be certified as eligible for the bar examination in the state in which they intend to practice. Applicants should contact the board of bar examiners of the appropriate state fo r specific information regarding any additional requirements. Applicants should be aware that the bar requirements of most states include character and fitness qualifications. Informati on supplied on law school applications is relevant to those qualifications and is consider ed by the law school in its certification of a candidate's eligibility for admission to the ba r. If any doubt exis ts about meeting bar requirements, Curricular Requirements Required Courses Civil Procedure I and II Contracts and Sales I and II Criminal Law Property Torts Constitutional Law Legal Analysis, Research, and Communication I, II, and III Professional Responsibility In addition to the courses listed above, all stude nts must complete an advanced research and writing requirement. Students may satisfy this requirement through a paper written for Supervised Research, a paper written in a course or seminar, or a published note written for one of the school's three law reviews. Th e Student Handbook contains details concerning the advanced research and writing requiremen t. The Handbook is available online at the school's web site. Be sure to look carefully at this requirement under the specific joint degree program for which you are applying as some programs have requirements regarding how the advanced research is obtained. 6The faculty also recommends that J.D. students take the following elective courses, each of which is important to the breadth of knowledge for all lawyers. Recommended Courses Administrative Law Closely Held Business Organizations Criminal Procedure: Investigations Evidence Family Law Income Tax Trusts and Estates Additionally, the faculty recommends that J.D. students take at least one advanced elective course in each of five subject areas--commerc ial law, constitutional law, federal statutory law, property, and torts. Full-time day students are required to register for the full load of 31 credit hours in their first two semesters and must complete all basic-level required courses before registering for advanced courses. Students enrolled in the pa rt-time division and attending evening classes may, in their second year, take upper-level c ourses while completing the required first-year offerings provided any pre-requisites for upper-level courses have been completed. Students admitted to the full-time day divisi on must complete their first-year required courses in the full-time day track. Students adm itted to the part-time evening division must complete their first year courses in the part-tim e evening track. Students interested in a joint- degree should consider this requirement as it f actors into the timing of enrollment in courses at another school. Although there is no required se quencing of advanced-level c ourses, the above-listed elective courses are considered part of the law school core curriculum and should be taken at the earliest opportunity. Similarly, many advanced-level courses carry prerequisites, and students are encouraged to enroll in the prer equisite courses early to enhance scheduling opportunities and flexibility. Limits exist on the number of credits attainable in clinics, law reviews, and other activities. Students should consult the Student Handbook and the Office of Student Affairs for a complete list and explanation of these limits. Each summer the faculty offer select required and elective courses. Students who wish to accelerate their studies may do so by attending summer sessions. Students in the part-time division must attend three summer sessions to complete degree requirements in four calendar years. The school matriculates first-year students in the fall semester only. Students wishing to pursue the part-time program should first work with advisors in both schools. Students in the part time divisi on at the law school must complete their foundational coursework in the evening section. This may conflict with required courses in other schools. Many degrees must be complete d within a certain time frame which cannot be met through the part time program. It is the stude nt's responsibility to work with advisors to ensure they can meet the required goals throu gh the part-time program before they enroll. 7 Please note that the joint degree programs require that the final degrees be conferred only after completion of both programs of study . If you have questions regarding this requirement, please speak with the Office of Student Affairs well in advance of graduation. Questions regarding admission requirements or a pplications can be directed to the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law Admissions Office, Assistant Dean for Admissions Patricia Kinney, at (317) 274-2459.

Candidates must meet the admissions and prerequisite criteria of each school and be separately admitted by each. Candidates may be admitted to the Kelley School of Business in either August or January and to the Robert H. McKinney School of Law in August. The MBA/JD Joint Degree requires four years of full-time study instead of the five years that would be required if the two degrees were to be earned separately. The program requires 39 credit hours at the Kelley School of Business and 80 credit hours at the Robert H. McKinney School of Law for gradua tion.

Summe r school during the first two summers of the joint program is encouraged to help the MBA/ JD student attain increased credit hours and ease potential scheduling conflicts that may arise wh en scheduling course work in two different professional schools. Typically, students spend the first year in full- time study in the Robert H. McKinney School of Law and then begin integrating their course work with the Graduate Kelley School of Business course work in the second year. The degrees are c onferred simultaneously when all requirements for graduation for the joint degree student have been met in each professional program. In Indianapolis, the Kelley Gradua te Kelley School of Business offers MBA course work through the part-time MBA Program. The MBA program is scheduled in modules, which meet 2 evenings per week from 6:00 p.m. - 8:40 p.m. for 15 weeks for the fall and spring semesters and for 10 weeks during the summer session. Additionally, some modules include a required weekend seminar. Both the full-time and part-time divisions of the Robert H. McKinney School of Law are available in Indianapolis. However, part-time students wishing to take evening classes in the Robert H. McKinney School of Law may very well encounter scheduling conflicts with MBA classes scheduled for the evening. The Robert H. McKinney School of Law generally offers course work in the full time day division Monday through Friday from 8:30 am - 5:20 pm and in the part-time evening division Monday through Fr iday from 5:30 pm - 8:35 pm. In addition, a few classes for both full-time and part-time stude nts are scheduled on Saturday from 9:30 am - 12:30 pm in the Robert H. McKinney School of Law.

In the final year of the program , a research paper on a topic in both areas of study is supervised by faculty advisors from both schools. Candidates must meet the admissions and prerequisite criteria of each school and be separately admitted by each. Candidates may be admitted to the MPA Program in either August or January and to the School of Law in August. The MPA/JD Joint Degree requires four years of full-time study instead of the five years that would be required if the two degrees were to be earned separately.

The program is designed for individuals who want to provide advocacy for underserved populations, administrative policy, an d other systems issues. Children's issues, access to health care coverage and treatment, hous ing issues, and issues of poverty are regulated by statutes, regulations, and case law. Training in both social work and law provides professionals with unique knowledge and skills to address these challenges. Lawyers with social work training are well suited to make significant contributions to the practice of social work and the development of social policy. Their legal perspective is enhanced by knowledge of human behavioral theories, systems theories, and community level evaluation and practice. Candidates must meet the admissions and prerequisite criteria of each school and be separately admitted by each.

Inlow Hall, Room 131L 530 W. New York Street Indianapolis, JOINT DEGREE PROGRAM The joint JD/MD program is designed to allow stude nts to obtain dual degrees in six years instead of seven years. It also provides students with the unique opportunity and valuable experience in interdisciplinary work in the areas of public hea lth, health policy, and life sciences. Students are required to gain independent acceptance to the Robert H. McKinney School of Law (\"School of Law\") and Indiana University School of Medicine (\"IUSM\"). A student enrolled in the combined program must complete the 90 credit hours required for the JD degree. At least 84 of these credit hours must be obtained in classes offered by the School of Law. Up to six credit hours toward the J.D. degree may be obtained from appropr iate courses offered by the IUSM. Students will have two options of study. The first option utilizes the more traditional form of study. Students usually spend the first two year s and summers exclusively in IUSM. The third year, third summer, and fourth year are spent exclusively in the School of Law. The fourth summer, fifth year, and fifth summer are devoted to IUSM with final year to credits taken in both schools. Alternatively, students may spend the first two y ears of the program in the School of Law. Students will then spend their first, second and third years completing the IUSM curriculum. During the senior year, students will be required to take a specifically designed set of law, medicine, and health policy electives.
