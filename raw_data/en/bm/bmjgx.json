Introduction 1.1. Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof Herbal substance(s) defines Curcumae longae rhizoma or turmeric rhizome as the whole, cured (by boiling or steaming), dried rhizome of Curcuma longa L. (syn. Curcuma domestica Valeton) with roots and outer surface removed (European pharmacopoeia 8th ed. 2017). Other docum ented synonyms Amomum curcuma Jacq. (Blumenthal 1998, WHO 1999) . Common names for C. longa : turmeric, curcuma. Besides C. longa also C. rotunda is mentioned in some older references. Nowadays C. rotunda is considered to be a former trade name for the product containing the primary rhizomes (bulb or round turmeric) in distinction to the product consisting of the thinner and longer secondary rhizomes (longa - form), both originating from C. domestica L. (List and Horhammer 1973 , Bisset ( H\u00e4ringer 2004) . The monographs of ESCOP and Commission E mention that the herbal substanc e contains not less than 2.5 resp. 3% dicinnamoylmethane derivates, calculated as curcumin, and not less than 2.5 resp. 3 % volatile oil, both calculated on a dry -weight basis of the drug ( ESCOP Monograph 2003, German Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. ( Dietrich), another species of the genus Curcuma , and having similar properties as C. longa, a HMPC monograph was established in 2014. The European Pharmacopoeia describes in the m onograph for Curcumae xanthorrhizae rhizoma a TLC -test for C. and its modifications for identifying C. xanthorrhiza (European pharmacopoeia 6th ed. 2009) . Constituents (see also Fig. 1) Carbohydrates : 69.4% of total mass ( Kapoor 1990 this is a mixture of (diferuloylmethane), monodexmethoxycurcumin and bis - desmethoxycurcumin (ASEAN 1993, Bisset ontent in turmeric ( Ruby et al., 1995) . The phenolic groups in the structure of curcumin explain the ability of curcumin to eliminate oxygen - derived free radicals ( Priyadarsini 1997) . The free radicals which can be eliminated by curcumin are hydroxyl radical (Reddy and Lokesh and and the C. longa rhizome varies from 0.6 to 5% of the dry mass ( Cronin 2003) . turmeric 1993, Bisset 1994, Bruneton 1995 , 1 and Fatty oil (Srimal 1997). Fig. 1: Structures of main components of Rhizoma Curcumae longae (WHO 1999) . Treatment of the herbal substance immediately after harvesting According to some handbooks the plant material is processed before drying ( Blumenthal 1998, ESCOP Monograph 2003, German Commission E Monograph - Bundesanzeiger 1985) . Hager's Handbuch describes that after harvest, the rhizomes are cooked for a short time or heated with hot water ( Frerichs et al. 1949, List and Horhammer 1973 ). The Indian and Ja panese Pharmacopoeias also describe the 'curing', consisting of boiling and (sun) drying of the rhizomes as well as identification by different color reaction tests. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia mentions: collection of rhizomes, washing, boiling or steaming, cutting in thick slices, sun drying and separation from roots (Herbal Medicine) . Max Wichtl's Herbal Drugs mentions that the yellowish brown color of the herbal substance is due to the steaming or scalding treatment after harvesting ( Bisset 1994) . As pharmacological and (pre)clinical studies do not contain any data on the pretreatment of the plant material, and research data on the scalding effect are missing, the impact of the scalding treatment on the active compounds and on the the efficacy of C. lo nga preparations remains unclear. The scalding treatment is considered to be a traditional procedure mainly for food purposes. Herbal preparation(s) The following herbal preparations are mentioned in literature: Powdered C. longa rhizom a (ESCOP Monograph 2003, German Commission E Monograph - Bundesanzeiger 1985, The Indian pharmaceutical codex 1953, WHO 1999) ; Ethanolic (80%) extract ( Commandeur and Vermeulen 1996, Deshpande et al. 1998, Khattak et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2005, Kuroda et al. 2005, Lee 2006, Nishiyama et al. 2005, Rafatullah et al. 1990, Xia et al., 2007) ; Aqueous extract (supernatant of mixture of 50 mg turmeric and 5 ml boiling distilled water ): (Azuine et al. 1992, Soni et al. 1992); Tincture (1:10) (WHO 1999) ; Paste: turmeric powder in petroleum jelly ( Kundu et al. 2005) , or a mix of turmeric powder and neem leaves ( Azadirachta indica ) (Charles and Charles 1992) ; Oil (by distillation of rhizom a with water Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 7/34 (w/w) and auxiliary substances such as zein, corn starch, and dextrin at 20% (w/w) each (Honda et al. 2006) .

China, Japan, Korea, Vi etnam, Nepal Turmeric is used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine. It is official in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China as well as in the Japanese Herbal Medicines Codex and is used in these countries and Korea for a r ange of indications including abdominal fullness, kidney pain, and amenorrhea. In China an aqueous decoction dosage form is ingested orally and applied topically (Herbal Medicine, 2008) . India Turmeric is used extensively in the Indian systems of medicine (Ayurvedha, Unani, and Siddha) and is official (Haridra) in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API, 1989). In Ayurvedic medicine turmeric has a long history of use as an anti -inflammatory drug for arthritis. In both the Ayurvedha a nd Siddha systems of medicine, turmeric paste is used topically t o treat ulcers and scabies. The Swami Prakashananda Ayurveda Research Centre lists as indications for turmeric: urticaria and skin allergy, viral hepatitis, inflammatory conditions of joints, sore throat and wounds (Kapoor 1990) . 2.3. Overall conclusions on medicinal use Both historical data on medicinal use and actual marketing information confirm that C. longa has a longstanding use for the relief of several dyspeptic complaints.

The dry extract ( DER 5.5-6.5:1) was already in cluded in the monograph which was published in 2009. It was decided to maintain this herbal preparation in the revised monograph because the ext raction solvent and the posology is in the range of the other preparations listed in the monograph (e.g. daily intake of corresponding herbal substance is 1.1 -2.3 g, posology of the po wdered or comminuted herbal substance is 1 -3 g daily). The tincture (r atio herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:10) was also maintained because it was already accepted during adoption of the previous version of the monograph. Moreover, there is no safety concern considering also the broad use of turmeric and turmeric preparations in the food area. The indications reported in the medicinal use can be reworded as a general indication for a \" Traditional herbal medicinal product used for the relief of digestive disturbances, such as feelings of fullnes s, slow digestion and flatulence .\" Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 13/34 3. Non-Clinical Data 3.1. Overview of available pharmacological data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof 3.1.1. Primary pharmacodynamics Herbal substance In vivo: In a study of Najafzadeh et al . (2011) choleretic effect, the bile accumulation in gall bladder of mice, was compared between aqueous suspension of C. longa and calcium channel blocker Verapami l. This animal model is approved and used for eva luation and screening pharmacological effect of agents on bile production or secretion. The mice were divided in 3 groups. Saline was administrated in group 1, an aqueous suspension of C. longa and Verapamil was orally administrated in groups 2 and 3 respectively. One hour after drug administration, the mice were euthanized and gall bladder was immediately removed. Verapamil as well as C . longa significantly increased the accumulation of bile in gall bladder in comparison to saline. Similar action on bile s ecretion (possibly via p -glycoprotein) was observed by Verapamil and C . longa al., 2011). Isolated compound- Curcumin In vivo: Siegers et al. (1997) observed that intravenous application of curcumin or bis(desmethoxy)cur cumin to rats at a level of 25 mg/kg bw, the bile flow increased by 80 and 120%, respectively after a period of 2 hours; the a uthors concluded that the observed effect on bile secretion was due to the presence of curcumin (Siegers et al., 1997) . Table 4: Overview of the main non -clinical data/conclusions Herbal preparation tested Posology Experimental model Reference Main non -clinical conclusions C. longa aqueous suspension 0.5 ml oral admini stration In vivo bile accumulation in gall bladder of mice Najafzadeh et al., 2011 C. longa significantly increased the accumulation of bile in gall bladder in comparison to saline, similarly to Verapamil Curcumin or bis(desmethoxy)cu rcumin i vivo In rats Siegers et al., 1997 Bile flow increase d by 80 and 120%, respectively after a period of 2 hours 3.1.2. Secondary pharmacodynamics Preparations Anti-depress ant effect C. longa aqueous extract has antidepressant effects mediated through inhibition of monoamine oxidize A (Yu et al., 2002) . Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page reversed the decrease in serotonin, noradrenalin and dopamine concentrations as well as the increase in serotonin turnover, cortisol levels and the in serum corticotrophin -releasing factor ( Xia et al., 2007) . Effect on b lood glucose level The effect of an ethanolic extract of turmeric on blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic KK -Ay mice and stimulated human adipocyte differentiation was investigated by Kuroda et al . The extract was prepared by a two time extraction of powdered turmeric, with five volumes of ethanol. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 12.2 g of ethanolic extract. In the experiment on the human adipocytes a stimulation of adipocyte differentiation was observed. The activity of 5.0 g/ml and 10.0 g/ml ethanolic extract was more potent than that of 0.22 g/ml and 0.44 g/ml of troglitazone, which was therapeutically used as anti- diabetic and anti -inflammatory drug in humans, until it was withdrawn in 2000 for causing drug -induced hepatitis (Kuroda et al. 2005) . Nishiyama et al. studied the influence of three turmeric extracts on blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic KK -Ay mice. The extracts used were ethanolic extract (DER and concentration not specified) containing ar-turmer one, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, a hexanic extract (DER not specified) containing ar-turmerone , and an ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction (ethanol concentration not specified) containing curcumin, demethox ycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin . The ethanolic extract extract were obtained from powdered C . longa by extracting twice with five volumes of ethanol or hexane and filtration and evaporation of the solvent. The ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction was obtained using the same method. To determine the mechanism of action the extracts were tested for adipocyte differentiation. No differences in bodyweight were observed between treated and contro l animals. The ethanolic extract stimulated adipocyte differentiation dose -dependently. The hexanic extract and the ethanolic extract from the residue of the hexane extraction showed similar effects but at higher concentration as the ethanolic extract. The results indicate that turmeric ethanolic extract containing both curcuminoids and sesquiterpenoids is more strongly hypoglycemic than either curcuminoids et antibacterial, phytotoxic, cytotoxic and insecticidal activity of an ethanolic extract of C. longa (extract preparation not specified). The extract showed antifungal activity towards Trichophyton longifusus and Microsporum canis and weak antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Toxic activity was observed against Lemna minor . The LD 50 in a brine shrimp lethality bioassay C. longa 33 g/ml. Curcuma et al., 2005) . Antioxidant activity in atherosclerosis A high- cholesterol diet given to New Zealand White rabbits leads to development of atherosclerosis in the rabbits. Rabbits given a dietary supplement of a C. longa extract (no furthe r detail) in combination with a high -cholesterol diet showed a positive effect on the animals' antioxidant status compared to controls. Curcumin has shown to mobilize -tocopherol from adipose tissue, thus protecting their body against oxidative damage pro duced during the development of atherosclerosis. Also more LDL cholesterol could be transported in plasma, increasing levels of -tocopherol. Overall the fatty acids in the animals were less susceptible to oxidation in the vessel wall ( Ramirez -Tortosa et al., 1999) . Inhibition of aflatoxin induced liver necrosis Soni et al. (1992) investi gated the preventive effect of aqueous and alcoholic extract s of turmeric on liver damage in ducklings induced by aflatoxin. The extract was prepared by boiling 1 g of turmeric Assessment report on Curcuma long a L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 15/34 powder in 100 ml water. After concentration it was made up to 10 ml. The aqueous extract (10 mg/ml) inhibited toxin production by 99%. An alcoholic extract of turmeric showed also inhibition though on a much lower level. Turmeric and curc umin treatment showed almost complete reversal of fatty changes and necrosis induced by aflatoxin ( Soni et al., 1992) . Myocardial apoptosis The effect longa in experimentally induced myocardial ischemic - reperfusion injury w as investigated by Mohanty et al . (2006) Wistar rats were fed 100 mg/kg C. longa once a day, for one month. C. longa treated rats demonstrated significant anti- apoptotic property, which might contributed to the observed preservation in cardioprotective eff ects and cardiac function (Mohanty et al. 2006) . Inhibition of u lcer formation Kim et al. (2005) investigated the protective effect of C. longa ethanolic extract against gastric ulcers by blocking H 2 histamine receptors (H 2R) of male Sprague -Dawley (pylorus -ligated) rats. The extract was prepared by re fluxing 100 g C. longa with 80% ethanol. This was shaken at room temperature for 24 hours, this was performed twice. After extraction, the fluid was concentrated with rotary vacuum evaporator. The ethanolic extract was dissolved in 100 ml H 2O and fractionated with organic solvents, n-butanol and ethyl acetate. For in vitro tests the dried material was resuspended in DMSO, for i n vivo tests the dried material was resuspended in saline. The C. longa ethanolic extract fractions were found to protect the gastric mucosal layer as effective as ranitidine. Orally administerd ethanolic extract (unknown a mount) inhibited gastric acid, gastric juice secretion and ulcer formation comparable to the effects of ranitidine. C .longa ethanolic extract also suppressed histamine -induced cAMP production, caused by direct inhibition of H 2 histamine receptors , curcumin however had no effect on cAMP formation (Kim et al., 2005) . Rafatullah et al. (1990) investigated the ulceration induced by indomethacin or reserpine administration. Hypothermic -restraint stress reduction of gastric wall mucus was inhibited by turmeric extract treatment. Treatment with turmeric extract reduced the severity of lesions induced by various necrotizing agents. Turmeric antiulcer activity of an ethanolic extract of turmeric in inbred Wistar albino rats. The extract tested was a dried 96% ethanol extract. Administration of turme ric extract led to a significant decrease in ulcer index and acidity of stomach contents. Turmeric extract not only increased the gastric wall mucus significantly but also restored the non -protein sulfhydryl (NP -SH) content in the glandular stomachs of the rats (Rafatullah et al., 1990) . Wound healing Kundu et al. studie d the wound healing effects of C. longa paste in rabbits. The C. longa treated group showed a significant higher mean value for contraction of the wound compared to controls. Furthermore t he wounds showed less inflammation and an increasing trend in the formation of collagen (Kundu et al. 2005) . Isolated compounds : (Chainani -Wu . Curcuminoids decrease prostaglandin formation via the lipoxygenase pathway ( EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 16/34 Neurochemical effect Xu et al. (2006) investigated the effect of orally administered curcumin on behavior in a chronic stress model of depression in rats. The antidepressant imipramine was used as a control. Curcumin administration showed similar properties as imipramine. The authors suggested se findings suggest that the properties of chronic administration of curcumin on the behavior of chronic stressed r ats may be related to the modulating properties of the dysfunction of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis, through selective increase in brain -derived neurotropic factor in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of the rats (Xu et al., 2006) . Anti-oxidant activity Curcumin mobilizes -tocopherol from adipose tissue, this results in protection against oxidative damage produced during atherosclerosis development. Curcumin increases VLDL cholesterol transport in plasma, which results in increasing levels of -tocopherol (Ramirez -Tortosa et al., 1999) . Curcumin was found not to be an efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger or quencher of superoxide (Khar et al., 2001) . Hepato protective activity Curcumin protects cells against lipid peroxidation induced by paracetamol. This may be due to the antioxidative effects of the phenolic groups of curcumin ( Donatus et al., 1990) decrease serum aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and free fatty acid, cholesterol and phospholipid levels. The mechanism of action is still unclear (Rajakrishnan et al., 1998) . Tacrine is known for its T -cell destructiv e activity and hepatotoxicity. In a study with cultures of human hepatocytes, which had been destroyed by tacrine, curcumin showed to be nearly ten times more effective than the regular treatment, ascorbic acid ( Song et al. 2001). However, a study on car bon tetrachloride toxicity in mice, performed in 1996, showed no protective effects due to curcumin administration at dosages of 200 mg per kg ( Zhao and O'Brien , 1996) . Donatus et al. (1990) investigated the effect of curcumin on the cytotoxic effect of paracetamol in rat hepatocytes. Curcumin showed no protective effect against paracetamol induced g lutathione (GSH) - depletion in hepatocytes of 3- methyl -cholanthrene pretreated rats. Curcumin in a concentration of 5x10-5, 5x10-4 and 5 x10-3 M protected the cells against lipid peroxidation induced by paracetamol. This effect may be due to the two phenolic groups of curcumin, which give it strong anti- oxidant effects (Donatus et al., 1990) . The effect of curcumin on alcohol induced hepatotoxicity in alcoholic rats were studied by Rajakrishnan et al. Compared to the control group curcumin administration resulted in a decrease of serum aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity. The levels of serum free fatty acids, cholesterol and ph ospholipids decreased as well ( Rajakrishnan et al., 1998) . Antiplatelet property Lee (2006) studied t he antiplatelet property of ar -turmerone. ar-turmerone showed strong inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation mediated by collagen and arachidonic acid. At higher concentrations curcumin showed the same effect. However, only a weak or no inhibitory effect was observed against PAF or thrombin activated platelets. The other components in the ethanolic extract showed no inhibitory effects ( Lee 2006) . Comparison between ar -turmerone and aspirin showed that ar -turmeron e inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen more effective than aspirin (Lee 2006) . Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 17/34 Cancer related activity Curcumin was found to inhibit in vitro tumor cell growth by inh ibiting expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in breast cancer -cell cultures and the angiogenesis factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factors (b -FGF) (Shao et al. 2002) . Effects of curcumin on inhibi tion of angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis of cancer cells was also observed (Jiang et al., 1996, Thaloor et al., 1998) . Curcumin was effective in squamous -cell carcinoma model. The study of Li et al . showed a reduced occurrence of chemically induce d tumors by 50% (Li et al. 2002) . Curcumin blocks cyclosporine A -resistant phorbol myristate acetate +anti-CD28 pathway of T -cell proliferation and thus may be a potential adjuvant immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of cancer (Ranjan et al., 1998) . Farombi et al. carried out a study to determine the ameliorative effects of curcumin and kolaviron (a biflavonoid from ) on the DBP -induced testicular damage of GSH, the g lucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and the decreased testosterone levels were significantly increased ( Farombi et al., 2007) . The increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased, which is in agreement with Ishihara et al . (Ishiha ra et al., 2000) . The authors concluded that is may be due to the intrinsic antioxidative abilities to combat oxidative damage induced by DBP . Mice exposed to human prostate cancer cells were treated with curcumin. The curcumin -treated animals showed a decrease in microvessel density and cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis compared to controls ( Dorai et al., 2000) . Incubation of endothelial cells from bovine aorta with curcumin (in a concentration range of 5 -15 M) showed induction of heme oxygenase expression. Heme oxygenase is an oxidative stress, by producing the antioxidant biliverdin, and it enhances resistance to oxidative damage to cells ( Motterlini et al., 2000) . The efficacy of curcum in or turmeric extract in reducing chemically -induced tumours in male Swiss albino mice was studied by Soudamini and Kuttan. The extract was prepared by extraction of 5 g of powdered turmeric with 100 ml acetone/methanol (45:55). The extract was filtered u sing filter paper. 40 mg of curcumin was dissolved in 5 ml acetone/methanol (45:55). 7 .12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA ) was used to induce tumors. Single application of curcumin or turmeric extract failed to inhibit papilloma formation. A small, non significant, reduction in papilloma formation was seen in the turmeric extract treated group, compared to the control group. Application of both curcumin and turmeric extract during carcinogenesis and promotion resulted in less papilloma production, compared to controls. This indicates that both curcumin and turmeric extract produce their best effects during tumour promotion ( Soudamini and Kuttan 1989) . on DMBA and 12, O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13-acetate (TPA) -promoted skin tumor formation in Swiss albino mice was investigated by Limtrakul et al . They found a significant lower number of papillomas in the curcumin treated group compared to the control group. The enhanced expression of ras -p21 and fos -p62 oncogenes w ere decreased dose dependently in the curcumin treated group ( Limtrakul et al., 2001). Curcumin reduces the testicular damage caused by exposure to di -n-butylphthalate (DBP), by increase in GSH, testosterone levels and G6PD activity and decrease in MDA levels. These effects may be due to intrinsic antioxidative abilities of curcumin ( Farombi et al., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Anti-mutagenic activity Nagabhushan et al. (1987) tested curcumin against tobacco products and several environmental mutagens in a Salmonella/microsome test with or without Aroclor 1254 -induced rat liver homogenate (S-9 mix), in order to determine the difference between mutagens which require metabolic activation and those who do not. Curcumin inhibited the mutagenicity of bidi smoke condensate, ciga rette smoke condensate and masheri (a tobacco product) and tobacco extracts in a dose -dependant manner. Curcumin is only antimutagenic against mutagens which require activation ( Nagabhushan. et al., 1987) . Diabetes Arbiser et al. (1998) and Okamoto et al. (2002) reported that curcumin reduces the destructive angiogenesis associated with diabetic retinopathy ( Arbiser et al., 1998, Okamoto et al., 3.1.3. Safety pharmacology No data available. 3.1.4. Pharmacodynamic interactions The poor bioavailability of curcumin if applied as single component is well known and described in literature. However regarding the complex composition of herbal preparations and the interplay of the many constituents (actions of synergy and inhibition), adequate general conclusions on pharmacodynamic interactions after intake of curcuma (extracts) cannot be drawn. 3.1.5. Conclusions For curcumin the studied amounts after oral a dministration are many times higher than the human daily posology used in traditional herbal medicinal products. Based on this finding it is not likely that a significant effect of curcumin on human bile secretion is obtaine d at doses traditionally used. 3.2. Overview of available pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof Curcumin Absorption and bioavailability In rodents, curcumin demonstrates a poor systemic bioavailability, because of low absorption by the gastrointestinal tract and rapid metabolism. Oral administration of a single dose of 2 g of curcumin to rats resulted in v ery low concentrations in plasma (less than 5 g/ml) indicating a poor absorption from the gut ( Leiherer et al., 2013) . After oral administration of curcumin to rats at 1 g/kg bw about 75% was excreted in the faeces and only traces in the urine; concentr ations in plasma and bile were negligible. Blood levels were less than 5 g/ml , these indicat ing a poor absorption from the gut (Lukita -Admadja et al., 2002, Volak et al., 2013) . Oral administration of radio- labelled curcumin to rats resulted in ra dioactivity being found only in the liver and kidneys ( Ravindranath and Chandrasekhar a 1980, mg/kg led to faecal excretion of about 89% of the radioactivity in 72 hours; about 6% was excreted in the bile. After intraperitoneal administration about 73% of the radioactivity was excreted in the faeces and about 11% in the bile (Holder et al. 1978) . Assessment report on Curcuma long a L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 19/34 When a single 400 mg dose of curcumin was administered orally to rats about 60% was absorbed and 40% excreted unchanged in the faeces over a period of 5 days. No curcumin could be detected in urine and only traces were found in the portal blood, liver and kidney ( Ravindranath and Chandrasekhar a 1980) . Recently research has focussed on the preparation of nanocurcumin because it has a higher solubility than curcumin and therefore a better bioavailability (Sarkar et al., 2010) . Also fytosome -curcumin in which curcumin is linked to phosphatidylcholine has been observed to result in a better bioavailability and activity after oral a dministration in rats ( Kidd 2009, Saraf 2010) to hexahydrocurcumin, and hexahydrocurcuminol in rats and mice in vivo and in suspensions of human and rat hepatocytes ( Ireson et al., 2002) . Studies with isolated perfused rat liver and isolated rat intestine suggested an initial metabolism of curcumin in the intestine, producing easily absorbable metabolites, and intensive second metabolism in the liver. Major metabolites were g lucuronides of tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin, with dihydroferulic acid and traces of ferulic acid as further metabolites, all of which were excreted in the bile (Ravindranath Blennow 1978) . LC-MS analysi s of plasma after oral administration of curcumin to rats showed that the predominant metabolites were glucuronide and glucuronide- sulphate conjugates, which reached maximum plasma concentrations about 1 hour after administration ( Asai and Miyazawa 2000 ). There is increasing evidence that in rodents and humans the intestinal tract substantially contributes to the overall metabolite yield. Metabolism of curcumin to curcumin glucuronide, curcumin sulfate, tetrahydrocurcumin, and hexahydrocurcumin was demonstrated in intestinal fractions from humans and rats, and its conversion to curcumin sulfate was demonstrated in situ in intact rat intestine ( Ireson et al. 2002) . Certain curcumin metabolites, such as tetrahydrocurcumin, possess anti -inflammatory (Ammon et al., 1993) and antioxidant activities similar to those of their metabolic progenitor ( Cohly et al., 1998, Romiti et al., 1998) . Metabolism also appeared to be rapid i n vivo . After intravenous dosing more than 50% of the dose was excreted in the bile within 5 h. This finding was interpreted as evidence in support of the hypothesis that curcumin undergoes biotransformation during absorption in the intestinal tract and enterohepatic recirculation (Ravindranath and Chandrasekhara 1982) . of tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin, with dihydroferulic acid and ferulic acid present as minor metabolites (Holder et al., 1978) . Metabolic transfer through lactation Singh et al. (1995) followed dams and their s uckling neonates to determine the modulatory influence of turmeric on hepatic biotransformation system enzymes. Turmeric and curcumin induced a significant increase in hepatic levels of glutathione S -transferase (GST) and sulfhydryl (SH) levels. Cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P450 levels were significantly elevated as well. This indicates that turmeric and/or curcumin metabolites can be transferred through lactation ( Singh et al., 1995) . Drug Interactions Animal studies revealed that green tea en hances the effect of curcumin. In mice and hamster tumor models the combination of catechin and turmeric was more effective than the individual components Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page Li et al . suggested that curcumin and green tea extract have synergistic effect in reducing oral squamous -cell carcinomas in hamsters ( Li et al., 2002) . The interpretation of the clinical relevance of the findings retrieved from animal studies and/or effects of isolated substances (as curcumin) is difficult and may lead to doubtfu l conclusions; therefore no interactions are included in the monograph. Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 to 50.3 M ( Appiah -Opong et al. 2007) . These CYPs are responsible for the hepatic metabolism of about 80% of drugs currently on the market and notably CYP3A4 is also abundant in the intestine. The inhibitory activity of curcumin towards CYP3A4 may well have implications for dr ug-drug interactions in the intestine, rather than in the liver when the intestines are exposed to high concentrations upon oral ingestion together with drugs metabolised by this enzyme. Curcumin is also a potent inhibitor of the three glutathione inhibitor of the bile acid transporter P -glycoprotein 1 (P -gp). The IC 50 value is in the range of 50 - 100 M (Aurade et al., 2010) . After the combined oral a dministration of 4 g curcuminoids and 24 mg piperine to healthy volunteers in a randomised placebo -controlled crossover study no effect on the metabolism of midazolam, flurbiprofen or paracetamol was observed, indicating that a clinically significant interac tion is not likely (Volak et al., 2013) . Assessor's comment: Curcumin demonstrates poor systemic bioavailability, because of low solubility and poor absorption by the gastrointestinal tract and rapid metabolism, which already starts in the intestinal m ucosa. Secondary metabolism occurs in the liver. The observed interactions of curcumin with other herb al preparations is not considered relevant for the traditional use of C . longa, while the maximum daily dose of curcumin is much lower than the dos e for which interactions have been observed. Therefore it is not likely that interactions will occur during the use of the traditional herbal products as described in the monograph. 3.3. Overview of available toxicological data regarding the herbal substance(s )/herbal preparation(s) and constituents thereof 3.3.1. Single dose toxicity Herbal substance The study of Majeed et al . revealed that a single feeding of 30% turmeric diet to rats had no toxic effects (Majeed et al., 1995) . Isolated compoun d- Curcumin The oral median lethal dose (LD 50) of curcumin in mice is higher than 2.0 g/kg bw ( Itokawa et al. 2008) . of curcumin at 1 -5 g/kg bw induced no toxic effects in rats ( and Blennow 1978) . Page 21/34 3.3.2. Repeat dose toxicity Herbal substance/ Extracts In a subchronic toxicity study liver toxicity had been reported, but most of these incidents involved large dietary doses (turmeric to mice or rats . In mice fed for 14 days with a diet containing 1% and 5% turmeric hepatotoxicity was observed. Rats fed with turmeric 1% for the same period showed no adverse affect. The rats fed turmeric at a dose of 5% of their diet for a period of 90 days showed a reduction in bo dy weight gain and hepatotoxicity (Deshpande et al., 1998, Kandarkar et al., 1998) . Isolated compound- Curcumin Gastric ulceration was observed after oral administration of curcumin to rats at 100 mg/kg bw for 6 days; but not at 50 mg/k bw ( Gupta compound- Curcumin No effects on chromosomal damage, and mutagenic effects were observed in mice fed with turmeric (herbal substance) (0.5%) or curcumin (0.015%) In vitro Curcumin showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames test, in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA100 and TA98, with or without metabolic activation (Jensen 1982) . No mutagenic effects were found in the Ames tests for curcumin and turmeric extracts (information on preparation could not be found) ( Nagabhushan and Bhide 1986) . No mutagenic activity was demonstrated in bacteria treated with curcumin preparations of purity up to 85%, or of unknown purity. A 79 -85% purity preparation induced chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in vitro ( Jain et al. 1987) . Donatus et al. (1990) found curcumin to be moderate cytotoxic. At a concentr ation of 5 x 10-3 M curcumin slightly increased LDH -leakage from rat hepatocytes. This increase was accompanied by an increase in GSH -depletion, which can result in increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity ( Donatus et al. 1990) . In vivo : Curcumin give n to mice at 0.015% of their diet for 12 weeks induced no genotoxic effects as measured by the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes and chromosomal aberrations , a curcumin unknown purity ) administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow cells, whereas a low level of chromosomal aberrations was reported in the same cell population ( Jain et al., 1987) . In another in vivo study in m ice injected i.p. with curcumin of unknown purity, there was some evidence of sister chromatid exchanges induction at low frequency above 25 mg/kg, while in rats fed curcumin of unknown purity there was equivocal evidence for the induction of chromosomal a berrations (Giri et al., 1990) . Based on these data, the JECFA concluded that there was no adequate evidence for the genotoxicity of curcumin. In reaching this conclusion, the sister chromatid exchange data in particular was considered to be of little r elevance in the evaluation, while other studies could not be reliably interpreted because of the impurities in the curcumin preparations used (JECFA , JECFA (103- weeks) carcinogenicity studies have been performed in mice and rats, fed ad libitum diets containing to daily doses of 0, 220/320, 1520/1620 or 6000/8400 mg turmeric oleoresin/kg in or 2000/2400 mg turmeric oleoresin /kg per day in rats. These results showed marginal increases in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in mice and in clitoral gland adenomas in rats. These effects were not considered to be treatment related and it was concluded that turmeric -oleoresin is not carcinogenic (National Toxicology P rogram 1993) . 3.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity No effects on pregnancy rate, number of dead embryos, total implants were observed in mice fed with turmeric (0.5%) or curcumin (0.015%) ( Vijayalaxmi 1980) was studied in Wistar rats ( Ganiger et al. 2007) . It was concluded that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for reproductive toxicity of curcumin, fed in the diet for two successive generations to rats in this study was 847 and 959 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) per day for male rats and 1043 and 1076 mg/kg bw for females for F0 and F1 generations, respectively. This study was the final toxicology study on curcumin reviewed by JECFA at the 61st Meeting, 2003. The JECFA group considered that the small body weight reduction in the F2 pups of the highest dose group prevented this from being regarded as a no adverse effect level, and so allocated an ADI for curcumin of 0 -3 mg/kg bw based on the intake of 250 -320 mg/kg bw in the mid- dose group as the NO AEL (JECFA , JECFA 2004) . There is one report indicating that rats fed high doses of turmeric (4 g/kg per day ) or curcumin (0.4 g/kg per day ) for 14 -21 days can pass sufficient quantities of these compoun ds (or their metabolites) into milk to cause the induction of hepatic enzymes in exposed offspring ( Singh et al., 1995) . 3.3.6. Local tolerance No data available . 3.3.7. Other special studies The finding that curcumin can cause gastrointestinal irritation in rats (ulcers, hyperplasia and inflammation) has been shown at doses of 100 mg/kg bw ( Gupta et al., 1980) and therefore is not relevant for the daily doses of curcumin that are contained in the products that are described in the monogr aph ( based on a content of 3.14%, the maximum daily dose is 126 mg curcumin), therefore no warning is taken up for individuals with gastrointestinal diseases (peptic ulcer disease, . 3.3.8. Conclusions In absence of toxicological data on the herbal substance and only one report on single dose toxicity on rats fed with 30% turmeric diet, w hich showed no toxic effects , data on the constituents can give an indication about the safety of the herbal substance . The isolated constituen ts do not appear to be toxic or mutagenic . No reproductive toxicity has been observed. However because it is known that curcumin and/or metabolites are transferred to sucklings via lactation it is not recommended to use C . longa or preparations thereof during breastfeeding. The JECFA established an ADI of 0 -3 mg/kg bw for Assessment report on Curcuma long a L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 23/34 the NOAEL of 250- 320 mg/kg bw per day from the reproductive toxicity study for a decreased body weight gain in the F2 generation observed at t he highest dose level and an uncertainty factor of 100 . Currently curcumin is an authorised food color in EU with maximal allowed use levels varying from 20 -500 mg/kg food according to the food type. Curcumin is also allowed in beverages at levels upto 200 mg/l (EFSA 2010) . The estimated maximum daily intake of curcumin with the posology recommended in the monograph is 126 mg. For an adult of 60 kg this corresponds with an intake of 2.1 mg/kg bw, which is within the established ADI. The finding that curc umin can cause gastrointestinal irritation (ulcers, hyperplasia and inflammation) has been shown in rats at doses of 100 mg/kg bw ( Gupta et al., 1980) and therefore is not relevant for the daily doses of curcumin that are contained in the products that a re described in the monograph (maximum daily dose is 126 mg curcumin), t herefore no warning is taken up for individuals with gastrointestinal diseases (peptic ulcer disease , ulcerative colitis, Crohn's). 3.4. Overall conclusions on non -clinical data The primary pharmacodynamic data presented supports the proposed traditional use indication: \"Traditional herbal medicinal product used for the relief of digestive disturbances such as feelings of fullness, slow digestion and flatulence\". A warning is taken up that the use of the product is not recommended in case of biliary obstruction and other liver function disorders . For curcumin an ADI of 0 -3 mg/kg bw has been established. The estimated maximum daily intake of curcumin recommended in the monograph is 126 mg. For an adult of 60 kg this corresponds to 2.1 mg/kg bw ; therefore the proposed traditional posology is considered safe. Tests on reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have mainly been performed with curcumin or herbal preparations and not with the herbal substance. Nonetheless, neither the chemical composition nor the long -term widespread uses in the European Union suggest that there is a high risk associated with the use of C. longa . In absenc e of genotoxicity data, a list entry cannot be recommended. 4. Clinical Data 4.1. Clinical pharmacology 4.1.1. Overview of pharmacodynamic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents No data available . 4.1.2. Overview of pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents Curcumin In a small study observing the influence of curcumin on blood lipids with 10 healthy volunteers was found that oral intake of 500 mg per day curcumin for 7 days resulted in a significant decrease in the level of serum lipid peroxides (33%) and increase in HDL cholesterol (29%) and a decrease in level of total serum cholesterol (12%) ( Soni and rhizoma Page 24/34 After oral administration of was estimated to be 65% ( Commandeur and Vermeulen 1996) . In a Phase I clinical study, low systemic bioavailability of curcumin following oral dosing has been demonstrated. Efficient first- pass metabolism and some degree of intestinal metabolism, particularly glucuronidation and sulfation of curcumin, might explain its poor systemic availability when administered via the oral route. A daily oral dose of 3. 6 g of curcumin is compatible with detectable levels of the parent compound in colorectal tissue (7 -20 nmol/g). There appears to be negligible distribution of the parent drug to hepatic tissue or other tissues beyond the gastrointestinal tract (Hatcher et al., 2008, Sharma et al., 2001, Sharma et al., 2007) . In another Phase I clinical trial, patients with high risk or pre -malignant lesions were treated with curcumin for 3 months. The serum concentration of curcumin usually peaked at 1 to 2 hours after oral intake of curcumin and gradually declined within 12 hours. The average peak serum concentrations after taking 4 -8 g of curcumin were 0.51- 1.77 M, respectively. Urinary excretion of curcumin was undetectable (Cheng et al., 2001) . The authors conclud ed that the levels demonstrated might be sufficient to exert pharmacological activity. Assessor's comment: The amounts of curcumin that were tested in these studies (4 -8 g of curcumin) exceed by far the theoretical maximal amounts of curcumin on the bas is of literature values in the products containing C. longa L. that are mentioned in the monograph . 4.2. Clinical efficacy 4.2.1. Dose response studies Curcuma longa (preparations) No data available . Curcumin In a randomised, single- blind, three phase, cross -over st udy on 12 healthy volunteers the effect of different dosages of curcumin on the gall bladder contraction was measured against placebo (amylum) over an observation time of 2 hours . Dosages of 20 -80 mg curcumin were taken orally. A dosage of 40 mg produced 50% decrease in the volume of the gall bladder, indicating an increase in the contraction of the gall bladder, 2 hours after intake. No side effects were reported by the participants in this study (Rasyid et al., 2002) . 4.2.2. Clinical studies In the publis hed literature 12 clinical studies conducted with C. longa preparations or curcumin were found. Details of these studies and the outcomes are presented in the following tables.

Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children) No data available. 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy The available clinical data are not sufficient to support a \"well established use\" indication for curcuma . The clinical data suggest so me possible effect s of curcumin on the depletion of the gallbladder, and reduction of sy mptoms in dyspeptic disorders . These are partially supporti ve for the traditional use of C. longa for digestive complaints . 5. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance 5.1. Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinical trials in humans No side effects were reported during a study in which 12 healthy volunteers took 2 0 mg curcumin (Rasyid and Lelo 1999 ). In a study with 8 healthy volunteers no adverse effects hav e been reported after oral doses of 2 g curcumin and also not after combining curcumin with piperine and thereby raising the serum level of curcumin (Shoba et al., 1998) . In a phase I trial with 25 subjects, who had various high -risk cancerous condition s, no toxic reactions were observed. The subjects received up to 8 g of curcumin a day for 3 months ( Cheng et al., 2001) . In a clinical study, two of 19 patients treated with 2500 mg of curcumin per day, complained of gastric irritation. No other adverse effects were reported ( James 1994) . Mild side effects (nausea, dermatitis, pain in abdomen) were also reported by participants in the study of Kulkarni after oral intake of a turmeric containing combination product, corresponding to 300 mg turmeric dai ly, however the side effects did not necessitate discontinuation of the treatment ( Kulkarni et al. 1991) . Rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported ( Goh and Ng 1987 , Hata et al. 1997) . In an 18 -month study on the topical use of curc umin to treat skin and mucous membrane cancers, scalp itching was observed in 1 patient of 62 patients ( Kuttan et al. 1987) . Patch testing led to allergic reactions (not further classified) in persons who were regularly exposed to the substance or who already had dermatitis of the finger tips. Few allergic reactions (skin rash) occurred in people not previously exposed to curcumin ( Seetharam and Pasricha 1987 ). In a phase II study, a gastro -protective action was observed in patients with peptic u lcer disease after oral intake of 600 mg curcumin 5 times daily ( Prucksun et al., 2001) . Therefore no contraindication for duodenal/gastric ulcers was included in the monograph. A dietary supplement containing curcumin has received a GRAS (Generally Recognised as Safe) notification from the FDA up to 1 000 mg per day for a 60 kg person (GRAS notification from FDA, 2018) . According to the EFSA panel, the daily intake of curcumin from the normal diet amounts to less than 7% of the ADI of 3 mg/kg per day, with a theoretical maximum daily exposure of 6.9 mg/kg bw per day for adults and of 11.9 mg/kg per day for a typical 3 year -old child ( EFSA 2010) . Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 31/34 5.2. Patient exposure No data available. 5.3. Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths In the database of the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Centre LAREB no adverse events were reported for C. longa . The Food and Drug Administration classifies turmeric as a substance Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS notification from FDA, 2018) . No major side effects have been reported in the cited clinical studies after oral intake of curcuma extracts and curcumin in doses up to 8 g per day for 3 months (Bundy et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2001, Deodhar et al., 1980, Rasyid et al., 2002) . In a clinical study in patients with irritable bowel syndrome dry mouth and flatulence was reported by approximately 25% of the patients ( Bundy et al., 2004) . In another study two of 19 patients treated with 2500 mg of curcumin per day, co mplained of gastric irritation (James 1994 ). In another study mild side -effects as nausea, diarrhoea, headache, tiredness and sleepiness have been reported in the turmeric group (2 g per day ) as well as in the other groups (placebo and compar ative herbal combination) (Thamlikitkul et al., 1989) . With respect to topical use , rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported ( Goh and Ng 1987, Hata et al., 1997) . In an 18 -month study on the topical use of curcumin to treat skin and muco us membrane cancers, scalp itching was observed in 1 patient out of 62 patients (Kundu et al. 2005) . Patch testing led to allergic reactions (not further classified) in persons who were regularly exposed to the substance or who already had dermatitis of the finger tips. Few allergic reactions (skin rash) occurred to people not previously exposed to curcumin ( Seetharam and Pasricha 1987 ). Pharmacovigilance issues have been reported for a product containing curcuma and an amino acid. Further study revealed that the observed liver toxicity was not due to curcuma. 5.4. Laboratory findings No data available. 5.5. Safety in special populations and situations 5.5.1. Use in children and adolescents No data available . Therefore in the section \" Special Warnings and precautions for use \" the following sentence is included: \"The use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age has not been established due to lack of adequate data \". 5.5.2. Contraindications The available data do not justify including a contraind ication , apart from the general contraindication on hypersensitivity to the active substance . The warning concerning the potential effect on bile secretion reported in the first version of the monograph was moved to \"Special warning and precautions of us e\" to align with the Curcuma xanthorrhiza monograph. Page 32/34 5.5.3. Special Warnings and precautions for use Because of a potential effect on bile secretion , C. longa is not recommended in case of obstruction of the bile duct, cholangitis, liver disease, gallstones and any Blumenthal 1998, ESCOP Monograph 2003 , Rasyid et al., 2002, WHO 1999) . Therefore , as a precautionary measure a warning is taken up into the monograph . 5.5.4. Drug interactions and other forms of interaction Turmeric may interact w ith NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti- inflammatory Drugs), antiplatelet agents or antihyperlipidemics, and a case report mentions interaction with warfarin. These findings are mainly based on in vitro data, animal studies or individual case reports. More studies are needed to confirm and assess the clinical significance of these potential interactions ( Bowman 2005 , Fetrow and Avila 1999, Heck et al., 2000) . As clinical data is lacking , these effects are not included in the monograph. Several studies reporte d interactions between curcumin and other phytochemicals. Fetrow suggested that curcumin could decrease the effect of immunosuppressants, but also here no supporting clinical data was provided ( Fetrow and Avila 1999) . Shoba et al. demonstrated that the bioavailability of curcumin increased twenty -fold when healthy human subjects took a 2 g dose of curcumin in combination with 20 mg of piperine, extracted from black pepper, compared to subjects who took only 2 g of curcumin ( Shoba et al., 1998) . The interpretation of the clinical relevance of the findings retrieved from animal studies (see Section 3.2) and/or effects of isolated substances (as curcumin) is difficult and may lead to doubtful conclusions ; therefore no interactions are included in the mono graph . 5.5.5. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. However , because it is known that curcumin and/or metabolites are transferred to sucklings via lactation (Singh et al., 1995) it is not recommend ed to use C. longa or preparations thereof during breastfeeding. No fertility data is available . 5.5.6. Overdose No toxic effects were observed in patients after three months oral daily intake of 8,000 mg or 2.2 g of turmeric (equivalent to max. 110 mg of curcum in) for four months ( Cheng et al., 2001, Sharma et al., 2007) . 5.5.7. Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability No data available . 5.5.8. Safety in other special situations Not applicable Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page 33/34 5.6. Overall conclusions on clinical safety No serious side effects have been reported up to now. Furthermore the chemical com position of C. longa does not give any reason for concerns regarding safety. Potential interactions between C. longa and NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, antihyper -lipidemics an d immunosuppres sants have been described andreported, but clinical evidence for these effects is lacking (Bowman 2005, Fetrow and Avila 1999) . The use of C. longa in pregnant women and during lactation is not recommended while there are sign s that curcumin and/or metabolites can be transferred through lactation. Because of possible effect on bile secretion , as a precautionary measure, C. longa preparations are not recommen ded in case of obstruction of the bile duct, cholangitis, liver diseas e, gallstones and any other biliary diseases. 6. Overall conclusions C. longa is in use in Europe for a long time, mainly for dyspeptic complaints , skin problems and liver diseases and infections. T he available data is not sufficient to support a \"well est ablished use\" indication for curcuma. As the medicinal use has been documented continuously in European handbooks, C. longa fulfils the requirements of Directive 2004/24 EC for classification of traditional herbal medicinal products. The use of C. longa is considered plausible in the treatment of dyspeptic complaints on the basis of bibliography and pharmacological data. The initial indication: 'Traditional herbal medicinal product used to increase bile flow for the relief of symptoms of indigestion (such as sensation of fullness, flatulence and slow digestion' was slightly amended for the revision to align it with with the Curcuma xanthorrhiza monograph. Reference to a lack of bile secretion was not considered to fulfill the criteria as laid down in Article 16a of Directive 2004/24 EC, because this is a potential effect and can only be diagnosed with the help of a medicinal practitioner. Therefore the proposed indication for traditional monograph reads as follows: 'Traditional herbal medicinal product used for the relief of digestive disturbances, such as feelings of fullness, slow digestion and flatulence'. Although the (topical) use for skin diseases is also described in authoritative texts, it is not included in the monograph because no information is available that C. longa containing products are currently on the market of EU Member States for such indications and data on the preparations and posology is lacking . The pharmacological activity is attributed to the whole preparat ion; however the majority of activities were observed with curcumin. C. longa is used in the following pharmaceutical preparations and posology: powdered herbal substance : 0.5-1 g, 2-3 times daily comminuted herbal substance as herbal tea ( infusion ): 0.5-1 g in 150 ml boiling water, 2 -3 times daily tincture ( ratio of herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:10) , extraction solvent ethanol 70% V/V: 0.5 -1 ml, 3 times daily Assessment report on Curcuma longa L., rhizoma EMA/HMPC/329745/2017 Page ethanol 96% V/V: 9 0-162 mg daily, divided in 2- 5 partial doses dry extract ( DER 5.5-6.5:1) extraction solvent: ethanol 50% V/V: 100- 200 mg, 2 times daily tincture ( ratio of herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:5) extraction solvent ethanol 70%, V/V: 10 ml once daily o r 5 ml in 60 ml water , 3 times daily Only mild side effects have been reported for C. longa such as dry mouth, flatulence, and gastric irritation. No serious side effects have been reported. Due to lack of data, the use of C. longa in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years cannot be recommended. As relevant data on the use during pregnancy and lactation is lacking, C. longa cannot be recommended in these conditions . Due to the nature of the potential effect on bile secretion it is not recomme nded to use C. longa preparations in case of obstruction of the bile duct, cholangitis, liver disease, gallstones and any other biliary diseases. A European Union list entry is not supported due to lack of adequate data on genotoxicity. Annex List "}
