It is around age 2 or 3 that the symptoms of ASD (autistic spectrum disorder) typically begin to emerge. This might manifest in an inability to perceive sights and sounds according to standard, resistance to change especially in regard to routines, deficient motor skills, repetitive behaviors or movements, hyper-focus on one thing, and loud outbursts. Studies indicate that individuals with ASD have hyper-active connectivity in some areas of the brain and under-active connectivity in others. Neurofeedback is the natural approach to normalizing these patterns. What Causes Autism? Definitive research on this matter is inconclusive of any one main source. Studies suggest it is related to increased stress to developing toddler's systems as a result of toxic burden to the body and among other factors. This can begin in utero and beyond including environment, diet, medications, vaccines, inflammation, lifestyle, and genetics. All of these can contribute to the development of ASD. How Does Neurofeedback Help? Neurofeedback uses biofeedback technology to establish healthier brainwave patterns. With ASD, a common finding is abnormal brainwaves. Studies show that neurofeedback helps to stabilize and improve brainwave function. By facilitating improvement in areas of abnormal connectivity and improving brainwave function, outcomes are optimized. Are There Noticeable Improvements? Some observed improvements from Neurofeedback can include: fewer emotional outbursts, stronger speech patterns, initiation of touch and contact, better responses to parental and teacher instructions, an increase in imaginative thought, decreased hyperactivity, and improvement of social skills.
