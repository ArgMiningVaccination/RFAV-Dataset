See summaries of product characteristics (SPCs), British national formulary (BNF) or the MHRA or NICE websites for up-to -date information. 4 Key points Wilson disease is a rare inherited genetic disorder that occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people. In people with the disease, biliary excretion of copper is impaired leading to accumulation of copper in the liver, which causes toxicity. Eventually, copper is released into the bloodstream and deposited in extrahepatic tissues causing dysfunction of other organs including the central nervous system, eyes and kidneys. Wilson disease is fatal without treatment . Zinc acetate dihydrate ( Wilzin ) is licensed for treating people with Wilson disease. The marketing authorisation was granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2004. Other zinc salts have also been used to treat people with Wilson disease but are not licensed in the UK for this condition. The evidence review includes 2 systematic reviews and 6 observational s tudies that assessed zinc for first -line treatment of symptoms of Wilson disease (alone or in combination with a chelating agent [penicillamine or trientine]) , or for maintenance treatment of Wilson disease (following treatment with a chelating agent ). The evidence review concludes that there is a lack of high-quality evidence to estimate the relative treatment effects of the available treatments for Wilson disease. The best available evidence suggests penicillamine or zinc salt monotherapy is effective fo r treating most people with symptoms of Wilson disease . There appears to be little difference between the treatments, although penicillamine might be preferable to zinc for people with predominantly hepatic symptoms and, because it works faster, for those who are acutely ill. From the available evidence, a combination of a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine) plus a zinc salt appears to be effective for treating most people with symptoms of Wilson disease . However, analyses suggest that penicillami ne, trientine or zinc taken alone are more effective than combination treatment, and more people taking combination treatment experience adverse effects. No firm conclusions can be drawn; however, the results of the studies suggest that combination treatment should be considered only after monotherapy has failed to manage symptoms, and people should be carefully monitored for adverse effects. Studies also suggest that zinc salts alone are effective as maintenance treatment for Wilson disease in people who have previously taken zinc salts in combination with penicillamine or trientine. 5 Contents 1.

Introduction Background and current guidance Wilson disease is a rare inherited genetic disorder that occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people. I n people with the disease, biliary excretion of copper is impaired leading to accumulation of copper in the liver, which causes toxicity. Eventually, copper is released into the bloodstream and deposited in extrahepatic tissues causing dysfunction of other organs including the central nervous system, eyes and kidneys. Wilson disease is fatal without treatment ( Wilson disease, Oxford Textbook of Medicine ). Symptoms of Wilson disease are usually non- specific but the condition should be considered in adults and children with unexplained liver disease and neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Typical presentation is in the second and third decade of life, most commonly with liver disease (ranging from asymptomatic hepatomegaly to fulminant tremor or psyc hiatric symptoms). Family screening is used to identify relatives of people with Wilson disease who have not yet developed symptoms ( Wilson disease, Oxford Textbook of Medic ine). Chelating agents (such as penic illamine or trientine), which bi nd to copper in the body and are subsequently excreted, are usually recommended first -line for treating Wilson disease. There is most experience world- wide with penicillamine; however, s ome people cannot tolerate it due to adverse effects and it may initially worsen neurological symptoms. Zinc, which inhibits absorption of copper, may be taken alone or in combination with a chelating agent. Lifelong treatment is required for Wilson disease to avoid recurrence of symptoms and liver failure. Liver transplantation may be required for fulminant hepatic failure and decompensated liver disease that is unresponsive to medical therapy ( Wilson disease, Oxford Textbook of Medicine). The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guideline on managing Wilson disease advises that there is a lack of high- quality evidence to estimate the relative treatment effects of the available medicines . This evidence review considers the best available evidence for zinc (used alone or in combination with chelating agents) for: first-line treatment of people with symptomatic Wilson disease maintenance treatment of people whose symptoms have stabilised or improved with a chelating agent, and second- line treatment of people who cannot tolerate penicillamine. Product overview Mode of action Zinc is believed to interfere with the uptake of copper from the gastrointestinal tract by inducing metallothionein, a protein in the body that chelates with metals. Metallothionein has greater affinity for copper than for zinc and preferentially binds copper, preventing its absorption. Bec ause copper also enters the gastrointestinal tract from saliva and gastric secretions, zinc treatment can generate a negative balance for copper, and remove stored copper from the body (EASL guideline on managing Wilson disease). 7 Regulatory status Zinc ace tate dihydrate ( Wilzin ) is licensed for treating people with Wilson disease. The marketing authorisation was granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2004. Although the license does not preclude its use, t he summary of product charac teristics (SPC) states that zinc acetate dihydrate alone is not recommended for the initial treatment of people with symptoms of Wilson disease because of its slow onset of action. People with symptoms should initially be treated with a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine) , alone or in combination with z inc acetate dihydrate. When copper levels are below toxic thresholds and the person is clinically stable, maintenance treatment with zinc acetate dihydrate alone can be considered. Zinc may also be used alone in people who are presymptomatic . When switching from a chelating agent to zinc acetate dihydrate for maintenance therapy, the chelating agent should be taken along with the zinc for 2 to 3 weeks because this is the time it takes for zinc to block copper absorption completely. The 2 treatments should be administered at least 1 hour apart. Other zinc salts, such as zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate, have also been used to treat people with Wilson disease. However, apart from zinc acetate dihydrate, no licensed zinc salts are available in the UK for this condition. In line with the guidance from the General Medical Council (GMC) on prescribing unlicensed medicines , the presc riber should take full responsibility for determining the needs of the person and whether use of these zinc salts is appropriate outside their authorised indications. Supporting information and advic e is also available from the GMC. Dosing information Acco rding to the SPC for Wilzin , the usual dosage of elemental zinc for adults is 50 mg (corresponding to 167.84 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate) 3 times daily, with a maximum dosage of 50 mg 5 times daily. Each dose must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2- 3 hours after meals. Lower dos ages are recommended for children and pregnant women. The dosage should be adjusted in response to therapeutic monitoring, including plasma free copper and urinary excretion of copper. Cost Wilzin costs \u00a3132.00 for 250 x 25mg capsules and \u00a3242.00 for 250 x 50 mg capsules, excluding VAT ( MIMS , June 2017). 2. Summary of results A systematic review (1 randomised trial and 12 observational studies) and 1 observational study found penicillamine and zinc salts (zinc acetate or zinc sulfate) are effective first -line monotherapy for most people with hepatic or neurological symptoms of Wilson diseas e (74% of people with hepatic symptoms improved or became asymptomatic with penicillamine compared with 56% with zinc , and 81% of people with neurological symptoms improved or became asymptomatic with penicillamine compared with 90% with zinc) . There 8 appears to be little difference between the treatments, although penicillamine might be preferable to zinc for people with predominantly hepatic symptoms. The systematic review found that early neurological deterioration was more common with penicillamine than with zinc salts. Adverse effects , including serious adverse effects that caused people to stop treatment, were also seen more often with penicillamine compared with zinc salts . However, the number of people taking zinc salts to treat symptoms was small, different disease presentations (hepatic or neurological) were not equally represented, and the studies have many other limitations. No studies comparing trientine and zinc salts alone for initial treatment of symptomatic Wilson disease met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review. A systematic review (17 studies ; design of individual studies not reported) and 1 additional observational study found that first -line combination treatment with chelating agents (penicillamine or trie ntine ) plus zinc sal ts (zinc acetate or zinc sulfate) was effective for 60% of people or treatment blocks (the duration of therapy until the medication was changed or until the end of follow -up) with hepatic or neurological symptoms of Wilson disease. Combination treatment appeared to be more effective for people with neurological symptoms compared with hepatic symptoms. However, when results from the systematic review were compared with results from studies of monotherapies for Wilson disease, analyses suggested that combinat ion treatment is less effective than penicillamine, trientine or zinc taken alone, and more people taking c ombination treatment experience adverse effects. In addition, m ortality and liver transplantation may be more common with combination treatment compared with monotherapy (12.7% overall versus 6.6%), particularly for penicillamine plus zinc sulfate (16.3%). The overall quality of the evidence is low and only 3 studies asse ssed trientine plus zinc salts. Three observational studies found that clini cal signs and symptoms remained stable when zinc salts alone (zinc acetate or zinc sulfate) were taken as maintenance treatment for Wilson disease in people who had previously taken zinc salts in combination with a chelating agent . Most people in the studi es had taken penicillamine rather than trientine . No studies that met the inclusion criteria specifically considered the use of zinc salts for treating people who were intolerant of penicillamine. Although some of the studies included in this evidence rev iew may have included small numbers of people who could not tolerate penicillamine , this was not stated explicitly and results were not reported for this subgroup of people. In the studies, zinc salts commonly caused adverse effects, but these were generally mild gastrointestinal adverse effects, which did not require discontinuation of treatment. One observational study suggested that adverse effects of zinc sulfate may be severe in children . The study authors noted that z inc acetate may be better t olerated than zinc sulfate. According to the summary of product characteristics for zinc acetate dihydrate, which is licensed for treating Wilson disease in the UK, t he most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation (in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people) . Elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, leukopenia occur uncommonly with zinc acetate dihydrate (in between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 people) . Most of the studies included in the sys tematic reviews and individual studies in this evidence review are low-quality retrospective non -comparative observational studies , which are 9 susceptible to bias, confounding and other methodological problems. Observational studies cannot prove that Wilson disease improved because of zinc salts or other treatments ; they can only suggest that zinc salts were associated with an improvement in the condition. 3. Methodology A description of the relevant Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes ( PICO ) for this review was provided by NHS England's Policy Working Group for the topic (see the literature search terms section for more information). The research questions for this evidence review are: 1. Are zinc salts an effective, safe and cost -effective initial sole treatment for symptomatic people with Wilson disease in comparison with penicillamine or trientine? 2. Is treatment with zinc salts in combination with penicillamine or trientine clinically effective, safe and cost -effective in people with Wilson disease who are intolerant to penicillamine, or as initial treatment for symptomatic people? 3. What is the evidence base for using long- term zinc salt maintenance therapy in people whose condition has stabilised and improved following treatment with trientine? 4. Is treatment with zinc salts clinically effective, safe and cost -effective in people with Wilson disease who are intolerant of penicillamine ? The searches for evidence to support the use of zinc for Wilson disease were undertaken by the NICE Guidance Information Services' team . Results from the literature searches were screened using their titles and abstracts for relevance against the criteria from the PICO . Full text references of potentially relevant evidence were obtained and reviewed to determine whether they met the PICO inclusion criteria for this evidence review. More information can be found in the sections on search strategy and evidence selection . The NICE evidence summary: process gui de (2017) sets out the how the summaries are developed and approved for publication. The included studies are quality ass essed using the National Service Framework for Long term Conditions (NSF -LTC) evidence assessment framework as set out in NHS England's Guidance on conducting evidence reviews for Specialised Services Commissioning Products (2016) (see the grade of evidence section for more information). 4. Summary of included studies The evidence review includes 2 systematic reviews and 6 observational studies . The first systematic review ( Wiggelinkhuizen et al. 2009; 1 randomised trial and 12 observational studies) assessed zinc salts or chelating agents as monotherapy for initial treatment of Wilson disease. The second systematic review (Chen et al. 2015 ; 17 observational studies) assessed zinc salts and a chelating agent in combination for initial treatm ent of Wilson disease. Three of the observational studies also considered initial treatment of people with symptoms of Wilson disease ( Czlonkowska et al. 2014 , Chang et al. 2013 and Wiernicka et 10 al. 2013 ). The other 3 assessed zinc salts taken alone as maintenance treatment for Wilson disease following treatment with a chelating agent (Brewer et al. 2001 , Shimiz u et al. 2010 and Sinha et al 2008 ). A summary of the incl uded studies is shown in table 1 (see the evidence summary tables for full details). No studies that met the inclusion criteria specifically considered the use of zinc salts for treating people who were intolerant of penicillamine. Table 1 Summary of included studies Study Population Intervention and comparison Primary outcome Zinc versus chelating agents as monotherapy for initial treatment of W ilson disease Wiggelinkhuizen et al.

Results An overview of the results for clinical effectiveness and safety and tolerability can be found in the evidence summary tables . Clinical effectiveness Zinc salts taken alone as initial treatment for people with symptoms of Wilson disease The systematic review by Wiggelinkhuizen et al. (2009) assessed subgroups of people according to their clinical presentation. It found that hepatic symptoms of Wilson disease resolved or improved in 73.7% (42/57) of people taking penicillamine alone over a mean of 64 months and 55.6% (5/9) of people taking zinc salts (zinc acetate or zinc sulfate) alone over a mean of 81 months . Neurological symptoms resolved or improved in 80.6% (58 72) of people taking penicillamine and in 90% (9/10) of people taking zinc salts . More people reported initial deterioration of neurological symptoms with penicillamine compared with zinc salts (5.7% [6/107] versus 0.8% [ 1/127 ] respectively) . No statistical analyses of pooled results were reported because the s tudies included in the systematic review were heterogeneous . 12 No studies of trientine or tetrathiomolybdate therapy were included in the systematic review because no relatively large studies consider ing the efficacy of initial monotherapy with these agents were found. After a median 4 years ' follow -up, the retrospective observational study by Czlonkowska et al. (2014) generally found no statistically significant differences between penicillamine alone and zinc sulfate alone in the likelihood of remaining on first -line therapy or in overall therapeutic success in subgroups of people with neurological or hepatic symptom s of Wilson disease. There was also no statistically significant difference between the treatments in initial deterioration of neurological symptoms in the neurological subgroup. N obody in the hepati c subgroup experience d initial deterioration of neurological symptoms. The retrospective observational study Wiernicka et al. (2013) did not consider the efficacy of zinc salts. Neither of the studies identified for this evidence review c ompared zinc and trientine monotherapies for the initial treatment of Wilson disease. Zinc salts in combination with penicillamine or trientine as initial treatment for people with symptoms of Wilson disease The systematic review by Chen et al. (2015) assessed the effectiveness of combination treatments over a mean follow -up of 10.6 years and compared this with the effectiveness of monotherapies obtained from analyses from other studies in Wilson disease. Most of the studies included in the systematic review assessed penicillamine plus zinc sulfate or another zinc salt; only 3/17 of the included studies assessed trientine plus a z inc salt. The systematic review did not compare combination treatment with penicillamine plus zinc with trientine plus zinc. Chen et al. (2015) found that monotherapy with penicillamine (73.7% versus 60.4% respectively, p=0.03) was statistically significantly more effective than combination treatment with zinc and a chelating agent . Combination treatment was found to be more effective in people presenting with predominantly neurological symptoms compared with hepatic symptoms (78.6% compared with 47.1%, p=0.02). In the retrospective observational study by Chang et al. (2013) , over a median 7.3 years, 89.2% (58/65) of people taking low -dose penicillamine plus high- dose zinc sulfate improved or became stable. Four people needed a liver transplant . Nobody had significant neurological deterioration . Zinc salt s taken as maintenance therapy following treatment with a chelating agent The retrospective observational study by Brewer et al. (2001) found that there was no deterioration in urine or plasma copper levels, or in speech, neurological or liver function during a mean 3.6 years' follow -up in 17 children primarily taking zinc acetate alone as maintenance therapy after a chelating agent. Statistically significant improvements in speech and neurological function scores were reported in the neurological subgroup, although these improvements were small and it is not known if they were clinical ly important . It is not known how many of the children previously took trientine compared with penicilla mine . 13 In their prospective observational study, Shimizu et al. (2010) found that hepatic and neurological symptoms did not worsen in 37 people who took zinc acetate alone for 48 weeks after previous ly being stable on penicillamine or trientine (alone or in combination with other zinc salts) , nor did any clinical signs or laboratory findings . Before being treated with zinc acetate, 9 people had hepatomegaly and this resolved in all of them at 16 weeks . Twelve people took trientine initially (alone or with zinc salts), but results for this subgroup are not reported separately. When penicillamine was stopped in people taking combination treatment , the retrospective observational study by Sinha et al (2008) found that 97.7% (44/45) improved or remained stable with zinc sulfate alone. Only 1 person reported worsening (in dysarthria) . Some statistical ly significant improvements in disability and impairment were reported with maintenance treatment, but the clinical significance of these is unclear . This study did not include anybody taking trientine plus zinc initially. Zinc salts alone or in combinatio n with chelating agents for people who are intolerant of penicillamine No studies that met the inclusion criteria specifically considered the use of zinc salts for treating people who were intolerant of penicillamine. Although some of the studies included in this evidence review may have included small numbers of people who could not tolerate penicillamine, this was not stated explicitly and results were not reported for this subgroup of people. Safety and tolerability Zinc salts taken alone as initial treatment for people with symptoms of Wilson disease The systematic review by Wiggelinkhuizen et al. (2009) found that adverse effects occurred in 24.4% (50/205) of people taking penicillamine and 12.5% (28/224) of people taking zinc salts (zinc acetate or zinc sulfate). Severe adverse effects requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 12.7% (26/205) of people taking penicillamine and 0.9% (2/224) of people taking zinc salts . No statistical analysis could be reported, and no studies were available comparing zinc with trientine or tetrathiomolybdate. In the observational study by Cz lonkowska et al. ( 2014) , more people had adverse effects with penicillamine compared with zinc sulfate (15.3% [11/72] versus 2.6% [2/78], p=0.008) . The difference was significant. Wiernicka et al. (2013) found that 39.6% (21/53) of children experienced adverse effects with zinc sulfate over a median 83.3 weeks. All symptoms were of gastrointestinal origin, includ ing abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting . Gastroscop y was performed in 7 children (33.3%, 7/21) who experienced persist ent and severe abdominal pain. They were found to have gastritis with ulcerations or erosion and 4 of the 7 children were switched to penicillamine because their symptoms were not relieved with proton pump inhibitors . Three children were switched to zinc acetat e and their symptoms improved, including 2 who had previously been switched to penicillamine but had adverse effects with that tr eatment . Zinc salts in combination with penicillamine or trientine as initial treatment for people with symptoms of Wilson disease 14 The systematic review by Chen et al. (2015) found an ov erall adverse effect rate of 35.8% with zinc plus a chelating agent. Inter -study analysis found more adverse effects with combination treatment compared with trientine alone (relative risk [RR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 2.69) or zinc salts alone (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.73), but not compared with penicillamine alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.38) . When the effectiveness of combination treatment was analysed according to clinical presentation, there was no statistically significant difference in adverse effects between the groups of people with hepatic and neurological presentations (41.7% versus 26.3% respectively , p=0.84), possibly due to the small sample size. Pooled data suggest combination treatment had a higher mortality or transplant rate than monotherapy (p<0.001), but Chen et al. (2015) consider ed that this result may be subject to bias. A higher mortality or transpl ant rate was seen with penicillamine plus zinc sulfate compared with all other combinations (16.3% vs. 4.7%; RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.54 to 8.00) , which was statistically significant . In the observational study by Chang et al. (2013) , penicillamine was discontinued due to adverse effects in 6/65 people taking penicillamine plus zinc . Abdominal discomfort initially occurred in 6/65 people taking high- dose zinc sulfate, but resolved after 1- 2 mont hs. Zinc salt s taken as maintenance therapy following treatment with a chelating agent In the total population in the study by Brewer et al. (2001) , 11.8% (4/34) of children had mild gastric irritation with z inc acetate, and it had a small but statistically significant adverse effect on the children's high- density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio. Adverse effects were seen in 54.1% (20/37) of peopl e taking zinc acetate in the study by Shimizu et al. (2010) . However, they were mild and did not require discontinuation of treatment . The most frequent adverse effects were gastrointestinal symptoms (such as stomach discomfort, 16.2% [6/37]) and decreased blood iron levels (45.9% [17/37]) . No adverse effects were reported with zinc sulfate alone in the study by Sinha et al (2008) . Summary of product characteristics According to the summary of product characteristics for zinc acetate dihydrate, which is licensed for treating Wilson disease in the UK, t he most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation (in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people) . This is usually worst with the first morning dose and disappears after the first days of treatment. Delaying the first dose to mid- morning or taking the dose with a little protein (which interferes with absorption less than other food groups) usually relieves the symptoms. Elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase are also common, generally occurring after a few weeks of treatment, with l evels usually returning to high- normal within the first 1 -2 years of treatment. Sideroblastic anaemia and leukopenia occur uncommonly with zinc acetate dihydrate (in between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 people) . 6. Discussi on Evidence strengths and limitations 15 It is difficult to undertake clinical trials in rare diseases because of the small number of eligible participants who are spread across a wide geographical area . This is especially true of heterogeneous diseases such as Wilson disease with a broad spectrum of subtypes (for example, different genetic mutations) , clinical presentation (for example, hepatic, neurological, mixed or no symptoms) , disease course and severity. The studies included in this evidence review are of low -quality and have many limitations that affect their application to clinical practice. More evidence from larger, longer -term, higher -quality trials may help to inform zinc's place in therapy . An overview of the quality assessment of each included s tudy can be found in the grade of evidenc e tables . The 2 systematic reviews mainly included uncontrolled observational studies, which have limitations inherent in their non- randomised design, especially around selection bias . The studies did not correct for possible confounders (including demographic factors, environmental factors, duration of disease, comorbi dity, co -medication and dietary compositi on). Most included studies were descriptions of a single centre's experience with 1 particular medicine, which may emphasise the benefit of a specific therapy, with a high probability of observer bias . Also, because healthcare professionals might be more likely to use a tried and tested medicine in more seriously affected cases, zinc salts might be used less often in severely ill people, resulting in selection bias . In both systematic reviews, some subgroups analysed included only small numbers of people, particularly subgroups of people taking zinc, meaning these results may not be robust and comparisons may lack statistical power to detect differences in outc omes . Wiggelinkhuizen et al. (2009) described their methods clearly and discussed the quality of the studies included in their systematic review, but Chen et al. (2015) did not. In Wiggelinkhuizen et al. (2009) , heterogeneity between the included studies was considered likely to exist because of differences in the study populations, treatment pathways and outcome assessments and, although the results give some indication of the comparative efficacy and safety of treatment, statistical analysis of pooled results could not be performed. In the systematic review by Chen et al. (2015) , it is unclear whether the study populations, treatment pathways and outcome assessments were similar between the studies, and no information on heterogeneity is reported; therefore, it is unclear whether the data was suitable to be pooled. The authors do, however, note that there may be bias in some of their interpretations of results due to the lack of substantial data and additional reports on combination treatments . They state that pooled data cannot be considered high -quality evidence for estimating the effectiveness and safety of combination treatments , and that their findings should be used to support treatment decisions only until more, and higher quality , evidence becomes available. The 6 individual studies included in the evidence review were open- label, observational studies , 5 of which were retrospective and 1 was prospective. Retrospective studies lack prospectively defined systematic methods for data collection, treatment initiation, dosing and surveillance for adverse effects. As already noted, observational studies are susceptible to bias, confounding and other methodological problems. The only comparative study was a retrospective analysis , so no randomisation was used and allocation was not concealed ; however, baseline characteristics appeared reasonably well -balanced across the treatments for each of the subgroups analysed. Treatment allocation and out come assessment was not blinded in the studies. Most studies reflect the experience of single centres and some 16 include fewer than 50 people, which limits the available data. Less common adverse effects could have been missed and because these studies were observational, adverse effects may not have been recorded in detail in all cases. Many of the studies included in the evidence review were undertaken in countries where populations, healthcare systems and treatment pathways differ from the UK (for example, Poland, the US, China, Japan and India) and they may not reflect UK practice. Nevertheless, all of the studies in the evidence review were considered to be direct studi es focusing on people with the indication and characteristics of interest , and considering key efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment strategies for Wilson disease vary according to the presenting clinical features. Many of the analyses in the studies considered treatment outcomes according to clinical presentation; however, some analyses combined people with no symptoms, hepatic symptoms, neurological symptoms and both, and are, therefore, difficult to interpret and apply to clinical practice. T he majorit y of patients in the UK are diagnosed and subsequently treated between childhood and middle age. Some of the studies in the evidence review include a broad age range, but others only included children and may not be applicable to people who present with sy mptoms later in adulthood. Wilson disease is a lifelong condition but the studies included in this evidence review have generally been conducted over a relatively short period of time. A person's condition may take several years to deteriorate after stopp ing treatment ( Scheinberg et al. 1987 ) and this should be taken into account when considering the results of studies of maintenance treatment following discontinuation of a chelating agent. In practice, clinical and biochemical markers are used to determine when a person's treatment may be changed to zinc maintenance therapy. S ome of the studies included in this evidence review monitored biochemical parameters when treatment was changed to zinc maintenance therapy ; however, the studies do not provide sufficient information on when or why treatment was switched in the participants to help determine the optimal clinical condition or biochemical levels at which a change from a chelating agent could be considered. Other treatments The EASL g uideline on managing Wilson disease recommends that i nitial tr eatment for people with symptoms of Wilson disease should include a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine). Zinc may have a role as a first -line therapy in people with neurological symptoms, and it is sometimes taken in combination with a chelating agent, or for maintenance treatment of Wilson disease, after a chelating agent. The guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases makes similar treatment recommendations. The EASL guideline recommends that the dose of elemental zinc is 150 mg/day in adults (and 75 mg/day in children who weigh less than 50 kg), administered in 3 divided doses, 30 minutes before meals (see the summary of product characteristics for more information for zinc acetate dihydrate) . The guideline advises that the recommended maintenance dose of penicillamine for adults is usually 750- 1500 mg/day in 2 or 3 divided doses (s ee the summary of product characteristics for more information on dosages licensed in the UK , for example, Distamine 250 mg, which differs slightly from the guidance) and typical dosages of trientine are 900- 2700 mg/day in 2 or 3 divided doses, with 900- 1500 mg/day used for 17 maintenance therapy. A trientine product is currently being evaluated for a license by the European Medicines Agency. Cost s of other treatments The table shows the comparative costs of maintenance dosages for treating adults with Wilson disease for 28 days, using the dosage ranges in the EASL guideline on managing Wilson disease. The doses may differ from those licensed in the UK for some products . The costs are for the medicines only (excluding VAT) and do not include any local procurement discounts or any costs incurred, such as distribution costs.

For comparison, 11, 294 community prescriptions for penicillamine were dispensed in 2016 costing about \u00a31.2 million (net ingredient cost) . Note that many of these prescriptions for penicillamine are likely to have been for treating people with rheumatoid arthritis or other immune disorder s, rather than Wilson disease. Also, 369 community prescriptions for trientine dihydrochloride were dis pensed in 2016, costing over \u00a32 million (net ingredient cost). These data do not include hospital prescriptions. 7. Conclusion Efficacy, safety, cost an d patient factors should be taken into account when considering the likely place in therapy of zinc salts , as well as disease presentation in the individual, its nature and severity . There is a lack of high- quality evidence to estimate the relative treatm ent effects of the available treatments for Wilson disease. The available evidence is of low quality and, although it may be used to guide practice, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Better quality large, prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trials are needed, comparing treatments (particularly trientine, alone and in combination with zinc salts ) for the initial 18 treatment , second- line and maintenance treatment of people with Wilson disease, and in people who cannot tolerate penicillamine. The best available evidence suggests penicillamine or zinc salt monotherapy is effective for treating most people with symptoms of Wilson disease . There appears to be little difference between the treatments , although penicillamine might be preferable to zinc for people with predominantly hepatic symptoms and, because it works faster, for those who are acutely ill. Adverse effects and earl y neurological deterioration appear to be more common with penicillamine than with zinc salts. Therefore, zinc salts may be preferable for people who are less severely ill , when a fast onset of action is not required. No ne of the included studies compared trientine with zinc salts alone for treating people with symptomatic Wilson disease. From the available evidence, a chelat ing agent plus a zinc salt appears to be effective for treating most people with symptoms of Wilson disease . However, analyses suggest that penicillamine, trientine or zinc taken alone are more effective than combination treatment , and more people taking combination treatment experience adverse effects. No firm conclusions can be drawn; however, the results of the studies suggest that combination treatment should be considered only after monotherapy has failed to manage symptom s, and people should be carefully monitored for adverse effects. Studies also suggest that zinc salts alone are effective as maintenance treatment for Wilson disease in people who have previously taken zinc salts in combination with penicillamine or trientine. No evidence was included looking specifically at people who could not tolerate penicillamine . More information on the best available evidence for trientine for treating Wilson disease is available in a separate evidence review. Adverse effects of zinc salts are generally mild gastrointestinal adverse effects , which resolve as treatment continues. A dverse effects of zinc sulfate may sometimes be severe in children, who should be caref ully monitored. The studies included in the evidence review generally used zinc sulfate or zinc acetate. It is unclear whether 1 of these salts is more effective than the other. However, zinc acetate may be better tolerated than zinc sulfate. In the UK, zinc acetate dihydrate is the only zinc salt licensed for treatment of Wilson disease. Although the license does not preclude its use, t he summary of product characteristics (SPC) states that it is not recommended for the initial treatment of people with symptoms of Wilson disease because of its slow onset of action. The optimal dosage of zinc salts is also unclear from the studies, but t he SPC for zinc acetate dihydrate lists dosages for the licensed indications. The dosage is generally adjusted according to therapeutic monitoring, including plasma free copper and urinary excretion of copper . At about \u00a380 per 28 days for maintenance treatment, the cost of zinc acetate is less than that of other t reatments for Wilson disease. For comparison, the cost of penicillamine ranges from about \u00a3130 to \u00a3270 and the cost of trientine ranges from about \u00a32,600 to 19 \u00a34,300 per 28 days for maintenance treatment (excluding VAT, local procurement discounts and any costs incurred). Zinc must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2- 3 hours after meals. Penicillamine should also be taken on an empty stomach. Zinc is chelated by trientine and penicillamine and, therefore, cannot be taken at the same time of day. The r estricted timing of multiple daily doses of treatments for Wilson disease mean it is unsurprising that compliance is reportedly poor ( Ala et al. 2015 ). 20 8.

It primarily included uncontrolled obs ervational s tudies , but randomis ed controlled trials (RCTs ) are often not feas ible for rare dis eas es . All relevant s tudies appear to have been included, apart from s tudies not fully publis hed or not in 21 Zinc versus chelating agents as monotherapy for initial treatment of W ilson disease Study Design Population characteristics Interv ention Outcome measure type Outcome measures Results Quality of Evidence Score Applicability Englis h, French or German. Key outcomes have been cons idered, and the res ults are applicable to the population being cons ider ed in this evidence review. The authors of the s ys tematic review dis cus s ed the quality of the included s tudies , noting that m os t had an obs ervational des ign with a profound ris k of confounding . The included s tudies did not correct for pos s ible confounders (including demographic factors , environmental factors , duration of dis eas e, comorbidity, co-medication and dietary compos ition); therefore, mos t had a poor s core for validit y. Mos t included s tudies were des criptions of a s ingle centre's experience with 1 particular medicine, which the authors of the s ys temati c review noted is lik ely to emphas ise the benefit of a s pecific therapy, with a high probability of obs erver bias . Als o, becaus e healthcare profes s ionals might be more lik ely to us e a tried and tes ted medicine in more s erious ly affected cas es , zinc sa l ts might be us ed l e ss often in s everely ill people , res ulting in s election bias . Due to differences in the s tudy populations , treatment pathways and outcome as s es s ments , heterogeneity between the included s tudies was cons idered lik ely to exis t. Although the r es ults give s ome indication of the comparative efficacy and s afety of treatment, s tatis tical analys is of pooled res ults could not be performed becaus e of heterogeneity between the s tudies . Zinc recommended within its mark eting authoris ation for maintena nce therapy for Wils on dis eas e; therefore it has not us ually been us ed as initial therapy, unlik e penicillamine . The numbers of people tak ing zinc to treat s ymptoms is s mall. No s tudies of trientine or tetrathiomolybdate therapy were included becaus e no relatively large s tudies cons idering the efficacy of initial monotherapy with thes e agents were found. The authors concluded that zinc therapy appears to be the bes t choic e for pres ymptomatic people with Wils on dis eas e becaus e it is effective and has negligible advers e effects . Convers ely, penicillamine might be better for acutely ill people with hepatic s ymptoms , becaus e zinc might work too s lowly for thes e people. In the low number of people with neurological s ymptoms treated with zinc, they concluded that zinc appears to be a better choice than penicillamine becaus e s evere s ide effects and initial deterioration were s een s ignificantly les s often with zinc s alts compared with penicillamine. The authors s tated that b oth trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have not been s tudied widely enough to mak e a proper judgement about the us e of thes e agents in the initial treatment of Wils on dis eas e.

Which outcomes should be considered? Examples include intermediate or short -term outcomes; mortality; morbidity and quality of life; treatment complications; adverse effects; rates of relapse; late morbidity and re- admission Critical to decision -making: zinc salts as an alternative to trientine and penicillamine Treatment failure as evidenced by clinical or biochemical deterioration, death, liver transplantation, or treatment withdrawal because of adverse effects of medication. Important to decision- making: Drug toxicity 38 Copper deficiency Clinical and cost -effectiveness Assumptions / limits applied to search Wilson disease is a rare disorder so it is important to consider all reports irrespective of study design, sample size, or date of publication (some p apers are prior to 1990).
