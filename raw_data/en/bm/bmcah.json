VAPP Vaccine Associated Paralytic Polio VDPV Vaccine Derived Poliovirus VVM Vaccine Vial Monitor WHO World Health Organization WPV Wild PoliovirusPreventing and responding to sexual Exploitation, AbuseEnvironmental Surveillance and Immunization1 OVERVIEW I 1 I BACKGROUND In May 2014, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the international spread of wild poliovirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, following international spread of WPV1 in Africa and Asia In 2021, a WPV-1 confirmed case was reported from Malawi in the African Region, genetically linked to WPV-1 transmission in Pakistan This highlights the ongoing risk of WPV-1 international spread until the goal of polio eradication is achieved and that countries should be prepared to respond Global eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 was certified in 2015 as was the global eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 in 2019 The WHO African Region was certified free from WPV1 in 2020 Detection of any wild poliovirus outside a laboratory or vaccine plant should be considered as a public health emergency Since the withdrawal of OPV2 from routine immunization in 2016, there has been a global increase in vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) related to the global fall in population intestinal mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses in children born after April 2016 Increasingly the circulation of VDPV2 has affected more and more countries, with international spread now occurring regularly This situation has led to the maintenance of the polio Public Health Emergency of International Concern PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of these standard operating procedures (SOPs) is to offer guidance to any country that detects any type of poliovirus outbreak or event, to respond in a timely and effective manner, with the specific objective to stop polio outbreaks within 120 days (four months) This guide is aimed at national governments and public health decision-makers who coordinate responses to poliovirus events and outbreaks, and their global, regional and country-level partners This version of the SOPs builds on the prior versions developed since 2015 and takes into account the key developments, lessons learnt and availability of new tools since the publishing of the last version in March 2020 The development of these SOPs relies on available scientific evidence and expert consensus, while remaining grounded in operational realities and the context of waning global immunity to type 2 poliovirus Critical aspects of the SOPs result from broad consultation with expert advisory groups, including the WHO, Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization, and endorsement by the GPEI's relevant technical and management groups These SOPs establish response standards and timelines for response to WPV spread to a non-endemic country, or when VDPV events and/or outbreaks of any type 1. OVERVIEWI 2 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK (VDPV1, VDPV2 or VDPV3) are detected in any context, whether a new emergence or previously undetected circulating vaccine- derived poliovirus (cVDPV) These SOPs do not include response to WPV1 due to local transmission in an endemic context, field-level operational guidance or tools for planning high- quality supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), or detailed methods for enhanced surveillance WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION In this version of the SOPs, the section on key definitions has been updated to include the novel oral polio vaccine virus type 2, genetic linkages and orphan viruses This version of the SOPs provides updated guidance on the rapid response round (sometimes also referred to, as 'round zero') It is recommended to implement the rapid response round within 14 days of the outbreak notification (Day 0) targeting the immediate area of the virus isolation; if it cannot be commenced within this time frame, the programme should consider proceeding directly to SIA1 Guidance has also been updated on the proposed target population of the response vaccination rounds, depending on the risk of spread in varying epidemiological situations This is based on the available data and modelling for VDPV2 which shows that significant delays in notification of outbreaks and implementing vaccination response necessitate larger scoped vaccination rounds to stop the transmission The definition of breakthrough transmission has been included: any WPV or cVDPV detected in an AFP case, healthy child or environmental sample with the date of onset of paralysis (for AFP cases) or the date of sample collection (for healthy child or environmental sample) more than 21 days after the first day of the last SIA in an area where at least two SIAs have been implemented is evidence of breakthrough transmission The SOPs do provide flexibility in high-risk scenarios, when a shorter threshold (14 days rather than 21) may be considered to decide upon breakthrough transmission In line with the new GPEI strategy (2022-2026), this version recommends making routine immunization coverage improvement an essential component of the overall outbreak response planning and implementation processes There is emphasis on dedicating a section of the plan to improving routine immunization coverage as part of the EOCs (or similar coordination platforms) remit, led by the national EPI programmes and adequately supported by the immunization partners, including GAVI Guidance on vaccine choices for responding to type-2 poliovirus outbreaks or high-risk events has 1 OVERVIEW I 3 I been updated, as the polio programme undergoes a transition away from Sabin OPV2 to the novel OPV2, as per the recommendations of the SAGE The countries facing cVDPV2 outbreaks should prioritize rapid, high-quality outbreak response with whichever oral polio vaccine is available to them, without any delay The SOPs provide general guidance on continued adaptation to the ever evolving COVID-19 Pandemic After dealing with the emergency phase of the pandemic, it is important that the GPEI continues close coordination with national and local COVID-19 response management mechanisms while planning and implementing the polio SIAs, with special focus on putting in place infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, community mobilization and mitigation to rumors and misinformation, in order to achieve uniformly high quality vaccination coverage This version of SOPs aligns the guidance on IPV use with the recommendations of the SAGE Considering that IPV provides a high-level of individual immunity and protection against paralysis but not the intestinal mucosal immunity sufficient to stop person to person transmission of polioviruses, IPV should not be used for outbreak response Moreover, IPV campaigns are unlikely to reach children not reached with OPV campaigns The priority of outbreak response is to stop transmission, therefore primary focus should be on achieving high coverage with OPV However, concurrent concerted efforts should be made to improve the IPV coverage through enhanced EPI activities as IPV can boost mucosal immunity in populations with prior OPV vaccination This version also touches upon the release mechanism for novel OPV2 and its further management, in line with other detailed documents available on this subject Like monovalent Sabin OPV2, the release of novel OPV2 from the global OPV stockpile requires approval of the WHO Director-General, upon the recommendation of the Outbreak Response and Preparedness Group (ORPG) The ORPG review process for requests for novel OPV2 will be carried out in close coordination with the Rapid Response Teams (RRT)/ Incident Management Support Team (IMST), WHO and UNICEF regional offices as well as the national programmes In the surveillance section, the target for non-polio AFP rate and performing healthy children stool sampling have been further clarified Following the outbreak notification or identification of an event in a high-risk area, the programme will target an annualized rate of greater than three non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children, younger than 15 years of age, in outbreak- affected and high-risk areas At the national level, a rate of two non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children is expected in outbreak countries While districts with fewer than 50 000 children under 15 years of age may not detect I 4 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK AFP every year, the quality of AFP surveillance should be checked for all districts that did not report any AFP case, regardless of population size If there is already evidence of community- wide transmission, targeted healthy children stool samplings need not be conducted This version of the SOPs considers the revised structure of the GPEI in line with the new Strategy (2022-2026), to support the county polio programmes The key revisions include the formation of Rapid Response Team (RRT) in the African Region, Incident Management Support Team (IMST) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and Outbreak Response and Preparedness Group (ORPG) and Surveillance Group (SG) at the global level In this document, RRT, IMST and other regional outbreak response mechanisms/bodies are referred to as Regional polio response teams In line with the GPEI strategy, chapters on gender mainstreaming and Prevention and Response to Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment (PRSEAH) have been included Moreover, gender related aspects have been included in all the components of outbreak response RELATED GUIDANCE Classification of VDPVs is comprehensively set

PROMISE Given the programmatic and epidemiological challenges, the GPEI has re-envisioned the endgame pathway with focus on collective ownership and accountability along with governments, communities and other stakeholders The Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 comprises of a wide-ranging set of actions to position the GPEI for delivering on a promise that brought the world together in a collective commitment to eradicate polio These actions target strengthening and empowering the GPEI to address challenges head-on and achieve and sustain a polio-free world Goal One of the new Polio Eradication Strategy sets a pathway towards permanently interrupting transmission of all polioviruses in Afghanistan and Pakistan; while Goal Two outlines strategies and tactics to put the GPEI and impacted countries on an emergency footing to stop cVDPV2 transmission The Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 sets aggressive benchmarks to measure progress towards eradication in order to interrupt the endemic transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan and stop all cVDPV2 outbreaks by the end of 2023, allowing for certification of global eradication of all wild polioviruses and validation of absence of cVDPV2 in 2026Achieving the last milestones for WPV1 certification and cVDPV2 interruption will launch the Post-Certification Strategy (PCS), for which steps have been initiated toward long-term integrated polio surveillance, response capacity, essential immunization strengthening and containment The GPEI plans to achieve Goal Two of the strategy by functionalizing an emergency management structure with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, developing and implementing a comprehensive accountability framework, increasing government ownership though political advocacy, and strengthening regional and country capacities for sensitive surveillance and rapid, high-quality response Innovative tools and methods, as well as new partnerships, will be pursued to strengthen outbreak response operations The new Polio Eradication Strategy also commits to an integrated approach to programme implementation that enables countries to leverage existing polio programme assets and serve the health needs of vulnerable communities The strategy defines integration as joint efforts between the polio eradication programme and a range of partners with the objective of improving immunization outcomes in targeted geographies The two principal means for integration mentioned in the strategy include strengthened collaboration with other immunization programmes and context-appropriate strategies for delivering vaccines alongside primary health care and other servicesI 6 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK PHASE I PHASE II

POLIOVIRUS EVENTS & OUTBREAKSI 8 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK at WHO HQ and the WHO Regional Office Isolates may be from persons with no known immunodeficiency or from an environmental sample, without evidence of circulation Genetic linkage: Genetic relationship between or among poliovirus sequences that suggests a common origin or emergence Orphan viruses: Viruses with less than or equal to 985% VP1 identity from the closest match in the sequence database at that time Finding these viruses usually indicates that the virus has been circulating for some time without being detected by either AFP or environmental surveillance DEFINITION OF POLIO OUTBREAKS AND EVENTS IN THIS VERSION OF THE SOPS Detection of WPV or VDPV (excluding iVDPV) in a previously unaffected area can be classified according to the pattern of detection and spread 1 An Outbreak: detection of WPV or cVDPV with community level transmission as demonstrated by: a detection in a human, UNLESS there is a travel history to an infected area within 35 days before onset of paralysis OR a confirmed type specific virus exposure in a laboratory or vaccine production facility; 1. The probability of a case being travel associated is the highest at 7-10 days, and decreases thereafter, minimal after 35 days ( https://www whoint/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/vaccine-standardization/ poliomyelitis ) 2. after adequate sampling of sufficient number of healthy children in the same community and sampling of environmental sites in the area but not in the sewage catchment of the case 3. isolates show no or minor genetic variation consistent with excretion by a single human being.b two separate detections from the environment, where separate means the samples were collected from two different sites with no overlapping catchment areas OR from the same site but at least two months apart; c any newly detected cVDPV, whether in a human or environmental sample; ie when a VDPV isolated either in human stool or the environment can immediately be genetically linked to another VDPV thereby confirming circulation in the areas of detection 2 An Importation Event: detection of WPV or cVDPV importation but no evidence of community transmission: a Detection of WPV or known cVDPV in an AFP case or asymptomatic person with a travel history to an infected area within the 35 1 days before onset of illness b One single environmental detection of WPV or a known cVDPV in a new infected territory (or country); with no evidence of local community transmission found 2 c Multiple environmental detections of WPV or a known cVDPV from one site over less than two months but no evidence of ongoing viral replication (isolates are genetically identical or nearly identical 3)1 OVERVIEW I 9 I 3 A New Emergence Event: New VDPV emergence a Detection of a newly identified VDPV in a single AFP case or asymptomatic person (such as a household contact) with no evidence of community transmission found2, including from genetic sequencing (not genetically linked to another known VDPV) identified VDPVs from a single environmental sampling site within a two-month period but no virological evidence of multiple excreters (ie the genetic sequences are identical or nearly identical3) 4 Facility associated WPV or VDPV event: Detection of WPV or VDPV in a person with suspected or documented type- specific virus exposure in a laboratory or vaccine production facility, or in the environment samples collected in the vicinity of such a facility 5 Vaccine Event a A case of vaccine associated paralytic polio (VAPP) very rarely caused by Sabin and Sabin-like polioviruses typically in the newborn, which is a clinical event rather than a public health event b Detection of a type 2 vaccine virus in an area where type-2 containing polio vaccine has not been used in the four months prior to detection -OR- detection of type 1 or type 3 vaccine virus in an area where polio vaccine has not been used for routine immunization (countries with only IPV in their routine childhood vaccination schedules) or SIAs in the four months prior to detection An uninfected area is defined as an administrative division of a country in which there has been no transmission of the specific poliovirus in the previous 12 months (as determined by the date of onset of paralysis for AFP cases or date of collection for other human or environmental samples) Typically, the uninfected area is either the whole country (in case of small countries eg population <2 million) or first sub-national administrative unit such as a state or province (in case of moderately populous countries eg population >2 million), but may also be a second sub-national area such as a district or prefecture or metropolitan area (for large countries with populations >10 million) Events do not require a vaccination response unless those are high risk Events 2b, 2c and 3a due to type 2 poliovirus are considered high risk, as is 3b if additional risk factors are present (details in section 6) b Multiple detections of newlyI 10 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK 1 OVERVIEW I 11 I DETECTION Samples collected from human or environment sources during routine surveillance or an event or outbreak investigation are sent to a laboratory of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) to determine the presence of poliovirus The virus is identified through culture, intra-typic differentiation and genetic sequencing Direct poliovirus detection is being rolled out in 2022 NOTIFICATION As soon as poliovirus is identified, the GPLN will inform the health authorities of the affected country and WHO at the country, regional and headquarters levels Under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) 4, all notifiable polioviruses (see Box 2) must also be immediately reported by national authorities to the IHR focal point at the respective WHO regional office WHO headquarters will inform GPEI partners when this information is received and validated Additional details, including any genetic links to other polioviruses, will be shared by the GPLN and WHO headquarters as soon as available Notification to WHO may lead to publication of a disease outbreak news report on the WHO website, as appropriate, based on virus type, risk assessment and outbreak status 4. See \"International Health Regulations\" (2005), third response monitoring For response performance monitoring, a \"Day 0\" is defined so that progress of all response actions can be monitored against the standards set in these SOPs Day 0 is the day of receipt of laboratory confirmation of WPV or VDPV by genetic sequencing at WHO headquarters or relevant WHO Regional Office and is considered as the \"outbreak notification day\" All timelines mentioned in these SOPs are counted from \"Day 0\" unless specified All poliovirus events should trigger the following responses: Public health investigation of cases and their contacts, and their local communities In case of a positive environmental sample, the investigation should focus on the catchment area and population being sampled by the environmental surveillance site; Risk assessment based on the results of the public health investigation; Surveillance enhancement; and Strategic advocacy and risk communication For all outbreaks and some high-risk events (deemed to require a vaccination response), Day 0 remains the same for the purpose of operational response monitoring, even if new information confirming transmission becomes available at a later stage3. DETECTION, NOTIFICATION & INVESTIGATIONI 12 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK In case of a low-risk event without vaccination response, genetic sequencing information for new isolates may subsequently retrospectively confirm transmission In this case, consideration may be given by GPEI to adjust Day 0 to the date of receipt of the new sequencing information that necessitated the vaccination responseINVESTIGATION The country must investigate any poliovirus isolate notifiable under IHR, from any human or environmental sources The GPEI will support the country as needed Under IHR, notification is required for all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern For polio, this includes detection in human or non- human sources of: WPV, and Sabin / Sabin-like type 2 viruses, from the areas where Sabin OPV2 has not been used in the previous four months (Sabin / Sabin-like viruses types 1 and 3 are not notifiable) The national IHR focal point must notify WHO within 24 hours the IHR contact person at the respective WHO regional office of all notifiable polioviruses, without waiting for final classificationBox 2: International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) and the obligation to notify Local health authorities should initiate the investigation within 24 hours of a poliovirus isolate report The most effective approach is a joint epidemiological and social investigation with support from the national level of any case and affected community, as well as the gathering of relevant national data A detailed case investigation may also be carried out for a clustering of compatibles (two cases in either a single district or two neighbouring districts in four weeks) and in some cases, a \"hot\" AFP case 5 in advance of laboratory confirmation Information from the GPLN and the 5. A \"hot\" AFP case is a case that meet at least 3 of the following criteria or the criteria as defined by the Country or Region: less than five years of age; fewer than three doses of OPV or have an unknown OPV status; 3) rapid progression of paralysis; 4) asymmetrical paralysis; 5) fever at onset.

RISK ASSESSMENT INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT Isolation of a poliovirus in a previously non-infected area represents an event or outbreak that requires national authorities to complete an immediate risk assessment to inform the type and scale of response The purpose of the risk assessment is to review virologic and epidemiologic characteristics of the newly detected virus, event or outbreak and determine the level of risk for further local or international spread as high, medium or low The risk assessment is presented by national authorities/country polio eradication team to Regional polio response teams and ORPG within 72 hours of receipt of a genetic sequencing result, or outbreak confirmation The assessment reviews critical factors as well as information from the field investigation that will influence the type and scale of response and allows GPEI to recommend appropriate actions A risk assessment addresses three risk elements: virologic, contextual, and risk of international transmission (see Table 2) Virologic Risk Based on experience since the international spread of polio was declared a PHEIC, compared to the other two polio types, cVDPV2 outbreaks are the highest risk 11. Presentation: GPEI Cessation Risk Task Team (CRTT) modelling groups (2021, April 16), quarterly meeting of the GPEI CRTT (virtual by MS Teams)for becoming persistent, spreading internationally and failing to be under control within 120 days This is due to the absence of population intestinal mucosal immunity in many countries and many age groups and the greater propensity of Sabin type 2 to revert to VDPV2 Similarly, a WPV2 outbreak due to a containment breach would be very high risk particularly in areas with poor sanitation and low IPV coverage By definition, two genetically linked VDPVs are required to classify the virus as circulating, so the first virus detected may initially be classified as an aVDPV However, currently a single new VDPV2 detection may also signal high risk of further transmission and cVDPV2 outbreak, depending upon the local context The risk is higher if the VDPV2 isolation occurs in a previously uninfected area with no type-2 vaccination in the last six months; moreover, the higher the genetic divergence from Sabin type 2, the higher is the risk of the outbreak Conversely, a new VDPV2 with fewer nucleotide changes in an area with recent Sabin OPV2 use is a much lesser risk of circulation A recent data analysis 11 indicates that almost 90% of the VDPV2 detected in AFP cases since the tOPV - bOPV switch (2016), went on to circulate and classified later as cVDPV2 This proportion increased to 97% if the VDPV detection was more than six months I 20 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK after the last use of type 2 OPV Among the VDPVs detected through environmental surveillance, 40% were later shown to be circulating and this increased to 89% if the detection was more than six months from the last use of type 2 OPV Isolation of new VDPV in areas with known inaccessibility for vaccination and sub-optimal surveillance also represents high risk of further transmission, geographical spread and undetected local transmission The overall risk of emergence and transmission of VDPV1 and VDPV3 is much less than for type 2 and is primarily related to bOPV immunization coverage Since 2016, outbreaks due to cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 have been mostly small and localized However, international spread of VDPV1 was detected between Malaysia and the Philippines in 2019 WPV1, the last wild poliovirus to be eradicated, is also a high-risk virus and capable of long- distance spread However, given the higher population intestinal immunity due to bOPV use in routine immunization and SIAs, the risk is related directly to immunization coverage in the affected populations WPV3 infection as a result of a containment breach would present a similar risk All type 2 virus isolations require special attention when conducting a risk assessment and determining the type and scale of response Following the global withdrawal of type 2 containing OPV from routine immunization programmes in April and May of 2016, there is increasing risk of very rapid virus spread associated with declining mucosal immunity in children All type 2 poliovirus (VDPV2 or WPV2) detections require consultation with Regional polio response teams and will be considered by the Sabin OPV2 Advisory Group/ORPG nOPV2 Release Group, to review the risk assessment and assess the need for a potential vaccination response with a type 2 oral polio vaccine A detection of type 2 Sabin or Sabin-like virus in an area where Sabin OPV2 has not been used in the previous four months is notifiable under IHR Such a finding may reflect ongoing and/or unauthorized use of tOPV or monovalent Sabin OPV2, as children vaccinated with OPV continue to shed Sabin virus for approximately three months For this reason, detection of type 2 Sabin or Sabin-like virus from any source four months or more after last Sabin OPV2 use requires an investigation, risk assessment and IHR notification to WHO Initial risk assessment and investigation should also be initiated for a poliovirus type 2 isolate pending for genetic sequencing (PV2) in the laboratory, from an area that did not implement any OPV2 rounds in the last six months, especially if other epidemiological risk factors also exist If novel OPV2 virus is detected (in human or environment) in an area that has never implemented a vaccination round using novel OPV2 or implemented any such rounds more than four months before the novel OPV2 virus isolation, an investigation and risk assessment should be initiated to determine the source The country programme should immediately share the findings with the Regional polio response teams and the Outbreak Response and ORPG 4 RISK ASSESSMENT I 21 I Contextual risk A detailed summary of elements to help countries prepare a robust risk assessment is provided, along with additional resources and tools (see Annex 1: Risk assessment overview for detailed guidance) but should include: detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis and mapping of population movement (eg trade, migration, displacement, and travel and migration routes such as roads, lakes and rivers); quantification of special high-risk or hard-to-reach populations (eg geographic or cultural inaccessibility, areas of insecurity, vaccine refusals and sentinel events); modelling of population immunity to relevant outbreak/event poliovirus type(s); detailed assessment of all surveillance indicators at subnational level; mapping with geographic information system (GIS), with emphasis on high-risk populations, urban areas, border areas and regions difficult to access for any reason Entities such as the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the WHO Health Emergencies Programme can provide critical information on population migration and insecurity Risk of International Spread The risk of international spread is to be considered in conjunction with the virologic and contextual risk, especially if the area affected by outbreak or high- risk event is bordering another country or has demographic links to other areas across the international borders (eg significant cross-border population mobility, international travel routes etc) In such situations, it is important to initiate necessary cross-border coordination on development and implementation of joint and complementing response plans with feasible synchronization of activities Table 2: Elements to assess risk for further poliovirus transmission that will guide response planning Risk element Sample of risk factors considered (not exhaustive) Virologic risk1 and nature of nucleotide changes, and expert interpretation by virologists, etc Contextual risk Recent poliovirus detection or other sentinel events, sensitivity of AFP surveillance system, high population density, low immunization coverage and population immunity, geographic access, conflict, inaccessible or hard-to-reach populations, and population movements, etc Risk of international transmission Border area with high population mobility, nomadic or refugee populations, cross- border conflict, and international travel routes, etc 1 Virologic risk is considered high for any WPV or cVDPV High degree of genetic deviation from parent vaccine virus, numberI 22 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK INCLUDING SENTINEL EVENTS IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT A sentinel event is information or an occurrence of any nature, related or unrelated to polio, which suggests that the community or general geographic area may be at risk for a polio outbreak Sentinel events can include: Appearance of vaccine-preventable disease (eg measles, diphtheria, and/ or VDPV of any type) that suggests low routine immunization performance in general (eg measles) or Appearance of a disease with the similar mode of person-to-person transmission as polio; Rapid displacement or ongoing movement of under-immunized communities; Detection of type 2 polio vaccine virus from a biological or environmental source in the absence of OPV2 use; Finding vials of tOPV, monovalent Sabin OPV2 or novel OPV2 in the community Communities or administrative areas with sentinel events should be included in the investigation and risk assessment ONGOING RISK ASSESSMENT Following initial investigation and risk assessment, national authorities must continue to collect detailed information to update the situation analysis and risk assessment (ie results from laboratory investigations, detailed information on affected communities, etc) 4 RISK ASSESSMENT I 23 I The scope of response to a detected event or outbreak will be determined by the type and classification of the poliovirus and the risk assessment The key to a successful response and interrupting transmission lies in adapting strategies as the situation evolves, over the course of the investigation and response MINIMUM RESPONSE STANDARDS FOR POLIOVIRUS EVENTS AND OUTBREAKS Notification of a new poliovirus, or the spread of poliovirus to a new geographic area or population, requires national authorities and GPEI partners to be strongly engaged and rapidly initiate the following elements: 1 Immediate declaration of the outbreak/ high risk event as an emergency by the national government This serves a very important trigger for all the subsequent steps and helps ensuring a fully committed 'all of government' approach The highest GPEI strategic leadership (Strategy Committee) as well as the Regional Directors of the concerned WHO and UNICEF regions will also coordinate on providing necessary enabling support and advocacy for a timely and effective outbreak response 2 Detailed investigation and risk assessment Details on investigation and risk assessment have been discussed in chapters 3 and 4 3 Enhanced surveillance to increase sensitivity and confidence that any ongoing person-to-person transmission of poliovirus will be rapidly detected (see investigation in chapters 5 and 8) 4 Planning for a vaccination response Robust coordination, planning, budgeting, community engagement, and monitoring are enabling functions central to successful response Risk communication and social mobilization efforts should be tailored to the event or outbreak context and support surveillance enhancement, vaccination response activities and routine immunization For all polio emergency responses, it is necessary to monitor and report all interventions and enhancements for surveillance, vaccination and communication 5 Scope of vaccination The scope of vaccination campaigns will vary according to the risk assessment All polio emergencies with local transmission, whether VDPV or WPV, should preferably have a vaccination response with an appropriate type specific OPV within 14 days of laboratory notification (more details in the section on vaccination response) In some circumstances, a polio emergency without proven local transmission may warrant vaccination response, based on the risk assessment Isolation of an iVDPV requires careful assessment to ensure that all household members and close community contacts are immunized with IPV Larger-scale SIAs are not required unless circulation in the community is established 5. RESPONSE STANDARDS - OVERVIEWI 24 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK An iVDPV carrier should receive appropriate therapy for their underlying immune deficiency syndrome and be offered optimal anti-poliovirus treatment where available 6 Defining and planning high-quality outbreak response A comprehensive outbreak response should be able to stop the polio outbreak within 120 days of notification, and includes investigation, surveillance and vaccination, all supported by communication and social mobilization activities, including cross-border coordination between countries Coordinated and high-quality activities will ensure confidence in the country's ability to detect rapidly any poliovirus circulation and to interrupt transmission through vaccination For surveillance, it is necessary to monitor carefully both process (eg AFP reporting rates, laboratory performance) and outcomes (eg early detection of virus through all surveillance strategies in high-risk special populations) OUTBREAK GRADING All polio outbreaks and in some instances, high-risk events, should be graded by the relevant WHO Regional Office as per the Health Emergency Response Framework 12 Grading is a procedure that triggers outbreak response policies in WHO and the affected country or countries The grading will indicate risk level and determine actions needed to manage the poliovirus event or outbreak in the country context See Chapter 9 for outbreak response scale-up and detailed information on GPEI support according to grading 12. See \"Emergency Response ( int/publications/i/ item/9789241512299, 28, Nov. 2021)The purpose of the grading is to: inform all partners of the nature of the event or outbreak, the response required and the need for mobilization of internal and external resources; activate GPEI response mechanisms; and prompt local government and GPEI partners at all levels to mobilize resources for support, including immediate human resources Ideally, the outbreak should be graded within the first three days of outbreak detection (day 0) Grade 1 is assigned to outbreaks that can be managed in- country, and grade 2 to those that require substantial Regional support and/or technical support from WHO Headquarters Grade 3 emergencies are global in extent or involve multiple regions A grade is valid for three to six months, through the first phase of outbreak response, and should be reviewed with new information and/or as response activities progress The criteria used to grade outbreaks include: 1) the potential for transmission within the country and beyond national borders based on the risk assessment (virologic, contextual, risk of international spread); and 2) the strength of the country's ability to respond to and contain the outbreak, including vaccine management capacity Depending on circumstances, the risk assessment may include discussion of the urgency and complexity of the event and the reputational risk it may generate Country capacity is a subjective assessment based on health infrastructure and current security or access challenges Figure 1 presents a general risk matrix for grading an event or outbreak 4 RISK ASSESSMENT I 25 I STANDARD TIMELINES FOR OUTBREAK RESPONSE Table 3 outlines key actions and timelines for event and outbreak response (see Annex 2 for a detailed list from Day 0 to close of outbreak) It is essential to rapidly establish coordination mechanisms between countries and GPEI partners at all levels, including RRT/IMST, WHO and UNICEF Regional offices as well as the OPRG This may include multilevel calls with sub-regional outbreak coordination offices, regional offices and global partners Following initial consultation, operations are supported by the relevant GPEI Outbreak Response and Preparedness Group to manage coordination with all partners Country capacity to respond Risk of local or international transmissionStrong Moderate Weak Low Grade 1 Grade 1 Grade 2 Medium Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 High Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 3Figure 1: General risk matrix for grading an event or outbreak Timeline Response actions for all isolates Within 24 hoursInitiate investigation Country and each partner agency to initiate internal consultations Country to notify WHO through IHR Within 48 hours Initiate partner coordination via ORPG Within 72 hoursRisk assessment and grading vaccine request to Sabin OPV2 Advisory Group/ORPG-nOPV2 release group (if applicable) Initiate development of response plan (surveillance, vaccination, social mobilization) GPEI to coordinate and deploy a rapid response team, as required Within 7 days National Government to declare the outbreak as National Public Health Emergency Within 14 days Rapid response round If not implemented within 14 days, move to SIA Within 56 days Assess immunization quality: Independent monitoring LQAS Outbreak response assessments (OBRAs) 2 Follow-up quarterly assessments and desk reviews during the course of the outbreak 3 Final assessment after at least six months without poliovirus detection 4 Further desk reviews/OBRAs in prolonged outbreaks, as appropriateTable 3: Major steps and timelines for critical components of event and outbreak response within 21days of the end of second large scale round) 1 First assessment within three to four months of the outbreak notificationFirst large-scale and second large-scale rounds (mop-up to be preferably implemented(since Day 0, unless specified) 1 Independent monitoring and LQAS results to be shared with Regional polio response teams and ORPG within 14 days of the end of each campaignI 26 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK 6 VACCINATION RESPONSE I 27 I The primary objective of vaccination response is to rapidly interrupt person- to-person transmission of poliovirus and hence protect the vulnerable population Both the timing and the quality of the vaccination response are critically important To accomplish virus interruption, a prompt vaccination response is required in a sufficiently large population and geographic scope High-quality vaccination will protect individuals from poliovirus infection and prevent future outbreaks if importation occurs The oral polio vaccine appropriate to the poliovirus strain induces intestinal mucosal immunity and remains the vaccine of choice to interrupt transmission rapidly and stop polio outbreaks The most appropriate vaccine is selected with technical support from WHO and GPEI partners ORAL POLIO VACCINE (OPV) FOR OUTBREAK RESPONSE Oral polio vaccine is the primary vaccination tool used in the fight to eradicate polio There are different types of oral poliovirus vaccine, that may contain one or a combination of two or all three types of attenuated poliovirus Vaccination with OPV enables individuals to mount an immune response against the poliovirus All countries which have eradicated polio used OPV to interrupt person to person transmission of the virus 13 13. https://polioeradicationorg/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-vaccines/opv/Sabin monovalent OPV2 Since the withdrawal of type 2 containing OPV from routine immunization in 2016, vaccination response to cVDPV2 outbreaks could be implemented only using Sabin- based monovalent OPV type 2 under the authorization of the Director General of WHO Sabin monovalent OPV2 while effective in halting transmission, has a risk of reversion to neurovirulence and hence seeding new outbreaks in the areas with low vaccination campaigns coverage Trivalent OPV In 2020, use of trivalent OPV was initiated under the authorization of the Director General of WHO, to respond to concurrent outbreaks of cVDPV2 and either of cVDPV1, cVDPV3 or WPV1 Trivalent OPV is currently the vaccine of choice to respond to co- circulation of type-2 poliovirus and other types of poliovirus Novel OPV2 After receiving Emergency Use Listing (EUL) approval in November 2020, the first outbreak vaccination response with novel OPV2 was implemented in March 2021 SAGE has endorsed a prioritization framework for type 2 vaccines for cVDPV2 outbreak response with clear distinct phases [Phase A: Pre-EUL recommendation, preparing for novel OPV2 use; novel OPV2 use under interim EUL recommendation; Phase C: Wider use of novel OPV2 under interim EUL recommendation; Phase D: novel OPV2 6. VACCINATION RESPONSEI 28 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK licensed and pre-qualified] The novel OPV2 was used in its 'initial use period' under the EUL from March to September 2021 In October 2021, the SAGE endorsed the transition of novel OPV2 to its next use phase, based on several factors, including the independent review of safety data from campaigns held in Nigeria, Liberia, Benin and Congo Collectively, these countries used over 65 million doses of novel OPV2 during the 'initial use period' With the transition from its initial to wider use period, novel OPV2 will be more accessible for outbreak response when supply allows It is important to mention that the novel OPV2 will be used under EUL until 2023 and all countries planning to use novel OPV2 need to meet additional readiness requirements prior to the release of the vaccine As per recommendation of the SAGE, countries facing cVDPV2 outbreaks should avoid delay and prioritize rapid, high- quality cVDPV2 outbreak response with whichever oral polio vaccine is available to them Moreover, all countries at risk of cVDPV2 outbreaks should prepare to meet the criteria for use of novel OPV2 and to complete the necessary novel OPV2 programmatic readiness assessments Novel OPV2 can be used for vaccination campaigns at 4-week interval from other OPV campaigns (for both pre and post campaign time) There is no limitation on the time between campaign use of novel OPV2 and routine use of OPV as well as IPV, measles and other non-polio vaccines 14 14.

Isolation of an iVDPV requires careful assessment to ensure that all household members and close community contacts are immunized with IPV Larger- scale SIAs are not required unless circulation in the community is established An iVDPV carrier should receive appropriate therapy for their underlying immune deficiency syndrome and be offered optimal anti-poliovirus treatment where available TIMING AND SCALE OF IMMUNIZATION ACTIVITIES A four-step vaccination strategy is recommended by GPEI for outbreaks and high-risk events for all poliovirus types (types 1, 2 and 3) (see Figure 2) The four steps consist of a rapid response (RR) round, followed by two large scale rounds (SIA1, SIA2), and a mandatory targeted mop-up round Further SIAs are justified if there is evidence of ongoing transmission such as by breakthrough isolates/cases The aim of this strategy is to ensure that: the response is as timely and rapid, as possible; at least two high quality large scale rounds are implemented; and re-vaccination of all areas where quality was insufficient For type 2 response, removal of all Sabin OPV2 (mOPV2/tOPV) or novel OPV2 from the field should be done as soon as possible (further details/timelines are available in the relevant vaccine management guidance documents)I 30 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK A rapid response (RR) vaccination campaign For an outbreak or high-risk event, a RR vaccination campaign is the first vaccination response It should commence by day 14 and target the immediate area of the virus isolation, to stop further transmission rapidly even if the source remains unknown If the rapid response cannot be commenced within two weeks, there should be consideration for proceeding directly to SIA1 with appropriate scope and target population This decision should be made in consultation with Regional polio response teams If the available genetic information and detailed field investigation indicate the possibility that poliovirus transmission has been ongoing for a long duration and/or has likely spread beyond the place of detection by the time of notification, a small scale rapid response is not warranted In such situations, focus should be on preparing and implementing an appropriately scoped and good quality SIA1 as soon as feasible SIA 1 and SIA 2 Two high-quality large-scale vaccination campaigns (>90% of children vaccinated) should be completed, preferably by day 42 and latest by day 56 from the outbreak notification The response will be tailored to the virus type and local context The duration of the campaign for SIA1 and SIA2 should be four days but can be extended up to seven days based on pressing needs in the local context or make additional efforts such as deployment of additional personnel and supervisors, to complete the campaign and reach missed children in areas of poor performance, as identified by intra-campaign monitoring or supervisors' observationsMop-up round A mop-up round is required as an additional step wherever monitoring suggests, children have been missed in certain health districts or areas, to ensure interruption of transmission (even in the absence of new poliovirus detections) Information to guide the selection of districts for full mop-up can include: intra-campaign monitoring, independent monitoring, eyewitness accounts and spot checks, LQAS, post- campaign surveys, or new events such as population movements, and breakthrough cases A mop-up round should be included in the initial outbreak response plan, appropriately scaled and implemented after SIA2, and only cancelled if ALL health areas demonstrated high-quality implementation and vaccination coverage Preferably, the mop-up should be implemented within three weeks after the end of SIA2, to achieve maximum benefit and to boost population immunity within the shortest possible time Breakthrough Transmission and Need for Additional SIAs Any WPV or cVDPV detected in an AFP case, healthy child or environmental sample with the date of onset of paralysis (for AFP cases) or the date of sample collection (for healthy child or environmental sample) more than 21 days after the first day of the last SIA in an area where at least two SIAs have been implemented is evidence of breakthrough transmission Where there is a high-risk of continued circulation, a shorter threshold of 14 days rather than 21 may be used for triggering an additional SIA High risk situations include for example, where there is inaccessibility, or evidence of poor SIA quality during outbreak response, or gaps in surveillance performance The decision to perform any 6 VACCINATION RESPONSE I 31 I additional SIAs will be jointly taken by the WHO regional office, other GPEI partners and local public health authorities Breakthrough transmission indicates inadequate quality of SIAs and a failure to stop transmission of poliovirus, necessitating additional vaccination rounds The country polio programme should carry out a thorough field investigation and risk assessment for any breakthrough transmission including any evolution in the epidemiology, the quality of the SIAs, the sensitivity and quality of polio surveillance and any other notable local factors The outcomes of the investigation and risk assessment should be utilized to decide upon the further course of outbreak response, including the scope of additional SIAs Evidence of breakthrough requires a mandatory vaccination response; however, absence of breakthrough does not necessarily negate the need for further vaccination Where quality is clearly inadequate in a large geographic area (based on the campaign monitoring modalities eg surveys, LQAS, spot checks etc) break-through isolates are identified or the outbreak continues to spread to unvaccinated areas, additional SIAs should be considered and planned Two campaigns must be completed after the last detected virus A high-quality mop-up round may be considered as one of these campaigns, if the area of the detected virus was covered twice Rapid Response <14 days of Day 0SIA 1 < 28 days of Day 0SIA 2 < 42 days of Day 0 (latest 56 days)Mop-up <21 days of Further SIAs if needFigure 2: Visual representation of timing and scale of immunization activities required Target population Rapid Response rounds should generally target a minimum of 100 000 and a maximum of 400 000 children (final decision to be made based on the target population in the outbreak zone and country's capacity) SIA1 and SIA2 should typically target 1 - 2 million children for cVDPV/WPV type 1 and type 3, but because of the greater risk of type 2 spread, type 2 events or outbreaks should typically target 2-4 million children It is possible to consider increasing the scope further, in densely populated areas, or if there is evidence or risk of extensive circulation (eg outbreak population well connected to a major urban area) The geographic scope for response is assessed case-by-case through a detailed risk assessment, informed by discussion with technical experts (ie epidemiologists, virologists and country experts), to ensure that all high-risk zones are reached including any such zones in the neighbouring countries, if necessary SIA2I 32 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK The available data and modelling indicate that for VDPV2 there is a likelihood of 12% weekly increase in the outbreak size and 5% weekly increase in probability of spread if an immediate vaccination response is not implemented 17 On average, delay of one month in implementing the vaccination response may require a 35% increase in the scope/target population 18 Hence, there should be consideration for likelihood of spread of infection if there are delays in implementing vaccination response, while deciding upon the scope and target population Significant delays in notification of outbreaks and implementing vaccination response call for larger scoped vaccination rounds to stop the transmission This is particularly true for type-2 poliovirus outbreaks and high-risk events, given the continuously waning population mucosal immunity In countries with good water and sanitation, the decision for the scope, target population and vaccine choice should consider the local context and findings of the epidemiological investigation The target population should be within the capacity of the programme to attain high coverage Depending on the local context and capacity, phasing of campaigns may be considered to ensure quality in each geographic and demographic region covered 17.

I 34 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK Routine immunization Strengthening routine immunization (RI) remains a central pillar of polio eradication Vaccination with bOPV/IPV and other antigens must continue as usual and be further strengthened, even if immunization sessions are conducted on same day as, or within days of, an outbreak response Strategies to mitigate any negative impact of outbreak response on the conduct of RI should be planned in advance (eg if staff are diverted for the SIA efforts, immediate rescheduling of RI sessions) Outbreak response mechanisms should be appropriately utilized for routine immunization coverage improvement, with particular focus on high-risk areas/ populationsCONCURRENT CIRCULATION OF DIFFERENT POLIOVIRUS TYPES If polioviruses of different types circulate concurrently, the decision on response should be based on the epidemiology and vaccine availability The trivalent OPV is the vaccine of choice for concurrent outbreaks of different poliovirus types If tOPV is not available, rounds of monovalent Sabin OPV2 and bOPV might be staggered based on operational feasibility Response strategy decisions will be made by the GPEI technical experts based on careful review of the epidemiology, the geographical areas affected, the capacity for robust response, and vaccine availability on a case-by-case basis while waiting for the country to get verifiedSituationVaccination response Vaccine preference Rounds Timing Scope/target WPV1 Outbreak RR <14 days 100 000 - 400 000 bOPVSIA1 <28 days Min 1-2 million SIA2 <42 days (latest <56 days) Mop up days of SIA2 Based on SIA1/2 quality cVDPV1 /cVDPV3 outbreak RR <14 days 100 000 SIA1 <28 days Up to 2 million SIA2 <42 days (latest <56 days) Mop up <21 days of SIA2 Based on SIA1/2 quality Co-circulation of type 1 and type 3 poliovirusesRR <14 days As per the epidemiologySIA1 <28 days SIA2 <42 days (latest <56 days) Mop up <21 days of SIA2Table 5: Response to Detection of type1 and type3 polioviruses outbreak 6 VACCINATION RESPONSE I 35 I VACCINE CHOICE Below are some guiding principles for decision-making on vaccine choice for responding to type-2 poliovirus outbreaks: Countries facing cVDPV2 outbreaks should avoid delay and prioritize rapid, high-quality cVDPV2 outbreak response with whichever oral polio vaccine is available to them 20 Countries will not be considered for novel OPV2 release unless verified ready for novel OPV2 use by the GPEI Readiness Verification Team No novel OPV2 will be allocated for use in a specific country while waiting for the country to get verified Where there is co-circulation with types 1 or 3 viruses, and no previous use of novel OPV2, tOPV is the vaccine of choice In countries with previous use of novel OPV2, the decision will be made on a case-by-case basis 20. See \"weekly epidemiological record/Relev\u00e9 http://www whoint/wer )HIGH-QUALITY CAMPAIGNS In implementing the four-step vaccination strategy for outbreak response, a tension exists between achieving a timely response and achieving the desired vaccination coverage (>90%, as assessed by the post campaign assessment) In settings where poliovirus is detected, the RR (Round 0) may not meet all quality expectations (eg situations with security or access challenges, operational difficulties, hard- to-reach subpopulations and/or vaccine hesitancy, or simply lack of adequate time to plan) This is acceptable as long as the RR is timely However, it is critical to ensure that the first and second large-scale vaccination rounds (SIA1 and SIA2) reach every child, to be able to stop the poliovirus transmission Quality microplanning, preparedness monitoring, and intra- and post-campaign monitoring are essential strategies to prepare and achieve high- quality campaigns Low quality campaigns (<90%, assessed by PCM) are not likely to During concurrent outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, immediate cVDPV2 response also takes precedence, in case tOPV is not available Co-administration of mOPV2 and bOPV is not recommended during campaigns for operational reasons A polio event or outbreak in a country that has been using only IPV in the RI programme requires immediate consultation with WHO, as for any polio event or outbreak anywhereBox 3I 36 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK stop the outbreaks If the post campaign assessment of a given outbreak response campaign indicates low quality, all necessary quality assurance measures must be taken before the subsequent campaign, with special focus on the identified weaknesses Planning for mop up should highly focus on improving the SIA quality in the areas that did not perform well during SIA1 and/or SIA2 Sub-optimal quality across the entire four-step response vaccination (RR, SIA1, SIA2, mop up) may require carefully planned additional rounds to address the immunity gap Decision for such additional rounds should be taken in close coordination with Regional polio response teams and ORPG Quality microplanning Preparation of macro-level plans and budgets based on the target population, local conditions and operational costs allows stakeholders to discuss strategies and secure resources Such top-down planning must rapidly be accompanied with effective bottom- up microplanning (ie developing and validating plans at the community level) House to house campaigns are the preferred modality Experience has shown that house to house implementation results in higher coverage in most settings Special strategies such as fixed posts supplemented by outreach teams and special vaccination teams in market places/ transport hubs, should be considered to effectively reach high-risk population 21.

While Chapter 4 (above) outlines the initial surveillance steps required as part of a thorough investigation, the current chapter focuses on surveillance enhancement following initial investigation. SURVEILLANCE ENHANCEMENT Following the initial investigation of any polio event or outbreak, it is critical to assess and enhance poliovirus surveillance Vigorous efforts are required to put the surveillance system on high alert and improve sensitivity to identify promptly any new virus or ongoing transmission, even outside the immediate outbreak zone The outbreak response plan must include surveillance initiatives from Day 0 of the event/outbreak, continue surveillance in parallel with other aspects of the response, and maintain selected 33.

SURVEILLANCE FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONI 44 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK Countries are to undertake the following activities to enhance AFP surveillance: Immediately notify all national and subnational surveillance units about the poliovirus event/outbreak Rigorously sensitize all health care workers to AFP surveillance and notification requirements, including zero-reporting Conduct sensitization activities among community members (eg, polio volunteers, informants, community health workers), government and non-governmental organizations to increase awareness of AFP and polio Review and re-prioritize reporting sites (if required) in the AFP active surveillance network in all districts and provinces and ensure that secondary and tertiary health facilities in public and private sectors are fully involved in AFP surveillance The network should reflect the current health services providers including public and private facilities, NGOs, and refugee camps Expand to include traditional healers, pharmacists and key community informants based on high- risk populations Important relevant bodies like paediatric, neurologists' associations should also be engaged Ensure prospective active surveillance visits are conducted regularly and passive surveillance is performing optimally Conduct facility- and community-based, ad hoc active case search to identify unreported AFP cases Ensure that supplemental AFP case- finding strategies are in place in the outbreak zone and high-risk areas, including ad hoc active search during campaigns by vaccination teams, independent monitors, and LQAS survey teams Monitor and document that at least 90% of all planned active surveillance visits are conducted Consider supplemental strategies, such as enhancing environmental surveillance, in consultation with national and GPEI surveillance experts Ensure the national laboratory is involved in outbreak planning and that capacity is strengthened to handle additional workload and maintain rapid specimen handling While efforts are initially focused on enhancing surveillance in the outbreak zone and high-risk areas, it is important to enhance surveillance across the infected country and demographically linked areas in neighbouring countries to ensure detection of any geographical spread of poliovirus ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEILLANCE Environmental surveillance (ES) serves as a complement to AFP surveillance, but never as a substitute It is the monitoring of wastewater or sewage from designated locations to detect the presence of poliovirus In the context of events and outbreaks, ES can provide information on the geographic extent, community transmission and duration of poliovirus circulation, as well as the excretion of polio vaccine virus following vaccination Any adjustment in the environmental surveillance should be done with coordination among the epidemiologists, polio laboratories, and where needed, the environmental health departments in a country to ensure appropriate ES sites6 VACCINATION RESPONSE I 45 I At the outset of a new event or outbreak, the following actions should be put in place: Assess the performance of all existing poliovirus ES sites in the area Sites that have had no virus isolation (including non-polio enteroviruses and sabin-like viruses) for over 6 months should be thoroughly assessed, in particular Increase the frequency of specimen collection to every two weeks, where feasible, for a minimum of six months following the most recent isolate detected or the most recent use of type2 containing OPV (in case of type2 poliovirus outbreaks/high-risk events), whichever is later 36 36.See: Standard operating procedures for polio environmental surveillance enhancement following investigation of a poliovirus event or outbreak ( https://polioeradicationorg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SOPs-for-Polio-ES-enhancement- following-outbreak-20210208pdf , accessed on 15 Nov. 2021) Consider new collection sites within and outside the outbreak or event area, where technically appropriate and laboratory capacity allows Assess nearby urban areas with a population of 100 000 or more as candidates for new or enhanced environmental sampling Any proposal to scale up ES must consider laboratory capacity to support the effort, and not jeopardize AFP surveillance Detailed guidelines on polio environmental surveillance enhancement following detection of vaccine-related type 2 poliovirus are available, from which Figure 4 is drawn 36 Figure 4 36: Overview of timeline of enhanced environmental surveillance depending on the type of initial VDPV2 isolated New VDPV2 isolationaVDPV2 or iVDPV2 cVDPV2Enhance or Deploy ES (if feasible) If no Type 2 containing vaccine& response If subsequent evidence of transmission mOPV2 / tOPV2 Response nOPV2 ResponseSTOP STOP STOPConsider last response last nOPV2 response *Minimum sampling frequency is monthly;

COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL MOBILIZATION Communication for Development (C4D) is a systematic, planned and evidence- informed strategy to promote positive and measurable behaviour and social change Effective social mobilization, with emphasis on high-risk populations, is a key component of polio outbreak response The polio C4D outbreak response approach is designed to redress perceptions and social norms that deter caregivers from vaccinating their children, and rebuild commitment to vaccination, including routine immunization A strong communication strategy can strengthen performance of all response activities, increase uptake of vaccination in all population groups, and support robust surveillance with early notification of AFP Critical C4D steps include: raising awareness of campaign dates; strengthening community confidence in vaccination through building health worker capacity and trust in vaccine safety and efficacy; elevating perception of polio risk to children, families and communities; addressing bottlenecks in and barriers to the decision to vaccinate; and incorporating infodemic management as well as anticipatory and real- time strategies to counter dis-and misinformationIn the context of vaccine-derived poliovirus, and against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived risk of polio may be low, especially when the virus is detected only in the environment While the C4D outbreak response for VDPVs follows the same principles as for WPV, it is important to reinforce vaccine safety messaging, including as necessary the type-specific messaging (eg nOPV2, mOPV2 etc) and address any context-specific fears or misconceptions around vaccines For VDPV detection only from environmental sources, it is important to explain that low immunity is the root cause STRATEGIC C4D FRAMEWORK FOR POLIO OUTBREAK RESPONSE Outbreak response communication, including C4D and emergency risk communication, is initiated as soon as an outbreak is declared and should be integrated in all aspects of planning and responding to an outbreak or high- risk event The outcome of the joint epidemiological and social investigation of the polio case/infected area is critical to understanding the social environment for areas or groups affected by the virus Interventions should be based on understanding of all relevant social and environmental barriers to strengthen I 48 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK vaccine acceptance and uptake (See Strategic Framework within the Communication for Development Guidelines for Responding to Polio Events and Outbreaks for detailed guidance 38) At this phase, the focus is on building (or rebuilding) caregivers' critical awareness about polio, OPV and the fact that there is an outbreak in the community that puts children at risk The primary goal is to raise awareness of the outbreak to at least 90% Communication approaches should be straightforward, clear and elicit an urgent response from parents and the community at large Plans for campaigns, including SIA1, SIA2 and a mop-up round , should include C4D interventions to reach missed children and reduce refusals Activities should continue to elevate public risk perception of the outbreak and its impact and empower decision making, especially for non- compliant groups or communities For campaigns using the SIAD approach, locally appropriate messaging is important, so that caregivers and decision makers understand the process and why children may be vaccinated more than one time in short intervals Protracted outbreak response Where an outbreak is ongoing for more than four months (120 days), there may be one or more underlying barriers As the target audience may include acceptors, vulnerable acceptors, transient groups or even rejecters, conducting a root cause 38.See \"Communication for development guidelines for responding to polio events and outbreaks, post switch\". 2016.

percentage of missed children for different reasons (grouped into social, operational and absences); percentage of refusals; percentage of refusals by reason; percentage of absence by reason; percentage of parents aware of the campaign prior to vaccinator's visit; and percentage reached through different communication channels This data must be sex-disaggregated and analyzed accordingly At the end of the outbreak, it is important to assess community acceptance of, and commitment to, vaccination, for example, through small-scale surveys or secondary data analysis, and to document the outcome of C4D activities as well as the lessons learnt and good practices COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES Strategic and coordinated communication strategies help ensure that communities and decision-makers at local, national, and regional levels are engaged in promoting vaccination Risk communication plans and C4D interventions should precede vaccination activities to create awareness and minimize vaccine hesitancy and refusals Immediately creating or reinvigorating a national communication or social mobilization committee is critical The role of the committee is to plan, coordinate and ensure the successful implementation of risk communication plans and C4D interventions Risk communication plans should be developed and employed to provide credible, timely and accurate information to the community or affected population during the outbreak response Effective risk mitigation strategies will help bring an After each campaign, IM/LQAS data and/I 50 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK outbreak under control quickly by ensuring a community understands ongoing risk and actions they can take, including vaccination, to reduce harm within the community and further spread outside of the outbreak zone Risk communication considerations during outbreak response include: political advocacy to garner the attention and resources needed to support response efforts and strengthen public trust in vaccination News media engagement to ensure that information is clear, timely and reaching affected populations and for example, is an important channel in conflict or inaccessible areas The Ministry of Health and WHO, generally the first to announce an outbreak, should take the lead in this area As part of the C4D/communication strategy, it is recommended to establish immediately which agency is leading the media management This leadership role will depend on capacity in each country, noting that UNICEF usually leads C4D and supports the media strategy development, spokesperson training and outreach to influencers Digital and social media for targeted outreach to a large audience, especially where interpersonal communication networks are weaker and to counter rumours and misinformation quickly Gender-related barriers should be analyzed and addressed in the 39.

COORDINATION Coordination mechanisms for polio are triggered by a laboratory notification (Day 0) of a new outbreak or high-risk event The country, region and global levels will coordinate to support the investigation, rapid risk assessment and determination of next steps The ORPG will lead outbreak response coordination with national authorities, RRT in the African Region, IMST in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, WHO and UNICEF regional offices, and all GPEI partners The ORPG will conduct a coordination call within 48 to 72 hours with partners to address the needs of the country, monitor the immediate provision of pre-financing (also referred to as no-regret funding), and plan the required resources and initial response support interventions The ORPG will include all the necessary skill sets to coordinate outbreak response Regular updates will be provided from ORPG to the GPEI Strategy Committee For grade 2 and 3 outbreaks (and high-risk events), WHO and UNICEF regional offices, in consultation with ORPG, will nominate an outbreak coordinator for deployment to the country level within 14 days of Day 0 The GPEI outbreak coordinator will be deployed as additional support for in-country authorities, supplementary to existing senior GPEI staff, to ensure comprehensive and timely coordination and outbreak management at national and subnational levelsBUDGETS AND FINANCING Coordinated approach The goal of outbreak response financing is to ensure that cash flow challenges do not interfere with the roll-out of response activities, based on a \"budget- mobilize- finance-replenish\" model National authorities should rapidly prepare a comprehensive budget, in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF and other partners The budget should include a comprehensive estimate of costs for all activities (ie coordination, vaccination, surveillance, communication and social mobilization) and enabling functions (ie laboratory operations, training and transport) A joint comprehensive work plan and budget shared with all levels involved will aid in mobilizing funds from donors to secure financing for response activities ORPG and WHO headquarters will provide specific guidance and timelines on outbreak budgeting \"Pre-financing/No-regret funding\" policy The pre-financing/no-regret funding policy (an advance of up to USD 1 million) helps ensure a timely, barrier-free release of funds to countries to support outbreak response This policy affirms that it is better to over-resource critical functions than to risk failure by delays in resources The pre-financing limit can be enhanced above USD 1 million, upon provision of adequate justification by the country programme and respective regional offices/ RRT/IMST The release of funds by GPEI partners may pre-date outbreak grading by 9 GPEI SUPPORT I 55 I WHO, based on the initial risk assessment and discussion between national, regional and global levels Whereas funds will usually be released by WHO and UNICEF, another GPEI partner may on occasion provide the funding The pre-financed funds have to be included and accounted for in the outbreak response budget prepared by the country programme HUMAN RESOURCE SURGE The objectives of GPEI surge support are to: i) rapid activate deployment of skilled professionals, especially for grade 2 and grade 3 outbreaks, to support the national response team for key outbreak response functions; and ii) ensure smooth transition to longer-term staffing It is important to ensure the balanced recruitment of women and men into technical and operational roles at all levels Deployment should occur by Day 3 through a partner-wide mechanism for deploying staff and qualified consultants from the regional level and supported from the global level through the ORPG The ORPG coordinates surge support and technical assistance in the following areas: Identifying key roles, according to outbreak grade and assessed needs of the country Expertise offered includes both technical (communication, immunization, surveillance, data management), and operational (coordination, finance, human resources) skill sets Team composition scaled according to need, for example, outbreak response coordinator, operations manager, communications officer, and technical experts for immunization, surveillance and social mobilization Personnel with specialized expertise may also be available to provide support to innovative strategies to improve the quality of response, such as for GIS mapping of the outbreak zone The Rapid Response Team involves deployment from respective GPEI agencies, including regional offices Recruitment for active support may extend beyond outbreak teams within each agency The period of deployment is from outbreak notification until the rapid response SIA or the first large scale SIA (SIA1), where indicated The Surge Support Team is an interagency on-call roster for longer- term deployment using a central platform for ease of visibility and reporting The Surge Support Team should be in place within 21 days of outbreak notification The expected period of deployment is from the rapid response SIA until the end of the outbreak Response teams will aim for at least one week of overlap between the work of the Rapid Response Team and that of the Surge Support Team to ensure complete and detailed handover Identifying needs and advocating for specialized support and innovation when warranted by context (eg GIS- informed microplanning, detailed enumeration, administration, and finance)I 56 I

An outbreak can be considered over, and response can be terminated when no poliovirus has been detected for six months; provided surveillance is adequate in the outbreak zone and other high-risk areas and there is convincing evidence that sufficient measures are in place to halt the poliovirus transmission in the conflict affected areas as well as among the displaced and hard to reach populations If these conditions are not met, the OBRA team will make recommendations for remedial actions (surveillance strengthening, vaccination quality improvement etc) After a further six-month period (ie after 12 months from the last detection) without detection of a poliovirus from any source, the outbreak can be considered over and response may be closed, based on the OBRA's review and recommendation When 'end of outbreak' criteria are met and/or the OBRA team is satisfied that the outbreak response has been sufficient, in following the decision tree below (Figure 4), the WHO regional office may consider the OBRA findings in consultation with the ORPG, share the report with the national certification committee and the regional certification commission, and may confirm that the outbreak is over and can be 'closed' The country is informed accordingly I 62 I STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - RESPONDING TO A POLIO EVENT OR OUTBREAK Figure 4: Outbreak response assessment decision tree Polio outbreak No poliovirus detected from any source for at least 6 months Good evidence of: High quality eective immunization response Sensitive surveillanceInsucient evidence of: High-quality immunization Sensitive AFP surveillance Outbreak closedOutbreak may not haved ended, response continues Additional emergency surveillance action plan implemented, 12 months - plus one month to complete laboratory testing and reports - from time of last poliovirus isolate (test results available for all samples collected) Outbreak closed Polio was declared a public health emergency of international concern on the 5th of May 2014, and according to the Temporary Recommendations issued by the WHO Director General, the criteria to assess countries as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV are as below: Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer Environmental isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental sample PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period Every three months, the committee meets to review the emergency status and to determine to which countries the Temporary Recommendations should apply However, if a country is considered no-longer infected according to the Temporary Recommendations this does not always mean the outbreak is closed, as the response may need to continueBox 410 MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF RESPONSE I 63 I DOCUMENTING LESSONS LEARNED There is great value for countries to review the performance of the outbreak or event response and document lessons learned The outbreak documentation should, among other things, include: a detailed outbreak investigation and risk assessment descriptive epidemiology (including index case investigation) surveillance response to monitor the evolution up to the end immunization response outlining the key milestones for quality assurance and innovations (micro-planning, training, preparedness monitoring, logistics management, community engagement 44.

GENDER MAINSTREAMING The new Polio Eradication Strategy 2022- 2026 emphasizes the importance of the use of rapid gender analysis for a more effective outbreak response By collecting and analyzing sex-disaggregated data and gender-sensitive information, teams at the forefront of outbreak response develop a more robust understanding of the population that improves community engagement and increases vaccine acceptance Gender mainstreaming in outbreak response will concern the following areas: Gender analysis Rapid gender analysis provides essential information about gender roles and responsibilities, capacities and vulnerabilities to guide programming It is used in situations where time is of the essence and resources are very scarce As outlined in the new Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 , rapid gender analysis in outbreak response will be guided by the IASC Multi-Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA) 45 and CARE International's Rapid Gender Analysis 46,47 Rapid gender analysis should be context specific and requires an approach tailored to the needs and interests of affected and at-risk communities This may require engaging with local expertise in-country 45.
