Obviously we can't prevent all of the viruses going around (I sure wish I could - I don't like it one bit when my littles are sick!) But there is a lot we can do that often supports the body better, and with fewer side effects than many conventional methods and medicine. When I was in practice I helped lots of moms feel equipped in taking care of their kids with herbs and homeopathy. Most of us aren't taught growing up how to support our kid's immune systems naturally. I want to teach you and help you feel ready to grab from your natural supplement cabinet next time your child has a cold, cough or fever. Having a sick kiddos is hard no matter what, but at least you can know that you are helping their body fight the sickness the best they can, in the most natural way possible! Now, a quick word of advice: don't get overwhelmed by all the information you're about to read through. It can take a while to learn all the different herbs, supplements, and their usages, and that's completely okay! Learning to support your family's immune systems naturally with herbs and supplements is absolutely something you can and will learn, little by little. They key is to just start! Start with learning and trying a few supplements at a time, then add in from there as you go. Our family's natural medicine cabinet is pretty full now, but I've been doing this for almost 4 years now (and had a lot of training before I had kids too!) P.S. None of the following information is official medical advice, and should not be treated as such. This is just a fellow mama sharing from experience some practical ways you can help your kids strengthen their immune systems and fight viruses as quickly as possible using natural herbs and homeopathic remedies. There are appropriate times to take your child to the doctor, and I strongly encourage you to do so if and when necessary! But there are many things you can do to help your kids before it gets to that point, and I want you to feel equipped with knowing what your options are to help your child in that middle ground. My Top Homeopathic Cold & Flu Recommendations (I have starred* the ones our family uses the most often.) [*Cold Calm](https://www.boironusa.com/products/coldcalm-tablets/) - When your little one comes down with the sniffles or a minor sore throat Cold Calm can do wonders to ease their pain. This is a much better alternative to traditional cold medicine, which can have lots of yucky ingredients and side effects. It comes in super easy to take, pre-measured liquid doses. We always keep Cold Calm and Tiny Cold Tablets on hand in our home. I like them both for smaller toddlers because they are so easy to take. Usage: Children 6 months of age and older: Snap off one single-use dose. Twist to open. Squeeze entire contents into mouth. Administer one liquid unit-dose at the onset of symptoms, 3 to 6 times a day. Reduce with improvement. Keep the remaining unit-doses in the aluminum pouch. [*Oscillococcinum](https://www.boironusa.com/products/oscillococcinum/ and https://www.oscillo.com/about/) - Obviously the flu is the last thing you want to hit your family, but if it does this will help relieve your flu symptoms in a totally natural way. Usage: Adults and children 2 years of age and older should dissolve the entire contents of one tube in the mouth every 6 hours, up to 3 times a day. I have also used this for 12 months- 2 years old. I put 1/4 of a tube dissolved in water or breastmilk every hour for 2 doses. [*Temp Assure](https://organicgrace.com/herbs-kids-temp-assure) - Fevers are completely normal immune system response designed to help the body get rid of viruses and infections. They actually serve a purpose, but it can be a little stressful for us mamas when our kiddos get a fever (talking from experience here!) Temp Assure is formulated with peppermint, yarrow, and elder, and works to help either raise or lower fevers naturally, depending on what the body needs. This isn't the same as Tylenol or Motrin, but rather works with the body (without any potential side-effects!) If your little ones spike a fever, this and the Newton Fever-Infection (below) should be your go-to's. We fought a fever recently and they both worked so well together! Usage: 1-3 years = 1ml, 3 = 1-2ml, 3 times 7-11 years = 2 ml, 3-4 times daily; 12+ years = 3 ml, 3-4 times daily. * [Kids Fever-Infection](https://www.newtonlabs.net/Kids-FeverInfection/productinfo/F004/) - Created by Newton Homeopathics, this is another option for bringing down a fever safely and naturally. It has been formulated for fever-associated symptoms such as chills, aches, sweating, fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. Usage: Children ages 0 to 11 should be given 3 drops or pellets by mouth as needed or directed by a healthcare professional. Ages 12 and up should be given 6 drops or pellet as needed or as directed by a healthcare professional. For kids under age 2, crush and dissolve the pellets in purified water to administer. Sensitive persons should begin with 1 drop or pellet and gradually increase to a full dose. I personally love learning about all the different applications of homeopathy, so I figured I'd share for you to see what each of the active ingredients in this formula is used for. Active Ingredients: Equal and heat. Restless sleep. - Cinchona officinalis chill, heat and sweat; Fever. HPUS: Loss - Influenzinum HPUS: Fever; General ill feeling with chill, headache. - Nux vomica HPUS: Indigestion; Stuffy colds. - Phosphorus Flu](https://www.hylands.com/products/hylands-4-kids-complete-cold-'n-flu) - This is another great option for when the flu or a simple cold runs through your home, particularly when you see sickness signs just beginning. It's designed to temporarily relieve the symptoms of the common cold and flu naturally, including body aches and headache, cough and congestion, fever, chills, and sore throat. Usage: Children 2 years to under 6 years = 5 mL or 1 teaspoon every 4 hours, up to 6x/day. Children 6 years to under 12 years = 10 mL or 2 teaspoons every 4 hours, up to 6x/day. Adults & children over 12 years = 15 mL or 3 teaspoons every 4 hours, up to 6x/day. [*Tiny Cold Tablets](https://www.hylands.com/products/hylands-baby-tiny-cold-tablets) - These quick dissolvable tablets will help kick cold and flu symptoms out of the house, even for your littlest ones. We use these so often in our home and it is so easy because these little pellets are sweet-tasting, easy to dissolve, and both of my girls take them easily. When in doubt I go to this (especially if the baby doesn't want to take supplements!) Usage: Children 6 months to 1 year of age = dissolve 2 tablets on tongue every 15 minutes for 4 doses, then hourly until relieved. Children 1 to 3 years of age = dissolve 3 tablets on tongue every 15 minutes for 4 doses, then hourly until relieved [*Immune Avenger](https://www.herb-pharm.com/product/kids-immune-avenger/) - You can add these drops to a little water or juice to boost your child's immune system anytime, whether they are just beginning to show signs of sickness or are already under the weather. We use this formula often in our house. It is my first go-to when I think the girls are getting sick. It is meant for the early onset of viruses, although I use it throughout the duration of the virus too. Immune Avenger features echinacea extract and black elderberry to strengthen the immune system. Usage: Add drops to 2 oz. of water or juice, 3 to 5 times per day. 25-49 pounds = 10 drops. 50-74 pounds = 20 drops. 75-99 pounds = 30 drops. 100+ pounds = 40 drops. [Immune Fortifier](https://amzn.to/2OIP2OD ) - This formula helps to both prepare for or restore the immune system from illness, meaning that you can administer it if you suspect there's a virus going around or to help the immune system recover from a virus. I like this one because astragalus extract and reishi extract are strong immune tonics, but this formula is created to be gentle enough for kiddos. Usage: Add drops to 2 oz. of water or juice, 2 to 4 times per day. 25-49 pounds = 5 drops; 50-74 pounds = 10 drops; 75-99 pounds = 15 drops; 100+ pounds = 20 drops. [*Kick-It-Biotic](https://www.wishgardenherbs.com/herbal-remedies/Kick-It-Biotic-For-Kids-83) - This is great for those of you who have children who get sick often, or are in places where sickness goes around quickly (preschool, daycare, school). It's something you can start using at the beginning of cold and flu season to keep your kiddo from getting sick. I would recommend giving it a couple times a week. I don't love giving stronger herbs daily for long periods of time because it can actually alter the gut micro-biome, and our gut micro-biome balance is essential for immune health too. I love this formula specifically for the usnea lichen in it, which is one of my favorite, most frequently used herbs. It's versatile for infections of all kinds, and great at killing off viruses. Usage: Kids over 1 year = 1-2 droppers full in water or juice for taste, 3-4 times a day (or every 2 hours) if needed. [Cold Seasons](https://www.wishgardenherbs.com/herbal-remedies/Cold-Season-Symptoms-139) - This formula is good at supporting the immune system while targeting the respiratory tract and can soothe sore throats. It also promotes healthy mucosal tissue. I have often given this formula if there isn't anything respiratory going on because of the elderflower in it. It's a great immune booster, but one I would take out specifically when you suspect the throat, bronchial tubes, or lungs are being affected by a virus. Usage: Kids over 1 year = 2-3 droppers full in water for taste 3-4 times a day, or every 2 hours as needed. Repeat in 5 minutes if needed for full effect. Infants under 1 year = 8-15 drops, 3-4 times a day, or every 2 hours as needed. [*Windbreaker](https://amzn.to/34aoBbo) - This powerful little herb is used to clear \"heat\" (an Eastern Medicine term) and is great for when you first get sick. It can really shorten the severity and length of colds, fevers, and sore throats. The taste isn't fantastic (it's actually pretty bitter) but it can really help get through sickness. We used this with a fever this season and for colds. It is one of my go-to herbs and I just started using it this season. Usage: Give 3-5x/day. 0-6 months = 1/2 dropper full ; 6-12 months = 1 dropper full; 12-24 months = 2 droppers full; 3 years+ = 3 droppers full, up to 3 times daily; older kids and teens = 4 droppers full, up to 3 times daily. [Blue Poppy- Bupleurum & Angelica](https://amzn.to/2ri471W) - For head colds, congestion, and ear issues, this stuff can help break up the phlegm and mucus that can make your little one feel cruddy! I have also read this can be good for fever and pain associated with a virus. This formula is new to me and I haven't used it much, but do like to have it in my arsenal. I couldn't find a lot of information on the dosages of this supplement, but from what I have found, I believe it should be dosed similarly to Windbreaker. Usage: Give 3-5x/day. 0-6 months = 1/2 dropper full; 6-24 months = 1 dropper full; 2 years+ = 2 droppers full. [Garlic Oil](https://amzn.to/337fR4n) - This is a great alternative to constant antibiotics for ear infections. If you have a little one prone to issues with their ears, you are going to want to keep this on hand. Garlic's natural antibacterial tendencies will help get rid of a painful infection. I like to pair this with chiropractic adjustments and going dairy-free. [Here](https://meghanbirt.com/2014/06/heal-ear-infection-naturally/) is a post I wrote on how to treat ear infections naturally, and [here](https://healthykidshappykids.com/2017/01/29/pediatrician-approved-natural-remedies-ear-infections/) is another ear infection post that includes info on additional herbal remedy support (like Windbreaker!) Usage: 2-3 drops in each ear 3-4x/day. After you drop it in, you can massage it into the ear. [Belladonna](https://amzn.to/2OwAkdL) - This remedy works quickly to relieve the symptoms of colds, and is most commonly used for fevers. You can easily dissolve the pellets under your child's tongue as soon as you see signs of sickness. You can also dissolve the pellets in water or breastmilk/ formula and put it in a dropper to give babies under 12-18 months. Belladonna is a very common formula used for many things, and may already be in a homeopathic formula you are using. I tend to use the single formula homeopathic drops less often than I do the pre-mixed ones. Usage: The basic dosage for an adult is to dissolve 5 pellets under your tongue 3x/day. For a baby or kid, I decrease that dose to 1-3 pelletes dissolved. I will dissolve 4 tablets in water when my kids are younger and give them a little bit every 60-90 minutes until the mixture is gone. [Pulsatilla](https://amzn.to/2Oa93yT) - These little pellets dissolve easily in your child's mouth and can be taken at the onset of sickness. It is good for colds with a thick, yellow discharge. It also can be used for persistent coughs. Usage: The same as Belladonna (see above!) [Influenzium](https://amzn.to/2XyvoJt) - These are also little, dissolvable pellets that you can give your child preventatively when they come in contact with the flu virus. Influenzinum is a homeopathic medicine made from flu viruses (but don't worry, there's no risk of you getting the flu from taking it!) You can also use it during the flu, although Pulsatilla, Belladonna and Oscillococcinum would probably be better to try first. Usage: If it is for flu prevention, you dissolve 2 tablets under your tongue 1-4x per month. If you are fighting the flu, you can dissolve 4 tablets under your tongue. For kids, decrease the dosage. [Elderberry](https://www.naturesway.com/Product-Catalog/Sambucus-for-Kids-4-fluid-oz and https://amzn.to/347Mq3q) - This is amazing at building your child's immune season during the months when colds and flu are most prevalent. It is a powerful immune booster to help your kids fight off whatever is going around. I love elderberry because it's easy to get kids to take, since it tastes great! You can make your own or you can buy it (it's very versatile!) Usage: I wouldn't take it daily as I have read it is the most effective when you cycle it. You can decide if you want to take it 3-5x/week, or just when you are feeling sick. Always take more when you're fighting something. We personally don't use it super often but take it when we are sick or are suspecting we are coming down with something. My Best Tips for Getting Kids to Take Supplements Homeopathic remedies usually doesn't really taste like anything, so they are the easiest to get your kids to take. Dissolve the pellets in a little water or juice, or have them put the pellets under their tongues until they dissolve if they are older. With homeopathy, you generally take more doses more frequently than with herbal remedies, which can take some figuring out as you go. Herbal tinctures have stronger flavors. Some taste better (like Immune Avenger) and others don't taste so great (like Windbreaker). I put all of the herbal tinctures together and add some elderberry syrup, a dark juice or Ningxia Red from Young Living, which disguises the flavor a lot and makes it much more tolerable. Don't give the strong ones straight which is a sure-fire way for your kid (and you!) to not want to do it again. With herbs, you will give them less often than homeopathy, and usually in a higher dose. Compliance is huge when it comes to getting your kids to take supplements. Some kids will take supplements more willingly than others, and you may need to get creative to find ways to get them into your less than compliant kiddos (which is totally ok!) The important thing is to get them in, however you can. You could also diluting the herbal tinctures in a little water, or add it to [Fruits and Greens](https://justenjoyhealth.nutridyn.com/nutridyn-fruits-greens-54720) or more water to really dilute it and decrease the flavor to almost nothing. Daily Immune System Support [Fruits and Greens](https://justenjoyhealth.nutridyn.com/nutridyn-fruits-greens-66380) - I love giving this to the girls daily because it is 20 servings of fruits and vegetables in one scoop. We eat well in our house, but we surely don't get enough veggies in each and every day. I start giving greens around 14 months old and start at less than a quarter of a scoop and increase from there. They come in 9 different great tasting flavors and we love the berry, grape, and chocolate flavors the most. Usage: 14 months-2 years = up to 1/4 scoop; 2-3 years = 1/2 scoop; 3 years+ = 1/2-1 scoop. There's no danger in taking too many greens. Your body will only take what it needs. The one negative is that if you drink too much, you will get loose stools, which are uncomfortable and a clue to back off the dosage. [Suppys Multivitamin](https://justenjoyhealth.nutridyn.com/suppys-multi-vitamin-40629) - I like to make sure my bases are covered with nutrients with my kids and that is why I do a multivitamin. Smaller kids don't need one every day, but it makes sure they get methylated folate and nutrients they may miss fully in their diet. I started giving Tava these at 2 years old about 3x/week. Usage: For kids who can bite and chew hard things easily. Give 1 chewable (I started by breaking them in half) 3-7x/ week. [Suppys Immunity](https://justenjoyhealth.nutridyn.com/suppys-immunity) - Proper immune function is crucial in children, especially as they grow and mature. Suppys Immunity is a great way to help kids get the beta-glucan they need for healthy immune function in tasty chewable tablets. Suppys Immunity is a delicious, all-natural immune support formula for children, containing patented Wellmune\u00ae a highly purified, proprietary strain of baker's yeast. A large body of clinical research suggests that Wellmune\u00ae can help support children's natural immune responses and provide protection from health challenges arising from physical and lifestyle stress. Usage: For kids who can chew and bit hard things easily. These are slightly smaller and not as hard as the Multivitamin. Take 1 tablet 3-5x per week. [Vitamin D3 + K2](https://amzn.to/2t8FoxO) - This is critical in immune health, but overall health of our bodies. Optimal vitamin D levels are needed in both children and adults and supplementing Vitamin D starts as babies (especially if you don't get outside often and in sunlight year-round). You also want to make sure you have K2 in the formula too, which helps with absorption greatly. I have two favorite Vitamin D supplements for babies and kids. A [liquid](https://www.orthomolecularproducts.com/liquid-vitamin-d3-with-k2/) and a [gummy](https://amzn.to/2t8FoxO). Yes, the gummy has sugar coating it... but it is so easy to give your kids. And in this case, I'm ok with the gummy once a day to get Vitamin D into my oldest! Usage: I am attaching a graphic from [Dr. Mercola](http://www.mercola.com) on his recommendations for Vitamin D, which I have always used and trust. Other Recommended Resources Here are a few of my favorite places to learn more about supporting your children's immune system naturally.
