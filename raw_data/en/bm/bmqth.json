Exercise, diet, and weight control continue to beessential and effective means of improving glucose homeostasis. However, lifestyle management measures may be insufficient orpatient compliance difficult, rendering conventional drug therapies (i.e., oral glucose- lowering agents and insulin injection)necessary in many patients. In addition toadverse effects, drug treatments are not always satisfactory in maintaining euglycemia and avoiding late stage diabetic complications.As an alternative approach, medicinal herbs with antihyperglycemic activities are increasingly sought by diabetic patients andhealth care professionals. Commonly used herbs and other alternative therapies, less likely to have the side effects of conventionalapproaches for type 2 diabetes, are reviewed. (Altern Med Rev 2002;7(1):45-58) Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a serious chronic metabolic disorder that has a significant impact on the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients, as well as on the health care system.In the United States, diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death. 1 Diabetes is divided into two ma- jor categories: type 1 diabetes (formerly knownas insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or IDDM) and type 2 diabetes (formerly known as non-insu- lin dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM). Theoverall prevalence of diabetes is approximately sixpercent of the population, of which 90 percent is type 2.2 Treatment and care of diabetes represents a substantial portion of the national health careexpenditure, over $105 billion annually. This rep- resents a substantial portion of the health care ex- penditure - more than one of every 10 U. S. healthcare dollars and one of four Medicare dollars. 3 Type 2 diabetes represents a syndrome with disordered metabolism of carbohydrate andfat. The most prominent clinical feature is hyper- glycemia (fasting plasma glucose level > 126 mg/ dL, or glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA1c) > 6.9%).4 In most patients with type 2 diabetes, the onset is in adulthood, most commonly in obese people over 40 years of age. Hypertension, hy- perlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and atherosclero-sis are often associated with diabetes. Pathophysiology and Complications Type 2 diabetes is known to have a strong genetic component with contributing environmen-tal determinants. Although the disease is geneti- cally heterogeneous, there appears to be a fairly consistent phenotype once the disease is fullymanifested. Whatever the pathogenic causes, thePage 46 Alternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002Type 2 Diabetes Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissionearly stage of type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance in insulin-targeting tissues, mainly the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipocytes. Insulin resistance in these tissues is associated withexcessive glucose production by the liver and im- paired glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, especially muscle. These events undermine meta-bolic homeostasis, but may not directly lead to overt diabetes in the early stage. With increased insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resis-tance, baseline blood glucose levels can be main- tained within normal ranges, but the patients may demonstrate impaired responses to prandial car-bohydrate loading and to oral glucose tolerance tests. The chronic over-stimulation of insulin se- cretion gradually diminishes and eventually ex-hausts the islet beta-cell reserve. A state of abso- lute insulin deficiency ensues and overt clinical diabetes becomes fully blown. 5-7 The transition of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes can also be influenced by ethnicity, degree of obesity, distribution of body fat, sedentary lifestyle, ag-ing, and other concomitant medical conditions. 8 The quality of life of type 2 diabetic pa- tients with chronic and severe hypoglycemia isadversely affected. Characteristic symptoms of tiredness and lethargy can become severe and lead to a decrease in work performance in adults andan increase of falls in the elderly. 9 The most com- mon acute complications are metabolic problems (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syn-drome or HHNS) and (hypertension, dyslipidemia, myocardial neurogenic bladder, impaired cardiovascu-lar reflexes, sexual dysfunction), and diabetic foot disorders. 9 Conventional Therapies The general consensus on treatment of type 2 diabetes is that lifestyle management is at the forefront of therapy options. In addition toexercise, weight control, and medical nutrition therapy, oral glucose-lowering drugs and injections of insulin are the conventional therapies. Since themost important pathological process during the development of diabetes involves three key organs, i.e., pancreatic islets, liver, and skeletal muscle, almost all anti-diabetic therapies are aimed at theseorgans. Pharmacological treatment is indicated when fasting glucose level exceeds 140 mg/dL, the postprandial glucose level exceeds 160 mg/dL or HbA 1c exceeds 8.0 percent.10 Pharmacological Treatment and Limitations Oral Glucose-Lowering Drugs In the United States, five classes of oral agents are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. By conventional standards, oral therapy is indicated in any patient with type 2 diabetes inwhom diet and exercise fail to achieve acceptable glycemic control. 10 Although initial responses may be good, oral hypoglycemic drugs may lose theireffectiveness in a significant percentage of pa- tients. The include sulfonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides. Sulfonylureas, second generation sulfonylureas, enhance insulin secre- tion from the pancreatic beta-cells. A significant side effect is hypoglycemia. Sulfonylurea therapyis also usually associated with weight gain due to hyperinsulinemia, 11,12 which has been implicated as a cause of secondary drug failure.10-12 Biguanides include the drug metformin, which was originally derived from a medicinal plant, Galega officinalis . Metformin reduces plasma glucose via inhibition of hepatic glucose production and increase of muscle glucose uptake. It also reduces plasma triglyceride and LDL-cho-lesterol levels. Side effects include weakness, fa- tigue, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, lac- tic acidosis, and kidney toxicity. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors include the drug acarbose. This drug category decreases post- prandial glucose levels by interfering with carbo-hydrate digestion and delaying gastrointestinal absorption of glucose. The major side effects are gas, bloating, and diarrhea.Alternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002 Page 47 Review Type 2 Diabetes Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written PermissionThiazolidinediones are represented by troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These expensive oral agents work by improving insulin sensitivity in muscle and, to a much lesser extent,in the liver. These drugs decrease plasma triglyc- eride levels, but such decrease may be associated with weight gain and an increase in LDL-choles-terol levels. Liver toxicity is a concern requiring monthly monitoring of liver function. Since troglitazone (Rezulin) is more toxic to the liverthan rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (having re- sulted in dozens of deaths from liver failure), in March 2000 the FDA asked the manufacturer ofRezulin to remove the product from the market. Meglitinides (drug name Repaglinide) augment insulin secretion, but weight gain,gastrointestinal disturbances, and hypoglycemia are possible side effects. Insulin Therapy Insulin is usually added to an oral agent when glycemic control issuboptimal at maximal doses of oral medica- tions. Some diabet-ologists prefer to initiate insulin therapy in patients with newly diagnosedtype 2 diabetes. 10 Weight gain and hypoglycemia are common side effectsof insulin therapy. 13-16 Vigorous insulin treat-ment may also carry anincreased risk of athero- genesis. 14 Table 1 sum- marizes various limita-tions of current drug therapies. Exercise Any exercise prescription should be indi- vidualized to account for patient interests, physi- cal status, capacity, and motivation. Exercising fiveor six times per week enhances weight reduction. Because many people with diabetes have not beenactive, exercise should start at a low level and gradually increase to avoid adverse effects such as injury, hypoglycemia, or cardiac problems. 17,18 Conventional Approach to Diet Therapy Given the heterogeneous nature of type 2 diabetes, no single dietary approach is appropri- ate for all patients. Meal plans and diet modifica-tions are generally individualized by a registered dietitian to meet patient needs and lifestyle. A typi- cal conventional approach would recommend adiet composed of 60-65 percent carbohydrate, 25- 35 percent fat, and 10-20 percent protein, with lim- ited or no alcohol consumption. 19 Alternative Approaches Alternative therapies with anti-diabetic activity have been researched relativelyextensively, particularly in India. Ideal therapies should have a similar degree of efficacy without the troublesome side effects associated withTable 1.

Alternative treatments for diabetes have become increasingly popular the last several years,16 including medicinal herbs, nutritional supplementation, acupuncture, and hottub therapy. Medicinal Herbs Many conventional drugs have been de- rived from prototypic molecules in medicinal plants. Metformin exemplifies an efficacious oral glucose-lowering agent. Its development wasbased on the use to treat dia- betes. 20 Galega in guanidine, the hypoglycemic component.21-23 Because guanidine is too toxic for clinical use, the alkyl biguanides synthalin A and synthalin B were introduced as oral anti-diabetic agents in Europe in the 1920sbut were discontinued after insulin became more widely available. However, experience with guani- dine and biguanides prompted the developmentof metformin. 24,25 To date, over 400 traditional plant treat- ments for diabetes have been reported,20 although only a small number of these have received scien- tific and medical evaluation to assess their effi- cacy. The hypoglycemic effect of some herbalextracts has been confirmed in human and animal models of type 2 diabetes. The World Health Or- ganization Expert Committee on diabetes has rec-ommended that traditional medicinal herbs be fur- ther investigated. 20 The following is a summary of several of the most studied and commonly usedmedicinal herbs. Ginseng Species The root of ginseng has been used for over 2,000 years in the Far East for its health-promot- ing properties. In recent years, it has consistently been one of the top ten selling herbs in the UnitedStates. Of the several species of ginseng, Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) are commonly used. Constitu-ents of all ginseng species include ginsenosides, polysaccharides, peptides, polyacetylenic alcohol, and fatty acids. 26 Most pharmacological actions of ginseng are attributed to ginsenosides, a family of steroids named steroidal saponins.27,28 Thechemical composition of ginseng products and potency may vary with the plant extract deriva- tive, the age of the root, the location where grown, the season when harvested, and the methods ofdrying. 29,30 Data from animal studies indicate that both Asian ginseng31,32 and American ginseng33,34 have significant hypoglycemic action. This blood glucose-lowering effect appears to be attributed to ginsenoside Rb-2 and more specifically topanaxans I, J, K and L in type 1 diabetic mod- els. 35-39 But whether these constituents have a simi- lar effect on type 2 diabetes is as yet unknown. There is some clinical evidence on ginseng's hypoglycemic activity. Sotaniemi et al demonstrated a reduction in the levels of fastingblood glucose and HbA 1c in type 2 diabetics treated with a small dose (100-200 mg) of ginseng rela- tive to placebo.40 Ginseng also elevated mood, improved psychophysiological performance and physical activity, and reduced body weight.40 Vuksan et al also demonstrated that 3 g American ginseng, when given 40 minutes prior to the test meal, significantly lowered the blood glucose in both non-diabetic subjects and type 2 diabetic pa-tients. 41 However, when ginseng was given to- gether with meals, this effect did not persist in non- diabetic subjects. Vuksan proposed several plau-sible hypotheses regarding ginseng's mechanisms of action: (1) ginseng may slow the digestion of food, decreasing the rate of carbohydrate absorp-tion into portal hepatic circulation; 30,42 (2) ginseng may affect glucose transport, which is mediated by nitric oxide (NO);32, 43-45 and (3) ginseng may modulate NO-mediated insulin secretion.46 It was recently shown that NO stimulates glucose-depen- dent secretion of insulin in rat islet cells.47 There are few reports of adverse effects of ginseng, despite the fact that it is estimated six million people ingest it regularly in the UnitedStates. 48 The most commonly reported side effects of ginseng are nervousness and excitation, but these diminish with continued use or dosage re-duction. 48 Ginseng may exert an estrogen-like ef- fect in postmenopausal women, nodularity and vaginal bleed-ing. 49,50 Ginseng may inhibit the effects of war- farin51 and interact with the monoamine oxidaseAlternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002 Page 49 Review Type 2 Diabetes Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

No Reprint Without Written Permissioninhibitor phenelzine.52 Often, such case reports fail to provide sufficient details concerning the type or quality of ginseng used, or whether the prepa- ration actually contained ginseng orginsenoside. 53,54 Massive overdose can bring about ginseng abuse syndrome, which is characterized by hypertension, insomnia, hypertonia, andedema. 48 The recommended daily ginseng dosage is 1-3 g of the crude root, or 200-600 mg of a stan-dardized extract. 55 As the possibility of hormone- like or hormone-inducing effects cannot be ruled out, some authors suggest limiting treatment tothree months. 55 Momordica charantia (Bitter Melon) Momordica charantia, also known as bit- ter melon, balsam pear, or karela, has been referred to as both a vegetable and a fruit, and is widely cultivated in Asia, Africa, and South America. Ithas been used extensively in folk medicines as a remedy for diabetes. The blood sugar-lowering action of the fresh juice or unripe fruit has beenestablished in animal experimental models as well as human clinical trials. 56,57 Bitter melon is composed of several com- pounds with confirmed anti-diabetic properties. Alcohol-extracted charantin from Momordica charantia consists of mixed steroids and was found to be more potent than the oral hypoglycemic agent tolbutamide in an animal study.58 Bitter melon also contains an insulin-like polypeptide, polypeptide-P, similar in structure to bovine insulin. It was found to decrease blood sugar levels when injected subcutaneously into type 1 diabetic patients. 59 The oral administration of bitter melon preparations has also shown satisfactory results in clinical tri- als in type 2 diabetic patients. Welihinda et al showed glucose tolerance was improved in 73 percent of type 2 diabetic pa- tients given 57 g of the juice.56 In another study, 15 g of the aqueous extract of bitter melon pro- duced a 54-percent decrease in postprandial blood sugar levels and a 17-percent reduction inglycosylated hemoglobin in six patients. 57 The mechanism of bitter melon's activity in lowering blood glucose is unknown, but in diabetic rabbitmodels it has been proposed to possess a direct action similar to insulin and was found effective in lowering blood glucose in alloxan-treated rab- bits.60 Bailey and Day report the herb appears to inhibit gluconeogenesis.20 The recommended dose of bitter melon depends on the form it is being consumed. Dos-age for tincture ranges from 5 mL two to three times daily to as high as 50 mL per day. 61 How- ever, bitter melon juice is very difficult to makepalatable since, as the name implies, it is quite bitter. To avoid the bitter taste, the Indians and Chinese crush the herbs and form tablets. In Cen-tral America, it is prepared as an extract or decoc- tion. Hepatic portal inflammation and testicular lesions in dogs have been reported with excessiveadministration of cerasee (a component of the wild variety of bitter melon). 62 Dosages of capsulized dried powder range from 3-15 g daily. That is quitea large dose so to avoid the necessity of taking so many capsules, a standardized extract may be used at dosages of 100-200 mg three times daily. Trigonella foenum graecum (Fenugreek ) Trigonella foenum graecum has been used as a remedy for diabetes, particularly in India.63 The active principal is in the defatted portion of the seed, which contains the alkaloid trigonelline, acid, and coumarin. g/kg daily) to both nor- mal and diabetic dogs reduced fasting and post- prandial blood levels of glucose, glucagon, soma-tostatin, insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycer- ides, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels. 64 Hu- man studies have confirmed the glucose- and lipid-lowering effects. 58 At least 50 percent of seeds is fiber and may constitute another potential mecha- nism of fenugreek's beneficial effect in diabeticpatients. 65 In type 2 diabetic patients, the ingestion of 15 g of powdered fenugreek seed soaked inwater significantly reduced postprandial glucose levels during the glucose tolerance test. 65 Dosages of the fiber range from 10-100 g daily in divideddosages. Urine may have a maple syrup smell af- ter fenugreek consumption. 66 No other side effects have been reported to date although, because ofPage 50 Alternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002Type 2 Diabetes Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissionthe possibility of it affecting blood sugar by slow- ing absorption, oral medications should be taken at a different time than fenugreek. Gymnema sylvestre (Gurmar ) Gymnema sylvestre , a plant native to the tropical forests of India (Figure 1), has long been used as a treatment for diabetes. Gymnema sylvestre appeared on the U.S market several years ago, hyped as a \"sugar blocker.\" In a study of type 2 diabetes, 22 patients were given 400 mgGymnema sylvestre extract daily along with their oral hypoglycemic drugs. All patients demon- strated improved blood sugar control. Twenty-oneof 22 were able to reduce their oral hypoglycemic drug dosage considerably, and five patients were able to discontinue oral medication and maintainblood sugar control with the Gymnema extract alone. 67 It was postulated that Gymnema sylvestre enhances the production of endogenous dosage of Gymnema sylvestre extract is 400-600 mg/day. One of its side effects may be a reduction or loss of the taste sensation of sweetness and bitterness, although this occursonly if the plant is directly exposed to the tongue. 61 Allium cepa and Allium sativum Studies (on- ions) and Allium sativum (garlic) have blood sugar lowering effects.69,70 Volatile oils in raw onion and garlic cloves have been shown to lower fastingglucose concentration in both diabetic animals and human subjects. 71 The active components are be- lieved to be sulfur-containing compounds - garlic. Researchers have postu- lated that these active ingredients lower glucoselevels by competing with insulin (which is also a disulfide) for insulin-inactivating sites in the liver, 70 resulting in an increase of free insulin. Onion ex- tracts reduce blood sugar levels in a dose-depen- dent manner.69 A typical dosage of Allium cepa is one 400 mg capsule daily. The general daily dos- age of garlic is 4 g fresh garlic or 8 mg essential oil.72 Pterocarpus marsupium and other Epicatechin-containing Plants Pterocarpus marsupium has a long his- tory of use in India as a treatment for diabetes. The flavanoid, (-)-epicatechin, extracted from thebark of this plant has been shown to prevent beta- cell damage in rats. In addition, both epicatechin and a crude alcohol extract of Pterocarpus mar- supium have been shown to regenerate functional pancreatic beta-cells in diabetic animals. 73,74 Epicatechin and catechin consist of glycosides and esters. They of are also good sources of flavan-3-ols. Since Pterocarpus is not very com- mon in the United States, green tea may be a suit-able alternative, although further study would be necessary to confirm this.Figure 1. Gymnema sylvestre Alternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002 Page 51 Review Type 2 Diabetes Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written PermissionIn an open trial, conducted at four centers in India, Pterocarpus at doses of 2-4 g daily was found to have significant glucose-lowering effects in patients with mild type 2 diabetes.76 Ninety- seven patients participated in the 12-week trial. By the end of the trial, 67 patients had attained good blood sugar control with 2 g (73%), 3 g(16%), shrubby plant that grows in Eu- rope (Figure 2). Leaves of bilberry were widely used as a treatment for diabetes before the avail-ability of insulin. 20 Oral administration of bilberry leaf tea reduced blood sugar levels in normal and diabetic dogs, even when glucose was concurrentlyinjected intravenously. 77 Bilberry also has a ben- microvascular abnormalities of dia- betes,78,79 particularly retinopathy. In the case of vascular complications, however, the fruit rather than the leaf is used, with the anthocyanosides being the most important constituent.80 The stan- dard dose of bilberry fruit extract is based on its anthocyanoside contents and is 80-160 mg three times daily of a 25-percent anthocyanoside extract.The ideal dosage of bilberry leaf for lowering blood sugar has not been elucidated. Atriplex halimus (Salt Bush) Atriplex halimus (salt bush) is a plant na- tive to Israel, where much of the clinical data has been collected. Small animals called sand ratsdevelop type 2 diabetes when deprived of this plant. 81 The data on its use for type 2 diabetes in humans is limited to unpublished reports in which3 g/day decreased blood glucose levels. 82,83 Aloe vera The dried sap (fluid) of Aloe vera is a tra- ditional remedy used for diabetes in the Arabian peninsula. Ghannam et al reported a hypoglyce- mic effect of Aloe vera in both type 2 diabetic patients and in an animal model.84 Aloe vera juice is prepared from Aloe vera gel, a mucilaginous preparation obtained from the leaves of the plant.Oral administration of the juice has been reportedto reduce fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels in type 2 diabetic patients with or withoutcombination of a conventional anti-diabetic agent. 85-87 The amount used was one tablespoon of Aloe vera juice twice daily with no significant adverse effects reported. Mineral Supplementation The treatment of diabetes requires nutri- tional supplementation, as these patients have a greatly increased need for many nutrients. Sup- plying the diabetic with additional key nutrientshas been shown to improve blood sugar control as well as help prevent or ameliorate many major complications of diabetes.Figure 2.

No Reprint Without Written PermissionChromium Chromium is an essential micronutrient for humans. Considerable experimental and epi- demiological evidence now indicates that chro- mium levels are a major determinant of insulinsensitivity, as it functions as a cofactor in all insu- lin-regulating activities. 88 Chromium facilitates insulin binding and subsequent uptake of glucoseinto the cell. Supplemental chromium has been shown to decrease fasting glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance, lower insulin levels, and de-crease total cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL cholesterol in normal, elderly, and type 2 diabetic subjects. 89,90 Without chromium, insulin's action is blocked and glucose levels are elevated.89 Chromium picolinate, a trivalent chro- mium (Cr3+), is one of the forms of chromium that exhibits biological activity.91 A large clinical study on 180 diabetic patients documents the benefit ofchromium picolinate for type 2 diabetic patients. In the study, while patients continued their nor- mal medication, they were placed in one of threegroups: placebo group, 100 mcg chromium picolinate twice daily, or 500 mcg chromium picolinate twice daily. There were significant dose-and time-dependent decreases in glycosylated he- moglobin, fasting glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose levels, fasting and two-hour postprandialinsulin values, and total cholesterol, particularly in the 500 mcg twice daily group. 92 However, not all studies on chromium have yielded positive re-sults. In a controlled six-month study to determine the effect of 200 mcg/day chromium picolinate on individuals with type 2 diabetes, Lee andReasner reported a decrease in triglycerides but no statistical difference between control and chro- mium-treated subjects with respect to measuredparameters of glucose control. 93 This dosage is considerably smaller than that found effective at lowering glucose in other studies so may explainthe disparate findings among studies. Although no recommended daily allow- ance (RDA) has been established for chromium,over 200 mcg/day appears necessary for optimal blood sugar regulation. A good supply of chro- mium is assured by supplemental chromium 94 inaddition to dietary sources. Good dietary sources are brewer's yeast63 and barley flour,95 while re- fined sugars, white flour products, and lack of exercise can deplete chromium levels. Trivalent chromium has long been con- sidered to be a safe nutritional supplement.96 Al- though the hexavalent form of chromium is aknown human respiratory tract carcinogen when inhaled in high-exposure industrial settings, there is no evidence of any carcinogenesis in humansfrom the trivalent form of chromium found in chro- mium supplements. 97,98 Further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of trivalent chromium in dia-betes treatment may be warranted. Vanadium Prior to the discovery of insulin in 1922, vanadium was used for the control of blood sugar. Two small studies (one with six type 2 diabetic patients, one with seven type 2 diabetic patients)have confirmed the effectiveness of vanadyl sul- fate at a dose of 100 mg/day in improving insulin sensitivity. 99,100 Magnesium A deficiency of magnesium is signifi- cantly more common in type 2 diabetics than in the general population.101 Magnesium deficiency has been associated with complications of diabe- tes, retinopathy in particular. One study found patients with the most severe retinopathy were alsolowest in magnesium. 102 Nutrients used in type 2 diabetes are sum- marized in Table 2. Physical Interventions: Acupuncture and Hydrotherapy Acupuncture is best known in the United States as an alternative therapy for chronic pain.However, it has been used for the treatment of dia- betes and related complications during the past several decades. There are numerous Chinese pub-lications on the use of acupuncture for diabetes, but only those published in English will be cited here. Acupuncture may be effective in treating notonly diabetes, but also in preventing and manag- ing complications of the disease. 103Alternative Medicine Review N Volume 7, Number 1 N 2002 Page 53 Review Type 2 Diabetes Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

No Reprint Without Written PermissionThe effects of acu- puncture on dia- betes mentally 104,105 mus. 106 Acupunc- ture can act on the pancreas to enhance insulinsynthesis, in- crease the num- ber of receptorson target cells, and accelerate the utilization ofglucose, resulting in lowering of blood sugar. 106 Data from other studies have shown the beneficial anti-obesity effect of acupuncture,105 which is the most modifiable risk factor for type 2diabetes. It appears that the therapeutic effect ofacupuncture on diabetes is not the result of its ac- tion on one single organ, but on multiple systems. Four commonly used points are: (1) Zusanli point, located three inches below the lat- eral knee depression, one finger width from the lateral side of the anterior crest of the tibia; (2)Sanyinjiao point, located three inches above the tip of the inner ankle, on the posterior margin of the metatarsal bone; (3) Feishu point, located 1.5inches lateral and inferior to the spinous process of the third thoracic vertebra in a prone position; and (4) Shenshu point, located 1.5 inches lateralto the posterior midline, lateral and inferior to the spinous process of the second lumbar vertebra ina prone position. These acupuncture points were selected based on traditional Chinese medicine theory. During the treatment, other points can be added according to symptoms and signs. 103 Other methods have also been employed such as point injection with normal saline, small dose insulin, and Chinese herbal medicine extracts. Treatmentis generally given once daily or once every other day as a course of 14-21 treatments. It is believed that the longer the course of treatment, the moremarked will be the effect. Acupuncture can be effective in treating complications of diabetes, often with marked im-provement in clinical symptoms. Better therapeu- tic results are obtained in patients with dietary control than in those without it. Physical exercise,breathing exercises, and massage can help improve the therapeutic effect.Table 2.

Since hot-tub therapy can increase blood flow to skeletal muscles, it has been recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes who are unable to exercise.107 A study reported that eight patients were asked to sit in a hot tub for 30 minutes daily for three weeks. During the study period, patients' weight, mean plasma glucose level, and meanglycosylated hemoglobin decreased. 107 Caution should be taken that the water not be too hot as neuropathy may prevent the patient from noticingthey are burning themselves. In addition, poor cir- culation can result in increased metabolic demands when feet become heated - demands that cannotbe met by the diabetic patient. Proper water sani- tation and appropriate guidance should be consid- ered when prescribing hot-tub therapy for diabeticpatients. 108 Conclusion Alternative therapies with anti- hyperglycemic effects are increasingly sought by patients with diabetes. This comes as no surprise since alternative treatments have been most widelyused in chronic diseases, which may be only par- tially alleviated by conventional treatment. Herbal medications are the most commonly used alterna-tive therapy for blood sugar control; however, their safety and efficacy need to be further evaluated by well-designed, controlled clinical studies. Be-cause various non-standardized forms of the herbs have often been the testing material, the results have been difficult to replicate. Therefore, prepa-ration of standardized medicinal herbs is urgently needed in future studies and therapies. Although herbs used for diabetes are less likely to have thedrawbacks of conventional drugs, potential ad- verse herb-drug interactions should be kept in mind for patients also receiving conventional anti-diabetic medications. Several minerals have been found to ben- efit people with diabetes, either because of poten-tial deficiencies or because of the beneficial ef- fect on glucose metabolism. Among the most important minerals for supplementation arechromium, magnesium, and vanadium. Other po- tentially beneficial treatments for type 2 diabetes include acupuncture and hydrotherapy.
