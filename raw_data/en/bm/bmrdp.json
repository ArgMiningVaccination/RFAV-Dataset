infants a\u0000ected by the opioid epidemic\u0000 including newborn babies who have drug withdrawal symptoms\u0000 known as neonatal abstinence syndrome\u0000 When Patrick began his research\u0000 the link between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths was clear\u0000 but the relationship between opioid exposure and newborn health was not\u0000 His \u0000ndings have shown that the number of infants diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome grew nearly sevenfold between \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 and \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 nationwide\u0000 His research found a link between higher rates of the syndrome and long\u0000term unemployment\u0000 especially in rural areas\u0000 and his \u0000ndings have had a direct impact on policy changes that bene\u0000t children\u0000 For instance\u0000
