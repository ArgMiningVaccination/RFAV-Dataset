NEEM ALOE VERA EUCALYPTUS \"I came across Holy Sanity's Hand Sanitiser at the start of the pandemic and since then I've had the pleasure of trying out their Manjish Elixir Night Face Oil and their essential oils. My skin doesn't always respond well to products so I was initially hesitant to try the Manjish Elixir. The product has blown me away! I haven't had any breakouts, my skin feels hydrated and I've had so many compliments about my glowing skin. I will be looking at adding the Saffron Glow Day Face Oil to my skincare routine as well ! Their essential oils smell gorgeous and the scent really lingers even after I have turned off my diffuser. My personal favourite is the Organic Rose Geranium. I cannot recommend their products enough!\" - Karishma Singh \"Without a doubt the most luxurious and best smelling hand sanitisers on the market! I've purchased the 'Moisturising Hand Sanitiser Essential Plus with Eucalyptus and Aloe Vera' and the 'Moisturising Hand Sanitiser Essential Plus with Lemon Myrtle' and they're just fantastic. My hands aren't dry after using them, smells incredible and I love that they're all Australian Made. I cannot recommend this product enough and their exceptionally high customer service.\" - Gazal Kamali \"Our second order from Holy Sanity and we couldn't be happier. We were recommended this product by friends after experiencing dry hands from using other sanitisers. After using Holy Sanity on a daily basis, my hands have never felt smoother, cleaner or smelt better. The ordering process was seamless and we have continually recommended the fantastic product to many friends and family. Do yourself a favour, support a great Australian company and make the best of a bad situation with some Holy Sanity.\" - Matthew Lang \"LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! I use hand sanitiser in my job all day long and it has been so difficult to find something that hasn't left my hands feeling so dry and rough until I found Holy Sanity! Added bonus that it leaves my car smelling so fresh all the "}
