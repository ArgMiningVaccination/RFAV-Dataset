While your first instinct may be to run the other way, there are several benefits to keeping them around. Snakes keep [rodent](https://www.callnorthwest.com/identify-pest/rodents/) populations under control, with a single snake able to eat 3 to 4 mice at one time. They also eat [moles](https://www.callnorthwest.com/identify-pest/wildlife/moles/), voles, [insects](https://www.callnorthwest.com/identify-pest/), and even fish. When Do Snakes Come Out? Snakes are more commonly encountered when temperatures average between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, usually during the spring and throughout the summer. They are most active in the early morning and late afternoon, as summer temperatures are often too hot for them to be out in during the hottest times of the day. Snake activity will pick back up again in late summer and early fall before they go into hibernation or brumation. Brumation is more common in southern states where the climate is warmer, and snow is less likely. Snakes don't actually sleep in brumation, but rather their bodies adjust to the lower temperatures, slowing down their metabolism and making them less active. On warm winter days, brumating snakes will sometimes come out to bask in the sunshine, often surprising unsuspecting people with their presence. While calling a professional [pest control company](https://www.callnorthwest.com/) is a guaranteed and safe way to tackle a snake problem, there are also some home remedies you can try to repel snakes.

Home Remedies to Keep Snakes Away: Eliminate Food Supplies Snakes are often found in areas where rodents are present, as this is one of their primary food sources. Snakes are also known to eat frogs, birds, moles, voles, insects, and even fish. If you have a problem with any of these animals, consider getting rid of that pest issue first. Once the source of food has been eliminated, snakes will move on in search of another source of food. Eliminate Hiding Places Snakes prefer dark, damp places and are known to live and hide in cracks, crevices, and holes. Eliminating these hiding places can help deter snakes from taking up residence on your property. Carefully inspect the exterior of your home and your property and repair any cracks or holes you find. Repair any damaged [gutters](https://www.callnorthwest.com/gutter-care/), piping, and ventilation ducts. Repair or replace any damaged screens on windows and doors. Snakes will also hide in wood piles and compost heaps. If possible, store firewood in sealed, lockable wood boxes. Try to get rid of any piles of wood chip mulch, straw mulch, leaves, etc., that may be collecting on your property. Change Up Your Landscaping If your yard or garden is prone to snakes, consider making changes that will deter these pests from coming in. Garden regularly to remove any snake attractants like debris, holes, and overgrowth. Keep the grass cut short of eliminating hiding places for snakes. Consider installing snake-proof fencing made of steel mesh, plastic sheeting, or a catch net. If you do install fencing, make sure it is flush with the ground and angled outward and that it is at least 3 feet high and 4 feet deep. You can also use materials that make it difficult for snakes to slither over, like holly leaves, pine cones, egg shells, and gravel. You can also consider planting snake-repellent plants that provide a natural deterrent. Some common examples include marigolds, lemongrass, and wormwood. Use Natural Predators Foxes and [raccoons](https://www.callnorthwest.com/identify-pest/wildlife/raccoons/) are common predators of snakes. Guinea hens, turkeys, pigs, and cats will also help keep snakes away. If foxes are indigenous to your area, fox urine is a very good natural repellent for snakes when spread around your property. Smoke Them Out Snakes have an elevated sense of smell and are ultra-sensitive to odours and fumes. One smell they particularly dislike is smoke. One remedy is to dig a fire pit and let it smoke for several days - covering the embers with moss and leaves can give you the best effect. Utilize Natural Products There are several natural products that work well as snake repellents. Some of the more common ones include: - Naphthalene: Naphthalene is a common ingredient found in many commercial snake-repellent products. It is one of the most common snake repellents. If you don't want to spend money on a commercial product, naphthalene is also the main ingredient found in mothballs. The smell of naphthalene irritates snakes without harming them. Place mothballs in holes, cracks, crevices, or any other areas around your property where snakes may be a problem. One caveat to using moth balls is they can be toxic and fatal to children or pets if they are ingested, so use caution or avoid using them if you have pets or children in your home. - Sulfur: Powdered sulfur is a great option to repel snakes. Place powdered sulfur around your home and property, and once snakes slither across it; it irritates their skin so they won't return. Sulfur does give off a strong odour, so consider wearing a mask that covers your nose and mouth when applying it. - Clove & Cinnamon Oil: Clove and cinnamon oil are effective snake repellents. These should be mixed together in a spray bottle and sprayed directly on snakes for maximum effect. Use caution, as snakes will often run in the opposite direction of the spray. This mixture can also be used in a diffuser indoors as a fumigant, as well. - Garlic & Onions: The sulfonic acid in garlic and onions (the same chemical that makes us cry when we chop onions) repels snakes. Mix these with rock salt and sprinkle them around your home and yard for effectiveness. You can also infuse garlic into any essential oil and use it to fumigate rafters, basements, and other hard-to-reach places. - Ammonia: Snakes dislike the odour of ammonia, so one option is to spray it around any affected areas. Another option is to soak a rug in ammonia and place it in an unsealed bag near any areas inhabited by snakes to deter them away. - Vinegar: Vinegar is effective at repelling snakes near bodies of water, including swimming pools. Pour white vinegar around the perimeter of any body of water for a natural snake repellent. - Lime: Create a mixture of snake-repellent lime and hot pepper or peppermint and pour it around the perimeter of your home or property. Snakes don't like the smell of the mixture, and the fumes are also itchy on their skin. If home remedies to keep snakes away aren't working, consider calling a [wildlife control company](https://www.callnorthwest.com/wildlife-animal-control/) for snake removal, snake prevention recommendations, and possibly other [exterminating services](https://www.callnorthwest.com/) like rodent control that could be contributing to the issue.
