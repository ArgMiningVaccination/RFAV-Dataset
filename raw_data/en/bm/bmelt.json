Yes. It is the duty of anyone in charge of a public or private school, kindergarten, boarding school, or day nursery to report within one business day to the local health officer the presence or suspected presence o f any of the reportable communicable d iseases (Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a72508). Laboratory confirmation is not needed to report a suspect case. Schools should provide the following information when repor ting a suspect case to Public Health: (Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a72500 (d)). Name of the disea se reported Date of onset Date of diagnosis Immunization statusName, address, telephone number, Social Security Number, occupation, race/ethnic group, sex, age, and date of birth of case Name, address and telephone number of reporting facility Am I breaching a student's confidentiality by sharing their personal information with Public Health? No. In the case of reporting a person suspected to hav e a vaccine preventable disease, California Code of Regulations 2500 allows the release of personal information to the local Public Health authority for any person with a suspect reportable disease. In the case of an outbreak or a highly infectious disease, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) contain s limited exceptions to its prior consent rule to disclose identifiable information from the education record. One of these exceptions allows disclosure of personally identifiable information to appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency. In the case of sharing i mmunization records of all students, Health and Safety Codes 120325 (d) and 120375 (c) allow health departments to obtain immunization records to determine immu nization deficiencies. Can students/staff remain out of daycare/school if exposed to a VPD? Yes. Public Health will make the determination whether students and staff who are unvaccinated and were exposed to certain vaccine preventable diseases should not attend school/daycare and extracurricular activities. Public Health will determine when it is safe for unvaccinated and exposed children and staff to return to school (California Health and Safety Code, Division 10 5. Part 2. Immunizations 120335 (b)). During the investigation of a reported case, an unusual disease, or an outbreak si tuation, a Public Health health officer shall take whatever steps deemed necessary for the vaccine preventable disease investigation, including taking appropriate steps to prevent or control the spread of the diseases (Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a7 2501; 45 CFR 164.512(b)). Understanding federal related to vaccine-pr eventable d iseases (VPDs) can help prevent the s pread of disea se in your daycare o r school. This fact sheet aims t o prov ide you with the information needed to educate students, families, staff and the general community about legally-man dated VPD prevention and control activities u ndertaken by the Los Angeles C ounty Department of Public Health ( Public Health). 14 Note: Not all information may be requested by Public Health Los Angeles County Department of Public Healt h http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/VPD_pertussi s.htm Rev. 5/9/18 Federal and California Reportable Disease Legislation Fact Shee t Information for Daycare/Preschools/Schools and Parents What is the purpose of keeping unvaccinated and exposed persons out of daycare/preschool/school? The purpose of keeping unvaccinated and exposed students and sta ff out of school is to protect the students, school community and general community from VPDs, which may be spread at s chool before the exposed individual develops symptoms of infection. Students and staff who a re exposed to a VPD and are unvaccinated and not immune to the VPD have led to the ongoi ng spread of disease in addition to acquiring serious illness themselves. What can staff do to prevent VPDs in their preschool/school communities? Daycares/schools are legally re sponsible for managing records o f immunizations on a routine basis ( California Health and Safety Code, Division 105. Part 2. Immuni zations 120325 (d)). Public Health has full access to the immunization status of each student in schools to determine immunizatio n deficiencies (California Health and Safety Code, Division 105. Part 2. Immuni zations 120375 (c)). What if a child has a medical exemption? A child with a medical exemption who is unvaccinated may be asked to stay home for disease protection purposes. For a valid medical exemption, a parent or guardian must submit a written statement from a licensed physician (M.D. or D.O.) which provides the following information: A statement that the physical condition or medical circumstance s of the child are such that the required immunization(s) is contraindicated. A statement regarding which v accines are being exempted A statement whether the medical exemption i s permanent or tempo rary An indication of the expiration date, if the exemption is tempo rary Are \"homeopathic \" vaccines or \"nosode s\" acceptable to meet a student's immunization requirements for entry into school? No. \"Homeopathic \" vaccines or \"nosodes\" do not meet the immunization requirement s detailed in the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, section 6020. The United States childhood immunization schedule is based upon scientifically validated re commendations made by a non- governmental-led board of individuals, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Only vaccines licensed by the FDA are recommended by the ACIP and subsequently adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with their state and local entities to meet daycare and school immunization requirem ents. Homeopathic vaccines or \"nosodes\" do not meet the immunization requirements for school entry. 15Can a student enter daycare/preschool/school with a schedule that deviates from the required vaccine schedule? Students must follow the required Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention (CDC)/Advisory Committee on Immunizatio n Practices (ACIP) vaccine schedule by age and grade before school entry. Any schedule that deviates from this schedule or \"alternative schedules \" are prohibited for school entry (Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a7 6020).Los Angeles C ounty http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ip/VPD_pertussis.htm Rev. 5/9/2018 Referenced Legislation Statu tes in Fact Sheet Information for Daycare/Preschools/Schools and Parents Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a72500, \u00a72593, 'Health care provider' means a physician and surgeon, a veterinarian, a podiatrist, a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, a registered nurse, a nurse midwife, a school nurse, an infection control practitioner, a medical examiner, a coroner, or a dentist. \u00a72500.
