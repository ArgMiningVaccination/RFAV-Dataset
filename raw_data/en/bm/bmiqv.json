All human activities like walking, eating, swimming, etc., are a function of energy. The energy in your body can be compared to a battery in your car, without it your car won't run. When the human energy is working well, you are in good health. It is when this energy goes in disarray that illnesses can occur. The disorder of energy can be divided into three categories: Deficiency, Excess or Rebellious. Deficiency means shortage, weakness, and decline. Some of the prevailing symptoms are fatigue, low resistance to illness, shortness of breath, weak voice, poor spirit, pale sallow complexion, pale tongue, loose stools, cold hands and feet, profuse pale urination, prolapsed of organs, weak pulse, etc. Excess means too much therefore it causes a congestion or blockage. Some typical symptoms of excess energy are swelling, breast tenderness, belching, pain in any part of the body, thirst, constipation, bloating, etc. Energy should flow throughout the body without difficulty. However, some factors like stress (physical and emotional), irregular eating pattern and external injuries can affect the energy flow negatively causing sluggishness and stagnation. Rebellious energy can be seen in coughing associated with asthma or with some respiratory conditions. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, or acid reflux associated with gastro-intestinal conditions or pregnancy. It is called rebellious because it is not following the correct pathway they are supposed to travel insidde the body, instead it goes the opposite direction. Some of these conditions can be treated effectively by acupuncture; others by a combination of acupuncture, herbs and Qigong exercise especially the long standing medical condition. Nutrition and some moderate changes in lifestyle are also important factors in the healing process. The practicioner of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine takes into consideration all of the prevailing signs and symptoms and based on the principle of energy disorder, can minimize the excess energy, strengthen the deficient energy or subdue the rebellious energy.
