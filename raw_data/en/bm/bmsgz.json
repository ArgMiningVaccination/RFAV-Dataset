Your energy is a culmination of interconnected physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual energy. Intuitive energy healing works with your entire self to illuminate, clarify and heal your energy. By doing this you can feel your authentic best. Blocked energy negatively impacts your overall health and well-being both internally and externally. How your energy functions within will greatly influence your quality of life and experience without. Ancient healers knew that imbalances in body, mind or emotions ultimately were rooted in an imbalance (or sickness) of Spirit. Intuitive energy healing connects the physical with the spiritual by addressing and resolving these imbalances. These imbalances present differently in different individuals. Most present spiritually, mentally, or emotionally but in some severe cases physically. Each requires specific energetic and spiritual treatments to promote lasting, positive results. Examples of spiritual imbalances: - Power Loss / Loss of Life-force - Soul Loss / Loss of Spirit - Intrusion / Energy that is not yours - or another kind of block By balancing and fulfilling your spiritual nature growth and true healing are experienced. An imbalanced and unfulfilled spiritual nature can exacerbate or cause several problems. These include disease, suffering, pain, tension, discomfort, anxiety, depression, trauma, repeating unhealthy patterns, emotional difficulties, negative self-talk, and more. Intuitive energy healing works to balance your intrinsic, core, root self (your Spirit). This is necessary to sustain optimal vitality, connection, grounding, love, joy, and purpose throughout life. These are very common; however, all are undesirable. Everyone will experience an imbalance at least once in their life, and often, several times. Knowing how to navigate this will minimize the potential negative effects and optimize ease-filled living.
