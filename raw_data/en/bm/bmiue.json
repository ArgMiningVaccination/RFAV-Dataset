United States: Americans will never forget the murderous events of September 11, 2001. They are for us what Pearl Harbor was to an earlier generation of Americans: a terrible wrong and a call to action. With courage, unity, and purpose, we met the challenges of 2001. The budget for 2003 recognizes the new realities confronting our nation, and funds the war against terrorism and the defense of ourhomeland. The budget for 2003 is much more than a tabulation of numbers. It is a plan to fight a war we did not seek\u2014but a war we are determined to win. In this war, our first priority must be the security of our homeland. My budget provides the resources to combat terrorism at home, to protect our people, and preserve our constitutionalfreedoms. Our new Office of Homeland Security will coordinate the efforts of the federal government,the 50 states, the territories, the District of Columbia, and hundreds of local governments: all to produce a comprehensive and far-reaching plan for securing America against terrorist attack. Next, America's military\u2014which has fought so boldly and decisively in Afghanistan\u2014must be strengthened still further, so it can act still more effectively to find, pursue, and destroy our enemies.The 2003 Budget requests the biggest increase in defense spending in 20 years, to pay the cost of warand the price of transforming our Cold War military into a new 21 stCentury fighting force. We have priorities at home as well\u2014restoring health to our economy above all. Our economy had begun to weaken over a year before September 11th, but the terrorist attack dealt it another severe blow. This budget advances a bipartisan economic recovery plan that provides much morethan greater unemployment benefits: it is a plan to speed the return of strong economic growth, togenerate jobs, and to give unemployed Americans the dignity and security of a paycheck instead ofan unemployment check. The plan also calls for maintaining low tax rates, freer trade, restraint in government spending, regulatory and tort reform, promoting a sound energy policy, and funding key priorities in education, health, and compassionate social programs. It is a bold plan\u2014and it is matched by a bold agenda for government reform. From the beginning of my Administration, I have called for better management of the federal government. Now, with allthe new demands on our resources, better management is needed more sorely than ever. Just as theNo Child Left Behind Act of 2001 asks each local school to measure the education of our children, we must measure performance and demand results in feder al government programs. Where government programs are succeeding, their efforts should be reinforced\u2014and the 2003 Budget provides resources to do that. And when objective measures reveal that government programsare not succeeding, those programs should be reinvented, redirected, or retired. 34 THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT By curtailing unsuccessful programs and moderating the growth of spending in the rest of government, we can well afford to fight terrorism, take action to restore economic growth, andoffer substantial increases in spending for improved performance at low-income schools, key environmental programs, health care, science and technology research, and many other areas. We live in extraordinary times\u2014but America is an extraordinary country. Americans have risen to every challenge they have faced in the past. Americans are rising again to the challenges of today.A n do n c ea g a i n ,w ew i l lp r e v a i l . George W. Bush February 4, 2002A NOTE TO READERS Once in a long time, an established publication presents itself in a new format, and the occasion requires an explanation to readers grown accustomed to the old form. The President's 2003 Budgetrepresents such a change. The first differences you may notice are merely presentational, all aimed at enhancing readability. This budget attempts to simplify information, to reduce the use of jargon, and toillustrate its contentions more liberally with charts, tables, and real-life examples. Color and photographs appear for the first time. But these changes are incidental compared to a fundamental difference in emphasis. The President's Budget for 2003 seeks to inaugurate an era of accountability in the conduct of thenation's public business. It takes the first step toward reporting to taxpayers on the relativeeffectiveness of the thousands of purposes on which their money is spent. It commences the overdueprocess of seriously linking program performance to future spending levels. It asks not merely \"How much?\"; it endeavors to explain \"How well?\" These changes have been called for by good government advocates for decades. A 1949 commission headed by the 31 stPresident, Herbert Hoover, first introduced the term \"performance-based budgeting.\" Subsequent Presidents launched efforts to get better results from government. Duringthe 1990s, the Congress passed several statutes aimed at enhancing government's attention toperformance. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) in 1993 directed the executive branch to undertake the measurement of effectiveness and to reflect the answers in budget choices. As Senator John Glenn said several years later, \"The ultimate goal of GPRA is to use programperformance information to guide resource allocation decisions. I repeat that. Use programperformance information to guide resource allocation decisions. That is the important connect.\" In an initial and admittedly exploratory way, this document responds to these longstanding demands, proposing to reinforce provably strong programs, and to redirect funds in many cases from programs that demonstrably fail, or cannot offer evidence of success. Real scrutiny of results and real accountability in government were long overdue, in any case. But they are absolutely essential at a time when national security requirements mandate significantnew spending. Defeating international terrorism and defending Americans in our homeland areimperative duties of the federal government, above and beyond all its other activities. We mustprovide for these increases and fund other necessary programs without letting total spending rise unacceptably. We must demand proof of value from prog rams of lesser priority. The information on which program ratings are based is far from perfect, and some conclusions may prove erroneous over time. The Administration invites a spirited discussion and welcomesadditional data, as well as suggestions about how to measure performance better throughout thefederal government. 56 A NOTE TO READERS Bringing accountability to government goes beyond performance-based budgeting. President Bush has ordered that his appointees take responsibility for improving the day-to-day managementof the government with which they are entrusted. To that end, the President directed the creation of a reform agenda, aimed at attacking the worst shortcomings of the government he inherited. This budget includes the first agency report cards,assessing the starting point of each department in these problem areas. Reports on the progress ofeach agency in improving from these baselines will be provided regularly to the President and to thepublic. Finally, the 2003 Budget parts ways with Washington's six year experiment with 10 year forecasting. Previous budgets' attempts to look out a decade in the future have varied wildly from year to year. But 2001 showed finally how unreliable and ultimately futile such estimates are. The economic slowdown was already well underway, but its severity could not be known when the last budget was transmitted. The tragic events of September 11 thensured that the downturn became a recession, and added the inescapable new spending requirements of a two-front war.Unemployment rolls at home rose at the same time that long-neglected military needs required attention to begin what will be an ongoing campaign against terror. Revised economics alone knocked 30 percent from the hoped-for 10 year surplus. Recognizing the uncertainty of long-term projections, the Administration in its 2002 Budget had set aside $1 trillion,or 18 percent, of the estimated surplus as a contingency reserve, but even this precaution was notenough to cover the drop in forecasted revenue caused by the poor economy. For continuity purposes, the 2003 Budget updates 10 year estimates at the overall level, but puts the appropriate focus on five year figures. Beginning with this budget, agency totals and supporting details are projected for the five years that the law requires. Taken together, the above changes produce a very different sort of budget, one the Administration hopes will inform its readers in new ways, while broadening the healthy debate that always attendsthis document. Going forward, let the question we debate be not just \"What will the federalgovernment spend?\" but also \"What will the federal government achieve?\"BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS A Budget to Fight War and Recession : Places highest priority on war against terrorism overseas and at home; \u007fIncorporates the bipartisan approach to economic stimulus that assists unemployed workers and fosters job creation; \u007fReforms the budget to focus on results instead of dollars spent; and \u007fFunds high-priority initiatives while moderating growth in the rest of government.

It is a war that must be fought at home as well as abroad, a war waged on the financial, diplomatic, and intelligence frontsas much as on the battlefield. We did not choose this war\u2014but we will not shrink from it. And wewill mobilize all the necessary resources of our society to fight and to win. Fortunately, our resources are great. Yet the challenge before us is great, as well. The terrorists threaten us not with mighty armies or fleets, but with unpredictable attacks on our civilian population and critical infrastructure. Therefore, we must protect our nation by defending our homeland against new dangers from new sources. We will win the war at home and abroad bydestroying terrorist organizations and discrediting their ideology of terror. Our new war will be costly. Some of those costs will not show up on the government's books. Terrorism has already inflicted considerable losses on the private economy, and now entrepreneursand employers will have to shoulder the expense of still-tighter security at points of vulnerability. These are real and heavy burdens for our society. The Administration's tax reductions adopted by the Congress in the spring of 2001 will help lighten the load\u2014but more compensatory tax relief willbe needed if our economy is to grow as rapidly as it could. Government, too, will have new bills to pay. Since the end of the Cold War, defense has been a dwindling priority in our national budget. By the end of the 1990s, the United States was spendingless of its national income on defense than at any time since the attack on Pearl Harbor. That will have to change\u2014and the 2003 Budget reflects the new reality. Future budgets will need to do likewise. We have new duties, and we will be judged by how we meet them. We are at war, and we must pay the price to fight a war. President Bush has called the war against terrorism a \"new kind of war.\" The lessons of history are clear, and we are not immune to old mistakes. In the mid-1960s, the United States government refused to adjust its spending to account for the costs of the war in Vietnam. It insisted on having both \"guns and butter\" and got instead inflation that lasted through almost two decades and contributedto four recessions, including two of the most severe in modern times. President Franklin Roosevelt made wiser choices during World War II. As war approached, he husbanded the resources of the nation\u2014and concentrated them upon the nation's supreme priority:victory. In fact, President Roosevelt's 1944 Budget noted that expenditures not related to the war effort were reduced by more than 20 percent between 19 39 and 1942. President Roosevelt's vision preserved freedom, and prepared the way for almost a quarter-century of robust economic growth in the United States and throughout the world. We canshow ourselves worthy of that accomplishment by following that example. 13PROTECTING THE HOMELAND Together, we will confront the threat of terrorism. We will take strong precautions aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and prepare to respond effectively if they might come again. We will defend our country; and while we do so, we will not sacrifice the freedoms that make our land unique. President George W. Bush October 8, 2001 Overview Our nation learned a terrible lesson on September 11th\u2014America has evil, cold-blooded enemies capable of unprecedented acts of mass murder and terror. The characteristics of American society that we cherish\u2014our freedom, our openness, our great cities, our modern transportationsystems\u2014make us vulnerable to terrorism of catastrophic proportions. This vulnerability will existeven after we bring justice to those responsible for the events of September 11 th. Indeed, the threat of mass-destruction terrorism has become a reality of life in the 21stCentury. It is a permanent condition to which not just America, but the entire world must adjust. The federal government has an absolute obligation to secure the homeland from future terrorist attacks. This will involve major new programs and significant reforms by the federal government,several of which are described in this budget. But it will also involve new or expanded efforts by stateand local governments, private industry, non-governmental organizations, and ordinary citizens. Thehigher priority we all now attach to homeland security has already begun to ripple through the land. Homeland security is a challenge of monumental scale and complexity. It will not be cheap, easy, or quick. Achieving our homeland security objectives will require vast sums of money, strenuouslabor, and many years. Our work has already begun, and it will continue. The American peopleshould have no doubt that ultimately we will succeed in weaving a proper and permanent level ofsecurity into the fabric of America. This budget reflects not just our absolute commitment to achieving a much more secure homeland, but also our determinatio n to do so in a manner that preserves liberty and strengthens our economy. September 11thand Our Response The September 11thterrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have presented an unprecedented challenge to our nation. The response has been, and must continue to be, equal tothat challenge. The President's Budget devotes a total of $38 billion to a host of federal agencies that will develop a new level of security to protect Americans at home. Throughout this volume, this Minuteman appears at the bottom of pages where a discussion on homeland security begins. 1516 PROTECTING THE HOMELAND In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, Congress swiftly appropriated $40 billion to aid reconstruction, wage war against terrorism, and strengthen our defenses at home. Aftermath of terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.In the months since September 11th, the $10.6 billion of the $40 billion dedicated to homeland security purposes has helped to: \u007fdramatically increase the number of skymarshals riding on \u007fsupport the largest criminal investigation inU.S. history; \u007fa c q u i r ee n o u g hm e d i c i n et ot r e a tu pt o1 0million more people for anthrax or otherbacterial infections; \u007finvestigate the sources of terrorist funding, andthen freeze the financial assets of more than150 individuals and organizations connected tointernational terrorism; \u007fdeploy hundreds of Coast Guard cutters,aircraft, and small boats to patrol theapproaches to our ports and protect them frominternal or external threats; \u007facquire equipment for certain major mailsorting facilities to find and destroy anthraxbacteria and other biological agents of terror;and \u007fstation 8,000 National Guards troops at baggage-screening checkpoints at 420 major airports. Now we will take the next step. When the President established a new Office of Homeland Security, under the leadership of Governor Tom Ridge, he directed the Office \"to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks.\" This strategy will meet four key tests: \u007fThe strategy for homeland security will be comprehensive and will integrate the full range of homeland security activities into a single, mutually supporting plan. \u007fThe strategy will be a national strategy, not a federal government strategy. The threat posedby terrorism does not fall neatly within the jurisdiction of the federal government. To defeatterrorism, the federal government must work with states and localities and the private sector. \u007fThe strategy will commit the federal government to a long-term plan and a long-term budgetto improve homeland security. \u007fFinally, the strategy will include benchmarks and other performance measures by which wecan evaluate progress and allocate resources. These objectives will set the goals for federaldepartments and agencies. They will also give guidance to state and local governments andthe private sector.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 17 At the same time as we craft our national strategy, we will begin work immediately on four urgent and essential missions for the defense of our homeland: \u007fensuring state and local first responders (firemen, police, and rescue workers) are prepared for terrorism; \u007fenhancing our defenses against biological attacks; \u007fsecuring our borders; and \u007fsharing information and using information technology to secure the homeland. The President's Budget for 2003, including Department of Defense spending, provides $21 billion to fulfill these four missions. Including other programs, total spending for homeland security wouldrise to $38 billion in 2003\u2014an $18 billion increase over 2002, a virtual doubling of the pre-September11 thlevels. The task of homeland security, however, is extraordinarily broad. The national strategy, therefore, will go well beyond these four initiatives. The nation's response to the terrorist attacks, although impressive in many respects, revealed substantial shortcomings in our ability to prevent, mitigate,and investigate such events. The sheer size and wealth of America means that we present manytargets to terrorists. Similarly, our freedom and openness makes our society vulnerable. Terroristscan strike at any place, at any time, with virtually any weapon. But America's free and open societyhas been challenged before and we can meet this new threat without abandoning these fundamental American principles. Mission One: Supporting First Responders Local fire, police, and rescue workers are the first to arrive at catastrophes, such as the September 11th attacks.When disaster strikes, the first people on the scene are our \"first responders\"\u2014firefighters, local law enforcement, rescue squads, ambulances, and emergency medical personnel. These brave and dedicated menand women, many of them volunteers, are ourfirst line of defense when terrorists attack.More than 300 first responders were killedin the September 11 thattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. While others ran out of burning, collapsing buildings, theycharged in, risking their own lives to saveothers. In this war on terrorism against our homeland, first responders are the infantry, protecting our lives and freedoms 24 hours a day. What they do in the first minutes after an attack can mean the difference between life anddeath for the terrorist's victims. We ask much from them, and they always deliver. Now it's timeto come through for them. The President's Budget provides $3.5 billion to support first responders, a more than twelvefold increase over 2002. The funds would be used to buy personal protective equipment, emergency medical equipment, biological and chemical detection equipment, communications, and other items18 PROTECTING THE HOMELAND that local first responders tell us they need. It would help first responders acquire the latest technology and training that can shave critical minutes or hours off of response time, but due tothe cost may have been out of reach for many localities. For example, this funding could be used to acquire diagnostic test equipment that can reduce the time required to test for anthrax from 40 hours to a matter of minutes. In the hours and days that followed the terrorist attacks on September 11th, communications between local police, fire, and rescue unitsand federal agencies providing assistancewas extremely unpredictable, and in somecases, virtually impossible. The collapse of the two World Trade Center buildings knocked out antennas used for cellular telephones,threatened emergency communicationssystems, and damaged landline switches innearby buildings. The limited interoperab ility of emergency responders' communications equipment, and the inherent complications for line-of-sight communications in densely built-upManhattan, caused further problems. If rescueworkers cannot talk to one another, they cannotdo their jobs.T h ef u n d sw i l la l s ob eu s e dt oc o n d u c t more frequent regional terrorism drills and rehearsals, enabling first responders towork together and identify gaps in theirresponses. The funds would be used toupgrade emergency communications systemsthroughout the nation, enabling more first responders and their agencies to talk with one another in \"real time.\" Finally, a portion of thisfunding will be dedicated to a new HomelandSecurity Corps that will be coordinated bythe Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) and be a key component of the USA Freedom Corps. T h er o l eo ff i r s tr e s p o n d e r s ,w h oa r el a r g e l y under state or local control, is a reminderthat our war on terrorism is a national, nota federal, effort. Under the budget, firstresponders will have increased freedom to determine their own needs and how best to meet them. FEMA will work closely with state and local officials to ensure their planning, training,and equipment needs are addressed. FEMA will also be charged with improving the federalgovernment's coordination with state and local governments and reducing duplication withinfederal agencies. Mission Two: Enhancing Our Defense Against Biological Attacks On October 4, 2001, a Florida man named Robert Stevens was diagnosed with inhalation anthrax. The source of the anthrax attacks is still unknown. But the effects of the attacks are clear: fivepeople murdered; hundreds treated; thousands tested; and a new American vulnerability laid bare.The consequences of new, larger, more sophisticated attacks could be much worse. We must have noillusions about the threat of germ terror. We learned that we must strengthen effective means to detect and react quickly to bioterrorism\u2014and that a failure to do so endangers our people and our nation. So the President's2003 Budget requests $5.9 billion to enhance our defenses against bioterrorism, principally in thefollowing four major areas:THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 19 Disease has long been the deadliest enemy of mankind. Infectious diseases make no distinctions among people and recognize no borders. We have fought the causes and consequences of disease throughout history and must continue to do so with every available means. All civilized nations reject as intolerable the use of disease and biological weapons as instruments of war and terror. President George W. Bush November 1, 2001\u007fFirst, the President proposes spending $1.2 billion in 2003 to increase thecapacity of state and local health deliverysystems to respond to bioterrorismattacks. The largest share of thisfunding, $591 million, would be provided to hospitals for infrastructure improvements such as communicationssystems and decontamination facilities,comprehensive planning on a regionalbasis to maximize coordination andmutual aid, and training exercises that will help the public health and emergency response communities worktogether better. The budget also includes$210 million for states to assess their existing ability to respond to such attacks, and thenstrengthen their capacity to do so. An additional $200 million would be used to increasestate laboratory capacity and related systems to permit rapid collection and identification of potential biological agents. \u007fSecond, the President's Budget includes an aggressive $2.4 billion research and development program to develop technologies that will strengthen our bioterrorism response capabilities in the mid- and long-term. Almost $1.7 billion would be provided to the National Institutes of Health to perform fundamental research leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics,diagnostic tests, and reliable biological agent collection, rapid identification and monitoringtechnologies, and to create a safe and reliable anthrax vaccine. Another $420 millionis proposed for the Department of Defense (DoD) to study the technology and tactics ofbioterrorists and devise countermeasures to the use of biological agents as weapons. The budget also includes $100 million to improve security at the nation's biological research laboratories and $75 million for the Environmental Protection Agency to develop improvedtechniques and procedures to cope with future biological or chemical incidents. \u007fThird, the President's bioterrorism initiative includes $851 million to improve federalcapabilities to respond to bioterrorist events. The National Pharmaceutical Stockpile willcontain a sufficient amount of antibiotics to provide treatment for 20 million people by theend of 2002. The budget includes $300 million to manage this stockpile, increase the supplyof chemical antidotes, and conduct the proper planning and training to ensure that statescan effectively receive and distribute stockpile allotments. It also includes $100 million to improve our ability to distribute and effectively use the nation's supply of smallpox vaccine and $99 million for the Food and Drug Administration to enhance the safety of the nation'sfood supply. \u007fFourth, the budget proposes spending $392 million to strengthen our ability to detect andreact quickly through improved communications to a biological attack. A key component ofthis ability is information management and exchange. The budget includes $202 million tocreate a national information management system that links emergency medical responderswith public health officials, enables early warning information to be distributed quickly, andpermits emergency medical care and public health care providers to share diagnostic and treatment information and facilities. The budget also includes $175 million to assist state20 PROTECTING THE HOMELAND and local public health providers begin to acquire the necessary hardware and assistance to access this information. Mission Three: Securing Our Borders America's borders must be made secure\u2014and they must remain open. To achieve both these goals, the border system of the future must gain a new ability to identify low- and high-risk traffic, speedinglow-risk traffic on its way, while focusing the attention of border security personnel on high-risktraffic. Accomplishing this separation in a quick and reliable manner is an enormously difficult task.It will require more sophisticated use of data and close cooperation with private industry and other governments, especially Canada, Mexico, and our other large trading partners. As it is, nearly a dozen federal agencies are charged with patrolling or inspecting along the border. The State Department issues visas. The Justice Department's Immigration andNaturalization Service (INS) inspects them. The Treasury Department's Customs Service checksany bags the visa-holder may bring with him. DoD and the National Guard patrol our skies. TheCoast Guard, which reports to the Secretary of Transportation, patrols our seas. The Department of Agriculture regulates imports of food, the Commerce Department monitors imports of manufactured goods, the Food and Drug Administration polices imports of legal drugs, and the Drug EnforcementAdministration tries to halt imports of illegal ones. The intelligence agencies and the newTransportation Security Administration have important roles as well. This complex arrangement has evolved over many years, but thanks to the dedicated professionals who staff it, often produces superb results\u2014including the thwarting of al Qaeda's Millennium plot against American targets in 2000. All of the 19 September 11thhijackers had entered the United States legally but three had overstayed legal visas. The Immigrationand Naturalization Service estimates thatapproximately 40 percent of persons currentlyin the United States illegally have overstayedlegally obtained visas.Although border security has been strengthened as a result of the terrorist attacks, the INS must do a better job of targeting illegal traffic while welcominglegitimate travelers. Therefore, thePresident's Budget includes $380 millionto establish a reliable system to track theentry and exit of immigrants, particularly those who might pose a security threat to the United States. The new system will leverage advanced technology and construction funding to ensure timely and secure flow of traffic. TheAdministration's goal is to complete implementation of this new, comprehensive initiative by theend of 2004. Additional funds will be spent to make passports and other documents of North American nations more compatible with one another and more easily read by one another's computers\u2014and to develop other identification techniques to halt illegal entrants and speed and smooth the way for lawfultravelers and cargoes.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 21 A car waits at an unattended northern border point of entry, blocked only by orange traffic cones in the middle of the road.The northern border, in particular, has become an attractive route for potentialterrorists. Until very recently, many northern entry points into the United States were not staffed around the clock; entry into the UnitedStates was sometimes controlled by no morethan orange cones in the middle of the road.Such measures stop only honest people. Ending this vulnerability is an urgent priority that must build on the long history of cooperative border management betweenthe United States and Canada, partners inthe largest trading relationship in the world.In December 2001, the United States andCanada declared a mutual commitment to create a \"smart border\" that could safeguard against terrorist activity while ensuring the free flow of people and goods. The President's Budgetprovides funds to implement this agreement. The President's Budget would more than double the number of Border Patrol agents and inspectors across the northern border. It supports deployment of force-multiplying equipment,including remote operated infrared cameras, to monitor isolated areas where illegal entry may have once occurred. The budget also provides resources to integrate once-separate information systems to ensure timely, accurate, and complete enforcement data is available in the field. Mission Four: Sharing Information and Using Technology to Secure the Homeland After September 11th, it became evident that important information about the hijackers' activities was available through a variety of federal, state, and local databases. It also became clear that thereis no comprehensive system for sharing information relevant to our security across jurisdictionallines. The President's Budget proposes $722 million for improvements to information-sharing within the federal government and between the federal government and other jurisdictions. These improvements are often highly technical\u2014and yet are crucial to the successful protection of our society from terrorist attack. Technology investments will improve the performance of agenciesin preparing for, detecting and responding to homeland security threats. So we will: \u007fensure that federal agencies with homeland security responsibilities have needed access tothreat information throughout the federal government; \u007festablish a process to provide for appropriately secure communications with state and localofficials so they may receive homeland security information in a timely manner; \u007fensure that crisis communications for federal, state, and local officials is reliable and secure;and22 PROTECTING THE HOMELAND \u007funify federal government security and critical infrastructure protection initiatives, and make strong security a condition of funding for all federal investments in information-technologysystems. Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the \"blind sheikh\" involved in the 1993 car bombing of the World Trade Center, not only entered the United States legally but was granted permanent resident alienstatus despite a terrorist past that dated to the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.Improved information-sharing could make a repeat of such tragic mistakes unlikely. Other Initiatives These four missions lead our homeland security agenda\u2014but they are not the whole of it. We must also finish the job of securing our airways. In 2003, the new Transportation Security Administration(TSA) will strive to meet the tight deadlines and rigorous aviation security requirements set byCongress. The TSA is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at each U.S. airport withcommercial air service. The budget requests $4.8 billion for TSA, a 210 percent increase on aviationsecurity over 2002. It includes funds to: \u007fcomplete the hiring of approximately 30,000 new federal airport security workers to checkpassenger identities and inspect carry-on and checked baggage; \u007faccelerate the installation of explosive detection technology so that all baggage loaded in aircraft is safe; and \u007fimplement other measures to enhance passenger safety and facilitate air travel. We also propose a robust expansion in domestic law-enforcement work. The Attorney General has instructed all department bureaus to shift their primary focus from investigating and prosecuting past crimes to identifying threats of future terrorist acts, preventing them from happening, andpunishing would-be perpetrators for their plan of terror. The 2003 Budget requests enhancementsto the capabilities of the FBI and other law enforcement/intelligence agencies. These enhancementswill: \u007fenable the FBI to add more than 300 agents and other investigative staff to the surveillance of terrorists and collection of information about their activities; \u007fadd more than 15 investigators to the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTAT), to identify and close down the sources of money that supports the terrorist cells. FTAT and the Office of Foreign Assets Control work together to seize the terrorists' assets; and \u007fadd approximately 150 FBI special agents and investigative staff to the task of protecting our banking, finance, energy, transportation, and other critical systems from disruption by terrorists, including by cyber attack. We face new kinds of threats from new kinds of enemies. Defeating those threats will be the great challenge and the great achievement of this generation of Americans.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 23 The Homeland Security Budget To develop the homeland security budget, the Office of Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) identified those activities that are focused on combating and protectingagainst terrorism and occur within the United States and its territories. Such activities include efforts todetect, deter, protect against and, if needed, respond to terrorist attacks. As a starting point, funding estimates for these activities are based on data that has been reported since 1998 in OMB's Annual Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism, and include combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD), critical infrastructure protection (CIP), and continuity of operations (COOP) . In addition, homeland security includes funding for border security (i.e., Immigration and Naturalization Service's enforcement and detention activities, Customs' enforcement activities, CoastGuard's enforcement activities, the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection Program, and State's visa program) and aviation security. Since homeland security focuses on activities within the United States, estimates do not include costs associated with fighting terrorism overseas; those costs are captured within the war on terrorismabroad category. The budget uses the Combating Terrorism Report's definitions for combating terrorism and WMD preparedness, CIP , and COOP . Combating terrorism includes both antiterrorism (defensive measures used to combat terrorism) and counterterrorism (offensive measures used to combat terrorism), and includes the following five categories of activities as they directly relate to such efforts: \u007flaw enforcement and investigative activities; \u007fpreparing for and responding to terrorist acts; \u007fphysical security of government facilities and employees; \u007fphysical protection of national populace and national infrastructure; and \u007fresearch and development activities. CIP is defined as efforts associated with enhancing the physical and cybersecurity of public and private sector infrastructures, especially cyber systems that are so vital to the nation that theirincapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on nati onal security, national economic security, and/or national public health and safety. COOP refers to the capability of federal agencies to perform essential functions during any emergency or situation that may disrupt normal operations. As the Office of Homeland Security develops a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks, it may refine the definition used to establish the boundariesof this category.WINNING THE WAR ON TERRORISM ABROAD Terrorism is a direct threat to our homeland, but in most cases it is a threat that originates overseas. U.S. efforts must assure there are no safe havens for terrorists anywhere in the world.The 2003 Budget provides the resources for that effort. Fortunately, we do not undertake this struggle alone. As President Bush has said, \"[t]he vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideological divide. We're makingcommon cause with every nation that chooses lawful change over chaotic violence\u2014every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life.\" The United States is working with traditional allies and new partners to achieve the goal of eliminating global terrorism. Many of these willing partnersare only beginning to strengthen counter-terrorism capabilities to assure our common success. Thisbudget requests assistance to support friends who join this global cause. Terrorism has many faces and takes many forms around the world. The war on terrorism will not end with the capture of Osama Bin Laden or the destruction of the al Qaeda network in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has many widely distributed cells that will not cease their efforts against the United States simply because we capture or kill Bin Laden. Nor will the destruction of the al Qaeda networkeliminate the threat of international terrorism against the United States. Other terrorist groupswho wish to harm or intimidate the United States will remain. Therefore, even after the combatoperations in Afghanistan wind down, we will still have a great deal more work to do. And this workwill differ in important ways from the wars the United States has waged in the past. \u007fThe war will not be short. The Administration is committed to supporting this effort over the long-term\u2014we do not expect a quick victory. \u007fIt will follow a different pace. This war will not follow a steady, predictable course. There are likely to be intense bursts of activity, like the recent action in Afghanistan, followed by intervals of seeming quiet, though our efforts will not cease until the threat is eliminated.Americans will be asked for their patience\u2014and their trust as the war proceeds from phase tophase. \u007fIt will take more than the military to defeat terrorists . We must employ every element of national power\u2014diplomatic, economic, intelligence, law enforcement, public information, andthe military\u2014to defeat terrorism. Element One: Diplomatic Power Following the strong leadership of the President, th e State Department created and strengthened a broad-based international coalition to combat terrorism, not just in Afghanistan, but around the world. The NATO nations and other allies such as Japan and Australia swiftly offered their help.We revitalized long-standing relationships with countries such as Pakistan and India, and foundcommon ground with newer partners like Russia, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The United States isalso leading the international community's efforts to assist the people of Afghanistan to create a new, 2526 WINNING THE WAR ON TERRORISM ABROAD better future for their nation and region. At the same time, we have begun to work with our partners globally, regionally, and on a bilateral basis to forge new mechanisms and capabilities to fight thescourge of terrorism not just today, but in the years to come. Many of our friends need our help to contribute to the war on terrorism. And the 2003 Budget makes that help available. It asks for: \u007fApproximately $3.5 billion for economic assistance, military equipment, and training for stateson the front line in the war against terrorism. \u007f$121 million for anti-terrorism assistance, training, and equipment to help other countriesfight global terror. As part of this commitment, the President is requesting $52 million toestablish a Center for Anti-terrorism and Security Training (CAST) to provide a consolidatedtactical training capability. Once it is fully operational, the CAST will train 7,500 Americanand coalition partners' law enforcement personnel annually in advanced anti-terrorism and security measures, thereby enhancing the security of U.S. interests abroad. \u007f$4 million for the Treasury Department's Office of Technical Assistance to provide training and other needed expertise to foreign governments' finance ministries and offices to combat terrorist financing. Another critical step in reducing the potential capability of terrorists is to reduce the likelihood that they can acquire weapons of mass destruction. The United States continues to support andstrengthen multilateral arrangements that work to prevent sensitive technologies and knowledgefrom falling into the wrong hands. An important element of this policy is helping Russia and the otherstates of the former Soviet Union to control and dispose of the massive quantities of weapons of mass destruction and missile materials inherited from the Cold War era. Specifically, the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DoE), and State manage a set of integrated programs with a combined 2003funding request of nearly $1.5 billion for Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union,including: \u007f$549 million for ongoing programs to secure, dismantle, and destroy nuclear, chemical, andbiological weapons and their components so that we can avoid the potentially catastrophic results of these weapons falling into the wrong hands; \u007f$235 million, an increase of $62 million over 2002, for DoE's program to secure and better control dangerous fissile materials to reduce the risk of them falling into the hands of terrorists; \u007f$101 million for ongoing programs to engage weapons scientists in peaceful research and help prevent the spread of the expertise required to build these weapons; and \u007f$55 million, an increase of $38 million over 2002, for DoD's biological weapons proliferationprevention program. This funding is in addition to over $1 billion in already-appropriated funds currently available for these programs. Aggressive public diplomacy is key to eliminating support and safe haven for terrorists and maintaining the political will to sustain the broad international coalition to fight terrorism overthe long haul. The Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are increasing mediabroadcasts in and around Afghanistan and throughout the Middle East to help inform local publicopinion about the true nature of terrorist organizations and the purposes of the United States' war on terrorism. This effort combined with the establishment of civil society and an elected, representative, post-Taliban government in Afghanistan will encourage support for our efforts toTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 27 end an era of terror. To help make these initiatives a reality, the budget includes $60 million for continued international broadcasting efforts in this critical region. Relief workers deliver food aid by raft.We must provide economic and humanitarian aid as well. President Bush has made clear that our concern for innocent lifeextends to the nations in which the terroristsbase themselves. The President stated that wewere \"at war with the Taliban regime, not withthe good, innocent people of Afghanistan,\" and he committed $320 million of emergency funds in 2002 for humanitarian assistancefor vulnerable Afghans. The UN World FoodProgramme identified 7.5 million vulnerableAfghans. The United States has now provided50 percent of the resources required to meet their needs through the end of March. We will continue to provide food and other aid to thepeople of Afghanistan, as they build a stable,post-Taliban government. By assisting democratic aspirations or by funding education programs to create economic opportunity, the United States can broaden efforts to discredit terrorism's appeal. Element Two: Disrupting The Financing Of Terrorism On September 23, 2001, the President signed Executive Order 13224, which expanded the Treasury Department's power to freeze the assets of terrorist financiers. Since then, the Treasuryhas worked assiduously to detect and disrupt terrorist fundraising activities. Between September 11, 2001, and the end of the year, the U.S. government froze $33 million in assets belonging to supporters of al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hamas, and other well known Middle Eastern terroristorganizations. More than 140 countries worldwide are helping to track and block terrorists' access to money, and as a result, millions more of al Qaeda and bin Laden assets have been seized. And with U.S.support, twenty leading industrial nations have adopted a comprehensive action plan to deny terrorists and their associates access to, or use of, financial systems, both formal and informal. This budget supports these efforts and will provide the means to promote new international standards toshut down terrorist financing and stop terrorist money laundering. Element Three: Intelligence and Law Enforcement Power Improving our Intelligence Collection, Sharing, and Analysis. Our intelligence agencies collect vital information on terrorist groups and their activities. The information they gather provides indications and warnings to law enforcement and military authorities of potential terrorist attacksagainst U.S. interests, either at home or abroad. The 2003 Budget provides funding for several28 WINNING THE WAR ON TERRORISM ABROAD initiatives now underway to enhance intelligence sharing among federal, state, and local entities. These include: \u007fThe establishment of a center that will strengthen cooperation between the law enforcement and intelligence communities; and \u007fImproved sharing through the Interagency Intelligence Committee on Terrorism, an organization comprised of more than 60 diverse members, including the CIA, FBI, FEMA, and the Coast Guard. A key example of the Committee's efforts is its new relationship with the State Department to access the Department's existing databases, which will allow certainclassified intelligence information to be de-classified and released in a timely, useful mannerto a wider audience. U.S. Marines raise the flag as they set up a base in Afghanistan. The U.S. military established a substantial presence inAfghanistan in an extremely short periodof time.Improving Law Enforcement Cooperation Overseas . The Department of Justice, through the FBI, is responsible for the criminal investigation into terrorist acts overseas involving U.S. citizens or interests. The FBI objective isto develop sufficient evidence to support criminal chargesagainst the terrorists. The FBI also maintains offices in keyoverseas locations. In these locations, FBI agents work withtheir police counterparts to exchange information that may be helpful in preventing criminal acts affecting the United States, including acts of terrorism. In addition, the State Departmentmaintains a presence of Diplomatic Security agents at everyembassy worldwide. Their established liaison with foreign lawenforcement officials provides a proven platform to furtherefforts to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Protecting U.S. Personnel Overseas . Good intelligence and police work safeguards not only Americans at home, but alsoAmericans abroad. More than 210,000 U.S. military personneland DoD civilian employees are stationed overseas at any onepoint in time, and we have embassies and consulates in all buta few countries around the world. The attacks on the Khobar towers in Saudi Arabia, on the USS Cole in port in Yemen, and on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have heightenedour awareness of our vulnerabilities abroad. The President'sBudget, therefore, includes $2.4 billion for physical securitymeasures to protect our military and diplomatic personneloverseas, an increase of over $300 million from 2002. Element Four: Military Power Winning the War in Afghanistan . On less than a month's notice, American and British forces joined with local anti-Taliban troops in an assault on the al Qaeda network and the Talibanregime that gave it safe harbor. The United States committed several hundred aircraft to OperationEnduring Freedom. Initially, we inserted small numbers of lightly armed British and American Special Forces into Afghanistan to support air operations and conduct reconnaissance missions. They were followed and supported by a Marine Expeditionary Unit and elements of the Army's 10 th Mountain Division. Relatively small numbers of light troops were able to prevail in Afghanistan. WeTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 29 could achieve decisive victories by integrating real time intelligence with sophisticated technologies in cooperation with indigenous forces. U.S. military forces were well organized and ready for the initial phase of the war on terrorism. They are superbly trained, equipped with advanced military technology, and armed with new tactical and operational approaches. While it would be a mistake to conclude that all future militaryoperations will look like Afghanistan, it is clear that the President's ambition to transform ourarmed forces has been validated by new missions and requirements defined in Afghanistan. A U.S. Marine hunkers down as Marines prepare to conduct a cordon and search raid at a suspected al Qaeda hideout in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan on January 1, 2002.Securing the Future .T h e r a p i d success of our forces in Afghanistan validates America's strategy of forward deployment. However, we may notalways be able to rely on local alliesto contribute to our operations. Wealso need the capability to conductoperations on our own. To support this capability, the U.S. has as many as 250,000 troops forward-deployedaround the globe at any given time.These troops conduct importantmissions year-round, such as providinga stabilizing influence on the Korean peninsula and in the Balkans and carrying out air operations over Iraq.At the same time, they stand ready tos e r v eo nt h ef r o n t l i n eo ft h ec u r r e n twar against terror. Another 1.1 million troops on active duty are back in U.S. territory engaged in critical support missions and maintaining a high state of readiness. The forces at home are frequently rotated overseas. In addition, forces at home provide critical support functions to make rapid deploymentfor combat possible. The U.S. Transportation Command, for example, fields fleets of tanker andheavy lift aircraft, in many cases operated by National Guard personnel, which give the UnitedStates the flexibility to respond to attacks anywhere around the globe. Logistics units make surethat we can move weapons, ammunition, equipment, and food rapidly where it is needed\u2014including humanitarian rations for local populations in cases like Afghanistan. We must protect our current readiness and operations. Therefore, the President's Budget provides a 12 percent increase to bring defense spending to $369 billion, reflecting the President's commitmentto a sustained, long-term investment in the nation's security. The budget provides an additional $10billion, if necessary, for the operational costs of the war against terrorism. We must also transform our military to meet the new challenges of the 21 stCentury. This transformation effort involves not just new technology, but also a new doctrine, new ways of organizing forces, and new ways of doing business. In order to transform the way our armed forcesfight, this budget sustains funding for operational training activities, upgrades to training facilities,and other transformational efforts that will make the armed forces more flexible and responsive30 WINNING THE WAR ON TERRORISM ABROAD to unanticipated missions. The 2003 Budget includes a number of transformation initiatives, including: \u007funmanned combat aerial vehicles; \u007fa substantial increase of precision munitions; and \u007fadditional funding to strengthen our ability to collect and disseminate information towarfighters in a useful and timely way. The Department of Defense chapter provides more details regarding the military's transformational activities. The U.S. flag, bearing the signatures of rescue workers, friends and family of victims of the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, and the USS Cole, waves in the breeze. Conclusion Again and again throughout this century, the world's tyrants have made the same error: underestimating America's character, resolve, and strength. They have sought war with the United States to enhance their own power, but they have instead caused their own destruction. This budget provides the United States with the resources to fight terrorism with diplomacy\u2014with economicand humanitarian assistance\u2014with police and intelligence work\u2014and with military power. Thechallenge is great. With the necessary resolve and resources, the result is certain.RETURNING TO ECONOMIC VITALITY America's power rests on our economic strength. And it is precisely this strength that the terrorists targeted on September 11th. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon inflicted serious short-term harm on the U.S. economy. The terrorists' hopes of doing more lasting damage, however, will be disappointed.The American economy is the most productive and most innovative on earth. Free market domesticpolicies, free trade, sound monetary policy, moderate regulatory burdens, and declining tax rates will soon restore growth and employment. We can achieve an even speedier recovery by adopting the economic-recovery and job-creation principles proposed by President Bush on October 4 th, nearly one million lost jobs ago. Signs of Economic Slowdown The economic impact of the terrorist attacks was magnified by the fact that growth had already begun to slow in the middle of 2000. In March 2000, stock market indices peaked. Over the following year, household equity wealth fell by over $4 trillion. After expanding at a double digit pace foreight years, business equipment investment slowed markedly in the third quarter of 2000 and turnednegative in the fourth quarter. At about the same time, energy prices jumped to painful new levels.Manufacturing was hit particularly hard: in the five quarters starting in the summer of 2000, themanufacturing sector lost some 1.4 million jobs. 1998 1999 2000 2001-2-10123456 1st half 2nd half Q2 Q3Economy Slowed Beginning in Mid-2000 Recession began in MarchReal GDP growth, percent annual rate Q1The Administration addressed the looming recession as soon as it took office, and theCongress quickly passed a bipartisan taxrelief package. The June tax package reducedmarginal tax rates across a wide spectrum,including for lower income citizens earning their way out of poverty. It also doubled the per-child tax credit, lightened the marriagepenalty, and put $36 billion directly inconsumers' hands through immediate rebates. 3132 RETURNING TO ECONOMIC VITALITY Chronology of the Recession The economy weakened beginning in 2000: \u007fThe stock market fell after March 2000. \u007fManufacturing output decreased after June 2000 and manufacturing jobs after July 2000. \u007fReal GDP growth slowed sharply from the second half of 2000 onward. \u007fConsumers became less confident after September 2000. \u007fThe unemployment rate rose after October 2000. \u007fOverall jobs fell after March 2001, the official start of the recession. September 11thdeepened the contraction: \u007fThe stock market dropped 12 percent by September 21st. \u007fConsumer confidence plummeted 26 percent by October. \u007fOverall jobs fell by 943,000 in the last three months of 2001, and the unemployment rate jumped by 0.8 percentage points. \u007fReal GDP growth fell at a 1.3 percent rate in the third quarter. Besides allowing Americans to keep a greater portion of what they have earned, these policies deliver both short-term and long-term benefits. Tax relief allows taxpayers to keep more of theirown money, supporting consumption in the near-term. Meanwhile, the nation's long-term outlook isbrightened by improved incentives for work, entrepreneurship, and investment. Before September 11 th, there were signs that the economic slide had begun to slow. Retail sales picked up in July and August. Steep declines in nondefense capital goods orders appeared to have ended in August, and the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index of manufacturingactivity improved sharply. The terrorist attacks cut short these promising developments. Business and consumer confidence plunged after September 11 th. Airlines were grounded. Travel and tourism were devastated. The finances of the world's insurance industry were damaged. And firms and individuals throughout the economy were forced to make heavy new investments in security. These events drove the economy into a recession. Indeed, The National Bureau of Economic Research\u2014the designator ofrecessions\u2014said, \"Before the attacks, it is possible that the decline in the economy would have beentoo mild to qualify as a recession. The attacks clearly deepened the contraction and may have beenan important factor in turning the episode into a recession.\" 1 The terrorist attacks imposed heavy new costs on government as well. The economic shock combined with unexpected new expenditur es for defense, homeland security, and domestic reconstruction pushed the federal government back into deficit. However, if we make the right choices by stimulating growth and controlling spending, deficits will be small and temporary. The Administration and the Congressional Leadership agreed in principle that further fiscal stimulus was needed to prevent a worsening of the recession. The House passed a stimulus plan 1National Bureau of Economic Research, \"The NBER's Business-Cycle Dating Procedure\", December 13, 2001, page 7.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 33 and a bipartisan majority for a similar plan coalesced in the Senate. Regrettably, the Senate chose not to act. Need for Economic Security Plan There have been some encouraging trends in the latest economic releases. Yet the number of unemployed workers continues to rise, incomes are stagnating, business investment remains soft,and the global economy is weak. The Administration therefore believes that additional measuresmust be taken to promote economic growth, create jobs, and avert future economic weakness. TheAdministration urges quick passage of an economic security plan modeled along the lines of the recent bipartisan compromise and has set aside resources for that purpose in this budget. The Dignity of a Paycheck It's important to help workers who've lost their jobs. It's even more important to help workers find new jobs. In tough times, people need an unemployment check; but what they want is a paycheck. Americans want the independence of a job, and the satisfaction of providing for their families themselves. A job is more than a source of income; it is a source of dignity. President George W. Bush January 5, 2002To both create new jobs and assist dislocated workers, this package should include: \u007fSpeeding up the tax reductions the Congress passed last year. The fastertax rates come down, the faster theeconomy will grow. \u007fGiving tax refunds to lower- andmoderate-income individuals andfamilies. This will put money inthe hands of people with children to support and bills to pay. \u007fProviding immediate assistance to laid-off workers, both by extending their unemployment benefits, increasing resources available for job training, and by helping them retain their health insurance coverage. \u007fReforming prospectively the alternative minimum tax on businesses. This will ensure that employers no longer see their tax rates rise as their profits shrink. In tough times, entrepreneurship should be encouraged, not punished. \u007fOffering better tax treatment for employers and entrepreneurs who invest in new equipment. This will help both the people who use the equipment and those who manufacture it. The Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that the Administration's economic security plan could boost 2002 GDP growth by 0.5 percent and lead to the creation of 300,000 more jobs. The Administration has built its economic forecasts around the assumption that an economic stimulus package will be enacted. If this does not occur, our growth estimates would be overstatedby the above amount. Unless economic growth can be restored, it will mean fewer jobs, smallergrowth in incomes, and smaller budget surpluses. Quick action on an economic security plan makes sense. It will speed up the economic recovery and will help bring laid-off workers back into the job market more quickly. While the primary emphasis of this budget is the quick recovery from the terrorist attacks on the United States, the President's Budget outlines a plan that also provides the fundamentalunderpinnings for long-term economic growth. The federal government does not create economicgrowth. However, it should foster an environment to allow entrepreneurs, small business, and34 RETURNING TO ECONOMIC VITALITY others in the private sector to generate economic growth. Such economic opportunity comes through promoting free trade, restraining costly regulatory burdens, maintaining low tax rates, simplifyingthe tax code, promoting a sound energy policy, controlling federal spending and increasing the efficiency of government operation. By taking action to reinvigorate growth in both the short- and long-term, we can thwart the terrorists' efforts to undermine our economy and our well being.BUDGET IMPLICATIONS OF THE WAR The nation faces significant challenges in the near-term in prosecuting the war on terror abroad and defending our homeland from attack, in addition to rejuvenating economic growth. These effortswill require substantial budgetary resources. Fortunately, the United States has abundant resourcesto tap. However, in order to ensure that the fiscal outlook remains positive over the longer-term,tough fiscal choices must be made to direct funds toward priority endeavors and away from poorlyperforming government programs. New budget process reforms are needed to expedite this process.

Deficits now look likely over at least the next two years. However, assumingthe government pursues pro-growth policiesand controls spending, the budget should beback in surplus by 2004 or 2005. The overall fiscal position remains strong even with this temporary move into deficits. The 2003 deficit is projected to be less thanone percent of GDP\u2014this compares with a4.5 percent deficit during the last recession.Indeed, despite simultaneous war, recession, and emergency spending, 2002's fiscal position will be better than that recorded in any year between 1975 and 1996. Impact of Recession One would expect the fiscal picture to deteriorate as the economy goes into recession, even absent the multi-front war on terror. Tax receipts decline as activity slows, while expenditures rise for cyclically sensitive programs like unemployment insurance. Furthermore, it is good economic policy to reduce tax burdens explicitly during a recession, in order to limit the economic slide and hasten recovery. While such policy actions may worsen the deficit in the near-term, they will improve thefiscal outlook in the long run since it is growth that ultimately generates any surpluses. 3536 BUDGET IMPLICATIONS OF THE WAR Evolution of the 2002 Fiscal Projection (In billions of dollars) 2002 2002 Budget Baseline Projection ................. 283 Weaker Economy ........................................... 197 Enacted Spending ......................................... 54 June Bipartisan Tax Relief Package ............ 40 2003 Budget Baseline Projection ................ -9Economic weakness has been the largest source of erosion in the currentyear's fiscal projection, followednext by spending stemming from theSeptember 11 thattacks. Economic changes accounted for two thirds of the deterioration in the projected baseline fiscal position since the last year.Spending accounted for an additional20 percent of the decline. Debt and Interest Savings The combined effects of recession and war have interrupted progress in paying down our publicly held debt. Nonetheless, debt willcontinue to diminish as a factor in our fiscal affairs. The ratio of publicly held debt to GDP willdecline steadily from 2002 onward. After hitting 50 percent in the mid-1990s, the debt/GDP ratiowill be 33 percent in 2003 and is projected to fall to 25 percent by 2007. Further evidence of this constructive backdrop can be seen in the Treasury Department's decision last fall to discontinue issuance of the 30 year Treasury bond. 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 20062025303540455055Publicly Held Debt as a Share of GDP Percent 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 200605101520Interest Costs Continue to Fall As a percent of outlays As the share of publicly held debt to GDP declines, interest costs will continue to fall as a share of total outlays. After totaling 15 percent of federal outlays in the mid-1990s, this burden will be onlynine percent in 2002, dropping to eight percent by 2007. Debt Limit The federal government issues debt to the public in order to finance its budget deficits. As noted, this debt is expected to be broadly stable in dollar terms over the next five years, while decliningas a share of GDP. However, the government also issues special Treasury debt to the federal trustfunds that generate surpluses, including Social Security. While debt held by the public is a moreTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 37 meaningful measure of the government's effect on private financial markets, Congress tracks the sum of publicly held and governmentally held debt, and imposes a limit on the amount of total debtoutstanding. Since governmentally held debt rises steadily over time, the debt limit must be raised periodically even if debt actually owed to the public is not growing. In fact, debt subject to limit continued to rise during 1998-2001 even as the publicly held debt decreased. The current limit on total debt is set at $5.95 trillion. In the Mid-Session Review for 2002, total debt was expected to breach this limit by 2004, due to ongoing trust fund purchases of Treasurysecurities. Given the deterioration in the near-term fiscal picture due to the war and recession,however, the debt limit now looks likely to be hit in early 2002. The Need for a Realistic Budget Window The events of last year underscore the difficulty of making reliable budget estimates even one year ahead. No one expected the economic and fiscal fall-out that resulted from last September's terroristattacks and the onset of recession. Similarly, no one knows what types of economic or political shockswill arise in the future. The uncertainty surrounding such events should make us cautious as we attempt to formulate our budget projections. Indeed, over the last six years, the 10 year fiscal projections have varied to a stunning degree. In the 1997 Budget, rising deficits were forecast totaling $1.4 trillion over a 10 year horizon. By the2002 Budget steadily rising surpluses were projected over a 10 year period, totaling $5.6 trillion. Dueto the events of last year, the latest projections are in between these wildly divergent estimates. Suchenormous swings over a short period of time raise doubts about the usefulness of 10 year projections and lead one to conclude that the recent experiment with 10 year budget projections has been a failure. Consequently, the Administration intends to phase out the use of 10 year budget projectionscompletely by the 2004 Budget. This year's budget will still provide aggregate 10 year projectionsfor those who follow and still find value in such numbers (see Summary Tables). However, agencytotals and supporting detail will be limited to five year projections. Recent Experience It is easy to forget that 10 year budget forecasts are a relatively new phenomenon. The 1996 Mid-Session Review was the first budget document to use 10 year projections. In the prior 25 years,five year budget windows were the norm. (In fact, prior to 1971, three year budget windows wereused.) Indeed, even five year estimates are fraught with uncertainty. The average absolute errors in projecting the surplus or deficit since 1982 have been large, and they increase in each year of the fiveyear budget window. There has been a $75 billion average absolute forecasting error for the budgetyear alone (i.e., 2003 for this budget). This rises steadily to $205 billion by the fourth year followingthe budget year (i.e., 2007 for this budget). Since the experiment with 10 year budget projectionshas been brief, data are not yet available to assess the average miss beyond five years. However, the rising average absolute errors over the first five years point to steadily rising errors over the subsequent five years as well. (For more information on the historical record of differences betweenestimated and actual surpluses, see Chapter 18 of the Analytical Perspectives volume, Comparison of Actual to Estimated Totals.)38 BUDGET IMPLICATIONS OF THE WAR Average Absolute Miss in Budget Projections: 1982 to 2001 (In billions of dollars) Budget YearBudget Year Plus OneBudget Year Plus Tw oBudget Year Plus ThreeBudget Year Plus Four 75 109 147 179 205 History suggests that the current projections could be off by an enormous margin. A 90 percent confidence range around the current projections stretches from plus $480 billion to -$480 billionaround the 2007 surplus estimate. Based on the trend seen in the first five years, this confidencerange would be expected to widen further beyond 2007. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has made similar calculations and has estimated even larger uncertainty bands. Responses to Uncertainty 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007-600-400-2000200400600Possible Range of Fiscal Outcomes Surplus(+)/deficit(-) in billions of dollars Current Estimate Potential Lower BoundPotential Upper BoundThere is widespread recognition of the difficulties involved in making multi-year projections. For instance, the Administration and CBO only attempt to forecast the economiccycle for the 18-24 month period followingthe budget submission. Thereafter, bothsimply assume that the economy returns toits long-run sustainable rate of growth. Most private economic forecasters do not project the economy beyond a one to two year horizon. In light of the remarkable swings over the last several years, it is time to acknowledge thelimitations of 10 year budget forecasts. Ratherthan continue to assign false confidence to these numbers, the Administration will begin shifting back to a maximum time horizon of five years. Budget Reforms It is critical that the increased funding for the war on terrorism and restoring economic growth be matched with restraint in other areas. This is necessary in order to avoid a worsening of the nation's long-term fiscal and economic outlook. Budget reforms are needed to enforce such restraint.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 39 Recent Experience The current budget process is flawed. Instead of coming to agreement on the broad outlines of the budget at the beginning of the year, there is often lengthy debate on spending levels that often culminates in an explosion of spending in a disorderly process of stop-gap funding measures and enormous omnibus bills, late and over budget. Last year was an extraordinary year, and the Congress moved swiftly to send the President a $40 billion emergency appropriations bill within three days of the terrorist attacks. Thereafter, spendingthreatened to spin out of control until the President stated he would veto any appropriations billthat exceeded the funding levels he had worked out with the Congress. Ultimately, the President succeeded in keeping spending within the agreed-upon levels. However, this achievement came at the cost of an extended delay in the enactment of the 13 regular appropriations bills that fund the government, with the last three bills being signed intolaw on January 10, 2002, over three months past the October 1, 2001 deadline. Two of the nation'sdepartments with the highest priorities, the Departments of Defense and Education, had to waitover three months to get their budgets. Such delays are unfortunate during ordinary times, but are intolerable when the nation is fighting a war both at home and abroad. Need for Legally Enforceable Mechanisms Last year's success in staying within preset budget limits should be institutionalized through the use of legally enforceable mechanisms. These mechanisms include making the budget resolution a law and extending statutory limits on spending. Such action is necessary if we are to maintain overall spending discipline, while allocating resources to our defense, homeland, and economic priorities ina timely fashion. Conclusion Despite the simultaneous impact of the war on terror and a recession, the nation's fiscal outlook remains positive. The 2003 deficit is expected to be less than one percent of GDP. Furthermore, if growth-promoting policies are pursued and spending restraint is exercised, deficits will be both smalland temporary. As the nation addresses its defense, homeland, and economic priorities, however, growth in the rest of government must be restrained to prevent an explosion in spending. To achieve this goal,budget process reforms are needed. Greater efficiencies must also be demanded from government. This is a good idea at any stage, but is imperative in the current environment. By highlighting good and poor performers, this budget attempts to set such a process in motion.GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY 41GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY Just as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 asks each local school to measure the education of our children, we must measure performance and demand results in federal government programs. President George W. Bush Overview The President has called for a government that focuses on priorities and executes them well. Securing the homeland, waging war on terrorism abroad and revitalizing the economy are the mostimportant priorities but even they will not be addressed by simply devoting money to them. This budget tells the American people how the President proposes to spend their taxes in 2003. People are often most interested in how much the President proposes to spend on particularissues compared to the previous year. Increases in spending are assumed to reflect high priorities and reductions to reflect low priorities. This is because everyone takes for granted that more government spending will translate into more and better government services. For example, thepremise frequently is that more spending on a housing program translates into more houses formore people or more spending on a science program will provide more and better science. The assumption that more government spending gets more results is not generally true and is seldom tested. It is potentially wrong for two reasons. First, the program may not actually achieve the results everyone expects. Second, it ignores the fact that improv ements in the management of programs can result in greater results for less money by realizing the same productivity gains commonly expected in the private sector. By focusing on performance we can achieve the desiredresults at limited additional cost or, in some cases, a reduction in spending. We can and should getmore for less. Rather than pursue an endless and disconnected array of initiatives, the Administration has elected to identify the go vernment's most glaring problems\u2014and solve them. The President has ordered the pursuit of five government-wide initiatives that together will help government achieve better results. The first initiative aims to attract talented and imaginative people to the federal government in order to improve the service provided to our citizens. A second exposes parts of the government tocompetition so that they may better focus on what customers want while controlling cost. A third project improves how the government manages its money\u2014reducing, for instance, the billions in erroneous payments the government makes every year. A fourth project harnesses the power of the 4344 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY Internet to make the government more productive. The fifth starts the process of linking resource decisions with results\u2014the underlying information needed to hold government accountable. This chapter describes the five initiatives in greater detail. It then discusses a scorecard that we are using to hold ourselves accountable for progress on these initiatives. Next, the Administration lays out proposals to remove barriers and give the executive branch the tools and flexibility it needs toget the job done. Finally, this chapter explains how all these matters are shared responsibilities thatmust involve Congress, and introduces readers to the department and agency chapters that follow. The President's Management Agenda Released in August 2001, the President's Management Agenda was designed to \"address the most apparent deficiencies where the opportunity to improve performance is the greatest.\" The President'svision is guided by the principles that government should be: results-oriented, not process oriented;citizen-centered, not bureaucracy-centered; and market-based, promoting competition rather thanstifling innovation. The best organizations in the world are 40 to 50 percent better than their closest competitors\u2014they set their goals by what is theoretically possible, not as a small improvement over last year's performance level. We need to apply this same thought process to our leadership responsib ilities in all of the departments and agencies of the federal government, so that we deliver value to the American people. The President's Management Agenda sets us on this course. Paul O'Neill Secretary of the TreasuryThe President's Management Agenda is a coordinated and coherent strategy to reformfederal management and improve programperformance. It tackles long-neglected management problems and offers specific solutions to fix them. The five government-wide initiatives apply to every department and agency. Togetherthey form a strategy to achieve breakthrough,not simply marginal, improvements in program performance. For example, the expansion of E-Government will transformnot only the agency's work and its peoplebut deliver greatly improved services to thecitizen. The President's Management Agenda commits the Administration to achieving immediate, concrete, and measurable results in the near term. It not only focuses on remedies toproblems generally agreed to be serious, but, more importantly, commits to implement them fully.The five government-wide goals are described below. Strategic Management of Human Capital Fifty percent of the federal workforce is projected to retire over the next 10 years. In addition, federal employee skills are increasingly out of balance with the needs of the public. Federalpersonnel policies exacerbate these problems. Compensation tends to follow a \"one-size-fits-all\"approach; excellence often goes unrewarded; and mediocre and poor performance rarely carries anyconsequences.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 45 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 20100102030405060 Non-Supervisor SupervisorPercent of workforcePercent of the 2000 Civilian Federal Workforce Projected to Retire Source: Office of Personnel Management, excluding postal employees.As 2001 began, many federal agencies did not know much about the characteristics oftheir workforce. For example, few agencies knew what skills they already had on board; what skills they needed to meet futuredemands; and how to address the increasingnumber of management layers. This year, eachagency will prepare a five year restructuringplan as part of its 2003 budget based upon the first government-wide workforce analysis in decades. Agencies must reshape their human capital strategies and organizations to attract andretain the right people, in the right places, atthe right time; make high performance a way of life in the federal service; and deliver the high-quality services the American public deserves. Competitive Sourcing Competitive Sourcing: Old-Fashioned Common Sense Sir, I had the honor to receive your letter of Decr. 28th 1812 requesting any information I might possess, which might expose the present causes of mismanagement in the naval establishment, and suggestions as to the best means of reform...The employment of more artificers, workmen and labourers in the Navy Yards, than can be employed to advantage, is another source of great expence. On this subject I can only say, that, comparing the expence of labour in some of the yards, with the service performed, induces me to believe that it is at least injudiciously directed. And I am disposed to believe that, many articles might be attained by contracts, of equal quality and at much less expence, than by having them made by artificers employed in the yard on daily pay. Lieutenant Charles Morris in a letter to Congressman Langdon Cheves on January 9, 1813 The competitive sourcing initiative strives to create a market-based government unafraid of competition, innovation, and choice. Public-private competition creates significant improvements inperformance and cost savings exceeding 20 percent. Although half of all federal employees performtasks that are readily available in the private sector, these positions have rarely, if ever, been subject to the pressures of the marketplace. The Administration is aggressively encouraging market-based competition throughout the government, and simultaneously working with the private sector and federal employees unions tofind long-term solutions to reform the currently cumbersome process governing competitions.46 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY Work Available in the Yellow Pages? The Department of Veterans Affairs employs over 18,000 medical technicians and pharmacists,11,000 lawn maintenance workers, dry-wallhangers, janitors, and contractors, and 10,000 cafeteria workers.Several agencies are now setting up significant competitive sourcing programs.For example, the Department of the Interiorplans to compete 3,500 federal employeepositions that perform functions that arecommercial in nature and easily competed with the private sector. Many of these positions include cutting grass, picking uptrash, drawing maps and performing basicengineering duties. The Department ofCommerce may compete the work of some positions, such as personnel administration, informationtechnology, and publication. Whether the federal government or private industry does the job, competition ensures that the taxpayer ultimately wins. Improved Financial Performance Improving financial management is critical to ensuring accountability. Federal managers need accurate and timely information for sound decision-making, but have neither. On average, it takes agencies almost five months of heroic efforts to close their books. And even then the overall government has been unable to pass its audit. To improve the quality and timeliness of financial information, the Administration is accelerating financial reporting deadlines and requiring quarterly and comparative reporting of information.Tightening deadlines will force agencies to re-engineer their business and financial managementprocesses, while at the same time developing systems capable of delivering information more useful to management. Particular attention is being directed to troubled agencies already on the GAO high-risk list. In another problem area, federal agencies have identified almost $20 billion in annual erroneous benefit and assistance payments in just 13 federal programs. The Administration has launched anaggressive initiative to determine and track error rates, and to implement strategies and controls tobring the rates down in programs covering over $1.2 trillion in annual expenditures. Expanded E-Government Fifty-five percent of Americans that use the Internet went online to interact with the government last year, according to a report released by the Center for e-Service at the University of Maryland inJanuary 2002. The electronic government, or \"E-Gov,\" initiative focuses on ways to make government simpler, more effective, and less costly from the citizen's point of view. The federal government has only scratched the surface of its E-Gov potential. Today, there are more than 31 million federal webpages available at 22,000 websites, and citizens often find more than a thousand government siteswhen they use a search engine to try to get service. At least 6,600 transactions can either be putonline or eliminated.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 47 W h yN o tU s et h eI n t e r n e t ? Currently, Americans applying for a government loan can, at best, download the forms andsubmit them by mail or fax. All citizens wouldbe better served if they could see and apply for the full range of government loans, similar to the way college students find financial aid at theDepartment of Education's website. Why not usethe Internet? American businesses have come to rely on the Internet, but not when dealing with the federal government. The paperwork burden on the economy exceeds $300 bi llion annually, because computerized records often are printedonto reams of paper to comply with antiquatedgovernment filing requirements. Why not usethe Internet?In February 2002, the E-Gov initiative will relaunch the FirstGov.gov website. We will make the government a \"click and mortar\" enterprise, more accessible,effective, and efficient. Instead of roamingaround thousands of websites, Americans will need only two or three clicks to get service on-line. The Administration has selected24 E-Gov initiatives directed at improvingservices to citizens, businesses, and otherunits of government. These initiativeswill provide easy access to services at the consolidated point of service: FirstGov.gov. An example would be to ensure that majoragencies involved in rulemaking can put theirdockets on-line, where the public can seethe comments filed on proposed rules thataffect them and participate in the rulemaking process. Individual agency chapters and the Analytical Perspectives volume of the budget provide further details on E-Gov. Budget and Performance Integration The initiative to integrate budget and performance has an important purpose\u2014to improve programs by focusing on results. Dollars will go to programs that work; those programs thatdon't work will be reformed, constrained, or face closure. As measures improve, dollars will go toprograms that yield the best results for each dollar spent. The Administration has started to applythese principles, using existing data to make performance the focus of decision-making. Examplesare visible throughout this budget. \u007fShifting Resources to More Effective Programs. Support for technology innovation in the Department of Commerce has increased funding for the more effective National Institute ofStandards and Technology and the Patent and Trademark Office, drawing on funds from theAdvanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The budgetproposes to eliminate the Technology Opportunities Program and shift resources to moreeffective programs in the Department. \u007fSetting Performance Targets. The National Weather Service, a demonstrably effective program, received an increase in funding and specific targets to double tornado lead times by2015, improve aviation forecasting accuracy by 13 percentage points by 2007, and improve temperature forecasts and river forecasts for a pilot region by 2004. \u007fAdding Incentives for Achieving Goals. Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants are often effective, but there are wide variations among states. The budget includes an incentive grant program to provide increased resources to the states that do a better job helping individuals with disabilities obtain competitive employment.48 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY An essential element of evaluating performance is understanding program costs. To compare programs, their cost must be calculated clearly and consistently. The 2003 Budget takes an importantstep toward clarity. For years, employee retirement costs have been tabulated inconsistently. The 2003 Budget shows employee costs, including those relating to retirement, in the appropriate agency budget. Keeping Score We are not here to mark time, but to make progress to achieve results, and to leave a record of excellence. President George W. Bush October 15, 2001Good intentions and good beginnings are not the measure of success. What mattersin the end is completion: performance andresults. Not just making promises, but making good on promises. In order to ensure accountability for performance and results, the Administrationis using an Executive Branch ManagementScorecard. The Administration will use this scorecard to track how well departments and agencies are executing the management initiatives, and where they stand at a given point in time against the overall standards for success. The scorecard employs a simple \"traffic light\" grading system common today in well-run businesses: green for success, yellow for mixed results, and red for unsatisfactory. Scores arebased on five standards for success defined by the President's Management Council and discussedwith experts throughout government and academe, including individual fellows from the NationalAcademy of Public Administration. It's not easy being green. Kermit the Frog The National Science Foundation (NSF) received the only \"green\" score. NSF did so in financialmanagement because it has embraced advancedinformation technologies, and operates in apaperless environment. Its grant workload morethan doubled from $2.1 billion in 1990 to $4.4 billion in 2000, yet the number of employees actually decreased.The standards for financial management, for example, were reviewed by the Secretaryof the Treasury, the Comptroller General, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Under each of the five standards,an agency is \"green\" if it meets all of thestandards for success, \"yellow\" if it hasachieved some but not all of the criteria,and \"red\" if it has even one of any number of serious flaws. For example, in financial management, an agency is \"red\" if its booksare in such poor condition that auditorscannot express an opinion on the agency'sfinancial statements. The initial scorecard shows a lot of poor scores, reflecting the state of the government this Administration inherited. This was to be expe cted since, as the President indicated when selecting the Management Agenda items, the areas are \"targeted to address the most apparent deficiencies where the opportunity to improve performance is the greatest.\" The marks that really matter willbe those that record improvement, or lack of it, from these starting points.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 49 Executive Branch Management Scorecard 2001 Baseline Evaluation Human CapitalCompetitive SourcingFinancial ManagementE-GovBudget/ Performance Integration AGRICULTURE \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f ATION \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f TREASURY \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f VA \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f50 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY Executive Branch Management Scorecard 2001 Baseline Evaluation Human CapitalCompetitive SourcingFinancial ManagementE-GovBudget/ Performance Integration AID \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f SSA \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f Over time, the scores should improve as departments and agencies correct the problems.

Unfortunately, federal managers are greatlylimited in how they can use financial, human,and other resources to manage programs;they lack much of the discretion given to theirprivate sector counterparts to get the job done. Government is ineffective under these conditions. During wartime, turf protectioncannot dictate the national interest. TheCongress should remove barriers and give theAdministration the tools to do the job thatmust be done. The Freedom to Manage Act In October 2001, the Administration submitted to Congress two pieces of legislation to give federal managers the freedom they need to manage programs more effectively. In transmittingthe Freedom to Manage Act, the President asked the Congress to join with the Administrationin making a commitment to reform the federal government by eliminating obstacles to efficientoperation. The Freedom to Manage Act would establish a procedure under which the President would identify structural barriers imposed by law, and the Congress would quickly and decisively act to remove those obstacles. Here are just a few illustrations: \u007fFor years, NASA has been expressly prohibited from relocating aircraft based east of the Mississippi River to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California. \u007fThe Department of Defense is prohibited from outsourcing more than 50 percent of majormaintenance and repair of planes, tanks, and vehicles, regardless of the cost savings to thetaxpayer. \u007fThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) is barred from closing or relocating even a single stateRural Development Office. Taxpayers are paying for 5,600 USDA county field offices (morethan one per county), many located near one another. The Managerial Flexibility Act The second Freedom to Manage measure is the Managerial Flexibility Act, a three-part bill to reform various personnel, budgeting, and property management and disposal laws to give federalmanagers tools and flexibility to better manage federal programs and meet the new challenges of the21 stCentury. \u007fReform Personnel Management :T h i sp roposal gives federal agencies and managers increased latitude in attracting, managing, and retaining a high quality workforce.52 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY \u007fBudgeting and Managing for Results\u2014Full Funding for Federal Retiree Costs: This proposal would assign employee costs, including those relating to retirement, as charges to theprograms themselves. These costs have been included in salary and expense accounts throughout this budget (as well as historically for 2001 and 2002) as they are in modern accounting systems. Under the current archaic system, agency managers have no incentiveto control these costs, as they are unaffected by any improvement. \u007fReform Federal Property Management: The federal government owns or controls 3.2 billion square feet of office buildings, military installations, housing, storage, hospitals, schools,and other facilities and millions of acres of land. The proposal would give federal agenciesauthority they lack to finance the renovation or replacement of obsolete facilities by usingthe equity in their property holdings, providing incentives for better property management.These incentives for better property management would permit a manager to sell an unneeded piece of property and reinvest the proceeds in improving property the government does need. Enhanced Management Authority The President will seek additional authority to organize and manage programs for improved results, including expanded authority to transfer funds to meet higher priority needs, based on unforeseen requirements. The protection of turf and jurisdiction should no longer stand in the way of more effective government. The Administration will seek to re-institute permanent reorganization authority forthe President to permit expedited legislative approval of plans to reorganize the Executive Branch.This time-tested management tool was available to Presidents for 50 years until the law expired in 1984. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration were formed after President Nixon submitted a reorganization plan tothe Congress in 1970. The Bureau of the Budget was reorganized into the Office of Managementand Budget the same year. Program Transfers The budget proposes to transfer a number of programs littered across the government in sometimes very disorganized ways. In addition, the budget also recognizes the need fororganizational reform within departments. For example, the Department of Health and HumanServices chapter details efforts to eliminate unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and consolidateduplicative functions.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 53 Inter-Agency Program Transfers Homeland Security: State/local terrorism programs ..................................................................................

Although the dollars are tiny relative to the department budgets, there are 20 accounts for 11 entities within the EOP that directly serve the President. The President cannot move even $100 between the Council of Economic Advisors and the Council on Environmental Quality without getting the Congress' permission in thenext budget. The President seeks to fund EOP agencies with a consolidated, shared account and forcommon acquisition-related goods and services. This will enable the EOP to eliminate redundantstaff and improve managerial efficiency. A Shared Responsibility Federal programs are responsible for providing services that are critical to the people's welfare. The public deserves at least the same commitment to results from its government that it expectsfrom businesses. We will know we are successful when conversations no longer focus on how muchwe are spending on a program compared to last year but rather how the results of the program willchange. Will we feed more people per dollar, educate more children per dollar, conserve more land per dollar, and so on? The Administration cannot improve the federal government's performance and accountability on its own. It is a shared responsibility that must involve the Congress. The Congress' agenda is acrowded one, and there is an understandable temptation to ignore or block management reforms inf a v o ro fh i g h e rl e v e l so fs p e n d i n go rn e wp r o g r a m s . The Administration rated the effectiveness of programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. It consulted with government performance experts at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University to externally review each rating and its justificationfor internal consistency, based on the principles of accountability and transparency.54 GOVERNING WITH ACCOUNTABILITY Scholars at the university's Government Accountability Project have helped improve the U.S. government's funding and policy decisions since 1997, most notably by publication of the AnnualPerformance Report Scorecard, a comparison of federal agencies' disclosures under the Government Performance and Results Act. Moreover, a number of changes have been made to this year's budget to attempt to make agencies more accountable for results. First, the President's proposals are now presented throughthe agencies charged with carrying them out. Past budgets presented various proposals across thegovernment with little connection to accountability. This budget integrates performance measuresinto its presentation. To the extent possible, the President's proposals are presented in terms of priorities and goals. To facilitate citizen contact, a profile of each major agency includes the department's website address as well as its main phone number. Each chapter's narrative section describes what the Administration hopes each agency will achieve in the coming year. Each agency chapter also contains a status report on select programs todisplay the highs, lows, opportunities, and pitfalls among the programs that the agency administers. Agencies are not solely responsible for the problems they experience serving the public. Congress enacts laws that contribute and restrain agencies in many ways. Every success story in this budget was the result of the Congress' passing a law to establish the program and fund it. On the other hand,the Congress often burdens agencies with numerous restraints that diminish their effectiveness andinhibit innovation. Since the Congress controls the purse, each major agency chapter includes a discussion on how the practice politely called congressional earmarking mars merit-based processes for distributing the American people's resources. The proliferation of congressional earmarking comes at a cost, in wasted dollars and in unfairness, as when a grant applicant who played by the rules and earned aplace at the front of the funding line gets shoved backwards. Each agency is also graded on the five government-wide goals spelled out upon the release of the President's Management Agenda in August 2001. A forthright accounting of progress, or the lack ofit in management areas of weaknesses, accompanies the rankings. Finally, the President's overall request for 2003 closes each agency's chapter.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The President's Proposal : \u007fFulfills commitments to \u007ffully fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children enabling 7.8 million at-risk preg nant and post-partum women, infants, and young children to receive supplemental foods, nutrition education, andaccess to preventative health care each month in 2003; \u007fmaintain a safety net for farmers and foster trade expansion for the long-term prosperity of American agriculture; \u007fprovide record support for food safety programs to protect American agriculture and consumers against unanticipated events; \u007fsimplify rules, support of working fam ilies, and improved incentives for state performance in the Food Stamp program; and \u007ffocus on housing, infrastructure, and other economic assistance to rural communities. \u007fProvide better service to farmers and others at less cost by modernizing field officestructure and processes; and \u007fImprove stewardship of our soil, water, and forestry resources by making moreresources available for conservation with less spent on overhead. Department of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman, Secretary www.usda.gov 202-720-3631 billion Field Offices: Eighteen separate program agencies organized under seven mission areas,with a total of 7,400 field, state, or regional offices outside of the Washington, D.C. headquarters.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides assistanceto farmers and ranchers. The Department promotes agricultural trade and pr oduction, works to assure food safety, protects natural resources, fosters strong rural communities,and fights hunger in America and abroad. 5556 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Overview USDA not only carries out its mission of helping America's farmers but, as the number of American farmers has shrunk, USDA serves essentially all of the American public at some level. Currently, there are over 346,000 farms whose operators make roughly 40 percent or more of their income from farming, and 70,000 USDA employees that support the farming community. This representsapproximately one USDA employee for every five such farms. The Department, by itself, providesmany of the same functions provided by other federal agencies. For example, the Department: \u007fPerforms a security function, with over 3,000 USDA inspectors searching bags at airports andcargo at major ports of entry for compliance with animal and plant import restrictions; \u007fProvides assistance to businesses, housing authorities, electric companies, water supply andsewage treatment facilities and other utilities. At over 5,600 county offices, USDA employeesdistribute farm commodity support payments, housing and community loans, and offer conservation technical advice to land owners; \u007fProtects public health daily at 6,000 meat, poultry, and egg product plants to ensure compliance with food safety standards; \u007fFights fires. In an average year, 832,000 acres of fires on national forests are battled by 10,000USDA firefighters; \u007fConducts research through its own laboratories and at over 200 institutions of highereducation in areas ranging from human nutrition to new crop technologies that, for instance,allow farmers to grow more food using fewer chemicals; and \u007fProvides food to the needy and schools. An estimated $19 billion in food stamps will bedistributed to approximately 20 million needy people in 2002, and on average, 28 millionschool children will receive school lunches through USDA each day. The long list of programs USDA now operates demonstrates how society's view of agriculture and our demands on food systems have changed over the last two centuries. The President's Budget meets the challenges posed by these changes. Unlike previous budgets, this budget reflects a review of the performance of USDA and how performance can be improved. This chapter addresses five primary areas for improvingperformance: 1) aid to farmers; 2) safeguarding the food supply; 3) stewardship on farms and inforests; 4) feeding people in need; and 5) supporting rural America. The chapter provides examples of specific programs that are rated effective or ineffective. Homeland Security Before September 11th, most USDA facilities, including laboratories, were not considered likely targets of terrorists. A subsequent review of USDA facilities throughout the United States andthe world determined that some, including several laboratories that perform research on infectious diseases and food supply contamination, need greater protection. To address the heightened risk, USDA will spend an additional $328 million for improvements in security of personnel, laboratories, and information technology infrastructure in 2002. Thesefunds will provide research and training in the detection of biological and chemical agents, and anintegrated emergency response and communications network to respond to food contamination. Thefunding will also provide for research facility planning, design and construction, for the enhancement THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 57 of border inspections, and for animal and plant disease monitoring. USDA will continue reviewing the security needs of its facilities and equipment. Continued funding is included in the 2003 Budgetfor these activities. In addition to these activities, USDA works to ensure the safety and security of the nation's food supply and agricultural systems through its inspection, monitoring, research, and enforcementactivities. These activities are discussed later in the chapter. Status Report on Select Programs The accompanying table is a selection of effective and ineffective programs in USDA. While the specific budget proposals for these five areas are too detailed to present in this chapter, this is illustrative of how programs were rated. This budget is the first to explicitly rate certain programsand tailor resources and other proposals to improve their performance. Program Assessment Explanation Special SupplementalNutrition Programfor Women, Infants,and Children (WIC)Effective WIC is a successful and cost-effective early intervention program thatsaves lives and improves the health of nutritionally at-risk women,infants, and children. The budget fully funds WIC, allowing service toall eligible persons seeking benefits. USDA County OfficesIneffective Even though USDA has worked on improving efficiency since 1992,enormous duplication and inefficiencies remain. Forest Service Operating ProgramIneffective The Forest Service's administrative and decision-making system,along with confusing and inadequate regulations, has led to gridlock.Currently, according to the National Academy of Public Administration,40 percent to 60 percent of the money spent on this program goes toplanning and litigation rather than projects. Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection ProgramEffective The program conducts inspections of people and cargo entering the country by land, sea, and air. Inspec tions indicate that at least 95 percent of international air passengers are in compliance with federalregulations. Rural Water andWastewater Grantsand LoansEffective The program alleviates health hazards and encourages economicgrowth in rural areas by providing support to build sewage treatmentplants and other water infrastructure. Funds are effectively targeted to the most needy communities including those with major wastewater problems that pose health concerns. Congressional Earmarks The process of identifying and selecting which projects will be funded by the budget involves high levels of subject matter expertise and administrative support. Hence, when non-priority58 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE projects, those not requested by experts, are funded directly by the Congress in what is referred to as \"earmarks,\" there is no assurance that funds will be used to support projects and activities thathave the greatest prospects for success. While earmarks may be good projects, they divert limited funds from programs that have competed fairly in the systematic budget development process and are of higher national priority. USDA programs receive many earmarks\u2014most of which fall inUSDA's research programs. The budget proposes to eliminate funding for over 400 USDA earmarks. Earmarking of research projects is an especially bad idea, because it enables special interest pressure to end-run the competitive selection of proposals through scientific peer review. From 2001to 2002, research earmarks increased in dollar amount and number, with earmark funding rising by 39 percent (from $228 million to $317 million) and the number of earmarks increasing by seven percent (from 414 to 444 earmarks). Aid to Farmers There are approximately 346,000 farms that provide the majority of their operators' incomes.Does federal aid target farmers most in need? How efficient is the government at delivering aid to farmers? These are the measures against which USDA effectiveness isjudged. Most of USDA's aid is funded outsideof the President's annual budget request.USDA provides direct and indirect subsidiesfor the production and export of U.S. crops using funds provided in farm bills that the Congress enacts every five years. For 2000 and2001, the government has provided a total ofover $40 billion in direct farm income support.In calendar years 1999 and 2000, governmentpayments accounted for roughly 49 percent of net farm income; they are projected to be 40 percent of net farm income in 2001. Summary of Farm Income (In billions of dollars) Estimate 1999 Actual 2000 2001 2002 2003 Farm income from product sales ........................ 189 194 206 204 208 Total net farm income1........................................ 44 46 49 45 49 Percent of net income from direct government payments1........................................................49 49 40 33 34 Percent of eligible crops insured ........................ 73 78 78 78 77 1Total net farm income and percent of net income from direct government payments for 2002 and 2003 include additional funding under a new farm bill, which is estimated to provide an additional $4 billion and $7 billion in 2002 and 2003,respectively.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 59 Farm income has held steady over recent years, but has become more dependent on government support. This support is neither targeted well, nor efficiently delivered. The 2003 Budget seeks toimprove aid to farmers by focusing on: increased agricultural trade, improvements in the delivery of farm aid, addressing risk management on the farm, and supporting agricultural research. The 1996 farm bill expires at the end of 2002, and Congress is currently working on a new farm bill. Funding in USDA's annual budget request as described in this chapter for 2003 is inaddition to, and coordinated with, the farm program funding provided in the 1996 farm bill. TheAdministration supports, and the budget reflects, an additional $73.5 billion over a 10-year period,for a farm bill that will provide a strong safety net for all farmers and ranchers, expand markets abroad for American agricultural products, and increase resource conservation in ways that enhance the environment. This funding will provide additional farm support payments; increasefunding for conservation programs; improve the food stamp program; enable the establishment ofrisk management savings accounts for farmers and ranchers; and increase support for other USDAprograms, including trade, research, and rural development. T h eC r i t i c a lI s s u eo fT r a d e Twenty-five percent of farm receipts are generated by exports. One quarter of all the revenues coming into the farm economy are generated as a result of a farmer in America, or a rancher in America, selling that product overseas. Our farmers and ranchers are the most efficient producers in the world. This is an area where our country has a competitive advantage. We're really good at it. And the job of this Administration must be to open up more markets for ag products. President George W. Bush June 18, 2001Ak e yw a yt oi n c r e a s ef a r mi n c o m ei st o increase trade. The President is committedto expanding overseas agricultural marketsby lowering trade barriers and strengtheningUSDA's ability to identify potential new foreign market opportunities. Recent trade statistics indicate that these efforts areworking\u2014U.S. agricultural exports for 2002are forecast to be $57 billion, up $4.2 billionfrom 2001. If these forecasts are realized,the 2002 export level will be the highest since 1997 and represent three straight years of sustained agricultural export growth. U.S.exports of high-value products, currently at$24 billion, $1.8 billion more than last year,are increasing the U.S. farm trade surplus. At the upcoming multilateral trade negotiations, the Administration will work to expand opportunities for agricultural exports by lowering trade barriers utilizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The TPA authority gives U.S. trade negotiators the ability to negotiate trade agreements with ourcurrent trading partners and open new markets under future trade agreements. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) represents U.S. agricultural interests overseas and plays a critical role in gathering market intelligence, which provides expertise in resolving technicaltrade issues and developing international commodity standards. FAS activities are fully funded in the budget. USDA also has a wide range of trade promotion programs that expand overseas market opportunities and develop long-term trade relationships with foreign countries. Theseinclude subsidies to export firms that face unfairly subsidized overseas competitors and creditguarantees for the commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports. USDA also provides outreach60 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE and exporter assistance activities that are designed to assist businesses in identifying opportunities overseas and entering export markets for the first time. 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002010203040506070 0510152025U.S. Exports U.S. Share of World ExportsAgricultural Exports Grow While U.S. Share Holds Steady Source: Department of Agriculture.In billions of dollars PercentThe budget proposes to reform the delivery of American food aid through USDA, USAID, and the Department of State. As part ofthose reforms, the budget includes a $335million increase for P.L 480 Title II food aid.A discussion of these reforms is included inthe Department of State and International Assistance chapter. Efficient Delivery of Farm Aid Why do the more than 28,000 USDA employees working in 5,600 county field offices across the country, wear different \"hats\" depending upon the category of serviceprovided? The answer is rooted in history. USDA's Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Farm Service Agency (FSA), andRural Development (RD) offices evolved over time, with the Congress, by law, giving them separatemandates and organizational hierarchies. Today, these USDA agencies act as separate franchises, with offices often located adjacent to each other. Prior efforts to improve the efficiency of USDA's county-based offices have resulted insignificant co-location, with 2,600 service centers now operating. New information technology hasbeen introduced to simplify customer transactions and to share information among USDA agencies.However, the separate hierarchical structures at state, regional, and headquarter levels are set inlaw, and this hinders further attempts to achieve additional efficiencies. For example, USDA personnel located in the same county office location operate three separate payroll, procurement, computer, and travel support systems. Similarly, county office personnelcannot \"help each other out\" with workload. For instance, a conservationist visiting a farm cannotverify the farmer's land unit to qualify for certain commodity support programs\u2014a separate tripmust be made by a USDA employee in a different \"hat.\" Congress has impeded efficiency improvements by: 1) not allowing USDA to combine administrative support offices and 2) not allowing the relocation of offices without congressional approval. The Administration has proposed legislation that seeks to remove roadblocks to efficientmanagement (the Freedom to Manage Act). This budget proposes changes that will allow theagencies to operate together more efficiently within the current organizational constraints.Specifically, the Administration proposes that the FSA and NRCS field offices seek improvementsby: \u007fRestructuring the administrative support offices to improve efficiency of informationtechnology, personnel, travel, payroll, and procurement; \u007fReviewing the field office structure to determine the most efficient level of offices necessary to provide services, with the goal of co-locating at least 200 additional offices in 2003;THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 61 \u007fBeginning to centralize loan servicing functions that do not need to be performed at the field level; \u007fEvaluating pilot projects and developing guidance to strengthen NRCS' process foremphasizing local involvement in setting national priorities; and \u007fImplementing competitive sourcing and cross servicing. Improvements undertaken that will improve efficiency and increase the number of employees available to provide services directly to the U.S. citizen will be evaluated based on: \u007fReducing the number of office visits and reporting burden for clients of FSA and NRCS. A 10percent reduction in reporting would reduce the number of hours spent filling out forms by 1.7 million hours or 46 minutes per farm (currently 17 million hours spent, 7 hours and 44 minutes per farm); and \u007fIncreasing the provision of core customer services, including technical assistance visits and eligibility determinations, while maintaining or reducing the number of personnel and/or the cost associated with the provision of service. Managing Risk on the Farm What can farmers do to lessen the risk their crop may be lost due to drought or other natural disaster? USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) administers a crop insurance program through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). These insurance policies insure a farmer againstcrop losses from natural disasters or market price reductions, and are delivered through privateinsurance companies. In 2003, it is expected that 80 percent of the total amount of crop acreageeligible for crop insurance will be covered. FCIC now subsidizes over half the cost of farmers'insurance premiums to encourage farmer participation. As more farmers participate, this should reduce the need for ad-hoc supplemental federal funding for crop losses due to natural disasters. FCIC also reimburses private insurance companies' administrative costs, and pays a share of the indemnities on insurance policy claims, which provides an incentive for the companies to sell thepolicies. The program was revised in 2000 thorough the Agricultural Risk Protection Act (ARPA).ARPA increased the estimated annual cost of the program from $1.7 billion to $3 billion, largelydue to its increases in insurance premium subsidies. However, the changes have made the program more attractive to farmers and significantly increased participation. Since 1993, the crop insurance program has grown from $700 million in gross premiums insuring $10 billion in crop value, to $2.4billion in premiums insuring over $32 billion in crop value in 2000. The Administration believes that improvements should be made in the risk sharing arrangements between the government and the private insurance companies. To achieve this, the 2003 Budgetproposes amending the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The proposal continues to provide incentives to the insurance companies to participate in the crop insurance program but establishes constraints on windfall profits. The proposal would cap the underwriting gains to 12.5 percent of each company'sretained premiums for the year. The dollar volume of total underwriting gains went from $201 millionto $378 million (an 88 percent increase) between 1999 and 2001. The change will save $89 per policysold to participating farmers in the crop insurance program in 2003.62 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Wheat is susceptible to natural disaster and diseases, such as karnal bunt.Assisting Farmers through Research Agricultural research can lead to discoveries that result in increases in farm income through better management, improvements in production and processingtechniques, development of new and improvedseed, and technologies to achieve themaximum use of agricultural products.Research also helps achieve other objectives, such as food safety. The challenge is to target research funding to the highestpriorities\u2014those that are most likely toboost farm income, or address other nationalconcerns. Priority research projects areidentified through competitive merit-based processes and peer review. As mentioned above, congressional earmarks can hinder the ability to focus funding on priority research. The 2003 Budget proposes an increase of $58 million for in-house research for a number of high priority initiatives of key national importance, such as: bio-based products; biotechnology;counter-terrorism; invasive species; genomics; and upgrades to the National Agricultural Library.The Administration had agencies re-evaluate all their programs, to ensure that taxpayer dollars fund the highest priority activities that meet national needs. The 2003 Budget does not propose to fund numerous unrequested projects added by the Congress in 2001 and 2002, and also reallocates$15 million from lower priority programs to fund priority initiatives. The 2003 Budget also proposes providing a significant increase in funds for the National Research Initiative (NRI), USDA's major discretionary competitive grant program. To date, the NRI has neverreceived more than $120 million. In 2003, the budget proposes to double funding for the NRI, to $240 million. Under this proposal, funding for competitive research would increase from seven percent to 12 percent of all research funding, or from 16 percent to 28 percent of research grant programs in2003. Safeguarding the Nation's Food Supply The United States has the safest food supply in the world. USDA has a prominent role in protecting the security of the national food supply, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local health agencies. Workingtogether, these agencies share information and coordinate food safety activities from farm to table.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incidence of reported foodborneillnesses under surveillance in the United States has declined in recent years; however, foodbornediseases still cause over five million illnesses and up to 9,000 deaths annually. Government food safety agencies are committed to a goal of reducing by 25 percent, from 2000-2005, the incidence of foodborne illness in this country. While existing public health data do not allow specific linkages between the prevalence of foodborne hazards, and the level of foodborne illnesses, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service(FSIS) has several performance standards in place to address product safety. These includeTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 63 pathogen reduction performance standards for salmonella. Monitoring establishment performance data indicates that the prevalence of salmonella on meat and poultry products has declined. While FSIS has been moving in recent years to a science-based food safety regulatory system, the underlying meat inspection laws, put in place in the early 1900s, have not been updated to reflect modern risk knowledge. Efforts to implement inspection processes that are more risk based currentlyface legal challenges. For example, in October 1999, FSIS began testing a new slaughter inspectionmodel. Independent testing of the new inspection procedures showed superior food safety benefitsover the traditional inspection system. However, the expansion of the new system outside of severalpilot plants has not occurred due to ongoing litigation that challenges the statutory basis of FSIS to implement procedures that differ from traditional inspection. The budget proposes increased funding for risk prevention activities and improved risk management systems to maximize food safety. In addition, the budget includes a proposal to replacethe existing overtime fee structure with a revised structure that would reduce existing overtimerates, while also charging fees for inspection services currently provided without reimbursementfor second and third shifts. The budget also contains a new annual licensing fee proposal that will make funds available, in subsequent years, for FSIS to invest in food safety inspection technology. Pest and Disease Outbreaks USDA recently released an independent risk assessment on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or Mad Cow Disease, which showed a very low risk of BSE in the United States. Early protection systems to safeguard against BSE, put into place by USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, have been successful. The BSE risk assessment will be helpful in identifyingadditional steps that government and industry should take to keep the risk at a very low level. Quincy, a USDA beagle, inspects passenger baggage.The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the primary agencyinvolved in the BSE plan\u2014APHIS is responsible for protecting the United States from pests and diseases of plants and animals.APHIS programs represent a continuum ofactions that include: working with foreignnations to set agreed upon standards ofpurity; inspecting people and cargo entering the country for prohibited articles; monitoring plant and animal health; and activelyresponding to infestations that threaten farmsand ranches. Besides working with foreigngovernments to reduce the risk of the entryof pests and diseases, APHIS has over 3,500 inspectors, working closely with the U.S. Customs Service, to prevent the entry of prohibited (potentially dangerous) agricultural products. USDA continually monitors plant and animal healthto detect and respond to exotic disease introductions, and to combat ongoing infestations, suchas the Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Canker. APHIS also enforces the humane treatmentand care of animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. APHIS programs have demonstratedsuccess in many of these areas, such as: minimizing the number of fruit fly outbreaks established64 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE in the United States (by an almost 10 fold reduction in square mileage); and increasing the area eradicated of boll weevil by about 700,000 acres. 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001050100150200250300350Growth in Emergency Funding to Combat Agricultural Infestations Spending in millionsThe 2003 Budget proposes an increase of $75 million in pest and disease exclusion and monitoring programs to guard against thethreat of foreign animal diseases, such asFoot and Mouth Disease (FMD), entering theUnited States. The 2003 Budget also proposes to fund the ongoing costs of combating infestations through the annual budget request to theCongress\u2014and proposes a $175 millionincrease for these activities\u2014rather thanthrough emergency funding authority. Inaddition, the budget proposes to establish criteria for cost-share rates for these programs, to be published for public comment in 2002. Stewardship on Our Farms and in Our Forests Farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners own and manage two-thirds of the nation's land and are stewards of much of our soil, air, and water. USDA provides these landowners with technical and financial assistance needed to effectively conserve natural resources. Efforts to improve and implement conservation technologies over the past two decades have reduced soil erosion on cropland and pasture by 1.2 billion tons (40 percent), and those gains are spread widely across all majorfarming regions. These natural resources are critically important for keeping our nation's economycompetitive and for solving challenges we face in agriculture, energy production and use, and theenvironment. As a result, federal conservation and forestry dollars must be invested as effectively as possible. This budget proposes to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the federal government's investments in conservation and forestry by improving management at USDA andrefocusing resources to \"on the ground\" efforts. To meet this commitment, key performance measuresin conservation and forestry are identified. Clean Water Agriculture has a significant impact on the nation's water. While, overall, water quality has dramatically improved, the application of fertilizers, manure, and pesticides have degraded thequality of streams and shallow ground water in some agricultural areas. Commercial fertilizersand animal manure are among the primary nonpoint sources of nitrate and phosphorus in surfacewater and groundwater. \u007fHigh concentrations of phosphorus lead to nuisance plant growth in nearly 80 percent ofstreams sampled by the Environmental Protection Agency, leading to low levels of dissolvedoxygen that harm fish and other aquatic life. \u007fAt least one pesticide was found in more than 95 percent of stream samples.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 65 \u007fA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) study found that the number of counties where manure nutrients exceed potential plant uptake and removal has doubled in the last15 years. Water quality improvements and wetland protections can be achieved through voluntary measures. The Administration, working with states, is seeking to achieve voluntary environmentalimprovements by targeting its technical and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers whooperate in the watersheds with the greatest needs. In 2003, the NRCS will spend $118 million,an increase of $48 million, to provide animal feeding operation owners with technical assistanceto develop voluntary nutrient management plans designed to protect water quality to the extent possible. Part of this effort in focusing assistance on the areas and activities of greatest need is to reduce or eliminate under-performing or ineffective programs. USDA's Watershed and Flood PreventionOperations program provides technical and financial assistance to plan and install small dams andother watershed-based projects for purposes of flood prevention, irrigation water management, andsedimentation control. Data show that the Army Corps of Engineers' flood damage reduction program returns 50 cents more per dollar invested than the USDA program (see the Army Corps of Engineers chapter). Consequently, the budget closes out USDA's flood mitigation projects, which struggle toachieve the required cost-benefit ratio. Restructure the Forest Service to Improve Performance Americans cherish national forests and national grasslands for the values they provide\u2014clean water, clean air, natural scenic beauty, protection of rare species, and opportunities for unparalleledoutdoor adventure. However, the burden of too many organizational layers and a cumbersomedecision-making process have reduced the amount of funds available to professionals who workin our national forests. This has reduced the level of conservation work at the national forests toexceedingly low levels. The budget includes significant management reforms for the Forest Service that will improve service to citizens and increase administrative efficiencies by putting more foresters in the forests. These reforms include: \u007f\"One-stop shopping\" for the public and reduced federal overhead expenses by co-locating 22Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management offices by the end of 2005; \u007fAn increase of resources to the field by reducing Forest Service indirect expenses in half by2005; \u007fPlacement of Forest Service personnel closer to the resource by relocating or reassigningWashington Office and regional office employees; and \u007fDevelopment of a model forest office by increasing the amount of resources available for contracting out to local communities and significantly increasing the amount of cost-share assistance for leveraging projects on federal lands. To overcome inertia and an excessive decision-making structure, USDA will develop legislation in 2003 to establish \"charter forests.\" This proposal would establish certain forests or portions offorests as separate entities, outside the Forest Service structure, that report to a local trust entityfor oversight. Like charter or magnet schools, this proposed structure would avoid the central bureaucracy and thereby reduce organizational inefficiencies, while emphasizing local involvement, and focusing upon specific programmatic goals, such as forest ecological restoration or hazardousfuels reductions.66 of Limiting acres burned in millions Source: Department of Agriculture.Wildfire Management The long history of controlling wildfires has an unfortunate side effect\u2014successful suppression of fires in the past has led to larger and more intense fires today. At thesame time, more people are moving into areasthat have traditionally been wildlands. Withlarger, more intense fires threatening morehomes and businesses, the costs of wildfire suppression have risen dramatically. Wildfires are a natural occurrence that help to maintain forest health and wildlifehabitat. However, as the accompanying chartshows, the acreage burned from wildfires hasdeclined sharply over the years, as the Forest Service and other land management agencies have emphasized fire suppression. This approach has exacerbated the risks from damaging catastrophic wildfires, since woody undergrowth that wouldhave burned away in smaller, less-intense fires now has grown into thickets across the West. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 200100.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Federal Wildfire Suppression Expenditures Have Risen Dramatically In billions of dollars Source: Department of Agriculture.Costs for suppression have also risen as the other chart shows. In 2001, the ForestService spent $1,300 per acre in suppressing fires on 573,000 acres of forests, an increase in cost per acre of almost 300 percent over2000. In comparison, wildfire suppressioncosts for the Department of the Interior (DOI)averaged about $235 per acre, although muchof DOI's lands are grasslands, which burn less intensely than forests. In some western areas, the government pays more in suppressing firesthan the fair market value of the structuresthreatened by those fires. It would literallybe cheaper to let the fires burn and pay 100percent of the rebuilding cost. The Forest Service is looking at a variety of ways to control the costs of fire suppression. For example, the Forest Service will work with stateand local governments to identify areas to pilot test \"fire plain easements\" as a way to protect liveswhile ensuring that taxpayer funds are used wisely. Another way to protect communities and lower fire-fighting costs is to reduce the amount of brush and small trees, especially in areas adjacent to human populations. The President's Budget funds the Forest Service Hazardous Fuels Treatments program at $229 million, with over 70 percent of funds directed to the wildland-urban interface. This will result in the completion of buffers at eightpercent of eligible vulnerable communities by the end of 2003.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 67 On average, 832,000 acres burn in national forests annually.This budget also emphasizes improvements in fire management planning, and willincorporate the results of several ongoing program reviews, so that better decisions can be made regarding when and how to fightfires, and fire program performance and costeffectiveness. The budget anticipates the costof fighting fires in a typical year. Accordingly,wildfire suppression is funded at a 10-year average of $423 million. Fulfilling a Commitment to Land Protection National forests and grasslands support the richest variety of habitats of any land management system in North America and a greatvariety of plants and animals depend upon them. To protect these resources, the President's Budgetincludes $15 million to expedite endangered species consultations to ensure careful management offood, water, space, and shelter for these species. The budget also includes an increase of $9 million to expand recreation, heritage, and wilderness management, while also focusing upon improving the ecological integrity of the forests, both in terms of forest health and forested areas restored. The budget includes full funding of the Forest Service portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), and increases funding to $70 million in the Forest Legacy program to protect againstthe loss of forests from development. LWCF funds provide clean water, maintain contiguous forests,preserve wildlife habitat, and protect archaeological and historical sites. The budget promotes the protection of environmentally sensitive acres targeted at conservation needs that foster better cooperation among the land management bureaus and between the bureaus, states, and localinterests. Over $51 million is provided to address a backlog in repair and maintenance of existingfacilities. The budget proposes to establish incentives for cost-effective, non-regulatory, market-based approaches to conservation, including a more business-like approach for timber sales by stimulating competition. This proposal will allow conservation and recreation groups and others to bid on timber sales. In addition, to provide an incentive for private, voluntary land protection, the budgetincludes a 50 percent capital gains tax exclusion for private landowners who voluntarily sell land orwater to a government agency or qualified conservation organization for conservation purposes. Feeding People in Need The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) saves lives and improves the health of nutritionally at-risk women, infants and children. Numerousgovernment and private studies show that WIC is one of the nation's most successful andcost-effective early intervention programs. Research documents the success of WIC in improvingbirth outcomes and saving health care costs. In addition, studies have demonstrated that WICimproves: diet and diet-related outcomes; infant feeding practices; immunization rates; access to health care; and cognitive development.68 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The budget reflects this demonstrated success by increasing the program's funding by $364 million in 2003, making certain that all eligible people who seek services receive them. The budget providesalmost $4.8 billion in 2003, including a $150 million contingency fund. The request is sufficient to serve 7.8 million people monthly and the contingency fund will ensure that the program can expand to serve an increasing number of eligible persons should that be necessary for any reason. Why WIC Works More than a decade ago, the high cost of infant formula threatened to limit the number of peopleWIC could afford to serve. Fortunately, two WICstate agencies discovered an innovative way totrim the program's costs without reducing its benefits. Understanding that the large quantities of infant formulas the program was purchasing gave ita unique bargaining position, WIC agencies inTennessee and Oregon negotiated contracts thatoffered infant formula manufacturers exclusive rights to the WIC market in return for discounted prices. The agreements, which saved the twostates more than a dollar on each can of formula,were quickly replicated by other states eager toexpand WIC's reach without increasing its costs. Today, all WIC's state agencies are required by law to negotiate discounted infant formula contracts. The result: WIC will save $1.5 billionin 2002, allowing the program to reach nearly twomillion indivi duals who would otherwise not have been served at the program's current fundinglevel.Food Stamps The budget proposes to reauthorize and improve the Food Stamp program. Foodstamps alleviate hunger and malnutritionamong low-income individuals. In 2003, theprogram will provide approximately $20.3billion in benefits to 20.6 million people. The federal government will provide an additional $3.7 billion for state administrative costs, jobtraining programs for food stamp recipients,and the Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistanceblock grant. Complex Food Stamp rules create a program that is highly targeted to the neediest individuals but at the same time,administratively burdensome for statesand recipients. Other program rules pose abarrier to supporting working families. ThePresident's Food Stamp proposal greatly simplifies program rules, encourages work, and improves program accountability. Thepackage standardizes the medical anddependent care deductions, eliminatesexceptions to the standard utility allowance,and excludes interest and dividend income from income tests. At the same time, the budget phases in a higher standard deductionto improve benefits for large households. The budget restores benefits to legal immigrants five years after entry to the United States, ensuring adequate nutrition among children and other vulnerable individuals, while requiringrecent arrivals to support themselves through earnings. To lower transportation barriers to work, the budget excludes one vehicle per adult from program asset rules, allowing a low-income worker to own a reliable car for getting to work without losing benefits. The budget improves performance incentives for states by reforming the quality control system, replacing enhanced funding with performance bonuses, and removing the federal cost cap forelectronic benefit transfer systems. The budget also tightens overly broad waivers from eligibilitycriteria and reduces, but provides greater flexibility for, the use of employment and training funds. The budget maintains a strong focus on improving program integrity with a goal of reducing the national average error rate from 8.91 percent for 2000 to 8.7 percent for 2002. This improvement isTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 69 projected to save $40 million in 2002. With an additional $4 million for food stamp payment accuracy initiatives in 2003, FNS will redouble its efforts to reduce erroneous payments, especially in stateswith the highest error rates. The budget also improves federal oversight of meals programs for the elderly by transferring USDA's Nutrition Services Incentive Program to the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) and consolidating it with HHS elderly meals programs. Supporting Rural America Since the 1930s, USDA has been in the business of promoting economic development in rural America through a variety of loan and grant programs that assist rural communities in addressing their infrastructure, housing, and economic development needs. On average, USDA annuallyprovides over $10 billion in grants and direct and guaranteed loans, and has an outstanding directloan portfolio of over $70 billion. 2003 Rural Development Budget Highlights \u007f1.4 million rural residents will have access to clean, safe drinking water. \u007f44,000 jobs will be created or savedthrough RCAP business and communityprograms. \u007f51,000 low to moderate income ruralfamilies will have a new opportunity forhomeownership. \u007fUpgrade 225 rural electric systems,benefiting over 3.4 million customers. \u007fProvide distance learning facilities to over300 schools, libraries, and educationcenters and telemedicine equipment to150 health providers. \u007fDevelop innovative ways to fund newmultifamily housing projects. Ensureallocation processes target the mostneedy areas and state-identified priority locations.Thirty percent of rural counties have a declining population, according to recentcensus data, and nearly a quarter ofnon-metro households pay 30 percent or moreof their income for housing costs. Smaller rural communities often have fewer sources of credit than their urban counterparts, and\"patient\" capital for start-up businesses, inparticular, is more scarce in rural areas. \u007fThe needs of rural areas are so differentthat no single approach can meet the needs of all rural communities. To address that, the Rural CommunityAdvancement Program (RCAP)provides flexible funding to thestates for water and wastewaterinfrastructure, community facilities, such as fire stations and medical centers, and business development.The budget provides a total (loan levelplus grants) of $2.7 billion. \u007fUSDA provides subsidized,means-tested loans and loanguarantees to individuals for homes,and makes subsidized financing available to developers who offer housing to elderly, disabled, migrant farm workers, or low-income rural residents of multi-unit housing buildings. All the programs are limited to areas with populations of 20,000 or less. In 2003, the direct and guaranteed single familyhousing programs will fund $3.7 billion in loans and loan guarantees. \u007fUSDA provides loans to cooperatives and private companies for electric andtelecommunication service throughout rural America. The electric and telecommunications70 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE programs are not targeted to needier areas and even serve areas that are no longer rural. In the budget, USDA will review the electric and telecommunications programs to determineand implement methods for better targeting of these funds. Strengthening Management USDA has been working for some time on improving service through increasing the efficiency of the network of county offices that are located throughout the United States. In addition, USDA hasbeen improving financial management and information security. However, the Department has alot of work to do to meet existing management requirements. These initiatives are contained in the President's Management Agenda, discussed below. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014There are skill gaps/imbalances across USDA, and USDA is not using existing personnel flexib ility. USDA provided a plan detailing how it is going to take advantage of the current skills, improve weak skill areas, and reallocate its workforce to increase frontlineservice provision. The plan will be modified to reflect adjustments prompted by a new farm bill. \u007f Competitive Sourcing\u2014 The goal is to compete 15 percent of the commercial positions by the end of 2003. Despite a wide array of possibilities, such as administrative personnel, data collectors, groundskeepers, janitors, and veterinarians, USDA has completed no competitions. USDA has recently prepared a plan detailing how it is going to meet the President's goal.USDA has indicated that it will begin competitions later in 2002 and continue into 2003. \u007f Financial Management \u2014Some USDA financial systems do not comply with federal financial management systems requirements or applicable federal accounting standards. A significantAnti-Deficiency Act violation occurred in the Forest Service in 2000. Such a violation of law occurs when an agency spends more money than is given to it by Congress. Auditors have been unable to express an opinion on the combined USDA financial statement and theForest Service's stand alone financial statement. While improvements have been made, thisaudit outcome has not substantively improved since 1996. USDA is close to implementing aDepartment-wide compliant financial system, and continues to work with the Inspector Generaland OMB on improving the processes and procedures used to estimate and re-estimate loan subsidy costs. Finally, USDA is working with the Forest Service on improving the control of property, plant, and equipment. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 71 Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014Many, but not all, major USDA system investments have been adequately justified and supported by well-drawn business cases. Many, but not all, of the projects are operating within 90 percent of cost, schedule, and performance targets. USDA is deploying Geospatial Information Systems and participates in Firstgov.gov. USDA is taking steps tomore effectively plan and manage its information technology investments and has recentlydeveloped an enterprise architecture plan. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014The goal is to provide greater focus on performance. USDA's performance measures are only imperfectly tied to the budget. Performance measuresdid not accompany the budget submission, and do not drive any budget requests. There are no clear performance targets to achieve. Sporadically across USDA, performance measures describe outputs generated by the budget after budget levels are determined. USDA needsto align processes and budget accounts to track the full cost of programs and measureachievement of program goals. USDA needs to develop a plan to better integrate performancemeasures into the budget process. \u007f Department of Agriculture (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Commodity and proposal ............................................................ \u2014\u2014 34 Central Activities ....................................................................... 472 481 549 Subtotal, excluding changes to mandatory programs 20,499 Mandatory savings adjusted1........

To enhance these core capabilities, resources are shifted from unwarranted corporate subsides and lower priority programs. Department of Commerce Donald L. Evans, Secretary www.doc.gov 202-482-2112 Number of Employees : 37,000 2002 Spending : $5.5 billion Field Offices : 10 bureaus with offices across the United States and 86 countries.The Commerce Department provides information, technology services, and science that assist American business and society. It makes possible the weather reports heardevery morning; it facilitates technologythat Americans use daily in the workplaceand at home; it supports the collectionand development of statistical information essential for competitive business and our representative democracy; it helps Americanfirms and consumers benefit from openand fair international markets; it seeks tomanage our marine fisheries; and it supports environmental and economic health in the communities where we live. This array of activities is reflected in Commerce's three strategic goals: \u007fProvide the information and economic framework to enable the U.S. economy to operate efficiently and equitably, both nationally and globally; \u007fProvide the infrastructure for innovation with cutting-edge science and technology to enhanceAmerican competitiveness; and 7374 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE \u007fObserve and manage the Earth's environment to promote sustainable growth. Homeland Security The President's Budget provides an additional $30 million for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection activities at the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). BXA regulatesexports of critical goods and technologies that could be used to damage national interests, whilefurthering the growth of legitimate U.S. exports to maintain our economic leadership. The fundingincreases in 2003 strengthen BXA activities that inhibit the global spread of dual-use goods andtechnologies that could be used in biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction. To reduce the risk of proliferation, beginning in 2003, BXA will post attaches in China, Egypt, India, Russia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates to reduce risks of trans-shipments through thesecountries to terrorist states. Also, BXA's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office will work withthe Office of Homeland Security to ensure that information technology systems and procedures arein place to provide broad access to relevant homeland security information for appropriate federal,state, and local government agencies. Homeland security investments will also be made in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and central departmental management offices. Specifically, the 2003Budget addresses vulnerabilities in weather and satellite systems to ensure NOAA is able tomaintain critical operations in crisis situations. The 2003 Budget also will strengthen physical andinformation technology security at the Department. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration proposes a variety of measures to address Commerce Department performance issues, including increasing funding where needed for core activities, reducing fundsfor low-priority or unnecessary programs, and instituting management reforms where necessary.Below are summary ratings and explanations for major Commerce bureaus and programs. Thesummary ratings were developed by the Office of Management and Budget based upon Commerce performance data and evaluations conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO), Commerce's Inspector General, and groups such as the National Academy of Sciences. Program Assessment Explanation Census Bureau Effective Census 2000 was the most accurate decennial census ever, with a net undercount of 0.06 percent. Controlling costs per household while maintaining accuracy is a major challenge for 2010 Census planning. International Trade Administration (ITA)Unknown Although ITA trade-promotion services are generally positivelyregarded, assisted firms currently pay little of the program's cost.Commerce will study fee options in 2002 to develop an appropriatecost-recovery framework. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 75 Program Assessment Explanation National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST)Effective NIST Laboratories are world leaders in high-tech and basic industrialstandards. AdvancedTechnology Program(ATP)Unknown ATP has been associated with some technical successes, but in someof those cases federal support was probably not necessary. Othersclearly represented unwarranted corporate subsidies. Proposedreforms will enable the program to better address current conditions and needs. National Weather Service (NWS)Effective NWS continues to improve forecasts for extreme weather bymodernizing systems and has reduced the number of its officesnationwide from over 250 prior to 1990 to 122 in 2002. National MarineFisheries Service(NMFS)Unknown Less than 40 percent of major ocean fish stocks are known to beat sustainable levels, 20 percent of stocks are over fished, and theremaining 42 percent of stocks have unknown population levels. Legislative reforms and reduced congressional earmarking of funds will help NMFS maintain sound fisheries. Congressional Earmarks Earmarks and Unrequested Projects NOAA's oceans and fisheries programs in the2002 appropriations include over $13 million forenvironmental remediation activities in an inlandstate far from the ocean. Since 2000, NOAAhas been required to provide over $45 million for these activities. The program may have merit, but it harms NOAA's performance in managing thenation's marine fisheries and oceans by cuttingresources available for those purposes. NIST's construction account has been repeatedly earmarked to support projects unrelated to NIST activities.Congressional earmarks for non-com- petitively awarded projects divert resourcesthat could more effectively meet the mission of the Department. For example, projects steering money to particular universitiesor localities sometimes draw funds fromprograms with far different purposes.Moreover, the dollar value of earmarkshas been increasing in recent years. In 2000, there were about 100 unrequested projects costing about $170 million in theDepartment of Commerce. The Department's2002 appropriations include over $225million for 96 unrequested projects. NOAAhas over two-thirds of the Department's congressionally directed earmarks\u201474 projects costing over $160 million. The 2003 Budget cuts many of these unrequested projects and redirects funds to activities that can mosteffectively meet the Department's three strategic goals.76 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Congressional Earmarks 2000 2002 Projects BA in millions of dollarsProjects BA in millions of dollars Commerce T otal ....................................... 100 170 96 228 NOAA ........................................................ 92 143 74 161 NIST .......................................................... 41 4 1 2 4 8 Besides reducing earmarks, the 2003 Budget proposes to rescind $96 million provided for loan guarantees to bankrupt and other financially troubled steel firms. This funding was provided in 1999, and was intended to support federal guarantees of up to 85 percent on loans by private lenders. While several applications for loan guarantees have been approved, only one of these loans has actuallyclosed since the program was established. Virtually all funding was rescinded last year from a relatedprogram intended to benefit the oil and gas industry. Strengthening Economic Information and Framework The President's Budget proposes to strengthen core Commerce activities in areas such as statistical programs and international trade compliance. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) supplies the nation's key economic statistics, including gross domestic product (GDP), which are crucial ingredients for business and government decisionmaking. An additional $10 million in 2003 will enable BEA to improve the statistical processingsystems for its economic data, accelerate the release of major economic estimates, and incorporate new international economic data classification systems. Although the U.S. GDP statistics are widely regarded as among the best in the world, they require continued improvements to keep pace with thenation's rapidly changing economy. 0102030405060 00.51.01.52.0Census Cost Per Home vs. Net Undercount Cost per home in 2001 dollars Net undercount percentage $32$56 1.6% 0.06% 1990 2000 Source: Department of Commerce.This budget proposes a $223 million increase for the Bureau of the Censusfor a variety of activities, including the Department's efforts to reengineer the 2010 Census. As a major part of this work, Censuswill launch the American Community Survey,which will provide detailed demographic dataon an annual\u2014rather than decennial\u2014basis.During 2003, Census also will be collecting data for two other cyclical censuses, the Economic Census and the Census ofGovernments. The Economic Census paintsa detailed portrait of the national and localeconomies every five years, with informationon the nearly 23 million businesses and establishments in the nation. Funding in 2003 also supports dissemination of Census 2000 data, including detailed results from the census longform. The challenge for the Department will be to retain a highly accurate decennial census in2010, while avoiding per capita real cost growth.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 77 Census 2000 was the most accurate census in history. The net undercount, or how manypeople the Census Bureau missed minus thenumber of people erroneously included, droppedto the lowest level ever. However, Census 2000was also the most expensive census in history, with average costs of $56 per housing unit. In planning for the 2010 Census, the Administrationhopes to continue to improve accuracy, whileavoiding cost growth with early planning andimplementation of the American CommunitySurvey, which will replace the decennial long form.This budget also proposes $177 million for the first of two new buildings for theCensus Bureau in Suitland, Maryland.Census's current facilities are among theworst in the inventory of the GeneralServices Administration and have decayed beyond the point where renovation would be cost-effective. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is responsible for assisting the growthof export businesses, enforcing U.S. tradelaws and agreements, and improving access to overseas markets by identifying and pressing for the removal of trade barriers. The 2003Budget provides increased funding for ITA'strade compliance activities. In addition, ITAwill be undertaking a study of fee options in 2002 to develop an appropriate model for cost recoveryfrom firms that receive trade promotion services. Small Business Exports to Canada and Mexico Have Grown Sharply Rest of the world 76% $80 billion 1992 of Commerce. Small businesses defined as companies with less than 500 employees. All data are in constant 1999 dollars.The budget proposes a small reduction in funding for the Economic DevelopmentAdministration (EDA) to bring resourcesin line with congressionally authorizedlevels and program needs. EDA is supposedto help communities across the nation create economic opportunity by promoting a favorable business environment to attractprivate capital investments and high-wagejobs, principally through infrastructureinvestments and capacity building. Whilethe 2003 Budget streamlines EDA programs, it increases Trade Adjustment Assistance to firms, which provides technical assistanceto U.S. manufacturers injured by increasedimports. EDA is reviewing its performance measures to ensure that it can evaluate its effectiveness in creating sustainable employment indistressed communities.78 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ITA's export-promotion and trade-negotiation activities help U.S. companies take advantageof markets around the world. For example,ITA's export counselors, in offices throughoutthe United States and in Canada and Mexico, provide U.S. businesses with market information and one-on-one counseling on selling in theCanadian and Mexican markets. The TradeInformation Center\u2014 www.trade.gov/td/tic \u2014has extensive information on the North American FreeTrade Agreement (NAFTA), including how to take advantage of NAFTA tariff preferences and meet NAFTA rules of origin. NAFTA, and open trade ingeneral, have had real benefits for the averageU.S. family. NAFTA and the Uruguay Round tradeagreements have resulted in higher incomes andlower prices for goods\u2014benefits estimated to be $1,300 to $2,000 a year for a family of four.The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) works to facilitate accessto resources for the minority businesscommunity in order to help grow minoritybusinesses. MBDA is seeking to transformfrom an administrative agency to an entrepreneurial organization. The budget proposes that MBDA work more closelywith the Small Business Administration( S B A ) ,t ot a k ea d v a n t a g eo fS B A ' sv e r ylarge network of offices (including over1,000 Small Business Development Centers) and extensive programs for minority and disadvantaged firms. This strengthenedcooperation and other MBDA efforts areintended to help the agency meet its missionto deliver high-quality services nationwide.In 2000, MBDA exceeded its target for the dollar value of contracts received by assisted minority businesses, but fell short of itstargets for the number and dollar value ofloans received by assisted businesses. Providing Infrastructure for Technological Innovation The 2003 Budget strengthens key Commerce programs that provide infrastructure to enable U.S. businesses to maintain their technological edge in world markets, while reducing two programs thathave provided subsidies in the past. A new state of matter created by a university/NIST partnership.A NIST researcher, Eric A. Cornell, shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for creating an entirely new state of matter called Bose-Einsteincondensate (BEC). The accompanying picturedepicts the range of speeds and directions of atomsbeing cooled. As the temperature drops, the peakgrows representing all the atoms nearly standing still in space, at a temperature only billionths of a degree above absolute zero. BECs, the coldestsubstance known to man, will lead to a greaterunderstanding of atomic behavior. The discoveryof the BEC established a new branch of atomicphysics. Dr. Cornell is the second NIST Nobel Prize recipient; William Phillips, a NIST Fellow, shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 79 The budget provides increased funding for the laboratories of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which works with industry to develop and promote measurement standardsthat support technological innovation. NIST laboratories specialize in electronics, manufacturing engineering, chemical science, physics, materials science, building and fire research, and information technology. The 2003 Budget provides $50 million to make the Advanced Measurement Laboratory,a new facility designed to meet state-of-the-art research requirements, fully operational. The budgetalso provides $17 million for NIST's Boulder, Colorado facilities. Private Capital and the Advanced Technology Program The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was created in 1988 to bolster high-technology research and development. Since the program's founding, the environment in which ATP operates has changeddramatically. Concerns about the competitiveness of theU.S. economy have diminished, while annual venturecapital investments have skyrocketed from approximately$6 billion in 1995 to $104 bi llion in 2000, according to one estimate. Even with the decline in 2001 activity, the overall growth in venture capital suggests sufficientprivate funding is available for high-technology projects. While ATP has focused on supporting activities of small firms that have more difficulty accessing capital, some ofthe nation's largest corporations have also benefited from the program. For example, ATP innovations reportedly helped large automotive firms realize savings on theorder of a hundred m illion dollars annually. In an effort to minimize unwarranted subsidies, the 2003 Budgetrecommends reducing ATP funding and institutingseveral reforms, including requiring firms to reimburse the government for up to five times its investment in successful projects.Consistent with the Administra- tion's emphasis on shifting resourcesto reflect changing needs, the 2003Budget also proposes to significantlyreduce federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). MEP's original legislativedesign called for a phase-out of federalmonies to each center after six years offunding, with the goal of making eachcenter self-sufficient. The 2003 Budget restores the program's original design; most MEP centers are now far morethan six years old. MEP was designed to provide information and consulting servicesto help businesses adopt more advanced manufacturing technologies and business practices. To theextent that evaluations demonstratethat MEP-assisted firms are moreproductive and competitive, firmsshould be able to pay for the services that help increase their profits. The budget also reduces funding for the Advanced Technology Program(ATP) from $185 million in 2002 to$108 million in 2003. In 2003, newATP awards will be reduced to $35 million. The rationale for ATP , which makes research and development grants to commercial firms, has declined since it was first enacted in part to respond to a belief that U.S. firms were being out-competed by foreign, and especially Japanese, firms. ATPalso will be modified in 2003 to address criticism that the program constitutes an unwarrantedcorporate subsidy. Past GAO reports have criticized ATP, stating that the program was fundingprojects similar to those already underway in the private sector. In addition, ATP monies havegone to some of the nation's largest corporations. The proposed changes will expand university participation, limit large-firm involvement, and include a cost-recoupment mechanism to protect American taxpayers.80 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE The budget strengthens the spectrum management capabilities of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration by providing $3 million to begin the process ofspectrum management reform and to upgrade its radio quiet zone test facility in Colorado. In addition, the Administration will propose legislation to streamline the current process for reimbursing federal agencies that must relocate from spectrum auctioned to commercial users.However, the budget proposes to terminate the Technology Opportunities Program, whichprovides grants for applications of telecommunications technologies. With the expansion of theInternet and related technologies into all sectors of society, federal subsidies are not justified toprove the usefulness of such technologies. The 2003 Budget funds a 21-percent increase (+$239 million) in resources available to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to address the agency's growing workload in the area ofintellectual property. USPTO issues patents and registers trademarks. It also works to promotethe protection of U.S. intellectual property rights around the world through international treaties.With the passage of the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999, USPTO was designated as a\"performance-based-organization,\" which provides the agency additional management flexibilities while ensuring that senior managers' tenure and compensation are at risk based upon their achieving organizational performance targets. 2000 2001 2002 2003050100150200250300350 02004006008001,0001,2001,400 Program Funding ($) Patent Applications Trademark ApplicationsPTO Funding vs. Performance Millions of dollars Thousands of applications processed Source: Department of Commerce.After a few years of relatively flat patent and trademark production, USPTO expectsto meet the following increased performancetargets with its 2003 funding: \u007fComplete (i.e., issue or a 138,600 2002; \u007fReduce total trademark pendency to 13.5 months, a 13-percent improvement. Observing and Managing the Nation's Oceanic and Atmospheric Environment The budget provides an additional $93 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to improve forecasts of severe storms and the satellite infrastructureneeded to support weather and climate prediction and research. Funding is also provided to improve fisheries management. However, many earmarks and funds that do not support NOAA's core stewardship missions have been redirected. In addition, funding will support critical infrastructureand homeland security activities within NOAA. The accuracy of NOAA's National Hurricane Center hurricane \"track\" forecasts has improved by about 50 percent over the past 30 years. Errors for three-day track forecasts decreased on averagefrom over 400 nautical miles in 1970 to about 200 miles today. In 2003, resources will be directed to advanced observational systems and modeling to further improve hurricane intensity and trackTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 81 forecasts. NOAA expects these advances to provide more timely evacuations and to increase the lead time for hurricane warnings from 24 hours in 2002 to 28 hours in 2005. Similarly, following modernization investments, tornado warning lead times have almost doubled\u2014from six minutes in 1993 to more than 10 minutes today. The National Weather Service aims to further increase lead times to 15 minutes by 2005. Hurricane Michelle skirting the southern coast of Florida.The National Hurricane Center achieved its most recent critical success when it correctly forecast the bruntof dangerous Hurricane Michelle would just miss theFlorida peninsula. Accurate forecasts of hurricanetracks translate to smaller areas required to prepare for evacuation, saving approximately $1 million per mile for coastal residents, businesses, and local governments. As part of the Administration's energy policy initiative for 2003, NOAA will implement a $6 million pilot program in the southeastern United States. NOAA will provide more accurate temperature andprecipitation forecasts and additional river forecast products to help the energy industry improve electrical load forecasting and hydropower facility management. Based on industry estimates, this investment will result in savings of $10 million to $30 million annually in the pilot region after thesecond year of the demonstration. Expanding the pilot nationwide could generate savings of over $1billion per year. NOAA has a lead role in climate measurement and prediction, and has conducted substantial work in climate change and atmospheric modeling. In 2003, the Administration will institute a newClimate Change Research Initiative, a multi-agency effort with a strong focus on outcomes addressingmajor gaps in our scientific understanding identified in the June 2001 National Academy of Sciences report, \"Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions.\" NOAA will receive an $18 million increase to advance climate-modeling capabilities, to develop a climate observing system, andto improve understanding of aerosols, land and oceanic carbon sinks, and regional impacts of climatechange.

The Sea Grant program would be administered as a NOAA/NSF partnership. The transfer is part of a wider Administration effort to promote competitive funding of scientific research, and to capitalize on the demonstrated excellence of the NSF and its programmanagement. NOAA's participation as a partner in this program will ensure that researchobjectives continue to reflect the agency's marine resource management priorities.82 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Status of 287 Major Fisheries Stocks in 2000 Insufficient Data 42% Sustainable 38%Over fished 20% Source: Department of Commerce.The Department's Inspector General and GAO have identified NOAA's NationalMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as an area of management concern. While NMFS has had significant budget increases over thepast few years\u2014increasing by almost 40percent since 2000, and over 100 percent since1995\u2014fisheries' management and stock levelshave not seen corresponding improvements. Currently, about 20 percent of major fisheries stocks are over fished, and stock levels areunknown for another 42 percent. While over 80percent of the over-fished stocks are currentlyunder rebuilding plans, the challenges aresignificant as rebuilding long-lived stocks can take decades. Over the last few years, fisheries collapses have occurred in the western Alaska salmon fishery, the West Coast groundfishfishery, and the Gulf of Maine groundfish fishery. Such problems have led to increases in paymentsfor fisheries disasters, fishing moratoria, and lawsuits by both environmentalists and industry. The 2003 Budget addresses two causes of this problem. First, the budget redirects over $160 million in congressional earmarks and unrequested funding, much of which undercuts NOAA's mission. Funds are also provided for a new fishery research vessel that will be used to upgrade fishery assessments\u2014an area identified by GAO, the National Academy of Sciences, and others asneeding enhancement. Second, the budget proposes that the reauthorization of Magnuson-StevensFisheries Conservation and Management Act include authority to establish transferable fishingquota systems, under appropriate conditions, within the regional fisheries. Money alone will notsolve the management problems in U.S. fisheries. Providing market-based incentives to fishers, redirecting funds to meet the highest priority fishery management needs, and enhancing science and stock assessments tied to management decisions will. With the management changes and funding proposed in the President's Budget, NOAA expects to be able to reduce the number of over-fished major fisheries by one in 2003 and by 10 in 2007. A greaterimpact will occur in the number of sustainable fisheries, as stock levels improve and unknown stocksare evaluated. Known sustainable stocks should increase by seven percentage points (19 additional fishery stocks) in 2003. Strengthening Management Commerce's leadership is making progress on management challenges. In particular, the status of competitive sourcing and financial management is expected to improve over the next two years asthe Department's plans in these areas are implemented.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 83 Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014Excess organizational layers remain in several bureaus, and existing personnel flexib ilities are not being fully utilized. Also, bureaus need to redirect staff from supervisory and overhead positions to line functions. NOAA will establish a taskforce to review its central-office administrative activities so that there is no unwarranted duplication of activities, such as budgeting at line-office, bureau, and departmental levels. EDA also plans to engage in workforce restructuring. The InternationalTrade Administration has taken useful steps to streamline its organization and officestructure, and reduce excessive supervisory positions in 2001. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014Commerce has not yet completed significant public-private or direct conversion competitions for positions listed as performing commercialactivities, such as data entry clerks, personnel office workers, information technology specialists, and publications clerks. The Department has developed a strong, approved competition plan to complete public-private or direct conversion competitions for fivepercent of its commercial inventory in 2002 and an additional 10 percent in 2003,which when implemented will meet the Administration's two-year 15-percent goal. \u007f Improved Financial Management \u2014Commerce currently fails to fully meet federal financial management systems requirements. However, the Department's integrated system is expected to be completely deployed by October 2003. Commerce has had unqualified audit opinions for two years straight, a major improvement over the past. \u007f E-Government \u2014Commerce submitted sound justifications and plans for nearly all major systems. Commerce bureaus are using the Internet to serve businessesinterested in international trade and minority contracting opportunities. Census usesE-Government for its economic surveys of firms, and will use it more for the 2010Census.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014Commerce performance measures in several areas are under review to ensure they reflect plans and resource allocations. Budgetjustifications are being strengthened to focus on programmatic outcomes. TheDepartment's Chief Financial Officer is working to ensure maximum integration ofstrategic planning and budget formulation work at both the departmental and bureaulevels.\u007f84 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Department of Commerce (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Departmental Management: Salaries and Expenses ............................................................................. 41 40 50 Emergency guaranteed loan program accounts ................................... 115 5 97 Office of the Inspector General ............................................................... 21 21 24 Subtotal, Departmental Management ......................................................... 53 56 23 Economic Development Administration ...................................................... 451 368 350 Bureau of the Census .................................................................................... 458 514 737 Economic and Statistics Administration ...................................................... 57 66 76 International Trade Administration ............................................................... 352 355 377 Bureau of Export Administration .................................................................. 68 72 103 Minority Business Development Agency .................................................... 28 29 30 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): Operations, Research and Facilities (non-add) ..................................... 46 220 162 Office of Technology Policy ........................................................................... 888 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): Scientific and Technical Research and Services .................................. 323 332 402 Industrial Technology Services ................................................................ 252 293 121 Construction of Research Facilities ........................................................ 35 62 54 Subtotal, NIST ................................................................................................ 610 687 577 National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA): Salaries and Expenses ............................................................................. 13 15 18 Grant programs .......................................................................................... 90 59 44 Subtotal, NTIA ................................................................................................ 103 Discretionary 5,224 5,330 5,335 Remove contingent adjustments .................................................................. 122 Total, Discretionary budget authority ............................................................... 5,102 5,206 5,192 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources 9\u2014 Total, Mandatory outlays .................................................................................... 69 115 50THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 85 Department of Commerce\u2014Continued (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Credit activity: Direct Loan Disbursements: Fisheries finance direct loan financing account ......................................... 24 24 74 Total, Direct loan disbursements ...................................................................... 24 24 74 Guaranteed Loans: Emergency oil and gas guaranteed loan financing account .................... 32 \u2014 Emergency steel guaranteed loan financing account ............................... 110 236 \u2014 Total, Guaranteed loans ..................................................................................... 113 238 \u2014 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Department of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary www.defenselink.mil 703-697-5737 Number of Employees : 2.3 million Military (Active, Reserve, and Guard) and 667,750Civilian 2002 Spending : $330.6 billion Organization : Four Armed Services (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force); 15 DefenseAgencies; nine Unified Combatant Commands;and over 30 million acres of bases/facilitiesworldwide.The primary mission of the Department of Defense (DoD) is to defend the United States of America and advance its interestsaround the globe. In peacetime, DoD trainsand equips military forces needed to deteraggression while protecting U.S. interestsand promoting U.S. security objectives. Now that we are at war, DoD's goal is to defeat the terrorists and their supporters who threatenour freedom. DoD is the largest federal agencyand the largest corporate entity of its type inthe world. 8788 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Overview New Challenges in the National Security Environment A Tomahawk Cruise missile is launched from as h i p .Shortly after his inauguration, President Bush called for a review of all U.S. military capabilities setting thegoal of how best to achieve the necessary transformationto meet the new challenges of the 21 stCentury. Over the past year, the Secretary of Defense has led efforts to transform the way U.S. military forces defend the country while also addressing long-standing management problemsat DoD. The terrorist attacks on the United States onSeptember 11, 2001, underscored the urgency of SecretaryRumsfeld's effort. The new security environment requires amilitary force that is balanced to counter both conventional and unconventional threats and is armed with strong intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities. Even so,intelligence gaps will persist, so innovation must be factoredinto our defense planning and response. The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan and before September 11th. What's different today is our sense of urgency\u2014the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It's like overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour. Yet, we have no other choice. President George W. Bush December 11, 2001 The future, both near- and long-term, presents numerous challenges and great opportunity. When President Bush took office, he inherited a defense program that needed to be strengthened.As a percentage of the nation's gross domestic product, defense expenditures had shrunk to 2.8 percent. Inadequate funding strained both equipment and people. Recognizing these deficiencies, President Bush provided significant increased resources for defense in 2002. Much remains to bedone. In a post-Cold War world, where freedom and democracy remain imperiled, this budget laysthe groundwork for a sustained, long-term investment in the nation's security. The United Statesmust strengthen its defense posture to protect the nation's interests and to assure its lead role inglobal affairs. A war on terrorism has begun, and while there has been success in achieving specific military objectives, the shape and dimension of the subsequent phases of the campaign will remain a work in progress for some time to come.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 89 The President's 2003 Budget for DoD and the intelligence community reflects the Administration's strong commitment to winning the war on terrorism, sustaining current militaryreadiness, transforming the way the nation defends itself, and enhancing American intelligence capabilities. To address these needs the President's Budget proposes $369 billion in 2003 for DoD and an additional $10 billion, if needed, to fight the war on terrorism. Defense Against Ballistic Missiles Successful flight tests over the past year represent a step forward on the road to deployingeffective defenses to protect the Americanpeople, its friends, allies, and troops abroad.DoD plans to pursue more aggressive exploration and realistic testing of key technologies to counter ballistic missiles in all phases of theirflight. The missile defense program is designedso that needed capabilities can be deployed astechnologies are proven ready.Winning the War at Home\u2014Homeland Security. The growing importance of homeland security raises a host of challengesin the post-September 11 thenvironment. These issues include policy and resourceallocation decisions to improve homeland security. More than ever, coordination among defense and non-defense agencieswill be critical to success. DoD playsan important role in homeland security,providing assistance to law enforcement atthe state and federal level when authorized by law, enhancing airport and border security, sharing intelligence information,and marshaling resources to respond to new attacks. Hand-in-glove with the domestic war on terrorism, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve,and active Air Force aircraft serving in Operation Noble Eagle began providing combat air patrolsover major U.S. cities starting on September 11 th. Shortly thereafter, the National Guard helped provide security at the nation's airports. Similarly, Navy Reserve and Coast Guard units are helping to protect our waterways and harbors, and Army National Guard troops will provide assistance toCustoms Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel on our northern border. Waging the War on Terrorism\u2014Winning the War Abroad. The U.S. military responded rapidly to the terrorist attacks, initiating major combat operations 7,000 miles from the UnitedStates in less than one month. By November 2001, the Air Force and Navy had flown 40,000 hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Navy has had as many as four aircraft carrier battle groups in the region supporting flight operations and special operations forces. Almost 400 fighter,tanker, and airlift aircraft and more than 50,000 troops have recently been engaged in this mission. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The accompanying table shows some selected DoD programs and their effectiveness. 90 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Program Assessment Explanation Military Readiness Effective The speed of American deployment in the war on terrorism has demonstrated improved readiness. The budget sustains this gain and builds on it by funding improvements in training facilities. Military CompensationEffective Recent increases in pay have helped improve the recruitment andretention of top-caliber men and women for our military. Family Housing Army/Navy: Effective Air Force: IneffectiveD o Dh a ss t a r t e dt or e l yo np r i v a t es e c t o re x p e r t i s et oi m p r o v et h equality of housing for military families a Presidential initiative. Also, the Secretary of Defense has established a goal to eliminate DoD'sinventory of 159,000 inadequate housing units for military families by 2007. The Army and Navy plan to achieve the 2007 goal; the Air Force will not achieve the goal until 2010. Cooperative ThreatReduction Moderately EffectiveSince it began in 1993, the Cooperative Threat Reduction program has funded the deactivation of 5,336 nuclear warheads, the destructionof 422 intercontinental ballistic missiles in the former Soviet Union,and helped secure vast quantities of material that could be used in aweapon of mass destruction. Taking such steps dramatically reduces the likelihood of terrorists obtaining the means to do harm to the United States and its allies. However, the program has been slow tospend funds provided in prior years. Science andTechnology (S&T) Moderately effectiveDoD is working aggressively to develop more effective technologies. Projects mostly performed by the private sector or academiaare generally handled well. However, each m ilitary service and defense agency generally determines its own S&T plan with little Department-wide coordination. To reduce potential duplication ofefforts, the Under Secretary for Acquisition Technology and Logisticsshould develop a better integrated and coordinated funding plan forthese efforts. Infrastructure Ineffective The Department maintains a large inventory of old buildings thatneed to be replaced. Right now, DoD is on a path to replace old buildings approximately once every 120 years. DoD had planned to accelerate the pace at which it replaced facilities, but allocated fundsto other, more pressing needs. Another round of base realignmentand closure, approved by Congress for 2005, is essential to achievingfaster replacement and improvement of unsatisfactory DoD facilities.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 91 Program Assessment Explanation Weapons Systems Cost ControlIneffective While DoD develops and builds the most capable weapons systemsin the world, these programs continue to exceed cost and schedule targets. Between 2000 and 2003, cost growth for major weapons rose by an estimated 15 percent on average. Part of that increase isdue to more realistic cost estimating. DoD has begun to establishinitiatives to enhance its ab ility to monitor and to control cost growth and schedule delays. ChemicalDemilitarization Ineffective The Army's program to destroy the U.S. stockpile of chemical weaponsis behind schedule. Costs have increased over 60 percent, from $15 billion to $24 billion. These delays are the result of various difficulties, including unrealistic schedules, site safety and environmentalconcerns, and poor planning. DoD-VACoordination Ineffective The Departments have historically lacked genuine commitment tocoordinate systems. Many areas for integration exist. For example,VA and DoD could better serve mutual constituents by developing an integrated enrollment system. There has, however, been progress in some areas. VA and DoD have begun discussions on how to bettercoordinate and share patient medical information. For significantand rapid progress to be made in this area, both VA and DoD mustfocus their efforts on developing common business processes that aresupported by fully integrated information technology standards and architecture. Congressional Earmarks Congressional earmarks add funding for programs that are not requested by the Defense Department, diverting funds from higher priority and more effective programs. The 2002 Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Acts earmarked funds for 963 DoD projects totaling$5.4 billion. The DoD budget process thoroughly reviews all programs to determine the optimalcost-effective mix of programs for national defense. Earmarking disrupts this balance of programsand crowds out other important projects. For example, the Congress has added funds for aircraft the Air Force does not require and thereby limits resources for war fighting needs. In addition, funding has been directed for military construction projects that the services do not want to build. Some earmarks have little relationshipto an agency's mission. For example, the 2002 Defense Appropriations Act included over $600million for a variety of unrequested medical research projects. These projects include research onbreast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, and osteoporosis. While research on thesediseases is very important, it is neither the mission nor the core competency of the U.S. military. Rather, these functions can be carried out and coordinated more effectively by other medical research agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health.92 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Intelligence The intelligence community is adapting to the changed environment of the 21st Century. Advances in encryption, denial and deception techniques, and information technology create enormous challenges for intelligence gathering and analysis. Policymakers need timely, accurate and insightful information on the capabilities and intentions of foreign powers. The armed forcesalso need real-time battlefield data furnished with a significant level of detail. The intelligencecommunity meets the full range of U.S. intelligence needs from the national level to the tacticallevel. The 2003 Budget strongly supports these efforts and makes a substantially increased investment in our intelligence capabilities. This budget also makes major investments to transform the intelligence community to meet the challenges of the 21 stCentury. Transforming Our Armed Forces This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle. Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach. These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict. The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor ...This combination\u2014real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power\u2014has really never been used before. The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tank symposiums. President George W. Bush December 11, 2001 One of the President's key defense priorities is to transform America's armed forces to perform their missions more effectively and to meet emerging security challenges. The Defense Departmentbegan the process of transformation with its 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review. The review shiftedto a \"capabilities-based\" defense strategy that focuses on capabilities of potential adversaries and the tools that America's armed forces will need to deter and defeat adversaries employing those capabilities. Both the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent conduct ofOperation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan underscore the urgency of military transformation.They illustrate the need for America's military to prepare for different types of conflict and executemissions with new tactics and new technologies. The growing use of unmanned aerial vehicles, theeffective utilization of real-time intelligence, and the coordination among special operations and allied forces all demonstrate the cutting edge of what military transformation can achieve and offer a glimpse of a future transformed joint force. To shape this effort, DoD has recently established anOffice of Force Transformation to coordinate all of the military service transformation efforts andadvise the Secretary of Defense.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 93 A Predator unmanned aerial vehicle in flight and an aircraft carrier at sea.In 2003, the Department will invest over $9 billion in science and technology.New efforts include: easy-to-wear chemical/biological protection masks, chemical, biological, and nuclear weaponsdetectors, bunker and cave-defeating weapons,intelligence systems to detect assembly ofweapons of mass destruction, and unmannedair, land, and sea surveillance and combat vehicles. In addition, DoD will invest $7.8 billion in ballistic missile defense with theobjective of developing the capability to defendthe forces and territories of the United States,its allies, and friends against ballistic missilethreats. Besides continuing the development of highly capable fighter aircraft such as the Joint Strike Fighter and new ships, the Defense Department's 2003 budget invests in technologies that willtransform the military and fundamentally change the American way of warfare. These systemsinclude: \u007ffour Trident ballistic missile submarines converted to submarines equipped with long-rangecruise missiles which will dramatically increase the range and precision of strikes and our capability to insert Special Forces; \u007funmanned aerial vehicles such as those used in the war against terrorism, which provide greater, longer-endurance intelligence and combat capabilities directly to the war-fighter at far less cost and risk to military personnel than manned aircraft; \u007funmanned underwater vehicles that can greatly extend the range and capabilities of submarines and surface ships at less cost and without risk to sailors; \u007fthe Army's Land Warrior technology, which digitizes the communications and intelligencecapabilities of the individual infantry soldier to enhance situational awareness and combatcapability; \u007fsmall precision bombs, which increase the quantity of targets that each individual aircraft canstrike; \u007fbunker-defeating munitions to target the growing threats of deeply hidden weapons of massdestruction; and \u007fspace-based radar and space control systems, which enhance our surveillance capabilities andour capabilities to collect and utilize information from space. Other emerging areas of defense investment focus on America's ability to conduct information and space operations.94 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Eliminating Poor Performers: Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense Delays in the development schedule and large projected cost increases caused DoD to cancel a multi-billion dollar Navy missile defense program. The program, known as Navy Area T heater Ballistic Missile Defense, was designed to give Navy cruisers and destroyers the ability to s hoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. DoD previously tho ught that the Navy's system would cost about $6.2 billion to develop and deploy. However, in December 2001, DoD announced that \"unit costs\" would grow by more than 50 percent. The Administration still plans to pursuesea-based terminal missile defenses, but this Navy program was too costly to continue. Assuring the Readiness of Our Armed Forces U.S. Marines on a CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter on their way to Afghanistan.The cuts to procurement spending and investment in the immediate years followingthe end of the Cold War, combined with anincrease in overseas contingency operations,put a strain on both equipment and people. Frequent deployments meant strains on military readiness because of missed trainingand strains on families because of morefrequent separations from loved ones. ThePresident has pledged to solve this problem. Despite these strains, the U.S. armed forces remain the most capable in the world and have demonstrated their readiness with theirrapid response to the events of last September.Soldiers, sailors, air force crews, and marineshave routed enemy forces in Afghanistan,while also keeping the peace in the Balkans, patrolling the no-fly zones of Iraq and maintaining a strong forward presence around the globe. Readiness relies upon three main factors. First, we must recruit and retain personnel with key skills and talents. Second, we must provide high quality training to give troops the expertise andskill to fight and win our nation's wars. Third, we must maintain equipment and facilities that ourforces use to accomplish their missions. These three factors are a high priority in this budget. \u007fFirst, a 4.1 percent across-the-board pay increase supports the Services' recruiting and retention goals. \u007fSecond, the adage \"you fight the way you train\" remains true. This budget robustly funds the Services' training goals, as measured in aircraft flying hours, ship steaming days, and ground vehicle miles. Without these crucial training and operating activities, the safety andwell being of our troops and their ability to accomplish their missions successfully will be atrisk.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 95 \u007fThird, this budget adds significant resources for maintaining military equipment and the facilities where our troops work and train. DoD can not afford any further growth inmaintenance backlogs. With scarce resources, the Department has been forced to delay needed maintenance. If equipment and real property maintenance needs are not met, training opportunities and readiness erode, and costs rise. President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld look over the scene of destruction at the Pentagon on September 12, 2001.As the attacks have demonstrated, U.S. military facilities are terrorist targets.The budget will enhance force protection for our armed forces and the facilities where they work and live. It also ensuresthat transportation, communications, andinformation systems are strong enough tocope with terrorist attacks when they occur.Just as important, these activities protect and support our troops' families. Enhancing the Quality of Life of Military Personnel and Their Families A Service Member from McGuire Air Force Base embraces a loved one.Military quality of life is crucial to retaining service members and their families. Themilitary services have long recognized that while they recruit the service member, they must retain the family. No matter howadvanced the technology or what strategyis developed, having imaginative, highlyskilled, and motivated military and civilianpersonnel is essential for America to address the challenges of the future. To recruit and retain these people, the Department hasincreased funding and will work to enhancea number of quality-of-life efforts, includingcompensation, housing, and health care,among other community and family work-life support programs.96 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Military Compensation In 2002, the President proposed and Congress authorized the largest military pay raise in two decades. That raise included both an across-the-board 4.6 percent increase in basic pay and the President's $1 billion initiative which proposed targeted raises based on rank and length of service to help retain skilled, experienced personnel. Other benefits have recently been offered to our troopsand their families. The President signed an executive order authorizing hazardous duty pay and taxexemptions for troops conducting operations in the Afghanistan theater. The President proposed,and Congress authorized, significant increases in reimbursement for permanent change-of-stationcosts, again putting more money into the pockets of service members. Pay and benefit levels have never been higher, with average enlisted compensation nearing $36,500 per year. Army captains with 10 years of experience will see their basic pay increase almost $3,000 a year to $50,788, andtheir overall compensation reach the mid-$70,000 range. Building on this record, the 2003 Budget contains another pay boost of 4.1 percent with the option of selected targeting of larger raises to mid-grade non-commissioned officers and officers.This continues the President's commitment to take care of our men and women in uniform and their families and ensures that pay continues to be competitive. This commitment is working: DoD is meeting its goals for recruiting talented young people and retaining experienced, highly-trainedmilitary personnel. Housing A privatized duplex housing two military families.About 20 percent of all service members have inadequate housing on military bases.The definition of inadequate housing is uniqueto each Service. While some houses are oldand in need of improvement, other housesa r es i m p l yi n a d e q u a t et om e e tt h en e e d so f today's military family, which has changed since on-base housing was first constructeddecades ago. The Administration is committedto eliminating 159,000 inadequate housingunits (out of a total of 275,000) by 2007. DoD is tackling the problem of inadequate housing by demolishing dilapidated units, renovating existing houses, and building newhomes. Increasingly, DoD relies on the privatesector, which has expertise to manage real property and can increase the quality of DoD-ownedhousing at less cost and faster than the government. In 1996, the Congress gave DoD authority toprivatize DoD-owned housing. Since 1996, DoD has privatized 16,817 units, or about six percent of the current inventory. While privatization began slowly, DoD is accelerating its efforts. Two public-private partnership launched in 2001: \u007fThe Army, in partnership with private developers, initiated a $260 million family housingprivatization project at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, the largest Army base in the country.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 97 This project will construct 973 new housing units and renovate 4,939 housing units. Over 4,000 units eventually will be replaced. \u007fThe Navy, in partnership with the private real estate companies and developers, initiated a$262 million family housing privatization project at the Naval Complex San Diego, California.This partnership will construct 519 units and operate a total of 3,248 housing units. By the end of 2002, DoD plans to privatize an additional 12,970 units. In 2003, DoD plans to privatize 35,600 more housing units to eliminate inadequate housing by 2007. Currently, the Navy and the Army are on track to eliminate inadequate housing by 2007. The Air Force does not plan toeliminate its inventory of inadequate housing until 2010. The Administration plans to reduce the average out-of-pocket expense of military families living in private housing in local communities to zero by 2005. In 2003, out-of-pocket expenses will dropto 7.5 percent from 15.0 percent in 2001. This will enable more military families to afford quality private-sector housing located in the local communities around DoD's installations. This initiative improves the quality of life for our military families, and makes a contribution to the local economiesand real estate markets. Strengthening Management The President and Secretary of Defense have made management improvement at DoD a key goal. DoD will transform its business processes and infrastructure to enhance capabilities and creativity of its employees and free up resources to support war fighting and transformation ofmilitary capabilities. Controlling Costs of Constructing Navy Ships The costs associated with constructing new Navy ships have increased dramatically over thepast few years. More funding will be required tocomplete construction of several types of ships. One ship in particular, the LPD-17 amphibious ship has experienced excessive cost increases.In 2001, DoD estimated that to build 12 ships itwould need a total of $10.6 b illion. Now DoD believes it will require $15.1 billion to build thesesame 12 ships, a 42 percent increase. DoD has begun a number of initiatives to enhance its ability to monitor and take action on cost growthand schedule delays in the ship constructionprogram.To support 2.3 million men and women in uniform effectively, the Department'sefficiency must improve. DoD's businesspractices and financial infrastructure must beoverhauled; they are outdated and have notkept pace with today's business environment. The Department is working to streamline its organization and infrastructure, adoptingnew business models to react to rapidchanges in technology, and implementingfinancial management strategies to repair theoutmoded and poorly connected accounting and auditing processes. DoD has over 600 different management systems that providefinancial information, few of which are trulycompatible. One significant management challenge is the Defense Health Program (DHP). DoD supports an internal health care network, as well as private contractors who provide health care. The core mission of DHP is to provide healthsupport for the full range of military deployments and to sustain the health of military personnel,retirees, and their families. DoD is effective at maintaining a health care system supportive of98 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE day-to-day operations, stays ready to perform its wartime mission, and provides its beneficiaries with the highest quality health care available. The cost of DoD health care contracts, however, has increased over the past three years to its current level of almost 50 percent of the health budget. Despite various risk-sharing provisions in the current versions of the contracts, there is still a need for greater incentives in the internal systemand the private contracts to control escalating costs. High contract costs are caused by a combinationof factors including the national health care market, enhancements to the benefit package offered tobeneficiaries, effects of downsizing and closures of military health care facilities, the Department'sinability to manage where patients are treated, and ineffective cost incentives. Additionally, DoD has historically underestimated the funding needs of its own medical care system, which has forced beneficiaries into the private sector at a higher cost to the Department. All of these factors resultedin the government paying an additional $655 million in cost overruns to DoD health care contractorsin 2001, and DoD receiving over $1.3 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations in both 2000and 2001. DoD has made progress in better projecting its funding needs for health care contracts and military pharmaceuticals. More work, however, is necessary to strengthen its projections for health care growth in the future. The Department is committed to redesigning health care contracts andadministrative policies to create incentives that preserve the ability of DoD to meet its mission andcontrol costs effectively. The table that follows illustrates how the entire Department fares on the President's Management Agenda. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014DoD has completed its civilian personnel workforce analysis that identifies: \u007fcurrent skill imbalances; and \u007fpotential personnel shortfalls due to the large increase in retirement-eligible employees starting in 2003. DoD identified difficulties with staffing critical technical personnel such as scientists, engineers, acquisition specialists, and medical personnel\u2014occupations that are critical now and in thefuture. These difficulties are expected to worsen because of the spike in the retirement-eligiblepopulation. DoD wants its future workforce to have better problem-solving skills and have moreadvanced technical knowledge and skills. DoD needs to develop a workforce-restructuring plan that fully addresses these challenges.\u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 99 Initiative 2001 Status Competitive Sourcing \u2014DoD's inventory of commercial activities represents more than half of the government-wide potential. DoD's competitive-sourcing program has been historically active compared to other federal agencies, but has declined in recent years. Since the President's Management Agenda ultimately calls for competing 50 percent of theinventory, DoD's role in this initiative is important to its overall success. DoD could competesuch commercial services as laundry, food, grounds-keeping, transportation, and libraries.Dedicating soldiers to these activities detracts from DoD's war fighting competency. At this time, the Services and Defense Agencies are projecting actual competitions below levels projected for 2001. DoD needs to compete 15 percent of its commercial inventory in 2003, as required by the President's Management Agenda. DoD should work to improve thecurrent rate of competitions to meet the President's goal. \u007f Financial Management \u2014With over 600 systems providing financial data, DoD has several serious failings in financial management: \u007fit is not substantially compliant with federal financial management standards; \u007fit cannot provide a clean assurance statement about its internal controls; and \u007fit has consistently received a disclaimer by its auditors on its financial statements. The DoD Inspector General and the GAO have issued a series of reports critical of DoD's financial management. For example, a recent GAO report criticized DoD's excessive use offunds in \"canceled accounts\" to pay contractor b ills. Until adequate progress is made at DoD, the financial statements of the entire government will not receive an opinion from GAO. DoD has launched a major initiative to improve business and financial processes and systems. The Department is working closely with OMB to develop an enterprise architecture andsystems that will support efficient operations, and provide accurate, timely, and useful financialinformation. This will take a number of years, but the Department has documented a clearcommitment to improvement and is moving forward.\u007f100 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014For its information technology programs, DoD fails to comply fully with the Clinger-Cohen Act, the key statute that establishes standards for federal information systems. \u007fClinger-Cohen Act\u2014Enterprise Architecture: DoD must strengthen its capital planning and investment control processes and integrate it with the Program Planningand Budget System ( PPBS). The current DoD Enterprise Architecture (EA), the Global Information Grid (GIG), is an important first step to building a comprehensiveEA and data layers. There is no clear link between information technology (IT) andperformance of core mission. \u007fClinger-Cohen Act\u2014Reporting Requirements: Clinger-Cohen and DoD regulations require DoD to justify major IT investments. DoD has begun to implement thisrequirement and complete the necessary analysis. However, DoD has failed to submitbusiness cases for a number of its major IT investments. In addition, many of the casesthat were submitted require improvement to meet Clinger-Cohen standards.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014DoD has two major systems for budget and performance that will provide Spring 2002 reports: \u007fProgram, Planning and Budget System ( PPBS) \u007fGovernment Performance Results Act (GPRA). However, these systems are not linked in any meaningful way. DoD does not completely factor in performance information when making budget decisions and is unable to correlate its budget request with GPRA goals and performance plans. DoD has taken some initial steps toward integration. The 2003 Budget includes additional performance information linked to budgetary resources. DoD is also implementing theAdministration's plan to accrue the cost of health benefits for retirees and dependents over65. Finally, DoD is working on a plan to implement the Administration's proposed budget integration legislation.\u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 101 Department of Defense (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary budget authority: Military Personnel authority Fund, Budgetary 10,000 Mandatory Outlays: Military Personnel 2 Operation and Maintenance/Health ....................................... \u2014\u2014 1,099 Revolving, Trust and Other DoD 581 328 565 Offsetting Receipts ................................................................... outlays .............................................................. 788 1,218 1,385 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Department of Education Rod Paige, Secretary www.ed.gov 800-USA-LEARN Number of Employees :4 , 7 1 0 2002 Spending : $47.6 billion Field Offices : 10 regional and 11 field offices.The Department of Education seeks to ensure equal access to education andpromote educational excellence for allstudents throughout the nation. It promotes educational excellence and access in elementary and secondary education byproviding formula and competitive grantsto states and local educational agencies inareas of national priority. Through its studentfinancial assistance and higher education programs, the Department helps ensure that postsecondary education is affordable and attainable for all students. The Department of Education conducts research and disseminates 103104 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION information on the best educational practices, and produces statistics on the condition of education in the United States. Status Report on Select Programs President Bush and I are especially concerned about the persistent gaps in achievement between poor and minority students and their more advantaged peers. ...Simply spending more money in the same way is not the answer. We need to do things differently, to adopt a culture of achievement in our schools and school systems, and to demand results for our growing investment in education. Secretary Paige April 2001 Education funding has skyrocketed over the last decade. Since 1997, appropriations for Department of Education programs have increased an average of 13 percent per year, despite analmost total absence of evidence that the programs were effective. The Department has almostno programs with evaluations reflecting overall positive performance, and very few of its nearly 200 separate grant programs have objective data to gauge their effectiveness. In most cases, the approach to funding education has been funding for its own sake, rather than funding based onresults benefiting students. The President and Secretary Paige are committed to stopping the cycleof funding decisions based on wishes rather than on performance information, and to ensuring thattaxpayer dollars are directed to the activities known to be effective in improving student outcomes. Program performance was a key consideration in developing this year's Department of Education budget. The budget redirects resources away from education programs that evaluations have found to be ineffective. The President proposes to terminate 35 programs entirely, thus freeing up nearly $1billion for high-priority activities more likely to yield positive and measurable results. Major reformsare underway for two other activities that have historically fallen short in meeting their objectives:Title I and Education Research. Increases are proposed for these high-priority activities becausereforms in these areas show promise for a positive impact in education. Increases also are sought for programs that have been effective and support high priorities: Vocational R ehabilitation, Special Education Grants to States, Pell Grants, and Statistics. The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lower-performing programs tohigher-performing or more-effective programs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 105 Program Assessment Explanation Statistics and AssessmentEffective National Center for Education Statistics releases numerous paper,electronic, and web-based statistical products that have a reputation for high quality. TRIO Student Support ServicesEffective Evaluation of the Student Support Services program showed thatit had a large impact on four-year college graduation rates and asmall but significant impact on students' grades, credits earned, andretention in higher education. Title I Grants to LocalEducation Agencies Ineffective Despite an investment of billions of dollars, reading scores amongdisadvantaged students on national tests have remained stagnant. Dramatic changes enacted this year focus on accountability and parental choice reforms designed to significantly improve programperformance. TRIO Upward Bound Ineffective Evaluation of Upward Bound found that the program had no overallimpact on participants' grades, credits earned, high school graduationrates, or college enrollment rates. Safe and Drug-Free Schools\u2014State GrantsIneffective The program cannot be associated with a demonstrable change in the incidence of youth violence or drug-abuse. A recent RAND study questioned the program's effectiveness and stressed that its futurehinges on the ability to demonstrate results. Even Start Ineffective National and local evaluations have shown no conclusive evidencethat this program is improving outcomes for children or adults. Research andDissemination Ineffective Past investments have not yielded consistent research quality;however, the Administration plans significant structural and grantmaking reforms. GEAR UP Unknown Though this program's evaluation is not complete, the program was modeled on local projects that have been successful in increasingacademic achievement and college-going rates among participatingstudents.106 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Elementary and Secondary Education 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 20020100200300400500 200220240260 211 212 211 209 211 212 212 Source: Department of Education.NAEP reading scores Advanced 268 Proficient 238 Basic 208Total expenditures Reading scoresIn billions of dollarsEducation Spending Soars While Reading Scores Stay StaticWhen the President introduced his reforms for elementary and secondary education last February, he pledged to leave no child behind. Far too many of our students are being leftbehind; national reading tests show nearly70 percent of inner-city fourth graders cannotread at a basic level. The accompanying chartshows that dramatic increases in education spending in recent years have not improved students' reading ability. At the federallevel, Congress has, over the years, createdhundreds of programs supporting educationwithout asking whether the programs produceresults or knowing their impact on local needs. Having spent hundreds of billions over the past two decades, the nation has fallen shortin meeting our goal of educational excellence. Do accountability reforms work? The facts speak for themselves. Texas and North Carolinapioneered a number of education accountabilityreforms and, as a result, posted significant andsustained achievement gains. A 1999 report showed that these gains were NOT due to increased per pupil funding, reductions in classsizes, or having more teachers with advanceddegrees or more years of experience. Instead,their key reform policies read like a blueprintfor the revised ESEA: annual assessments in grades three through eight, rewards for success and sanctions for failure, flexibility toallocate resources to best meet local needs,and computerized systems for gathering andanalyzing student achievement data. The result? These two states made greater gains in reading and math on national tests between 1992 and 1996 than any other states.Clearly change is needed. Early last year, the President proposed an ambitious reformagenda supporting accountability for results,enhanced parental choice, and increasedlocal flexibility. Based on the President'sproposal, Congress recently passed and the President signed revisions to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), theNo Child Left Behind Act. First passed in1965, ESEA spells out the federal role inK-12 education. It has traditionally directedadditional resources to needy communities and supported some innovations. It will now help ensure that disadvantaged childrenreceive the same educational opportunities asall children. While most of the President's objectives were met in the new Act, some were not. Congress has continued about two dozen programs that the Administration sought toeliminate because they were narrowly focusedor ineffective, and added a half dozen moreprograms that the Administration did not think were necessary. These restrictive, special interest-driven programs could drain away nearly $1 billion from more effective or flexible programs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 107 Accomplishments of the President's No Child Left Behind Act Signed into law in January 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act is a major accomplishment of the Bush Administration. The new Act will help make schools more effective by: Strengthening AccountabilityIn the past, schools could fail to improve student achievement for years. Now: \u007fFor the first time, by 2005 states will test all students in reading and math in grades three through eight every year so that parents, teachers, and communities will know whether students are learning. \u007fAnnual state and local report cards will show test results, including results for major subgroups of students, so that schools and districts will have a strong incentive to use funds effectively. \u007fSchools that receive Title I funds, which are targeted to high-poverty communities, must show academic progress each year, both for students overall and for each student group, to ensure that all groups of students are proficient in reading and math within 12 years. \u007fFailing schools that receive Title I funds will face consequences so that they can no longer ignore poor performance. \u007fConsequences could ultimately include replacing school staff or reopening as a charter school. \u007fSchools that exceed their student achievement goals will be rewarded. Enhancing Parental ChoiceIn the past, students in fa iling schools were trap ped, with no real alternatives for a better education. Now: \u007fStudents in low-performing schools can transfer to better public schools, withtransportation provided by the school district. \u007fIf a school that receives Title I funds does not improve for three consecutive years, parents can use federal funds for outside educational assistance from a public or private tutor of their choice. \u007fThe 21stCentury Community Learning Centers after-school program will permit a wider variety of providers, including faith-based and community-based organizations, to give parents more choices.108 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Increasing State And LocalFlexibilityIn the past, states and districts had to adopt reforms dictated from the federal level in order to receive certain funds. Now: \u007fMany narrow, categorical programs have be en consolidated into state-run grants for bilingual education, teacher training, educational technology, and education innovation, thereby freeing states and districts from restrictive federal requirements. \u007fFor the first time, states and school districts will have the flexibility to move funds from one federal program to another, so they can allocate resources to best meet local needs. Focusing on What WorksIn the past, funds have been spent on programs that are ineffective or for which there is little or no evidence of effectiveness. Now: \u007fProgram performance is a top priority, and the effectiveness of academic programswill be measured by student achievement data. \u007fThe President's literacy initiative, Reading First, will support only reading practicesthat have been proven to be effective, so that all children can read at grade level bythe end of third grade. Funding for Major Programs The following programs will provide critical resources to states and localities to implement education reform. Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies. The budget requests $11.4 billion for Title I to help raise student achievement in the nation's most impoverished communities. At this level,f u n d i n gw i l lh a v ei n c r e a s e d8 5p e r c e n ts i n c e1 9 9 3 . H i s t o r i c a l l y ,T i t l eIh a sd o n el i t t l et or a i s estudent achievement as measured by test scores of low-income students. For instance, reading scores of at-risk students have remained flat over this period. However, in light of this year's legislative reforms, the program now holds promise for improving performance by the schools andfor the students who face the most challenges. Reading First. Reading is the foundation skill for all other learning. The President's goal is to ensure that all students can read at grade level by the end of third grade. The Reading First program,initiated through the No Child Left Behind Act, will provide funds to states to support only the most proven reading practices. The budget provides $1 billion for this program, a $100 million increase over 2002. The budget also includes $75 million for Early Reading First, the same level as 2002, todevelop model programs to help children in high-poverty communities prepare for school. Assessments. The budget proposes $387 million for the second year of federal support of states' development of annual reading and math assessments for grades 3 through 8. These assessmentswill be used to monitor schools' yearly progress under the new requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. English Language Acquisition. The budget proposes $665 million for this redesigned program that provides performance-based grants to states to educate students with limited English skills.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 109 Under the new law, students served by this program must also show adequate yearly progress, thus giving states a strong incentive to improve student performance on annual assessments. Despite generally flat performance in the last decade, the federal role and the federal investment in education expanded dramatically during the 1990s. Put another way, most of the federal funds expended for elementary and secondary education were spent in the nineties, after the progress had ended and scores had stagnated. That is meaningful information for policymakers at the national level. Secretary Paige May 200121stCentury Community Learning Centers. This program supports before- and after-school projects that extend learning time and offer enriching activities such as art, music, and recreation. Early reports indicatethat 21 stCentury Community Learning Centers opens access to after-school programs,improves student behavior, and possiblyboosts achievement. The budget retains this large program at the 2002 level of $1 billion. Choice Demonstration Fund. Choice is a primary component of the President'selementary and secondary education reforms.The Choice Demonstration Fund will award$50 million to fund school choice research and demonstration in order to study the effects of expanded educational options for low-income parents, including opportunities to send their children to private schools. Teacher Programs. The budget proposes $2.9 billion for the Teacher Quality State Grants program to recruit, train and retain qualified teachers. This funding should assist states in ensuringthat all new teachers in schools receiving Title I funds are highly qualified as required by the newESEA. In addition, the budget proposes $15 million for new teacher quality initiatives to address reform in teacher professional development and $50 million for competitive grants to school districts for activities that promote the teaching of traditional American history. Safe and Drug Free Schools. The Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities (SDFSC) program was created in response to increases in youth violence and drug use, but has been ineffectivein fighting these problems, in part because SDFSC funds are spread thinly across many schoolsand because the program lacks incentives for schools to institute high-quality projects. Although the budget maintains a commitment to the program and its purpose, future budgets will weigh its effectiveness before funding recommendations are made. Over the next year, every effort will bemade to determine if this program is effective. Even Start. The budget reverses the growth of this well-intentioned program that has failed to produce results. Even Start funds family literacy services. Unfortunately, two national evaluationsand a multitude of local appraisals have not shown conclusively that this program has had a positive impact. The budget therefore provides enough funds to continue supporting current Even Start grantees but does not expand the program to fund new projects. These funds are shifted to supportprograms expected to improve reading achievement, such as Title I and Reading First.110 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Improving Programs Through the Smart Use of Data Data management reform will significantly reduce the local, state, and federal paperwork swamping this employee.As a companion to the President's elementary and secondary education reforms, the budget includes a fundamental reform of how the Department of Education and statescooperate to collect and analyze data on schoolperformance. For the federal governmentand states to hold schools accountable foreducational results, they must measure student progress yearly. The federal government's old approach of issuing and collecting voluminous reportsthat had little utility for decision-makers orthe public will be replaced by a new systemthat uses the latest technology to make performance information readily available to federal, state, and local decision-makers andthe public. The new Performance-Based Data Management Initiative will involve: 1) electronic collection of timely data on student achievementand educational outcomes; 2) elimination of existing reporting burden that diverts state and local school resources from their educational mission; and 3) analysis of data on educational results to identify performance trends and inform management, budget, and policy decisions. The budgetincludes $10 million to develop, in collaboration with states, the electronic data system. An Expert's Report on Reports \"The bottom line is ...I don't think it's really used,\" said a state employee about a \"massive\" survey distributedby the Department of Education on elementary andsecondary education programs. \"Every state reports the information differently,\" added the employee, who also explained that 14 full-time professional staff andtwo temps worked for three weeks to complete the form.\"Our response [to the US Department of Education]is an inch-and-a-half thick,\" the civil servant stressed,concluding that despite the s urvey's comprehensiveness, \"The report just isn't used.\"Special Education Children with disabilities are among those at greatest risk of beingleft behind. The Individuals withDisabilities Education Act (IDEA)establishes the right of children with disabilities to a free, appropriate public education. Through this legislation, which the Congress passed in 1975, the federalgovernment plays an important rolein helping children with disabilities meet high academic standards and participate fully in American society.The 2003 budget provides $8.5 billionfor the Special Education Grant to States program, a $1 billion increase over 2002. The budget also provides $437 million for states toidentify and serve infants and toddlers with disabilities, a $20 million increase. In many cases, this early intervention can reduce or even eliminate the need for special education as children grow up.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 111 W h oI si nS p e c i a lE d u c a t i o n ? About six mi llion sc hool-aged children, roughly 10 percent of the total population, receive special education. Many of these children have easy-to-identify disab ilities, like mental retardation and blin dness. However, an increasing proportion of children in special education have disabilities that are moresubjectively determined and difficult to diagnose. About half of all special education children are diagnosed as \"learning disabled,\" and Department of Education data suggest the number of children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder has skyrocketed. These disab ilities lack clear criteria for i dentification, and are applied inconsistently across schools. Many people are worried that some children are inappropriately referred to special education. For instance, many children may be referred to special education not because of a real disability but because they werenever properly taught how to read. Also, Department data show that minority children are disproportionately represented in special education. The President's Co mmission on Excellence in Special Education will pay particularly close attention to these issues and report its recommendations to the President. While the President supports the principles embodied in the IDEA, the law needs reform. The Administration plans to develop its reform proposal in the coming year. To support this effort, the President has formed a Commission on Excellence in Special Education, which will report back to the President this year. Job Training Programs in the Department of Education The 2003 Budget will launch a multi-year effort to reform job training programs across the federal government, target resources to programs with documented effectiveness, and eliminate funding for ineffective, duplicative, and overlapping programs (see the Department of Labor chapter). This crosscutting reform includes three programs in the Department of Education whose primary missionis to help individuals prepare for the labor market and lead productive lives. Vocational Rehabilitation. State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment to the extent of their abilities. VR also supportsthe President's New Freedom Initiative to help people with disabilities lead independent lives. People with disabilities are less likely to be employed than those without disabilities; one of VR's main purposes is to offer job training to help people with disabilities obtain competitive jobs. Inaddition, persons with disabilities can more effectively participate in the integrated workforce withthe special accommodations and supports afforded to them through the VR program. State VRagencies, for instance, also offer adaptive technologies to individuals with physical impairments andother disabilities, as well as job coaches and personal assistants for those with the most significant disabilities. While nationwide state VR agency performance has improved in recent years, there is still wide variation among states. As a result, VR is an area the Department will highlight in the President'sinitiative to tie budget decisions to program performance. As part of this initiative, the budgetproposes a new $30 million incentive grant which will be allocated to state VR agencies based ontheir performance in helping individuals with disabilities obtain competitive jobs.112 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Vocational and Adult Education. The Department of Education provides grants to states to support programs that develop the academic, vocational, and technical skills of students in highschools and community colleges. Vocational education is primarily a state and local responsibility. Federal funds account for only about seven percent of total vocational education spending. The Department also awards grants to states to help adults become literate, obtain a high school diplomaor its equivalent, and learn skills necessary for work and self-sufficiency. Research shows that thereis a strong relationship between education and earnings; adult education programs often provide thefoundation for further job training and workforce preparedness. The federal laws that authorize vocational and adult education programs will expire at the end of 2003. The 2003 Budget maintains funding at the 2002 level while the Administration examines what reforms\u2014including fundamental changes to the federal role in vocational education\u2014may beneeded in these areas. Postsecondary Education The Administration's strategy for postsecondary education is to focus resources on student aid programs that help needy students pay for college, higher education programs that help students prepare for postsecondary education, and institutional development programs that provide supportfor colleges which serve low-income and minority students. Pell Grants. Pell Grants help increase college enrollment rates among disadvantaged students. In 1999, only 49 percent of high school graduates from the poorest families went to college, comparedto 76 percent of students from the wealthiest families. Research has shown that increases in grant aid result in significant increases in enrollment, particularly for low-income students. The 2002 appropriations bill created a serious fiscal problem for 2002 by underfunding the Pell Grant program. The Congress mandated a Pell Grant maximum award of $4,000, but provided onlyenough funding to pay for a maximum award of $3,600, creating a shortfall of nearly $1.3 billion.To rectify this problem, the budget proposes to redirect resources from unrequested earmarks andlow-priority programs in 2002 to the Pell Grant program. The Administration will propose $10.9 billion for Pell in 2003 to help over four million students afford college. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Federal resources help these institutions, which provide opportunity for some of the most disadvantaged students in the nation, improve their educational programs. ThePresident has committed to increasing funding for HBCUs and for HSIs by 30 percent between2001 and 2005. The budget proposes $213 million for HBCUs, $51 million for Historically Black Graduate Institutions, and $89 million for Hispanic Serving Institutions to keep these institutions on track to achieve the President's goal. TRIO and GEAR UP. These two programs, which help disadvantaged middle- and high-school students prepare for college, share similar goals but use different approaches. As part of thePresident's initiative to tie budget and performance, the Administration will assess the programs'effectiveness and develop strategies for 2004 to improve the performance of both and direct resources to the most effective strategies. Funding for these programs in 2003 is held steady at the 2002 level pending the results of this review. Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Under current law, teachers who work in high-poverty schools for five years may have up to $5,000 of their federal student loans forgiven. The budget proposes toTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 113 expand this program to allow the math, science, and special education teachers who qualify for this program to have up to $17,500 of their student loans forgiven. Student Loans. The guaranteed and direct student loan programs provide $50 billion in aid each year to students and parents. The Administration is in the process of developing revisions to the method of calculating the cost estimates for these programs. The new method, when fullyimplemented, is expected to produce better cost estimates necessary for policy decisions andprogram management. While the budget reflects amounts calculated using the existing method, theAdministration will complete work on a new estimation method for use in the Mid-Session Reviewof the 2003 Budget. In the interim, the Administration will adopt Congressional Budget Office estimates for purposes of the Budget Enforcement Act scoring of legislative proposals. Educational Research This year, the Administration will propose legislation to reform the Department's research office, the Office of Educational Research and Improvement. The budget includes a $53 million increasefor research activities to support important new programs and emphasizes scientifically based research. A major focus will be placed on identifying the most effective strategies for improving reading comprehension. Improving Student Financial Aid Operations Student Aid Fraud Last March, the Department of Education's Inspector General uncovered a student aid fraud ring in Chicago. Eight financial aid advisers and 18 parents were charged with fraud for obtainingmore than $2.6 million in undeserved grants and loans by lying about family income on thestudent aid application. As many as 600 peopleare still under investigation. Many of the parents continued to file accurate tax returns with IRS even while they provided fake documents tosupport their student aid applications.Eliminating Fraud and Error in Student Aid Programs. Through the Department of Education, the federal government supports approximately $60 billion in student financial aid annually.Programs in that portfolio are vulnerableto fraud and error because the Departmentcannot verify students' income effectively.Students are awarded Pell Grants and loans based on the financial resources they report on their aid applications. The EducationDepartment currently verifies incomeinformation on applications by asking 30percent of applicants to provide copies of their,and in the case of dependent students, their parents' tax returns to their schools' financial aid offices. Students easily can receive more funding than they are entitled to by changing theirreturns or claiming they did not file. The President proposes a legislative change to allow IRS tomatch the income reported on student aid applications with tax return data. An estimated $138million would be saved in 2003. Reducing Costs. Reducing administrative costs was one of the key purposes of 1998 legislation that established a performance-based organization to administer student financial assistance programs. Although the Department of Education has made some progress, weak accountingpractices and an overly complex budget structure have made it difficult for the Department's114 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION management to measure progress in reducing costs. Furthermore, of the more than $900 million provided annually for administrative funding, more than four-fifths has not been subject to annualreview in the congressional appropriations process. Beginning with the 2003 Budget, accountability for these funds will be strengthened. Funding from four sources will be consolidated into a single discretionary account for student aidadministrative costs. The account will be subject to annual appropriations by Congress. Annualbudget requests will be tied to unit cost targets for major business processes (e.g., applicationprocessing, loan origination, loan servicing) and to annual estimates of participation in the variousloan and grant programs. Strengthening Management In April 2001, the Secretary of Education established a Management Improvement Team to develop an agency plan for management excellence. The Department of Education faced particularlysignificant challenges in financial management and student financial assistance programs, whichhave kept the Department on the General Accounting Office's list of high-risk programs since 1990. The Secretary set two goals: earn a clean financial audit, and eliminate fraud and error in student aid programs. The Department of Education's Blueprint for Management Excellence spelled out robust plans to address longstanding financial management problems, such as high risk of waste, fraud, and abusein student financial aid programs, and information technology security. Overall, some 140 actionitems were put into play. Areas still lacking detailed or adequately defined plans include human capital, competitive sourcing, budget and performance integration, and some e-government projects. However, the Department has established deadlines for developing these plans. In addition, Education is actively implementing the President's Faith-Based and Community Initiative in order to improve the delivery of social services by drawing on a wider range of serviceproviders. Education has identified barriers to participation in its programs and has developed astrong plan for eliminating those barriers. The following management scorecard reflects the Department of Education's September 30, 2001, status on each of the initiatives in the President's Management Agenda. The Department'smanagement during the coming year will closely track progress on the President's ManagementAgenda and the Department's Blueprint for Management Excellence.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 115 Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014Education has not completed an inventory of its staff's current skills or a workforce restructuring plan to align its workforce with its mission and goals. In the year ahead, Education will give high priority to identifying areas in which its staff needs to develop skills, developing training strategies to ensure employees have the necessaryknowledge to meet changing work demands, and taking advantage of recruitment tools so theDepartment can attract high-quality employees. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014Education has not completed its plan permitting the private sector to compete to perform tasks that are done by the government workforce but are commercialin nature. The 2002 goal calls for competing 43 commercial positions. Education's existing inventory of commercial positions excludes many activities that could appropriately be reclassified as commercial, such as human resource clerks and administrative assistants. In 2002, the Department will develop a competitive sourcing plan and reevaluate its inventory of commercial positions. Education expects to meet or exceed the 2002- 2003 target tocompetitively source 15 percent of its commercial positions.\u007f Financial Management \u2014For 2000, the Department of Education received a \"qualified\" opinion on its financial statements. The auditors continued to cite material weaknesses from prior audits, including failure to reconcile fi nancial data from different sources and inadequate internal controls. In 2000, the general ledger was not compliant with federal requirements. The Department is taking aggressive steps to fix past problems. This year, it will implement Oracle Federal Financials (an accounting pac kage), prepare quarterly instead of only annual financial statements, and reconcile transac tion-level data with summary balances in the general ledger. Because of these changes, the D epartment of Education expects to achieve a clean audit opinion for the 2002 financial statements.\u007f E-Government \u2014Performance has been mixed. Capital asset plans justifying information technology expenditures have improved but some still do not address statutory requirements.There has been success in using new technologies to simplify students' access to financialaid, such as using electronic signatures for aid applications and promissory notes. Yet theDepartment's failure to implement mandated planning requirements could lead to unwise investments or the use of obsolete technologies. Plans to reform data collection for elementary and secondary programs, as well as student loans are under development. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014While recognizing the importance of linking public education investments to evidence of program effectiveness, the Department of Educationhas not yet put in place administrative actions to implement this policy. The Department has decided to modify significantly the program performance goal s developed by the previous Administration but has no alternative method for measuring and reporting on performance. For 2003, performance measures and evaluation strategy will be developed for key programs. \u007f116 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Department of Education (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Elementary and Secondary Education Title I Grants to LEAs .......................................................... 8,763 10,350 11,350 Even Start ............................................................................. 250 250 200 Reading Excellence/Reading First and Early Reading First ................................................................................... 286 975 1,075 Impact Aid ............................................................................. 993 1,144 1,141 Educational Technology State Grants .............................. 872 700 700 Teacher Quality State Grants ............................................ 2,225 2,850 2,850 Safe and Drug Free Schools State Grants ...................... 439 472 472 21st Ctry.

Department of Energy Spencer Abraham, Secretary www.energy.gov 202-586-8100 Number of Employees : 15,000 Federal and 100,000 Contractor 2002 Spending : $19.1 billion Facilities : Twelve operations and field offices oversee four Power Marketing Administrations,26 laboratories, and 24 other facilities.The Department of Energy (DOE) has four major functions. These are: 1) nationalsecurity; 2) environmental quality; 3) scienceand technology; and 4) energy resources. Inthe area of national security, the National Nuclear Security Administration maintains the nation's nuclear weapons stockpileand manages non-proliferation effortsto reduce threats from weapons of massdestruction. The environmental qualityfunction is largely conducted by the Office of Environmental Management, which cleans up the environmental contamination resultingfrom over 50 years of nuclear materialproduction. The Office of Science sponsors a broad range of basic research that supports other DOE programs and operates a suite of scientificfacilities for the benefit of the entire U.S. research community. Finally, the Offices of Fossil Energy, Nuclear Energy, and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy conduct applied research aimed at improving energy conservation and supply. Recently, Secretary Abraham declared that the 119120 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Department's single overarching mission is supporting national security, which includes energy and economic security. This mission provides direction to all four functions as described below. Overview The Department faces some of the most daunting technical challenges of any federal agency. For instance, DOE must certify the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile\u2014and do sowithout nuclear testing. It must clean up sites contaminated by over 50 years of weapons testingand production\u2014an area equal in size to Rhode Island and Delaware combined. The Departmentmust design, site, build, and operate a 10,000-year repository to safely store the nation's nuclear waste. DOE also sponsors an extensive research portfolio encompassing issues ranging from the universe's earliest matter to how to make homes more energy efficient. It carries out most of thesetasks using a contractor workforce operating both an aging infrastructure and many large, expensive,one-of-a-kind research facilities. In all these areas, careful planning, rigorous prioritization, andmanagement reforms are particularly important for improving DOE's performance. Secretary Abraham announced national security as DOE's primary mission in October 2001. He established the following priorities: \u007fSupporting homeland defense with a focus on the threat of weapons of mass destruction and emphasis on nonproliferation efforts abroad; guaranteeing the safety and reliability of thenuclear stockpile, and ensuring that research and development (R&D) and production planssupport the Administration's nuclear strategy; and providing safe, efficient, and effectivenuclear power for Navy ships; \u007fAssuring energy security through infrastructure protection; implementing the President'sNational Energy Policy; exploring new energy sources and technologies with dramaticenvironmental benefits; and directing R&D budgets to innovative new ideas while ensuring application of mature technologies; and \u007fAccelerating the cleanup and closure of sites where there is no longer a national security mission. Improving management and performance is the unifying theme of the 2003 President's Budget. The Administration's proposals to return value to the taxpayer and address performance issues areorganized along the four main \"functional areas\": National Security; Environmental Management;Science and Technology; and Energy Resources. Nonetheless, safeguarding national security remainsthe paramount objective. National Security Created by Congress in 1999, the DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) mission is to strengthen the security of the United States by: 1) applying nuclear science andtechnology to military purposes; and 2) reducing the global threat from weapons of mass destruction.To accomplish this mission, NNSA manages defense-related programs to: \u007fmaintain and enhance the safety, security and reliability of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile; \u007fprovide the Navy with safe and effective nuclear propulsion plants for ships; and \u007fprevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their components. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 121 Stockpile Stewardship Since 1993, DOE has developed and is operating the Stockpile Stewardship program to certify the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile in the absence of underground testing. NNSA achieves this goal by relying on improved science, technology, and computational techniques to detect and predict problems in the aging nuclear stockpile. NNSA is also charged with effectivelymaintaining and refurbishing existing nuclear warheads, as well as sustaining the design andmanufacturing base to produce a new weapon if required. The B-61 bomb, undergoing refurbishment, has approximately 6,000 component parts.To maintain a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent, NNSA's federal workforce of about 1,700 oversees a vast complex that includes Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermorenational laboratories; the Nevada Test Site;and extensive production facilities in Amarillo,Texas, Kansas City, Missouri, Aiken, SouthCarolina, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These facilities have a combined contractor workforce of approximately 25,000. This complex carriesout four kinds of activities: \u007fDirected Stockpile Work programssupport DOD's nuclear weaponsrequirements by maintaining and refurbishing warheads to ensure their safety, reliability, and performance.Programs include research, development, and production associated with weaponsmaintenance, life extensions, and certification of continued reliability. For example, NNSAis in the process of refurbishing an aircraft-delivered weapon, the B-61 bomb, which firstentered the stockpile in 1979. \u007fScience Programs develop and maintain capabilities needed to certify the reliability of thenuclear stockpile into the future. One example is the Inertial Confinement Fusion IgnitionCampaign that includes construction and operation of the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. This is a technically challenging effort that has led to significant cost growth and delays. However, because this facility is important tounderstanding the physics of nuclear explosions, DOE continues to place a high priority onallocating a significant amount of resources to it. DOE laboratories also operate some of theworld's largest and fastest computers to perform advanced simulations of nuclear weaponsexplosions. The size and speed of these computers enable DOE to perform calculations and simulations that, previously, were impossible to perform because of their complexity. \u007fInfrastructure Programs operate and maintain existing facilities and construct new facilities that underpin the stockpile work. Since the end of the Cold War, some of these facilities have decayed, and NNSA is beginning to improve conditions. \u007fSecurity Programs protect the nuclear warheads and their supporting facilities, whether mobile or stationary. Managing the Stockpile Stewardship program without nuclear testing has proven to be challenging, because much of the work requires DOE to use new and untested techniques.Throughout the Cold War, DOE maintained a viable nuclear stockpile by designing and producing122 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY new weapons every 15 to 20 years. New production and underground testing ensured the effectiveness of the weapons. However, the United States last produced a new weapon in 1991, and last conducted a nuclear test in 1992. Now, DOE must develop new tools to manage the stockpile without the type of design and testing that has supported the stockpile since 1945. This work will remain critical even as DODdraws down the number of operationally deployed warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 over thenext 10 years. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 200301234567Stockpile Stewardship and Related Funding In billions of dollarsFor those reasons, NNSA's stockpile stewardship program is a fast-growing effort. Funding has grown by 88 percent since 1995. The accompanying graph shows thegrowth in funding since 1995 for stockpilestewardship work, the infrastructure thatunderpins that work, and the associatedsecurity requirements. The 2003 Budget requests $6.1 billion for Stockpile Stewardship and associated administrative activities, $455million above the 2002 level. Beyond 2003,the Administration will work with DoD toprovide resources to meet DOE's requirementsoutlined in the Nuclear Posture Review. Naval Reactors In 2003, the Naval Reactors program will add to its record of 124 million miles steamed wit hout a reactor accident or a significant release of radioactivity into the environment.One true success story of the nuclear age is the development and operation of safe andreliable nuclear-powered warships. DOE'sNaval Reactors Program is responsible for all naval nuclear propulsion work, beginning with technology development, continuingthrough reactor operation and, ultimately, toreactor plant disposal. The program ensures the safe operation of the reactor plants in operatingnuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers (comprising about 40 percent of the Navy'smajor warships), and develops new nuclear propulsion plants to meet evolving national defense requirements. By the end of 2003, the goal is to complete 99 percent of the design of the next generation of submarine reactors and to continue work on the design of the next generation ofaircraft carrier. Preventing the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction Preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction around the world is vital to the nation's security. The importance of this was made clearer after the September 11thterrorist attacks. This Administration is fully committed to a comprehensive nonproliferation effort that will reduce thethreat of weapons of mass destruction and stop the flow of the materials and expertise required toTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 123 build such weapons. The President's Budget includes a significant funding increase to step up efforts in these programs. The NNSA will manage over $1 billion in nonproliferation programs in 2003 aimed largely at securing or eliminating materials in states of the former Soviet Union. NNSA focuses its efforts on those activities that do the most to minimize the potentially catastrophic results of these weapons ormaterials falling into the wrong hands. For example, ...And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges ...Working with other countries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls. Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people. Remarks at the Citadel President George W. Bush December 11, 2001\u007fNNSA operates a program, known as International Nuclear MaterialsProtection and Cooperation, to securenuclear materials in the former SovietUnion. These programs includeupgrading security at Russian nuclear sites, securing fissile materials that c o u l db eu s e dt ob u i l dw e a p o n s ,a n dimproving security at Russian borders.By the end of 2003, NNSA will havesupported completion of comprehensivesecurity upgrades to 54 of 95 identified former Soviet nuclear sites and will have begun work to secure roughly 80percent of the weapons-grade nuclearmaterial at these sites. \u007fNNSA manages international security programs aimed at limiting the production ofweapons-usable fissile material, facilitates retrieving and securing radioactive spent nuclearfuel, helps engage Russian scientists in non-weapon-related projects, and assists Russia indownsizing its nuclear weapons complex. \u007fNNSA's Nonproliferation Research and Development program develops technologies neededto detect and deter nuclear proliferation abroad, and to detect and respond to chemical andbiological attacks in the United States. \u007fNNSA's Fissile Material Disposition Program covers activities in both the U.S. and Russia todispose of weapons-usable fissile materials such as enriched uranium and plutonium. The2003 Budget supports the first year of a newly-revised program for plutonium disposition.Beyond 2003, the Administration is committed to providing the resources necessary to fully support this new plan. While the nonproliferation programs are critical to national security, DOE in previous years has been slow to spend the funds the Congress provided. A key impediment has been timely access toRussian sites, which sometimes requires lengthy negotiations. The Administration is committed toresolving problems and accelerating its nonproliferation effort. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs to124 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY more effective or higher priority programs. The following ratings of selected DOE programs are illustrative. Some programs are discussed in more detail in this chapter.

The EnvironmentalManagement (EM) program is responsible for cleaning up 114 sites where the Energy Department and earlier government agenciestested and produced nuclear weapons orconducted nuclear energy research. In 1998,the EM program published Accelerating Cleanup: Paths to Closure , which outlined a plan to complete the 53 sites remaining (one site was added to the list after Accelerating Cleanup was published), at an estimated cost of $147 billion during the period 1997 to 2070.The current cost estimate for cleaning up this set of 53 sites is $220 billion, an increase of 50 percentin just three years. As of 2001, DOE has completed 14 of those 53 sites. What accounts for these delays and cost increases? Some result from technical uncertainties. But another problem is that the program has become less focused on cleaning up sites and has insteadturned into a local \"jobs\" program. The Administration finds 2070, well beyond the life span of mostAmericans alive today, as an unacceptable deadline to complete the cleanup of existing sites. Progress vs. Payroll In 2000, DOE reallocated $30 million from priority cleanup projects at Savannah River, S.C.,Hanford, Wash., and Idaho National Lab. The Department decided to use these funds instead to revive the EM laboratory-directed researchand development program suspended by theCongress and to employ workers displaced whenthe Congress terminated the DOE Office of FieldIntegration.For more than a decade, the General Accounting Office has designated DOE'scontract administration and management ofits EM projects as a high-risk area, vulnerableto fraud, waste, and abuse. Problems in this area include cost and schedule overruns and DOE's inability to hold contractorsaccountable. At the Savannah River site inSouth Carolina, for example, the EM programselected a process to separate radioactivewaste from liquids in storage tanks. In 1985, EM estimated it would take three years and $32 million to construct the necessary facility.In 1999, after more than a decade of delaysand spending about $500 million, the EM program terminated the project because the facility couldnot operate within required safety margins. Problems of this type persist. The accompanying figureshows the change since 1989 in estimated costs to clean up the five major sites. Some of the variance is due to more complete information regarding the extent of contamination, but the program has also failed to meet cost, schedule, and performance goals.126 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Oak at Major Sites Since Original Estimate +$6.8 Billion Source: Office of Environmental Management, DOE. Costs Less +$1.0 BillionSavannah River Rocky Flats +$6.0 Billion Costs MoreToday, the Department recognizes the significant management challenges facing theEM program and is moving to meet them. In March 2001, Secretary Abraham ordered the Office of Environmental Managementto do a top-to-bottom review and identifyways to improve performance. Managementimprovements instituted by the Departmentwill accelerate cleanup and lower costs. The program is scheduled to complete cleanup of Missouri's Weldon Spring site in 2002, andKentucky's Maxey Flats Disposal site in 2003.The total number of EM sites completed bythe end of 2003 will be 76 of 114. Environmental Management Performance Rating Criteria Geographic Site Mission Performance ReformOverall Idaho National Lab, ID\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f Savannah River, SC\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f Hanford, WA\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f Rocky Flats, CO\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f Oak Ridge Reservation, TN\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f The EM scorecard above presents the Administration's baseline assessment of performance at the five largest EM sites as of early 2001. These sites account for roughly 60 percent of EM's total resources, or about $3.8 billion a year. This evaluation is based upon the following criteria: \"mission\" assesses whether plans and resources are adequately focused on completing sitecleanup; \"performance\" evaluates whether cleanup activities are consistent with cost, schedule, andperformance baselines; and \"reform\" indicates whether sites recognize performance problems andare attempting to improve performance. \u007fEven though the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory receives substantial earmarked funding through the EM Office of Science and Technology, it is unableTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 127 to complete projects on time and within budget. The Administration proposes accelerating the completion date from the current date of 2050 and closing the lab. \u007fThe Savannah River Site spent $500 million on a radioactive waste treatment plant thatcould not operate as required, yet DOE rewarded the contractor with a contract extensionin 2000. The site resists project management improvements, and it too should be placed on anaccelerated cleanup track. \u007fHanford appears to be improving its management, despite a history of significant problemsmanaging large capital projects and a cleanup that is behind schedule and over budget. \u007fRocky Flats has generally performed well, but recent schedule slippage for critical-pathnuclear material stabilization raises concerns about attaining the primary goal of closure byDecember 2006. \u007fOak Ridge has performed reasonably well. The site has focused on the easy work, not on higherrisk reduction activities. This misdirection of effort accounts for the mediocre rating for thesite. The President proposes $6.7 billion for the Environmental Management program. This amount includes $800 million in a new \"reserve\" fund to implement fundamental program changes, with the expectation that the proposed reforms will improve cleanup efficiency by completing constructionprojects within baselines, reducing the cost of waste treatment and disposal, and integrating cleanupstrategies across different sites. The proposed EM budget focuses resources on sites with betterperformance, while the Department implements reforms identified by the Secretary's top-to-bottomreview at those sites with poor performance. The budget adds funding for higher priority, better managed activities such as waste treatment at Hanford, closure of the Fernald site, and cleanup at the Oak Ridge National Lab, by reducing funding for congressional earmarks, poorly performingprojects in the EM Office of Science and Technology, and excess administrative staff. Radioactive Waste Disposal Growing quantities of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste have been accumulating at commercial nuclear reactor sites and storage facilities across the country for half a century. Asrequired by law, DOE has investigated the suitability of a storage site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada,100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, for over 20 years. Based on sound science and compelling national interest, the Secretary of Energy has informed the Governor of Nevada of his intent to recommend the Yucca Mountain site to the President for development as a geologic repository for the nation's nuclear waste. Should the site be formally designated this year, current plans call for the repository to open in 2010. The Budget provides sufficient funding for DOE to prepare a license application to meet that deadline. If the site is designated, the Administration will seek additional funding to beginconstruction of essential transportation facilities and infrastructure within Nevada, and providea long-term management and financing plan for the entire licensing and construction effort. The Administration is committed to ensuring the environmentally sound and safe disposal of the nation's radioactive waste.128 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Congressional Earmarks The President's Budget generally allocates funding for specific programs, such as research and cleanup programs, based on an analysis of objective factors including the results of peer review and engineering capabilities. Congressional earmarks skew these determinations and divert funds from higher priority and more effective programs. For instance, in 2002 the Congress earmarked 134 DOEprojects totaling $300 million. Unfortunately, this trend is getting worse. Earmarks in the Office ofScience increased 60 percent over the previous year, to $72 million, and 400 percent more than 1999.One adverse effect is that during 2002, DOE will only be able to operate its scientific user facilities atapproximately 75 percent of the optimally available hours. Had these funds been allocated to facility operations as needed, a broader segment of the research community could have benefited, and the return on the federal investment would have been higher. In other programs, earmarking is having an even more damaging effect. In 2002, the Congress earmarked almost one-fourth of the funding for applied research in renewable energy technologies.For example, the Congress earmarked $3 million \"for the Winona, Mississippi, biomass project,where the current investment in the plant shall count as the required demonstration project cost share.\" Although the National Energy Policy promotes applied research in biomass to help the nation utilize its resources, congressional earmarks such as this one bypass the competitive awardsprocess that results in better, more relevant science to advance national goals. This earmark isparticularly troubling because the project had previously failed to win a funding award in a DOEcompetitive solicitation, and the earmark circumvents the cost-sharing requirements prescribedby the Energy Policy Act. The budget supports the President's commitments and tackles the most pressing energy issues by increasing resources for high priority programs by wasting less on ineffective ones or earmarked projects. Science and Technology Redirecting earmarked funds to the frontiers of science where DOE is working is one good place to invest. The Department performs a broad array of basic research in fields from applied math to physics to biology. It is the primary federal agency supporting research in particle physics, nuclear physics, fusion energy sciences, and chemistry of the radioactive elements. The Department's basicresearch programs are generally effective, with Office of Science-supported researchers winningnumerous awards and honors. In the past decade, seven Nobel Laureates won Nobel Prizes inChemistry or Physics for work that DOE sponsored. The Office of Science also operates a suite of 27 scientific user facilities\u2014such as x-ray light sources, fusion devices, particle accelerators and colliders\u2014used each year by over 18,000 university, industry, and government scientists. Researchers traveling to use these facilities expect that thephoton, neutron, proton, electron, or other beams will be provided for their experiments on schedule.DOE facilities delivered 99 percent of scheduled operating hours over the period 1997-2001. Moreimportantly, these facilities deliver scientifically. As just one example, 11 of the 12 irreduciblebuilding blocks of all known matter were discovered at particle physics facilities the Department has run over the last 50 years. The only one not discovered at a U.S. high-energy physics facility was the electron, discovered in England in 1897. Access to DOE facilities is allocated by peer-review to the most scientifically promising of the proposed experiments. Awarding research funds through a peer-reviewed, competitive process isthe preferred method to improve chances for higher quality results. Agencies, and programs withinTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 129 them, vary in the degree to which they award funds competitively. Overall, only 24 percent of DOE research funds are competed, while another 49 percent are subject to limited competition. For theOffice of Science, 45 percent of the research funds not spent on facility operations are fully competed; 55 percent are subject to merit review with limited competition. AgencyPercent of Research Competed in 2001 National Science Foundation .............................................. 94 Department of Health and Human Services ..................... 83 National Aeronautics and Space Administration .............. 75 Department of Commerce ................................................... 42 Department of Energy .......................................................... 24 The Office of Science spends 37 percent of its research funds on facility operations. To maintain operations of its user facilities at the highest level possible, Office of Science advisory committees periodically review both the operational efficiency and scientific productivity of DOE's user facilities. These reviews have teeth. In 1997, the Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee undertook areview of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Finding the facility'sperformance wanting, DOE cut its budget, the director resigned, and the facility embarked ona path to recovery. Last year, the advisory committee revisited the facility and re-evaluated itsscientific output. Noting that none of the criticisms in the earlier report were still valid, the review panel found that the ALS had established areas of excellence in a number of important scientific areas. It singled out for special mention the unique capabilities of the ALS to study ultrafastprocesses in solids and gases, which have application for chemical reactions, phase transitions,surface dynamics, and a wide variety of critical biological processes. The budget proposes $3.3 billion for DOE Science programs. Consistent with the Administration's emphasis on shifting funds to higher priority programs, the budget redirects funding for the particle physics fixed target program at Brookhaven to operations at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Energy Resources DOE performs research and development on energy production, use, and conservation over a wide spectrum of technologies such as nuclear, solar, wind, fossil, and many others. Other programs inthis area include energy security activities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. Presidential Initiatives The budget continues to fulfill the President's commitments to increase funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program over the next 10 years to assist 1.2 million low-income families while improving the nation's energy conservation. The program's energy conservation construction130 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY measures for homes help save each low-income family an estimated $218 annually on utility bills, at an average one-time cost of $2,000 to $2,500 each. With an average life span of 20 years, theimprovements generate more than $4,000 in total utility bill savings per home. The budget proposes to weatherize 123,000 homes in 2003, a 17 percent increase over 2002. Old Clean Coal The old Clean Coal program was intended to demonstrate technologies that could reduceacid rain-producing emissions from coal-firedpower plants. Projects required a minimum 50percent cost-share from industry. Commerciallysuccessful projects were supposed to reimburse the federal investment. Less than $2 m illion of the $1.6 billion expended\u2014about one tenthof one percent\u2014has been repaid. Of the 50projects funded, 12 costing $97 million wereterminated or withdrawn prior to completion. The General Accounting Office examined 13 projects: six were behind schedule by two to seven years, and two were bankrupt.The budget also continues to fulfill the President's commitment to search for technology that will allow us to burn coal cleanly and more efficiently. Last year'sbudget added $150 million to existing coalresearch towards the President's commitmentto spend $2 billion over 10 years on clean coalresearch. In this budget, all coal programs are brought under one umbrella\u2014the President's Coal Research Initiative. This approach,using a more transparent budget structure,will improve the management and oversightof this $326 million program. Funds fromthe earlier, much-criticized demonstration program of the 1980s will be redirected to the Coal Research Initiative, freeing up almost$500 million that has languished unexpendedand unproductive for years. Getting More for Each Research Dollar The federal government needs to spend each dollar carefully, recognizing it is the taxpayers' money, not its own. In an effort to better prioritize research and development spending, theAdministration, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences and many others, developedinvestment criteria for applied R&D programs. The Administration is using the specific R&Dcriteria to recommend funding levels for the Department's applied R&D programs that support thePresident's National Energy Policy. This is the first application of these criteria to specific programs to ensure that programs fulfill an essential federal role, have well-developed plans to achieve objectives, and achieve results thatbenefit the nation. Next year, the Administration will develop investment criteria for basic researchprograms and extend the application of applied R&D criteria throughout the government for use indevelopment of the 2004 Budget. Application of the criteria indicated that data on the expected performance of many R&D projects are not readily available. For instance, some of the 19 fossil energy R&D programs failed to report any performance data at all, and those that did tended to report goals rather than the currentcost performance of technologies under development. The Department is addressing this lack ofperformance data. In addition, the grading method needs to be improved to distinguish betweenprograms more carefully. For instance, about 80 percent of the programs graded by DOE achieved amaximum score.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 131 R&D Investment Criteria at Work Improving R&D Investment Criteria The National Academy of Sciences recently reported that from 1978 to 2000 the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and fossil energyR&D programs produced a return of $40 billionoff an investment of $13 billion. Dampening thispiece of otherwise good news was the fact thatthree-quarters of these benefits were attributable to three projects that cost only $11 million. What happened to the rest of the money? Goodquestion. Many projects that set taxpayers back billions of dollars generated little or no economic benefit.Take the Coal Liquefaction program, which has spent more than $2 billion on improving the conversion of coal to liquid fuels. Despite itstechnical success, the program has made littleprogress toward manufacturing economicalcoal-derived fuels. For the effort to be profitableat the current level of development, oil prices would have to reach a sustained level of $45 per barrel, more than twice what the commoditycurrently trades for. The R&D investment criteria developed in the President's Management Agenda will helpagencies select broadly beneficial projects that individual firms would be unlikely to undertake. Achieving the greatest possible return oneach taxpayer dollar is an essential part of theAdministration's performance-based focus.Despite these initial problems, the criteria supplied enough guidance to determine somehigher and lower performing programs. For example, ideas about a concept called \"whole-house design\" show significant promisefor reducing the cost of solar water heatingand developing a \"zero-net energy home.\"While the Concentrating Solar Power programsucceeded in lowering the cost of power produced by solar collectors, the price tag for this technology still cannot come close tocompeting with conventional power sources.Therefore, the budget increases funding to theSolar Building Technology Research programby shifting funding from the Concentrating Solar Power program. The R&D investment criteria also directed funding shifts in the Department's wind powerprograms. Due in part to DOE's historicalsupport for wind R&D, wind energy capacityin the United States increased 50 percent in 2001, to about 4,200 megawatts\u2014enough electricity to meet the needs of one millionhouseholds each year. Wind technologycan compete on cost in some areas of thecountry with high average wind speeds.Now, the Department will turn its focus toward developing wind power technologies to compete in lower wind-speed areas. Even high-performing R&D programs may conduct research that could or shouldbe funded by industry. For example, thefossil energy program proposed an expansion of research efforts into offshore drilling techniques. Yet, this area carries a great incentive for industry to invest its own resources, andindustry has a long history of doing just that. So there is little reason for taxpayers to help themout. The budget proposes reductions to programs that are poorly performing, misdirected, or arecorporate subsidies. Some of this funding is redirected to programs recommended by the NationalEnergy Policy, such as hydrogen and superconductivity research and other programs performing particularly well. Following the lead of the National Energy Policy, the budget accelerates commercialization of stationary fuel cells in the next three to four years. It adds a $54 million capstone to the more than$1.2 billion spent developing this technology over the last two and half decades. Also in keeping with132 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY the National Energy Policy, the budget furnishes $50 million to research fuel cells for transportation technologies. Remodeling a Public-Private Partnership The National Energy Policy also recommends funding R&D programs that are \"performance-based and are modeled as public-private partnerships.\" The Administration proposesa new venture with the auto industry called Freedom CAR (Cooperative Automotive Research). Thepartnership aims to develop technologies, such as hydrogen-based fuel cells, that solve many of the problems associated with the nation's reliance on oil. Freedom CAR replaces the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), which had a misguided focus and insufficient accountability due to its multi-agency structure. The new jointeffort will build on some of the PNGV's technical successes and address the program's shortfalls,including its poor management structure. Partners will include DOE and the U.S. Councilfor Automotive Research (USCAR), an umbrella organization of major U.S. automakers. The automakers will provide technical experts to conduct peer-review of project proposals, but direct federal support of automakers will be limited. This new venture will have clear goals. DOE will develop performance measures and assess research projects annually, and independent technical experts will peer review the programbiennially. The venture will be funded solely through DOE, and will be managed by one accountableDOE program manager. The new venture will embrace the President's Management Agenda's investment criteria for applied R&D programs, including a strict adherence to the cost-sharing guidelines. Renewable Tax Incentives The budget proposes significant tax incentives primarily targeted at encouraging energy efficiency and use of renewable resources. These total $9.5 billion over 10 years. The budget includes several new energy tax incentives and extensions of existing ones, including incentives recommended by theNational Energy Policy . Specific proposals would: \u007fExtend and modify the tax credit for producing electricity from environmentally friendlysources, such as biomass and wind ($1.9 billion); \u007fProvide a tax credit for residential solar energy systems ($75 million); \u007fProvide a new tax credit for the purchase of certain hybrid and fuel cell vehicles ($3.0 billion); \u007fProvide a tax credit for energy produced from landfill gas ($1.1 billion); \u007fExtend the ethanol tax exemption; \u007fProvide a tax credit for investment in combined heat and power ($1.2 billion); and \u007fModify the tax treatment of costs associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants($2.1 billion). The Administration also proposes $51 billion to permanently extend the Research and Experimentation tax credit for all sectors of the economy.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 133 Legislative Proposals The Administration proposes opening a small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration. The Administration would devote $1.2 billion of the bonus bid receipts, paid for the right to explore in a small part of ANWR, to increasing renewable energy R&D. This research will help the nation reduce its dependence on fossil fuel. Another portion of expected receipts fromfuture royalties will be devoted to increasing land conservation and reducing maintenance backlogson public lands in the Department of the Interior. Power Marketing Administrations The Western, Southwestern, Southeastern, and Bonneville Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) market electricity generated at 133 multipurpose federal dams and related facilities.Overall, they manage more than 33,000 miles of federally owned transmission lines. The 2003Budget provides $183 million in new discretionary budget authority for Western, Southwestern,and Southeastern. The PMAs will continue to meet their performance goal of providing safe and reliable service. To do that, each PMA must achieve a \"pass\" rating each month under the North American Electricity Reliability Council's industry-wide performance standards. The National Energy Policy report directs federal agencies to remove constraints on the interstate transmission grid to help ensure that the nation's electricity can flow more freely. TheAdministration has made considerable progress this past year working with the state of Californiaand private utilities to secure private-sector financing for construction of transmission facilities that will relieve the transmission bottleneck in northern California. PMAs receive their power from hydroelectric dams operated by the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. In 2003, Southeastern, Southwestern and Western will begin to directly finance theCorps of Engineers' power-related operating and maintenance expenses. In past years, the Corpsobtained appropriations to pay these expenses, and the PMAs repaid the costs to the U.S. Treasury. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) finances its $3 billion annual cost of operations and investments from its annual power revenues and through borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. The budget proposes to increase BPA's current borrowing authority ceiling of $3.75 billion by $700 millionto enable BPA to finance transmission system, conservation, and hydropower improvements. BPAwill encourage non-federal or joint financing of all its future investments in transmission systemupgrades and other investments. It will report its evaluation of these financing opportunities toDOE before using its borrowing authority. Strengthening Management DOE is making progress in addressing the President's Management Agenda and anticipates much improvement through 2002. For example, DOE is making strides in improving its financialmanagement and has received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements in four ofthe last five years. DOE is working with OMB to integrate budget and performance. However, E-Government, especially management of its Information Technology (IT) investments, is DOE's weakest link. Previously, DOE failed to prioritize and report on its IT investment portfolio ormanage IT strategically. The Department is currently consolidating its IT portfolio under the ChiefInformation Officer (CIO), who reports directly to the Deputy Secretary.134 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY One additional management area particularly important for DOE is contract reform and project management. DOE spends more than 90 percent of its budget through contracts. It is essential thatDOE integrate cost and performance standards down to the project level into the competitions for large contracts. DOE traditionally competes large contracts first and then negotiates performance and cost standards after the award. DOE plans to enhance and improve contract and projectmanagement by increasing the technical skills and resources it needs to make its managersaccountable for achieving project and contract cost, schedule, and performance goals. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014DOE has two main problems: an aging workforce and imbalances in core skills ne eded to carry out its missions. The Department has not effectively used existing statutory and regulatory flexibility as part of an overall strategy to address workforce issues. DOE's Workforce Restructuring Plan lacks a vision of the staffing needed for its scientific andtechnical missions. It does not include a proposal for streamlining headquarters and fieldoffices to reduce management layers. DOE's 100,000-plus contractors are not included in thescope of its workforce restructuring plans. With one of the highest contractor-to-federal staffratios (7:1), DOE must have skills necessary to provide substantive oversight and m anagement of its contracts. DOE will revise its workforce-restructuring plan to: \u007fAddress skill gaps in contract administration and project management; \u007fDevelop and maintain science and technical staff; \u007fEliminate headquarters and field office redundancies; and \u007fIntegrate human resources into budget and strategic plans.\u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014The Department prepared a 2000 inventory of 9,941 commercial positions performing tasks that are commercial in nature, more than a third of which are withinthe Power Marketing Administrations. The Department's competitive sourcing plan must meetthe President's Management Agenda goal to compete 15 percent of the agencies' commercialpositions through 2003, in an effort to eventually compete 50 percent of all commercial activities. \u007f Financial Management \u2014DOE was one of only six agencies to receive an unqualified audit opinion on its first consolidated financial statement. It has continued to receive unqualifiedopinions every year, except 1998 because of its environmental liabilities. DOE was also one offour agencies whose financial systems met the Federal Financial Management ImprovementAct requirements. Despite these successes, DOE is still reporting material management control weaknesses. DOE will continue to work on resolving these issues and will: \u007fDevelop a financial management plan that includes a schedule and addresses system integration, especially with its contractor systems; \u007fIntegrate financial, budget, and program information in its s ystems in order to provide cost information related to performance; and, \u007fEnsure implementation of its Business Management Information System (BMIS) is ontrack and that it will correct manageria l accounting issues as planned.\u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 135 Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014DOE reports only 10 percent of its IT investments as \"major,\" which excludes too many relevant projects from oversight and justification of continual investment. DOE has significant weaknesses in its capital planning and investment control process, use of enterprise architecture in decision making, and the effec tiveness of its security policies. Because of a lack of information or business case for its IT investments, it is impossible to evaluate DOE'scompliance with e-government standards. Its financial management system does have someenterprise resource planning management capabilities. DOE must make much more progressin this area by providing complete, accurate, and timely submissions that are justified by a good business case for all of its major IT investments. The Department needs to implement the capital planning and investment control process, and should: \u007fRedefine its major IT investments to include a majority of the $1 billion in annual ITinvestments; \u007fConsolidate the IT portfolio and manage it at a departmental level; and \u007fProvide strong leadership from the CIO.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014Historically, planning and budgeting have been separate activities that were not sufficiently coordinat ed. Strategic and performance plans tend to be submitted after the budget, rather than informing budgets. There has been little attempt to tieresources to results. Although DOE has been working to correct some of these problems,there is still a long way to go. Use of R&D investment criteria should reduce \"justificationby anecdote\", helping DOE to focus on outcomes and how programs influence them. TheDepartment needs to capture meaningful data on performance. Each program should develop performance metrics for all priority programs that will inform and justify budget request decisions. \u007f136 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Department of Energy (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: National Security National Nuclear Security Administration ........................ 6,950 7,249 8,039 Other Defense and all other programs ................. 138 80 176 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1............... 20,187 20,966 21,918 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 70 Total, Discretionary budget authority ......................................... 20,117 20,893 21,847 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: Weapons Activities ................................................................... 51 3 1 \u2014 Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation .......................................... \u20142 2 6 \u2014 Defense Environmental Management ................................... \u20148 \u2014 Other Defense Activities .......................................................... \u20144 \u2014 Total, Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ...... 53 6 9 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: Existing law ............................................................................... 766 1,326 1,253 Legislative proposal ................................................................. \u2014\u2014 1 4 9 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 766 1,326 1,104 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Thompson, Secretary www.hhs.gov 202-619-0257 Number of Employees : 65,000 2002 Spending : $459.4 billion Divisions : Food and Drug Administration; Health Resources and Services Administration;Indian Health Service; Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention; National Institutes ofHealth; Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Administration for Childrenand Families; Administration on Aging; Office ofthe Secretary; Office of the Inspector General;and Program Support Center.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is one of the largest federaldepartments, the nation's largest healthinsurer, and the largest grant-making agencyin the federal government. The Departmentis charged with promoting and protecting the health and well-being of all Americans, and provides world leadership in biomedicaland public health sciences. HHS addressesthese objectives through an array of programsin basic and applied science, public health,income support, child development, and the financing of health and social services. HHS Priorities Fighting Bioterrorism National Pharmaceutical Stockpile supplies are stored strategically in secure locations around the country to ensureswift mobilization to the site of a disaster.No HHS activity is now more important than its role in national bioterrorismpreparedness. By Presidential directive,HHS is the lead federal agency in preparingto combat bioterrorism. HHS prevents,identifies, and responds to incidents of bioterrorism through the Office of the Secretary, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC), the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), the Health Resourcesand Services Administration (HRSA), and theNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Through the CDC, HHS provides assistance to state and local entities to build increasedlaboratory capacity for quick and accurateidentification of dangerous agents, and toenable rapid and secure communication. TheCDC also maintains laboratory facilities to hold and study dangerous biological agents and works with the states to confirm the identity of such THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 139 agents in the event of a potential attack. Existing and new funding will help improve and update these laboratories. HHS trains and maintains federal public health emergency response teams tobe rapidly deployed in the first stages of a bioterrorist incident. HRSA works with states and the nation's hospitals to ensure their preparedness on a regional basis. Secretary Thompson and New Y ork State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello speak with rescue workers on September13, 2001, at the site of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.HHS also maintains the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile, which is increasingits capacity to cover over 20 million individualsduring 2002. To ensure that medicines andsupplies can be quickly delivered to the site of an emergency, HHS is acquiring a national supply of antibiotics and smallpox vaccine, andis working to develop and approve innovativenew drugs and therapeutics. HHS is taking a new approach to managing and distributing funds for state and local bioterrorism preparedness. This process will ensure that public health departments,hospitals, emergency medical services, andother first responders develop integrateddetection and treatment systems to providea seamless response to potential acts of bioterrorism. The FDA works to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply. The budget supports a substantial increase in the amount of safety inspections of FDA-regulated products imported into the country.In an effort to protect public health, the FDA will conduct three times the current inspections ofimported foods to keep them from being used as a conduit for terrorism. The FDA will also improveblood screening processes to assure availability of a safe national supply of blood and related products in the event of an attack or its aftermath. These HHS efforts were brought to national attention by the speedy delivery of medical supplies to New York on September 11 th, and in the assistance provided to state and private parties involved in the subsequent anthrax attacks. The threat of bioterrorism is now a reality, and the budget includesresources to respond at HHS and across the government. Measuring effectiveness is extremely difficult in this rapidly evolving area. So it is essential that assessments are conducted, planning procedures are established, and rigorous standards are lived up to. Under the leadership of the President, these steps will be taken at all levels of government. A Citizen-Centered HHS: Streamlining Bureaucracy A key objective of the President's Management Agenda is a more responsive, more \"citizen-centered\" federal government. In few federal agencies is the need for organizational reform more acute than at HHS, where a long history of decentralized decision-making has produced aDepartment with 13 operating divisions functioning with relative autonomy. As a result, a complexweb of ever-proliferating offices has distanced HHS from the citizens it serves, and has produceda patchwork of uncoordinated and duplicative management practices that hinder its efforts toaccomplish its mission efficiently.140 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES This Administration is committed to solving this problem through Secretary Thompson's One Department initiative, which will eliminate unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and consolidateduplicative functions into unified offices. Streamlining efforts in 2003 will focus on HHS' human resources, public affairs, legislative affairs, and building and facilities management functions. Talent Agencies Currently, the Department does not leverage itself with respect to bringing on new talent by combining the resources of all of its agencies. The most recent example occurred at a recruiting fair in Puerto Rico the Program Support Center attended\u2014along with several other HHS agencies, all with different booths and HR personnel, and all looking and appearing as separate government entities. The costs [were] all being borne individually by the different agencies. HHS Workforce Analysis June 2001Human Resources. HHS today has 40 different human resources offices, all of which conduct independent\u2014and oftencompeting\u2014recruitment, hiring, and trainingactivities. In 2003, that number will be cut tofour, as HHS consolidates personnel mattersinto offices in Baltimore, Rockville, and Bethesda, Maryland, and Atlanta, Georgia. Public Affairs and Legislative Affairs. Currently, HHS has more than 50 publicaffairs offices and more than 20 legislativeaffairs offices. Spread throughout 13operating divisions and dozens of bureaus, these offices deliver separate\u2014and sometimes conflicting\u2014messages. In 2003, this structure will be streamlined to create one office for public affairs and one centralized legislative affairs office. Which Of These Projects Would You Fund? NIH Parking Facility: NIH is planning to construct a new $14 million on-site parking facility toaccommodate its employees, visitors, and patients.Since 1996, over 1,500 parking spaces have been lost because of new construc tion projects, including the Clinical Research Center and the East Child CareCenter. Indian Health Service Sanitation Facilities: Investment in sanitation facilities projects has contributed toimprovements in American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) health status. However AI/AN homes are still seven times more likely to be without clean water thanall other U.S. homes. One of IHS' most importantmissions is to construct sanitation facilities for AI/ANhomes. IHS has identified a backlog of $1.8 billion insanitation construc tion projects but, within the overall IHS budget, is able to fund only two percent annually.Buildings and Facilities Management . HHS agencies seek to make certain thenation's biomedical research and healthcare services are conducted in safe labsand hospitals. In the past, NIH, CDC, and HRSA each administered their own building maintenance and construction projects. HHS' performance in building construction can be improved. One challenge facingthe federal government's main socialservice agency is uneven project planning and oversight. HHS does not have a department-wide performance measure thatarticulates national priorities for health carefacilities. As a result, construction projectsoften get selected for reasons other thanmerit, including congressional earmarks. The P r e s i d e n t ' sB u d g e ta d d r e s s e st h i sc h a l l e n g e by: 1) concentrating leadership, programmaticexpertise, and project oversight in the HHSOffice of the Secretary; 2) instituting acomprehensive framework that prioritizes all capital projects across HHS; and 3) implementing adepartment-wide measure linked to program outcomes.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 141 The budget consolidates facilities construction and maintenance activities for NIH, CDC, and HRSA in the Office of the Secretary so that HHS can manage buildings competitively across theDepartment. In 2004, FDA and IHS will be included in this consolidation. This consolidation will give HHS tremendous flexibility in allocating funding to the highest priority projects and is fully in line with the Secretary's vision for a unified HHS. Promoting the President's Initiatives The paramount goal is compassionate results, and private and charitable groups, including religious ones, should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes, like curbing crime, conquering addiction, strengthening families and overcoming poverty. President George W. Bush January 29, 2001 Faith-Based and Community Initiative On January 29, 2001, the President announced the Faith-Based and Community Initiative and, at the same time, created a White House office dedicated to this issue along with parallel offices at five key Departments: HHS, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Education. This initiative aims to enrich social services by drawing on the strengths of religious and communitygroups. These organizations have long played a critical role in furnishing their own aid, but havebeen unfairly or unwisely excluded from playing a more direct role in delivering federally supportedservices. The initiative expands the access of community and faith-based organizations on a non-discriminatory basis to existing federally funded programs. Last summer, the White House Office on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and the five departmental centers reviewed artificial regulatory or administrative barriers to full participationby faith-based organizations. The results were published in the August 2001 report, Unlevel Playing Field: Barriers to Participation by Faith-Based and Community Organizations in Federal SocialService Programs. The report found that many of the barriers to fuller participation were needlessly burdensome administrative creations. The Faith-Based and Community Initiative's part of the President's Management Agenda will measure the progress of the five Departments in removingthese barriers. In addition, the budget funds the following four competitive grant programs,targeted at faith- and community-based organizations that can provide innovative services at thegrassroots level. Compassion Capital Fund: To build on the efforts of community-based, charitable organizations, the budget provides $100 million to help small charities increase their capacity to deliv er services and grants by financing the start-up costs of charitable organizations.142 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Unlevel Playing Field \u007fA funding gap exists between the government and the grassroots. Smaller groups,faith-based and secular, receive little federalsupport relative to the size and scope of services they provide. \u007fA widespread bias against faith- and community-based organizations in federal social service programs exists. \u007fThere are some legislative restrictions, but many of the restrictive regulations are needlessly burdensome administrative creations. \u007fCharitable Choice legislation has been almost entirely ignored by federal administrators who have done little to help or require state andlocal governments to comply with new rulesfor faith-based service providers. Unlevel Playing Field: Barriers to Participation by Faith-Based and Community Organizations in Federal Social Service Programs White House, August 2001Mentoring Children of Prisoners: The President recognizes that, as a group, themore than two million children with parentsin prison have more behavioral, health, andeducational problems than the population at large. Mentoring by caring adults serving as positive role models can brighten the outlookfor these children. Therefore, the budgetincludes $25 million for competitive grantsto faith and community-based groups forprograms providing mentors to children of prisoners. Promoting Responsible Fatherhood: Over 25 million children live in homes withoutfathers. To assist non-custodial fathers tobecome more involved in their children's lives,the budget provides $20 million in competitive grants to faith-based and community organizations. Maternity Group Homes: The Administration also increases supportto community-based maternity group homesby providing young, pregnant, and parenting women with access to community-based coordinated services such as childcare,education, job training, and counseling. The budget includes $10 million in competitive grants tomeet the needs of these women and their children. Partnering with Faith-based and Community Organizations The San Antonio Weed & Seed Coalition consists of 120 community, neighborhood, and law enforcement organizations whose mission is to reduce drug-related crime and victimization. The coalition has helped toreduce crime in San Antonio by 43.5 percent from1992-2000. One of the coalition partners, LoveDemonstrated Ministries (LDMI), is a faith-basedorganization which focuses on youth offenders, gang members, and high risk youth. Over the past three years, 135 of 165 young offenders entering its LifeSkills and Parenting Camp have gr aduated from LDMI, a success rate of 82 percent.Charitable Tax Provisions: The Administration favors a charitable deductionfor taxpayers who don't itemize theirdeductions on their tax returns of up to $100 for singles and $200 for joint returns in 2002, increasing in stages to $500 for singles and$1,000 for joint returns in 2012. This proposalwould also permit tax-free distributions fromIRAs for charitable contributions, increase thepercentage limitation on corporate charitable contributions, and make several changes related to trusts and foundations. The effecton federal receipts would be $2 billion in 2003,and $41 billion for 2003-2012. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs): The Administration also supports the establishment of additional IDAs, a savings vehicle designed to encourage assets development andTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 143 help participants enter the financial mainstream. Program participants can withdraw accrued savings, matched contributions, and investment earnings for qualified expenses, such as highereducation, homeownership, and business start-up. The IDA initiative creates a tax credit available to financial institutions to generate matching contributions to participants' savings accounts. A 100 percent IDA tax credit would allow a bank toreduce its federal tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis for matching participant savings up to $500per year. For example, if a participant deposits $500 into an IDA account, the bank would matchthis amount and claim a $500 tax credit on their federal tax return. This initiative will create up to900,000 accounts over the next six years. The National Institutes of Health Research is the lifeblood of NIH work.Begun in 1887 as a one-room laboratory within the Marine Hospital Service, theNational Institutes of Health has become the world's leading research institution for biomedical and behavioral research. NIH nowsupports more than 50,000 scientists workingin 2,000 institutions across the United States.These scientists, with the help of federal grantsupport, have been making great advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. As we look to the future, medicalscience stands at the threshold of profoundresearch advances that were unthinkable adecade ago. Researchers are identifying thegenes responsible for the abnormalities that cause many diseases. What researchers learn could help bring us closer to a cure for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cardiovascular disease, AIDS, diabetes, and other diseases. During the presidential campaign, the President promised to double the budget of NIH by 2003 to $27.2 billion, from the 1998 level of $13.6 billion. The Administration is committed to fulfillingthat promise. The budget includes the final installment of $3.9 billion over 2002 needed to achievedoubling. With this increase, NIH will further its efforts to support research on diseases affecting the lives of Americans. 2003 Budget Completes Doubling of the NIH Budget (Discretionary budget authority in million of dollars) 1998 NIH Budget ............................................................................................................................... ............ 13,622 2003 NIH Budget\u2014Doubles 1998 Funding Level ..................................................................................... 27,244 Adjustments for Accrual of Employee Pension and Annuitant Health Benefits .................................... +91 2003 NIH Budget with Accrual Adjustments ............................................................................................. 27,335144 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES This NIH funding increase will also finance important research needed for the war against terrorism. Over its history, NIH has been an important contributor to the nation's wartime efforts.During World War II, NIH was instrumental in developing the oxygen mask to prevent pilots from blacking out at high altitudes. Now, as the country faces new bioterrorism threats, NIH is prepared to research the effects of bioterrorism and develop treatments in the event of attack. The budgetincludes $1.8 billion for bioterrorism research, including development of an improved anthraxvaccine, and laboratory and research facilities construction and upgrades related to bioterrorism. Public/Private Partnership: A Major Step to an HIV Vaccine The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the National Institutes of Health, has entered into an agreement with Merck & Co. to collaborate on human testing of promisingHIV vaccines developed by the company. Underthe agreement, the vaccines will be evaluated incollaboration with NIAID's International HIV VaccineTrials Network (HVTN). To date, 30 potential HIV vaccines have been evaluated in NIAID-supported clinical trials. With an estimated 5 million new HIVinfections worldwide this year\u2014about 14,000 eachday\u2014developing a vaccine against HIV is a topbiomedical research priority. In the U.S., collaborationbetween the biomedical, pharmaceutical, medical, and public health communities have contributed to the steep decline in HIV/AIDS deaths and HIV/AIDSacquired through childbirth. By combining thelaboratory strengths of NIAID's HVTN with Merck,rapid progress in evaluating the safety, immuneresponse, and effectiveness of these vaccines is expected.While the nation fights the war against terrorism, it also continues to fight the waron cancer. Each day more that 1,500 peoplein the United States die from this disease;the annual death toll from cancer exceeds fatalities from all wars fought by the United States in the last century. Thirty years ago,when the war on cancer was declared, manyscientists believed that cancer was one diseasethat would have a single cure. Recent researchindicates that cancer is actually hundreds of diseases, all of which require different treatment regimens. Promising research isleading to breakthroughs in treating variousforms of cancer. The budget includes a $5.5billion investment in cancer research at theNational Cancer Institute and other NIH Institutes. The President recognizes research will advance the health and well being ofAmericans and those living beyond ourborders. The budget continues to invest in theGlobal Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis by allocating $100 million of NIH funds for this effort. NIH is composed of 25 institutes and centers with an overall mission to sponsor and conduct biomedical research and training that leads to better health for all Americans. While the NIHconducts research in its own laboratories, the vast majority of its funding supports researchersthrough grants to them and to their universities, hospitals, and research institutions. Panels of scientists review grant requests and then fund them for their scientific merit. New knowledge often leads to the development of medical advances to treat and cure diseases. The budget expandsscientific discovery by increasing the number of research grants funded. In 2003, NIH will support35,920 grants, an increase of more than 8,800 from those underwritten in 1998.

Doctor helping patient at a Community Health Center.The budget builds on the 2002 Community Health Centers Presidential Initiative toincrease and expand the number of health center sites by 1,200 in order to serve another 6.1 million patients by 2006. This expansioncomplements the President's proposals toincrease health insurance coverage in privateand public insurance programs, to helpensure that all Americans have access to health care. The professional care provided at health centers reduces hospitalizations andemergency room use and helps prevent moreexpensive chronic disease and disability. Forexample, while health center patients typicallyhave high blood pressure rates far exceeding that of comparable racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, they are more t han three times as likely to report that their blood pressure is under control compared to non-health center patients. Increasing and Expanding Community Health Care SitesNew Community Health Care Sites Since 2001 2001 ............................................. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES National Health Service Corps Community Health Centers often work with the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), the goal of which is to provide safety net support for the uninsured and underserved by directing health care professionals into medically underserved areas. The NHSC funds scholarships and loan repayments for health professionals who serve for a minimum of two years in areas suffering shortages of healthprofessionals. The 2002 President's Budget launched a management reform initiative to place NHSC clinicians in the neediest, underserved areas. This management reform initiative better defines areas of thecountry that have a shortage of health professionals. The budget increases funding for the NHSC and its sister program, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program, so that more health care providers will practice in underserved areas. Promoting Abstinence Teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock sexual activity remain a major problem. In 1999, half of all high school students engaged in sexual activity, including eight percent before age 13. To ensure that more children receive the message that abstinence is the best option for avoiding unintendedpregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, the budget makes a substantial investment inabstinence education. The budget's more targeted performance measures also will evaluateabstinence education's effectiveness.

Yet many people go untreated. The Administration is committed to narrowing the drug treatment gap. According to a national survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration (SAMHSA), an estimated129,000 people report that they were unable to obtain treatment for a drug problem, despite making an effort to get treatment. In the 2003Budget, SAMHSA will support an estimated52,000 additional drug abuse treatment slotsto help narrow the treatment gap.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 147 Narrowing the Treatment Gap Changes Lives William Cope Moyers began experimenting with marijuana and alcohol as a teenager in the quietsuburbs of Long Island, New York. By the time hewas 30 he was addicted to hard drugs and living in a crack house in Harlem. After his third treatment, Moyers succeeded in overcoming his addiction. Today I hold a job and pay taxes, own a home, raise a family, and vote all because I got help in overcoming the ravages of my addiction to alcohol and drugs. I am living proof that comprehensive treatment works and pays great dividends to all of society. William Cope Moyers, Hazelden Foundation, Saint Paul, MinnesotaTo capture the quarter-million people who recognize they are in need of treatment butare not seeking help, SAMHSA will workto improve linkages among drug treatmentand mental health, healthcare, and criminaljustice systems. SAMHSA will use newly available data on the drug treatment gap, by state, to guide grants and other assistance. Enhancing Public Health The 2003 Budget will make other targeted investments in public health improvement. The Administration will invest in patientsafety and health care quality improvement,eliminating costly medical errors andencouraging more effective use of up-to-date methods of treatment. HHS will also increase FDA food safety inspections of high risk and imported foods. Finally, HHS will initiate innovative community grants to prevent and treat diabetes, asthma, and obesity. Taking the Next Step in Reforming Welfare The Administration's Welfare Reform Reauthorization Agenda The budget includes a proposal that pursues the following three goals: \u007fContinue Moving People to Self-Sufficiency. The budget retains the approach of the 1996 legislation, which helped millions of people move from welfare dependence toward self-sufficiency. It builds upon this success by strengthening the work components while simplifying program administration. \u007fStrengthen the Goals of Work and Independence. The budget strengthens the requirements to work while providing more support to low-income workers. The proposal phases in stronger workparticipation requirements in Temporary Assistance for Needy Fam ilies. In the Food Stamp program, low-income workers would be able to own reliable transportation for getting to work. More formerwelfare recipients would receive the full child support payment. \u007fSimplify Program Administration. Complex program rules are administratively burdensome for both agencies and recipients. The budget would simplify complicated Food Stamp rules, and simplify thecalculation of child support payments for families who have left welfare. Additional Food Stamp provisions are described in the Department of Agriculture chapter.148 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Welfare Reform Reauthorization Aug 96 Jan 97 Jan 98 Jan 99 Jan 00 June 0102468101214 Families RecipientsNumber of People Receiving Welfare Has Dropped Dramatically In millions 56% Reduction in TANF Recipients 53% Reduction in TANF Families Source: Administration for Children and Families.In 1996, the Congress passed legislation to create the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children andrelated welfare programs. TANF is a $16.7billion a year block grant with bonuses forhigh performance and reduced nonmaritalbirths. States were given significant flexibility in designing the eligibility criteria and benefit rules for their TANF programs, which requireand reward work in exchange for time-limitedbenefits. TANF is probably the most successful federally funded domestic program in decades. Nationally, the TANF caseload (number of cash recipients) has declined 56 percent sincethe program's inception, while the percentage of welfare recipients working has increased threefold.Due to state flexibility, an increasing portion of welfare dollars is now spent on services to helpindividuals retain and advance in their jobs. Building on its success, the Administration proposes to reauthorize TANF. Specifically, it maintains block grant funding, provides for supplemental grants to address historical disparities in welfare spending among states, strengthens work participation requirements, retains statemaintenance of effort requirements, and continues a system of high-performance bonuses. Inaddition, the budget proposes to reauthorize a modified contingency fund to assist states in timesof severe economic downturns. Also as part of welfare reform reauthorization, the Administrationwill work across agencies to identify opportunities to better coordinate programs, simplify administration and support work. The budget eliminates the current illegitimacy reduction bonus as there is no evidence that it encouraged states to develop initiatives to reduce out-of-wedlock births. The Administration iscommitted to encouraging the development of effective programs to reduce out-of-wedlock birthsand to promote family formation. The budget redirects the funds through a combination of grants,research, and technical assistance to develop a more effective approach to achieving this goal. Reviewing the way child welfare services are structured and financed: Often criticized as complex and inflexible, the Administration will review federal child welfare programs to ensurean appropriate balance between flexibility and accountability that promotes the best outcomes forvulnerable children and families. In the year ahead, the Administration will have discussions withinterested parties about this issue. Child Support Enforcement : To benefit families who once received welfare, the budget allows states the option to provide them with the full amount of child support collected on their behalf. For current welfare recipients, the budget includes, also as a state option, federal matching for statesto provide up to $100 per month in child support collections to the family. These policies are offsetby proposals that strengthen child support collection tools, collect a $25 user fee from non-TANFTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 149 families that benefit from the child support enforcement program, and require states to review child support orders more frequently. Child Support Enforcement Successes Sometimes the true value of automation gets forgotten amid its speed and efficiency. In the Child Support Enforcement Program, federal automation projects have revolutionized local governments' whole way of doing business. In Pennsylvania, for example, \"Sylvia\" and her 13-year-old daughter received welfare. Unfortunately, a wage attachment couldn't be used to collect child support from the noncustodi al father, because he was self-employed. He neither paid child support regularly nor in full. Over time, because of his sporadic payments,outstanding child support payments grew to $9,000. The father made payments of $2 a week toward the backsupport, telling the judge that was the best he could do. But with the advent of the Financial Institution DataMatch (FIDM) program, the county child support agency located about $9,000 of his assets and seized them to pay off the entire amount of back support owed. In another Pennsylvania case, the National Directory of New Hires was used to identify the new employment of an absent parent who had not paid any support since 1983. The parent skipped out on his new employmentimmediately, but the employer gave the local child support agency his forwarding address. Now, he pays$100 in support every two weeks. Promoting Safe and Stable Families To strengthen states' ability to promote child safety, permanency, and well-being, the budget would increase funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $505 million, $130 million over the 2002 level. These additional resources will help children remain with or return to theirbiological families if safe and appropriate, or to place children with adoptive families. Education Assistance for Older Foster Children The budget includes $60 million in the Independent Living program to help older foster youth transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency after leaving foster care. Approximately 16,000 youngpeople leave foster care each year. This initiative would provide vouchers of up to $5,000 for educationor vocational training to help youth aging out of foster care develop the skills to lead independentand productive lives. Providing Health Care to Disabled, Elderly, and Low-Income Citizens Through the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs, the federal government spends over $400 billion to increase access to high quality health care for nearly 80 million disabled, elderly,and low-income individuals. These programs face serious challenges, however, in furnishingaffordable, efficient, and up-to-date benefits for these vulnerable groups. Through the budget, the Administration proposes to improve these programs so that they give beneficiaries t he care they need today, and continue to do so tomorrow.150 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The Administration proposes to increase beneficiary access to prescription medicines.Medicare Medicare will spend over $230 billion in 2003 on about 40 million senior and disabled citizens. Medicare was established in 1965 to address a serious national problem in health care: the elderly,especially those with limited incomes or costly healthneeds, often could not afford to buy health insurance.The program was later expanded to address similarlysituated people with disabilities. Medicare thus improved access to quality health care. However, while the private health insurance market has madedramatic strides to update coverage and improvehealth outcomes over the last 40 years, Medicare haslagged behind. The program's outdated benefit package does not cover prescription drugs, provide consistent coverage for many preventive treatments, support coordinatedmanagement of chronic diseases, or, for that matter,protect beneficiaries against the high cost of treating serious illnesses. Moreover, Medicare is not financially secure for the retirement of the Baby Boomgeneration. The Administration is committed to modernizing Medicare and addressing its financial security. In July 2001, the President announced the following framework: The President's Principles for Strengthening Medicare \u007fAll seniors should have the option of a subsidized prescription drug benefit as part of modernized Medicare. \u007fModernized Medicare should provide better coverage for preventive care and serious illnesses. \u007fToday's beneficiaries and those approaching retirement should have the option of keeping thetraditional plan with no changes. \u007fMedicare should make available better health insurance options, like those available to all federalemployees. \u007fMedicare legislation should strengthen the program's long-term financial security. \u007fThe management of the government Medicare plan should be strengthened to improve care for seniors. \u007fMedicare's regulations and administrative procedures should be updated and streamlined, while theinstances of fraud and abuse should be reduced. \u007fMedicare should encourage high-quality health care for all seniors. While nearly three-quarters of beneficiaries had prescription drug coverage in 1998, just over 10 million had no drug coverage at all. About one-half, or 5 million of these beneficiaries, had incomesbelow 175 percent of the poverty level\u2014roughly $19,000 for a family of two. Two million of thesebeneficiaries had incomes below the poverty level. Many of these beneficiaries do not qualify forMedicaid\u2014which provides prescription drug coverage to low-income beneficiaries\u2014because their incomes or asse ts are too high. Yet, their incomes are not high enough for them to afford to purchase drug coverage on their own.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 151 Medicare's most pressing challenge is the lack of coverage for prescription drugs. ...Frank Van der Linden was a newspaper reporter, and a good one. Now he's being squeezed behind Medicare premiums and drug costs. Or Bob Cherry, he's a senior coordinator at the Florida Avenue Baptist Church, right here in Washington. He pays close to 40 percent of his income for prescription drugs and Medicare co-payments. Or Gwendolyn Black, who spends $2,400 a year to put four healing drops a day into each of her eyes. President George W. Bush July 2001A prescription drug benefit is part of the President's framework for strengthening Medicare, but this will take time. So, theAdministration is taking steps now to assistbeneficiaries with the greatest need. This year,HHS seeks to implement a Medicare-endorsedprescription drug card to give beneficiaries immediate access to drug discounts and other valuable pharmacy services. Medicare willendorse prescription drug cards that meethigh standards for managing pharmacyservices and providing discounts, and will giveseniors the information they need to find the card that offers the best services and discounts for their needs. Medicare beneficiaries will be able to select one card that will grant them access to discounts on medicines, including rebates frommanufacturers, and assistance from their neighborhood drugstores. Through the ability of cards tomove market share, this program will give beneficiaries access to the same tools widely availableto Americans with private insurance to get discounts from manufacturers. The Medicare-endorsed prescription drug card is neither a drug benefit nor a substitute for one. But it will give both beneficiaries and the Medicare program needed experience with competitive choices for prescriptiondrug assistance so that a competitive drug benefit can be implemented more efficiently. ...[W]hen it comes to health care, 1965 is not the state of the art. We need to bring Medicare into the 21stCentury, to expand its coverage, improve its services, strengthen its financing, and give seniors more control over the health care they receive. President George W. Bush July 2001The budget builds upon the President's framework. It dedicates $190 billion over10 years for targeted improvements andcomprehensive Medicare modernization,including a subsidized prescription drugbenefit, better insurance protection, and better private options for all beneficiaries. To pave the way, the budget proposes immediatesteps to begin to improve Medicare benefits,including an infrastructure for a prescription drug benefit and incentives to expand and maintainprivate health plan options. In addition to proposing some new funding to improve Medicarebenefits, the budget also proposes new Medigap plans, a full view of Medicare solvency, and other program improvements. The budget also proposes efforts aimed at addressing Medicare's financial status, such as ensuring that Medicare payments are efficient and appropriate. Providing Access to Prescription Drug Coverage. While drugs were not a standard part of health insurance coverage at Medicare's creation, today they are integral to modern medicine. Not onlydo they relieve pain and speed recovery, they may reduce health care costs by avoiding more costlytreatments, hospitalizations, and complications. With few exceptions, however, Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs. Thus, many beneficiaries must get prescription drug coverage from other sources or pay out of pocket for medicine.In 1998, 73 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had some form of supplemental insurance with a drugbenefit for at least part of the year.152 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The Administration also proposes to begin to phase in comprehensive drug coverage for lower-income Medicare beneficiaries up to 150 percent of poverty, as envisioned in all majorprescription drug proposals. This proposal would allow states to expand drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries up to 100 percent of poverty\u2014about $12,000 for a family of two\u2014at current Medicaid matching rates, much like existing programs that subsidize Medicare premiums and cost-sharingfor low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Further, as an added incentive for states to expand coverageup to 150 percent of poverty\u2014about $17,000 for a family of two\u2014the federal government would pay90 percent of the states' costs of expansion above 100 percent of the poverty level with states beingresponsible for the remaining 10 percent. This policy eventually would expand drug coverage for up to 3 million beneficiaries currently without prescription drug assistance.

Prescription Drug Waivers. Medicaid is the source of drug coverage for approximately four million Medicare beneficiaries, those whose incomes are low enough for them to be eligible for both programs.A number of states would like to use the Medicaid program to extend drug-only coverage to seniorcitizens and individuals with disabilities, who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. States are also concerned about rising drug costs in Medicaid. Net of manufacturer rebates, prescription drug spending in Medicaid is expected to reach $26 billion ($15 billion federal share) inTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 153 2003 and to grow to almost $62 billion ($36 billion federal share) by 2012. States have been exploring common private-sector cost-control mechanisms like preferred drug lists and prior authorizationto moderate drug spending, but Medicaid law and federal regulations make using these types of management tools more difficult. The Administration will develop model drug waivers to allow states to both reduce drug expenditures and expand drug-only coverage to more Medicare beneficiaries. States wouldhave the flexibility to use competitive approaches to provide drug benefits, including throughMedicare-endorsed drug cards. These changes are a part of the Administration's overall strategy toprovide Medicare recipients with access to prescription drugs and to take steps toward a universal, competitive Medicare drug benefit as envisioned in drug benefit proposals sponsored by members of Congress from both parties. Because several states have already expressed interest, waiverswill increase significantly the number of Medicare beneficiaries with access to prescription drugcoverage before a universal benefit can be fully implemented. Sustaining and Enhancing Medicare+Choice. The absence of prescription drug coverage is not the only serious gap in the Medicare benefit package: beneficiaries who obtain coverage through Medicare+Choice do not feel secure that this benefit will continue to be available. Established in 1997, Medicare+Choice was intended to offer beneficiaries comprehensive private plan optionsfor their health insurance coverage\u2014and those private health plans that still participate inMedicare+Choice do just that. Such plans offer additional benefits, such as prescription drugcoverage, vision and dental care, and usually at a price well below that of a comparable supplementalpolicy. However, the program faces significant challenges that threaten beneficiary choice. Few new types of plans, such as preferred provider organizations, have entered Medicare+Choice, and many have withdrawn. Plans Exiting Medicare+Choice, 2000-2002 2000 2001 2002 Contract Terminations ..... 41 65 22 Affected Enrollees ........... 327,000 934,000 536,000 As plans exit, hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries must switch to a different Medicare+Choice plan or return to Medicare's Fee-For-Service program, which is usually more expensive for them. Asa result, enrollment in Medicare+Choice has fallen dramatically. The most important reason that private plans are withdrawing from Medicare, even as they continue to provide reliable and up- to-date coverage for other Americans, is that federal payments to Medicare+Choice have not kept pace with rising health care costs in many areas of the country. The pricing system that controls payments to Medicare+Choice plans has artificially held downpayment increases to plans as health care costs have steadily risen. So, plans find it increasinglydifficult to continue to provide beneficiaries with additional benefits and choices.154 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001-10010203040 Percent of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled Percent growth in enrollmentBeneficiary Enrollment in Medicare+Choice Drops Percent Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Data represent Section 1876 Risk Plan enrollment through 1998, then Medicare+Choice enrollment from 1999.Preserving choice for Medicare's beneficiaries requires fixingMedicare+Choice's payment system so that existing plans remain in the program and new plans are encouraged tojoin. The budget proposes reforming thecurrent payment system, which is failingMedicare beneficiaries. This includestying plan payments to the health care cost increases plans are actually experiencing. It also includes adjusting payments tobetter reflect beneficiaries' health status.In addition, the budget gives managedcare plans more flexibility in designingtheir plans and proposes bonus payments for new types of private plans that enter Medicare+Choice. The bonuses will encourage new managed care plans, such as PPOs, toenter Medicare+Choice, and will increase enrollment up to 400,000 people by 2007\u2014more thanseven percent of Medicare+Choice enrollment. Modernizing Medigap. Medicare does not sufficiently protect beneficiaries against the high cost of medical care, particularly catastrophic medical expenses. Sicker beneficiaries generally pay a greater share of their health care costs. So, in contrast to private plans which might charge only $100 per admission, Medicare charges beneficiaries over $800 for each hospital stay. Then, there are theadded deductibles and co-payments patients must absorb for physician and outpatient visits. In fact,on average, Medicare beneficiaries spend nearly $3,000 a year out-of-pocket for medical expenses. Due to Medicare's benefit limits, more than 85 percent of beneficiaries in traditional Medicare enroll in a plan to supplement its coverage gaps. Some beneficiaries receive supplemental coverage through Medicaid or an employer, but more than one-quarter purchase Medigap coverage that typically has higher premiums. Medigap plans are antiquated and poorly tailored to meet the health care needs of today. Unlike many private plans, they provide coverage for up-front deductibles, but offer only very limitedprescription drug coverage. This first-dollar coverage drives up Medicare costs and beneficiarypremiums. Premiums for plans that do not offer drugs have increased by 25 percent to 45 percent over the past three years, and premiums for plans with drugs have increased at an even greater rate. As we move toward more comprehensive Medicare modernization, the 2003 Budget proposes to add two Medigap plans to the existing 10. These plans improve upon the existing ones by offeringprescription drug coverage, protecting beneficiaries against catastrophic illness, and includingnominal beneficiary cost sharing at a lower premium cost than the most popular Medigap planstoday. AF u l lV i e wo fM e d i c a r e ' sS o l v e n c y . The Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, which provides hospital insurance to seniors, will collect $189 billion through payroll taxes and spend $150billion on benefits in 2003, yielding a $39 billion surplus. Medicare's trust fund for the other halfof the program, the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, is financed mainly fromgeneral revenue transfers and premiums. Currently, the best known measure of Medicare solvencyconsiders only the HI Trust Fund.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 155 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 207000.51.01.52.02.53.0Medicare Outlays Exceed Dedicated Tax Receipts and Premiums In 2001 constant dollars, trillions Outlays Dedicated Tax Receipts and PremiumsShortfall Source: 2001 Medicare Trustees Report.Using this approach to solvency, the Medicare Trustees project that HI expenseswill exceed new revenues (excluding interest income) by 2016, and the HI Trust Fund will head rapidly toward insolvency by 2029. H o w e v e r , t h e r ei sn oc o m p r e h e n s i v e solvency measure accounting for the financesof both trust funds. This current view ofsolvency only tells half the story. The SMI program also is also running a large shortfall, since premiums collected from beneficiariescover only about 25 percent of program costs.A comprehensive analysis of both trust fundsreveals that the program is actually running ashortfall of $553 billion over the next 10 years, not a surplus. The singular focus on HI solvency underestimates the magnitude of Medicare's financial problem. The Medicare Trustees acknowledged this disconnect in their 2001 Trustees reportwhen they stated, \"Although this report focuses on the financial status of the HI Trust Fund, it isimportant to recognize the financial challenges facing the Medicare program as a whole and theneed for integrated solutions.\" Thus, the budget proposes new comprehensive measures of solvency accounting for both the HI and SMI Trust Funds. This larger view of Medicare's finances facilitates more careful planning forthe future.

Under this measure of solvency, the HI T rust Fund has a deficit equal to 1.97 percent of taxable payroll, or $4.7 trillion, over the next 75 years. This measure ofsolvency does not address the fact that the SMI Trust Fund is also running a shortfall, and the SMI Trust Fund will remainsolvent only because of a growing infusion of general revenue funds. Thus, this measure does not provide a complete picture ofMedicare's overall budgetary impact. The Administration is proposing additional measures of solvency that provide a more comprehensive view of the program's financial status by looking at both the HI and SMI T rust Funds. This measure of solvency acknowledges that SMI actually has a deficit equal to 3.37 percent of taxable payroll over the next 75 years. In combination,both trust funds have a deficit equal to 5.33 percent of taxable payroll, or $12.9 trillion, over the next 75 years.156 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Additional Medicare Improvements: \u007fMedicare pays too much for medical equipment such as hospital beds and oxygen as well as for prosthetics and orthotics. The budget proposes a nationwide competitive bidding system for this equipment to encourage suppliers to provide quality services and supplies at lower prices than what Medicare currently pays. \u007fThe Administration recognizes that Medicare's extremely complex provider payment systems, based on regulated prices, do not always function smoothly and equitably over time. For example, while the system Medicare uses to pay physicians has been working as intended,recent short-term adjustments have been large. At the same time, provisions that have helddown growth of other payment systems toward historical growth rates are set to expire. TheAdministration is willing to work with the Congress to smooth out such payment adjustmentsthrough reforms in payment policy that, in both the short and long term, are budget neutral across provider payment updates. \u007fMedicare and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) finance health insurance for 2.1 million federal retirees and their dependents, yet the programs are neither formally coordinated nor offer insurance plans tailored to the federal retiree. The Administration will work with stakeholders to develop additional FEHBP options for retireesthat improve choice by making available a full range of private health insurance options. \u007fMedicare sometimes pays too much in health insurance claims because it mistakenly payswhen another insurer should have paid most or all of the claim. But Medicare rarely collectson these overpayments. To correct this, the budget proposes a requirement that insurers andthose sponsoring group health plans periodically report those beneficiaries for whom Medicarecould be the secondary payer. \u007fWhile Medicare pays for only a few outpatient drugs, the current Medicare paymentmechanism results in the program overpaying billions of dollars, according to the HHSInspector General, the General Accounting Office, and other witnesses who testified at recenthearings before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Congress has expressed a clear bipartisan interest in addressing this issue while ensuring providers are adequately compensated for the cost of caring for patients. The Administration this year intends toimprove the payment system for these drugs consistent with quality care. \u007fThe budget proposes to extend the subsidy of Medicare premiums for certain qualifiedindividuals. \u007fIn addition, the budget proposes to continue steps already underway to address variations in graduate medical education payments.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 157 Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001050100150200250Medicaid Spending and Enrollment Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Expenditures, State & Federal, in 1999 dollars (billions)Enrollment in person-years (millions)Medicaid. Almost 37 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid in 2001. Medicaid covers one-fourth of the nation's children and is the largest single purchaser of maternitycare and nursing home/long-term careservices. The elderly and disabled compriseone-third of Medicaid beneficiaries but accountfor two-thirds of Medicaid spending. SCHIP. SCHIP was established in 1997 to make available approximately $40 billionover 10 years for states to provide health carecoverage to low-income, uninsured children.SCHIP gives states broad flexibility inprogram design while protecting beneficiaries through federal standards. Approximately 4.6 million children were enrolled in SCHIPprograms in 2001. Both Medicaid and SCHIP rely on state and federal sharing of program expenditures, with the federal contribution based on state per capita income. The federal share of Medicaid ranges from50 percent to 77 percent, with an average match rate of 57 percent. Medicaid spending will be an estimated $280 billion ($159 billion federal share) in 2003. SCHIP matching rates vary from 65 percent to 85 percent. About $3.2 billion is available to states for SCHIP programs in addition toalmost $11 billion in unspent funds from previous years. According to HHS, more than 1 millionadditional people have gained Medicaid or SCHIP coverage since January 1, 2001. The budget proposes several initiatives for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The first set gives states greater ability to expand health insurance coverage to targeted populations, while the second set promotes fiscal integrity. Medicaid/SCHIP Reform. While there is considerable discretion under Medicaid, many states and other stakeholders have complained that the web of Medicaid laws and administrativeguidelines are confusing, burdensome, and serve to limit state flexibility. The creation of theSCHIP program added further complexity to the already intricate rules for expanding coverage tolow-income Americans. States frequently request additional flexibility through waivers to tailor their public programs to their specific insurance markets or to expand eligibility to the uninsured beyond mandatory populations. Additionally, many states have requested that the Administrationgrant the same flexibility in their Medicaid programs through waivers of Medicaid law andregulation that they have in their SCHIP programs. As a first step, the Administration introducedthe Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) demonstration initiative, which givesstates the flexibility they need to design innovative ways to increase access to health insurance coverage for the uninsured. The Administration will continue to build on the HIFA initiative by developing proposals that will give states: a) the statutory authority to provide broader coverage to low-income uninsuredAmericans; and b) the flexibility to design innovative programs without seeking waivers. States will158 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES be encouraged to use current resources to extend coverage to more of their neediest residents and reduce the number of people without health insurance coverage. Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability Demonstration Initiative In August 2001, the Administration announced the Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Demonstration Initiative. The HIFA initiative: \u007fEncourages states to develop comprehensive health insurance coverage approaches that utilize available Medicaid and SCHIP funding to address insurance coverage for individuals with incomes less than twice the official poverty level, who comprise most of the uninsured; \u007fGives states the flexibility to increase health insurance coverage through support of private group health coverage; \u007fSimplifies the waiver application process by providing clear guidance and data templates; and \u007fIncreases accountability within the state and federal partnership by ensuring that Medicaid and SCHIP funds are effectively being used to increase health insurance coverage. On December 12, 2001, the Administration approved the first HIFA waiver for Arizona. The state plans to expand health coverage to parents of children enrolled in Medicaid or KidsCare (Arizona's SCHIP program) with family incomes between 100 percent and 200 percent of poverty. Arizona expects ultimately to provide health insurance to more than 25,000 currently uninsured adults. Arizona's HIFA waiver will explore ways toimprove coordination between public and private coverage options for the uninsured using employer-sponsoredinsurance. Extending the Availability of Expiring SCHIP Funds. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made funds available for state use in a two-step process. The first allows states three years to use theirallotment. For the second step, HHS redistributes unused funds among the states. A year laterremaining funds return to the U.S. Treasury. According to current estimates, $3.2 billion in fundswill return to the Treasury at the end of 2002 and 2003.

The Administration proposes to extend the availability of these expiring funds until 2006. According to current estimates, this extension will allow every state to retain enhanced-matchfunds. This proposal will provide additional support for their current coverage levels as well asTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 159 provide additional health insurance coverage to more Americans under the Administration's HIFA initiative. Transitional Medicaid Assistance (TMA). TMA was created to provide health coverage for former welfare recipients after they entered the workforce. TMA extends up to a year of health coverage to families who lose eligibility for welfare-related Medicaid due to earnings from employment. Thisprovision will expire September 30, 2002; however, the Administration proposes a one-year extension. Program Integrity Strengthening the fiscal integrity of Medicaid while ensuring that its beneficiaries have access to care remains a top Administration health priority. The joint federal-state nature of the Medicaidprogram promotes ownership and mutual investment in its activities. The complexity of Medicaidfunding rules, however, has also made ensuring program integrity both more difficult and more vital.As program spending has grown over the years, so too have concerns that Medicaid dollars are notbeing used to provide services to eligible beneficiaries. Undermining Medicaid's Program Integrity Over the past year, HHS has been working to close a controversial Medicaid payment loophole that permits states to pay some public nursinghomes and hospitals more than the actual costsof providing medical services. Through theloophole, health facilities may be required toreturn the excess payment to the state. States then get reimbursements from Uncle Sam beyond those intended under federal Medicaid law. During 2000, one state made $76 million in excess payments to 14 public nursing homes.Of the $76 million, the nursing homes returned$66 million to the state treasury and the state was able to use the money for non-Medicaid purposes. Now facing a budget crisis, the statein question seeks to expand this program toobtain more than $250 million from the federalgovernment to match additional payments madeto nursing homes and subsequently returned to the state for non-Medicaid purposes. The HHS Inspector General stated in September 2001, that unless curbed, this financing loopholethreatens the financial stability of the Medicaidprogram.Upper Payment Limits. The Administration proposes to build on past efforts to curb the costly Medicaid Upper Payment Limit (UPL) loopholeby strengthening the management andenforcement of federal payment policies. School-Based Health Services. Medicaid is authorized to pay for health services provided to Medicaid-eligible children pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act(IDEA). In past years, billing inconsistencieshave plagued the program because the federalgovernment has never articulated clearguidance. In 2002, the Administration will release guides that will address all aspects of school-based Medicaid billing. After issuing the guides, the Administration will address problematic areaswithin school-based health services. Often,school districts are not familiar with the Medicaid program and they do not have the administrative capacity to properly submitclaims to the government. As a result, schoolshire private consulting firms to assist them,paying them on a contingency fee basis fortheir services.160 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES School-based Claims in Medicaid Medicaid is authorized to reimburse schools for medical services including physical, occupational and recreational therapies as well as related administrative costs and transportation costs for many children enrolled in special education. Many school districts do not have the administrative capacity to submit Medicaid claims. As a result, school districts have come to rely on national consulting firms that help themclaim Medicaid funds from the federal government. In some cases where schools pay firms on a contingency fee basis, federal investigators have found evidence that consulting firms have advised school districts to overcharge the Medicaid program. Acontingency fee is a form of payment in which a consulting firm retains a percentage of the federal Medicaid claim reimbursement. The General Accounting Office and the HHS Inspector General have found that Medicaid costs can be unsubstantiated and, in some cases, unallowable under consultants' guidance when a contingency fee is involved. Ultimately, contingency fees divert money from school districts and create a financial incentive for consulting firms to submit questionable claims. This practice undermines the integrity of the Medicaidprogram and its ability to provide health care to Medicaid children. Evidence from the General Accounting Office suggests that consulting firms incorrectly profit from Medicaid overpayments. The Administration believes that these practices should stop and isproposing a regulation to ban contingency fees in the area of school-based health services and willtake strong action to end abuses. Improving Medicaid Drug Payment Integrity. The drug rebate is currently one of the primary cost-control mechanisms in Medicaid. The rebate, which is the greater of the difference betweena drug manufacturer's best price and its Average Manufacturer's Price (AMP) or a percentagespecified in statute, has not changed substantially since its inception in 1990. The Administrationproposes to improve the drug rebate system and more explicitly link state payment to pharmacieswith the manufacturer rebates. The HHS Inspector General estimates that the disconnect between manufacturer rebates and pharmacy reimbursement is costing the states and federal government billions of dollars. In addition, the Administration proposes to ensure that all necessary priceinformation is reported, and that states collect all rebates owed to them. States and the federalgovernment will work together to ensure that Medicaid does not pay for prescription drugs thatthird parties, like private insurers, should cover. Enhancing Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Program Integrity. HHS has realized early success in reducing Medicare payment errors, as evidenced in part by the declining Medicare error rate. Medicare's estimated error rate was 6.8 percent in 2000, roughly half of the 14 percent rate estimatedin 1996, the first year that the Inspector General conducted an audit to estimate Medicare's overallerror rate. Future successes will depend on further refinements and actions on Medicare programintegrity measures. The budget proposes developing a Medicare fraud yardstick that will measurethe magnitude of Medicare overpayments made in error and those that result from fraud. HHS has not, however, devoted the same attention to Medicaid and SCHIP. In 2003, HHS will devote more resources to Medicaid and SCHIP program integrity. To that end, the budget proposesto strengthen federal oversight of states' financial practices and Medicaid program integrity efforts.This effort will include increasing the number of audits and evaluations of state Medicaid programs,reestablishing and elevating the importance of financial management oversight at Centers forTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 161 Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and outsourcing appropriate activities to private firms. The budget proposes to allocate $10 million in Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control funding in 2003 tohelp finance this Medicaid and SCHIP program integrity initiative. Other Expansions of Health Coverage New Freedom Initiatives . On February 1, 2001, the President announced the New Freedom Initiative as part of a nationwide effort to further integrate people with disabilities into society.The President followed up on this commitment by asking federal agencies to work together to identify barriers to community living and propose solutions to eliminate them. As part of this effort, the Administration proposes a number of new initiatives, including: the Direct Service WorkerNational Demonstration, in which HHS and a limited number of states will address shortages ofcommunity service direct care workers; a 10-year demonstration allowing states to set up home- andcommunity-based alternatives for children currently receiving services in psychiatric residentialtreatment facilities; and two new national demonstrations allowing states to provide respite care services for adults, and respite care services for children with substantial disabilities. Tax Credits for Health Insurance Coverage. Federal tax laws help finance private health insurance coverage. Most notably, employer contributions for health insurance premiums are excluded fromemployees' taxable income, a tax incentive of $99 billion in 2003 and $581 billion from 2003 to 2007.In addition, starting in 2003, self-employed individuals may deduct 100 percent of what they pay forhealth insurance for themselves and their families. All current law health-related tax incentives, including other provisions, will cost an estimated $118 billion in 2003, and $692 billion from 2003 to 2007. To encourage private health insurance coverage, the budget proposes a new refundable tax credit for low- and moderate-income individuals and families who are neither covered by an employer plannor enrolled in public programs, and who may have the most difficulty finding affordable healthinsurance today. To improve the tax credit's purchasing power, the Administration also proposes a health insurance tax credit buy-in as part of the 2003 Budget. This would permit certain tax credit recipients, at state option, to purchase private insurance through private purchasing groups,state-sponsored insurance purchasing pools, and high-risk pools. Additional details about therefundable health insurance tax credit can be found in the Federal Receipts chapter of Analytical Perspectives , as well as forthcoming Treasury Department publications. The budget also includes new tax provisions to improve and permanently extend Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), a new deduction for long-term care insurance premiums that will help those with long-term care costs, and an additional personal exemption to caretakers of family members in needof long-term care services. In addition, the budget would improve flexible spending accounts (FSAs)by allowing up to $500 in unused benefits to be distributed as taxable income, rolled over into anMSA, or invested in a 401(K) or similar plan. Congressional Earmarks In 2002, the Congress earmarked funding for 690 projects in HHS, totaling $532 million. The practice of earmarking grants bypasses the competitive peer and grant review processes. Further,earmarks undermine the Department's ability to reward effective programs by diverting resourcesto unrequested, non-competitive projects. For example, in 2002, 100 percent of the $312 million162 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES appropriated for health facilities construction was earmarked by the Congress, leaving HHS with no discretion in deciding which construction projects would be funded. To eliminate the impact ofearmarks, the Administration will consolidate facilities construction and maintenance activities to be managed competitively across the Department. This consolidation will also give HHS flexibility to set priorities and allocate funding accordingly. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The accompanying table displays selected HHS programs and their ratings. Program Assessment Explanation Health Resources and ServicesAdministration(HRSA)\u2014Community Health CentersEffective CHCs are effective at providing primary health care services and increasing health care access to uninsured and underserved patientsregardless of their ability to pay.

Indian HealthService (IHS) Moderately EffectiveIHS is moderately effective at providing health care services to Native Americans, reducing health disparity, constructing new and replacement hospitals, and managing self-governance activities. Improving Performance Health Resources and Services Administration The mission of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is to ensure access to health care for all Americans in partnership with states, universities and colleges, and other entities.HRSA has identified four broad strategies to guide its diverse grant portfolio: 1) eliminate barriers tocare; 2) eliminate health disparities of minority populations; 3) assure quality of care; and 4) improve public health and health care systems. The budget reflects the Administration's commitment to ensure the efficient and effective use of resources to improve overall health and access by including funding increases to support new andexpanded health care access points for those who lack any form of health care. The budget fundsplacement of more doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals in underserved areas. Thebudget also streamlines and phases out activities that lack clear goals, have not proven to be effective, or could be accomplished through existing activities. Health Professions Training Grants. The health professions training grants, awarded to institutions and individuals, were established over 40 years ago to address the supply anddistribution of health professionals and the recruitment and retention of minorities in healthprofessions schools. However, rather than improving the supply and distribution of health providers,the program has splintered into numerous small grants that address more than 40 objectives\u2014some completely unrelated to the core intent of the training grant program . It is virtually impossible to measure the national impact of the grants and the annual multi-million dollar investment that funds them.164 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Professions Funding and Health Profession Shortage Areas 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 19990100200300400500 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000Health Profession Funding Primary Care HPSAsHealth professions funding in millions Primary care HPSAs Source: Department of Health and Human Services.Despite 40 years of funding, most of the health professions grants have not proven tobe effective because they do not accurately address current health professions problems. For example, since 1993, the number ofresidents enrolled in primary specialtieshas grown, but the demand for primary carephysicians is still acute in health professionalshortage areas. Over the last two decades, almost $7 billion has been invested in health professions training grants and during thistime the population of areas with shortagesof primary care health professionals hasincreased by 140 percent. Health professions training grants as currently administered do not provide an incentive for grant recipients to work in underserved areas. Most of those who receive federal health professions training support do not practicein underserved areas. As a result, health professions training grants effectively subsidize theeducation of students who do not help address the distribution problem. Of the roughly 20 percentwho do serve in shortage areas, there is no data on how long they actually remain. For the size ofthis investment, totaling over $375 million in 2002, more of our health professional shortage areas should be filled. In contrast, community health centers, subsidies for health insurance coverage, and other policies are more cost-effective approaches to improving access to care in underserved areas. The 2003 Budget reforms health professions grants by eliminating those that are not the most efficient way to address health care workforce problems. The budget makes investments in two keyareas: 1) increasing opportunities for minority and disadvantaged populations to enter in the healthprofessions; and 2) warding off a potential future nursing shortage. Minority enrollment in health professions programs has declined in recent years. Since 1996, the number of individuals from minority groups enrolled as first year medical students has droppedeight percent. The budget increases funding to finance scholarships for health professions studentsfrom disadvantaged backgrounds. These grants will be awarded to schools that have a successfulprogram for recruiting and maintaining students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Students whoreceive these grants must demonstrate a commitment to serve in a public or non-profit health care site after graduation. The Administration is committed to ensuring equal opportunity for minority and disadvantaged Americans in the health professions. The nation's nursing corps is aging, and, unfortunately, few young people are considering nursing careers. The total number of full-time registered nurses per capita is expected to peak around 2007and decline steadily thereafter as the largest groups of nurses retire. The situation will likely worsendue to a steady decline in nursing school enrollment and reasonable predictions of a growing demand for nursing services. The budget includes $99 million to help boost the supply of nurses by providing grants to schools of nursing to help attract and educate the next generation of American nurses.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 165 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in partnership with states and local communities, aids the nation's effort to prevent and treat mental illness and substance abuse. The budget funds the treatment of mental illness and the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. A recent evaluation of SAMHSA's Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) found that the formula grant is effective in helping states expand community mental health services,alcohol and drug treatment, and support services for homeless individuals facing a serious mentalillness. Building on this success, the budget includes additional funds for PATH to reach out to 163,000 homeless individuals to help them recover from mental illness and substance abuse, find housing, and gain meaningful employment. Administration for Children and Families The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) runs programs that seek to promote the economic and social well-being of children, youth, and families. ACF focuses particular attention on low-income children, refugees, Native Americans, and the developmentally disabled. Social Services Block Grant. The Administration funds the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) at $1.7 billion. This program provides flexible funds to states for social services for low-incomeindividuals and families. Head Start. The President has proposed to reform Head Start and return it to its original focus getting children ready to learn. The budget provides an increase of $130 million in 2003 to maintain participation and program quality. HHS and the Department of Education are forming a taskforce to assess ways to improve Head Start and lay the groundwork for its proposed transfer to theDepartment of Education as part of the program's reauthorization. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In response to Department of Energy forecasts of lower fuel costs, the budget contains $1.7 billion to help low-income households cover home heating and cooling costs. This amount includes a contingency fund of $300 million for unanticipated needs that may arise. The legislatively established formula currently used todistribute LIHEAP block grant funds to states is based on 20-year old population and winter heatingcost data. The Administration is interested in options that would make block grant allocationsmore equitable by basing the formula on current home energy expenditures paid by low-incomehouseholds. Child Care. Child care is funded through both the Child Care and Development Block Grant ($2.1 billion) and the Child Care Entitlement to States ($2.7 billion). Community Services Block Grant. The budget proposes to fund the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) at $570 million, a reduction of $80 million from the 2002 level of $650 million. TheCSBG program provides a small fraction of the budget to a largely static group of organizations. Verylittle performance data exists on the outcomes from the CSBG funding. Consequently, this reduction was used to fund other high-priority, high-performing programs.166 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Administration on Aging The budget proposes $1.3 billion for Administration on Aging (AoA) programs. The budget proposes to merge the smaller Department of Agriculture Nutrition Services Incentive Program with AoA's nutrition programs. Although funding for home and other meals programs for the elderly is now provided through both HHS and the Department of Agriculture, HHS is the lead agency andhas greater interaction with the states and service providers. This merger will improve programoversight and streamline reporting requirements. Strengthening Management [T]he biggest challenge to HHS is the relative independence of all of the operating agencies. In other words, we are our own worst enemy. HHS Program Support Center Workforce Analysis June 2001 HHS will intensify its management reform efforts substantially in order to meet the ambitious objectives of the President's Management Agenda. Because of the relative autonomy enjoyed by each of its 13 operating divisions, the Department currently finds itself with numerous different policies and practices in areas such as personnel management, information technology (IT), financialmanagement, and program performance measurement. The \"Citizen-Centered HHS\" section of this chapter (see above) describes the proliferation of duplicative personnel, public affairs, and legislative affairs functions within HHS, and outlines howthe Administration will consolidate them into more efficient and effective offices. The Department also faces serious problems in several other management areas. HHS' inadequate financial management systems failed to prevent $12.5 billion in overpayments for services in its Medicare Fee-for-Service program in 2000. In the increasingly critical area of IT management, HHS facesnumerous challenges created by an unnecessarily complicated infrastructure. The Departmentcurrently maintains seven separate networks using 10 different operating systems, and has asmany computer servers as computer professionals\u2014about 2,900 of each at last count. Talking Past Each Other Soon after his swearing in as head of HHS, Secretary Thompson experienced firsthand the Department's chaotic computing environment. He discovered that he could not send an e-mail from his desk on the sixthfloor of HHS' Washington headquarters to another office in the same building just one floor away! The incompatibility of his own computer with others in the building forced the Secretary to resort to having important papers carried from office to office rather than sent instantly with just a \"point and click.\" Thisstartling experience highlighted the need for dramatic change in HHS' inadequate, uncoordinated ITsystems. Today, the Secretary's agenda includes more rigorous control of IT investment decisions, bettercoordination of IT systems, and a more streamlined deployment of IT personnel throughout the Department. Finally, HHS has lagged in implementing bold, innovative ideas for opening federal positions that are commercial in nature to private competition. In 2003, HHS will compete some positionsthat could have been performed by the private sector long ago, such as locksmithing, plumbing,THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 167 printing, TV studio production, web design, and facility security. The Department has begun to implement reforms by drafting a workforce restructuring plan, instituting performance-basedcontracts for all senior managers, leading federal government efforts on E-government projects, consolidating financial management systems, and identifying federal positions it will open up to private competition. Still, much more remains to be done. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014HHS has not implemented the comprehensive restructuring reforms needed to create a citizen-centered department. Excessive organizational layers persist, and planningfor redeployment of managers to the front lines is incomplete. Workforce restructuring plansreflect a decentralized Department in which few operating divisions consider coordinating reform efforts. In 2003, HHS will consolidate 40 personnel offices into four, and more than 70 public affairs and legislative affairs offices into single offices for each function. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014Though HHS has identified 1,621 positions that may be put up for competition, it has not yet met the President's goal to conduct public-private competitionsfor 15 percent of its commercial positions by 2003. HHS will implement a competition planthat meets the President's 15 percent goal, and will conduct competitions involving selectedfacilities, security, and fire protection functions.\u007f Financial Management \u2014HHS' financial management systems have been non-compliant with federal laws and regulations since 1996, and its systems remain inadequate to producereliable financial information. To solve these problems, HHS will begin implementation of aseven-year Unified Financial Management System project. The Department will also measurethe level of erroneous federal payments to social programs administered by the states, and willwork with the states to decrease these levels.\u007f E-Government \u2014HHS must assert central control of IT decision-making by coordinating IT development efforts across operating divisions and emphasizing elimination of duplicative IT projects. The Department must strengthen IT planning and address IT security issues, andmust focus on converting paper transactions to computers to improve customer service andreduce private sector burden. To address IT management problems, HHS will consolidate ITstaff, develop a comprehensive E-Gov strategy, and lead the federal government's E-Grantsand Health Informatics initiatives.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014HHS' annual performance plan, containing 15 volumes and nearly 750 performance measures, reflects a decentralized process with little value formaking budget decisions. Rather than setting national health outcome goals, HHS reportsnarrowly on specific program outputs. HHS will link its budget with Departmental priorities andnational health outcome goals; describe how program activities support each priority; andoutline strategies and resources.\u007f168 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Department of Health and Human Services (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Food and Drug Program .................................................... 20,447 and Mental Health Services Admin ....... 2,968 3,142 3,197 Agency for Health Research and Quality ............................. 1 0 73- Program Level ...................................................................... 272 300 252 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:1 CMS Program Administration 13 17 18 Legislative proposal ............................................................ -- 130 Administration for Children and Families: Existing law .......................................................................... 12,399 12,939 13,028 Legislative proposal ............................................................

Department of Housing and Urban Development Mel Martinez, Secretary www.hud.gov 202-708-1112 Number of Employees : 10,300 2002 Spending : $30.9 billion Field Offices : 80, including most major cities.The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsidizes housing costsfor about five million low-income householdsthrough rental assistance, construction grants, and loans. It also helps revitalize over 4,000 localities through communitydevelopment programs and provides housingand services to help families and thehomeless toward self-sufficiency. HUD alsoencourages homeownership by providing mortgage insurance for over six million homeowners, many of whom otherwise might not qualify for loans, and by managing billions of dollars in both guarantees of mortgagesand mortgage-backed securities. 171172 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Overview HUD Strategic Objectives \u007fReduce complexity, paperwork, and costs of the homebuying process. \u007fHelp families move from rental housingto homeownership. \u007fImprove the quality of public and assistedhousing, and help families find affordablehousing. \u007fStrengthen and expand faith-based andcommunity partnerships. \u007fEnd chronic homelessness and increasehousing opportunities for other homelesshouseholds. \u007fEmbrace a new sense of ethics andaccountability. \u007fEnsure equal opportunity and access tohousing. \u007fSupport community development efforts.T h eb u d g e tp r o p o s e st om a i n t a i no r increase support for housing assistance andother programs to help low-income familiesand communities achieve their goals. It provides 34,000 new housing vouchers targeted to ensure they provide assistanceto those most in need and increases othereffective programs to help meet HUD'sstrategic objectives. In some cases, however, HUD programs have trapped families in poor quality buildings or neighborhoods with safety concerns andwith limited educational and economicopportunities. Requiring families to acceptthese conditions in order to receive housingassistance is unacceptable. T h i sb u d g e t ,t h e r e f o r e ,p r o p o s e st oi m p r o v e housing quality and choice for the people HUDassists. It will strengthen public housingusing an \"asset management\" approachmodeled on private sector practices to addressthe large backlog of capital needs and provide better incentives for sound local management. It will provide subsidized families with increased ability to move when their needs or conditionswarrant, without giving up their subsidy. Helping families with their shelter costs is an important goal, yet HUD would fail in its mission if families were not moving toward eventual self-sufficiency. An important measure of HUD's successshould be the number of families that no longer need to reside in assisted housing because they have moved to safe, decent, and affordable private housing. To that end, the Administration will propose changes and work with the Congress to ensure that HUD programs support self-sufficiency efforts.

Requiring that more CDBG funds be providedto those communities with the greatest need will make the program truer to its intended purpose and less like a general revenue sharing program. The budget includes proposals addressing other ambitious goals for HUD, such as increasing homeownership rates among minority households and ending childhood lead poisoning in 10 years.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 173 Status Report on Select Programs The budget seeks to redirect funds from poorly performing programs to higher priority or more effective ones, while working to improve the management of ineffective programs. Program Assessment Explanation Public Housing Ineffective Serves 1.2 million low-income households, but properties are too often of poor quality and in high poverty or isolated locations. Housing Vouchers Effective Cost-effective, market-driven portable rental assistance. Serves Housing AdministrationModerately effectiveIncreases homeownership opportunity. But inadequate, out-dated systems and controls hamper ability to monitor private partners. Homeless Program Unknown Provides flexibility to serve homeless families and individuals throughcoordinated local planning and consolidated funding. Lack of data makes it difficult to measure progress toward achieving nationwide objectives. CommunityDevelopment BlockGrantUnknown Designed to boost low-income communities, its effectiveness isdiluted by the inclusion of some of the richest cities in the country. Itsflexibility permits use for a wide variety of community and economicdevelopment activities. Because each community has different needs and goals, it is difficult to assess performance, despite over $100 billion in grants since 1974. Lead Hazard ControlGrants Effective Program has clear, measurable objectives, and use of efficienttechnology is emphasized.174 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Congressional Earmarks The County Sheriff's Department of Ashland, Wisconsin, received $80,000 as a congressionalearmark to purchase an Ice Angel Windsled, similarto the one shown here. Windsleds have been used during the winter for rescue activities. Ashland's gain was Wisconsin's loss, however, because ifearmarked funds had been distributed throughthe CDBG formula, Wisconsin would have receivedan additional $2.5 million. That's enough for 30windsleds, if you believe windsleds are the best possible use of community development funds. The Administration objects to the Congress's traditional practice of funding unrequested earmarks. In 2002, the $336 million that might have been used for HUD's programs was earmarked insteadfor 831 congressional projects. These earmarks avoid the competitive process and often come at theexpense of more urgent needs. For example, Carmel, Indiana, with a poverty rate of one percent andmedian household income over $77,000, received $1 million for its parks. On the other hand, Gary, Indiana, with a 26 percent poverty rate and a median income less than a third of Carmel's, did not receive a project grant. Since 1998, the Congress has siphoned off over $1.2 billion for unrequestedearmarks in HUD appropriations. Notable Congressional Earmarks $2,250,000 for the city of Fairbanks, AK to provide winter recreation opportunities at the FairbanksNorth Star Borough Birch Hill recreation area; $1,000,000 for the Southern New Mexico Fair and Rodeo; $2,450,000 to restore six zoos; and$340,000 to restore opera houses in Connecticut, Michigan, and Washington. -20-15-10-505101520Funds Misallocated by Earmarks SDWV NY MO AK MD MA GANC TX PRIn millions of dollars MI 2002 Moreover, many states do not receive their share of earmarked funding\u2014that's a natural consequence of earmarking. The accompanying chart shows each state's earmarked dollars less theamount of funds they would have received if the $336 million had been distributed through thecongressionally authorized state CDBG formula.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 175 Reform Community Development Block Grants and Eliminate Poor Performing Community and Economic Development Programs Under a two decade old formula, over 1,000 cities, urban counties, and the states (for non-metropolitan areas) receive about $4.3 billion of CDBG funds annually. CDBG supportsvarious community development activities that are supposed to be directed primarily at low- andmoderate-income persons. Several smaller programs are also funded within CDBG. A three-foldincrease for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program will provide $65 million forcompetitive grants to non-profit faith-based and community-oriented organizations that support homeownership. Reform CDBG While it favors poorer communities, the current distribution of CDBG formula funds includes many grants to higher income cities and counties. The budget proposes a legislative change to reduce grants to the wealthiest one percent of eligible communities, defined as those with per capita income two times the national average. The savings from this proposal will fund a regionalinitiative to enhance the availability of affordable housing, economic opportunity, and infrastructurein the Colonias. Colonias are communities within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexican border that lackadequate infrastructure and other basic services. These communities have greater needs and fewerresources, and are better targets for such funds. In addition, the CDBG formula program grows by $95 million in 2003, giving communities an increase in their annual allocations. As 2000 Census data become available, HUD will developproposals for a new CDBG allocation formula and process, to allocate more to those who need thesefunds and will use them effectively.

Since 1999, these two programs have received over $430 million. Evaluations and other performanceinformation provide no convincing evidence that adding grants to the tax benefits of EmpowermentZones increases that program's effectiveness. Moreover, HUD's CDBG program lets localities meetthe same needs. For example, through CDBG, smaller communities will receive $1.3 billion in 2003for locally designed programs that meet their own housing and economic development needs. The savings from eliminating these programs will be reinvested in the CDBG program. Reinvigorating Renewal Communities and Empowerment Zones To help develop the economies of distressed urban and rural areas, HUD has just designated 40 Renewal Communities (RCs) and seven additional Round III urban Empowerment Zones (EZs). Private investors in both RC and EZ areas are el igible for tax benefits over the next 10 years tied to the expansion of job opportunities in these locations. Like CDBG, these programs allow communities to design and administer their own economic development strategies with a minimum of federalinvolvement.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 177 Strengthen Public Housing HUD low-income housing assistance programs, including public housing, other project-based subsidies, and housing vouchers, help approximately five million low-income families pay the rent. They do much good, but the Administration is committed to improving their operation. The budget will improve the physical condition and financial management of the 1.2 million public housing units subsidized by HUD, and give new choices to the families who live there. As a whole,these properties have approximately $20 billion in modernization needs. While most are inhabitable,30 percent fail HUD's physical quality standards. The reform of public housing introduces a way to end the practice of subsidizing substandard housing. More specifically, the reforms, introduced on a voluntary basis in 2003, will contribute to: \u007fMeeting two goals stated in the President's Management Agenda\u2014that 84 percent of public housing units will meet HUD's physical standards by 2005; and that HUD, working with theCongress, will ensure families are not required to live in substandard housing as a conditionof retaining their subsidy; \u007fProviding better management of public housing with less intrusive federalmicro-management; \u007fUsing the market to test projects' viability and guide local investment decisions; \u007fIntroducing choice and competition in public housing; and \u007fSubstantially reducing, and within a decade eliminating, an estimated $20 billion ofaccumulated capital needs. Local housing authorities will be able to employ real estate management and financing practices that are standard in the private sector. This approach to public housing will treat each property as a separate real estate investment. Housing authorities will finance the capital needs of their individualproperties with private mortgages, while the federal government will continue to subsidize operatingand debt service costs not covered by rent collections. Properties that cannot support a privatemortgage but are deemed worthy investments by local communities can use other local resourcesto make mortgages affordable and finance capital improvements. The Administration also proposes to extend choice to families living in public housing properties that are refinanced and rehabilitated under this model. As the program operates now, low-incomefamilies are required to reside where public housing exists as a condition of receiving rentalassistance\u2014even if properties fail HUD's physical standards. The Administration's plan wouldallow families to move after the initial one year lease period and retain their subsidy, givingthem choice in the selection of their housing and creating parity among HUD's assisted-housing programs. When residents have the option to leave a property, housing authorities must do a good job serving them or they will move out. Competitive market forces are thereby introduced and aproperty is more likely to be well managed and stay in good condition. This model corresponds tothe existing project-based voucher program. Strengthen Housing Assistance to Increase Affordable Housing and Promote Self-Sufficiency The budget includes both funding increases and management reforms to create a full \"toolbox\" of options for overcoming particular obstacles to affordable housing. HUD will measure performance178 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT against the goals for assisted housing, including a new measure to keep a count of the number of families moving from subsidized housing assistance to self-sufficiency. \u007fThe number of households leaving assisted housing and achieving housing self-sufficiency will increase from 2002 to 2003. \u007fThe number of households with worst case housing needs will drop three percent between 2001 and 2003. \u007fThe share of assisted multifamily units that meet HUD-established physical standards willrise by 1.5 percentage points between 2002 and 2003. Vouchers Have Lower Costs and Greater Benefits On average, the cost per unit of public housing exceeds the voucher program by 18 percent. All HUD subsidy programs target low-income households. However, 26 percent of all voucherrecipients live in neighborhoods with povertylevels below 10 percent, while only about eightpercent of public housing residents live in such areas. Vouchers give low income families a better chance of residing in a more economicallydiverse neighborhood.The number of households assisted is maintained by renewing all subsidy contractsthat expire in 2003. The budget also expandsassistance with over 34,000 new housing vouchers that will give families the financial power to choose from a variety of housingoptions in the private rental market. TheAdministration favors vouchers because theyare proven to provide greater benefits atlower cost than older subsidy approaches. By relying on the private market and competitive forces, vouchers allow families to choose thebest available housing. Vouchers also relieveHUD of the difficult management burden ofoverseeing numerous housing properties. Comparison of Housing Assistance Approaches Public HousingHousing VouchersProject-based Subsidies Choice and Mobility Low High Low Cost Effectiveness and Avoidance of Federal LiabilityLow High Low The budget supports other approaches for increasing affordable housing, by including a $100 million increase for the HOME block grant, a flexible program that localities can tailor to theirparticular housing needs. This program will produce about 23,000 new affordable rental units in 2003 and rehabilitate another 23,000. Other programs in the budget that support the supply of affordable housing are CDBG and the low-income housing tax credit. The budget increases CDBGformula funds, about 30 percent of which goes to housing, by $95 million. The tax credit was recentlyincreased by 40 percent and now supports the production of about 100,000 units of moderate-renthousing a year. HUD is working to ensure that tax credit and HOME units are available in all casesto voucher families.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 179 End Chronic Homelessness in 10 Years The Administration has made ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective. The chronically homeless number perhaps 100,000 to 200,000 persons who are without a home for long periods of time, or on many occasions. They typically have many difficult-to-treat disabilities or mental health problems that lead to severe personal suffering. Serving this group consumes a largeshare of all resources dedicated to the homeless. HUD will work to move more of the chronicallyhomeless from the dangerous streets to safe, permanent housing. HUD will establish a baseline measure in 2003 of the chronic homeless population in communities with Homeless Management Information Systems. The performance measure for those communities will be achievement of a reduction in the number of chronically homeless persons by up to one-half over five years. HUD's homeless assistance programs, along with those of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and five other Departments, will all contribute to this result. Federal spending forthe homeless will increase in 2003 to $2.2 billion, including $1.1 billion in HUD. The budget proposes consolidating HUD's largest homeless programs into one. It also transfers two homeless programs from departments with other missions to departments with major responsibility for aiding the homeless. The result of the new structure will consolidate programadministration into five agencies rather than the current structure that includes seven. The FederalEmergency Management Agency's Emergency Food and Shelter program will be shifted intact toHUD, where it will continue to operate with its non-profit, private sector partners. The Departmentof Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration program will be moved to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Both transfers will allow agencies to focus on the mission of reducing chronic homelessness without reducing programs that are vital to the homeless population. Expand Homeownership Opportunity Families took advantage of strong economic conditions in recent years, increasing the national homeownership rate to a record level of 68.1 percent in 2001. The homeownership rate among minority households also increased over this period, reaching 47.8 percent in 2001. HUD's goals for 2003 are to increase the homeownership rate for minority households and protect therecent homeownership gains nationwide. HUD's homeownership efforts will seek to increase thehomeownership rate among minority households to 50 percent. The Administration will use several means to reach these objectives: \u007fTo promote the development of affordable single-family housing in low-income urban and rural neighborhoods, the budget proposes a tax credit of up to 50 percent of the cost of constructing a new home or rehabilitating an existing property. Eligible homebuyers would be required tohave incomes of not more than 80 percent of area median income. \u007fThe budget quadruples the President's Down Payment Assistance Initiative from its 2002level to $200 million. Through HUD's HOME program, this initiative provides state and localgovernments with matching grants to provide down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. \u007fThe budget triples funding to $65 million for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunityprogram, which helps families realize their homeownership dreams through sweat equity.180 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation I look forward to the day when we measure compassion not by the number of families living in assisted housing, but the number of families w h oh a v em o v e di n t oah o m eo ft h e i ro w n . Secretary Martinez December 13, 2001Continued support for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation is another elementof the Administration's homeownershipstrategy. The Corporation is a non-profitorganization outside of HUD and chartered by the Congress. It is primarily funded by the American taxpayer. The Corporation'sCampaign for Homeownership enabled over34,000 low-income families to become new homeowners since 1998 by using $155 million in public funds to generate $2.3 billion in privateinvestment (a 15-to-1 ratio). Meet the Simpsons Dimple Simpson, a single mother of three living in Nashville, Tennessee, yearnedto own a home, but thought she faced overwhelming odds. As a cook and cashier at an area high school, her income plungesduring the summer break, making it achallenge to save for a down payment. Shehad received HUD housing assistance forthe last 16 years, but did not know how she could afford to purchase a home or find her way through an unknown process. Through an innovative programmatic partnership among HUD, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and a private lender, Ms. Simpson'sdreams became a reality. She purchased the home she longed for by using her HUD voucher as part ofthe financing structure, and relying on the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and local partners to guide her through the process. After building home equity for a few years, Ms. Simpson will be self-sufficient, thereby freeing up her housing subsidy to help another needy family. \"I have proved to my girls that [their] Mom ...can do ANYTHING,\" Simpson says. \"This was a hand up, not a hand out.\" Other HUD Programs Lead Paint Hazards HUD is committed to eliminating childhood lead poisoning by 2010, working with other federal agencies, including HHS and the Environmental Protection Agency. HUD's primary role in keepingTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 181 children from lead exposure is through grants to localities for control of lead paint hazards in low-income housing. HUD promotes the use of new, low-cost technologies that can be replicatedacross the nation. For 2003, the budget proposes a 15 percent increase (to $126 million) for this program. Faith-Based and Community Initiatives HUD is one of the five agencies that has established an Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in response to the President's Executive Order published in January 2001. Expanding the opportunities and success of faith-based and community development organizations is a HUD strategic goal. More information on the coordinated effort across the federal government regardingfaith-based and community initiatives appears in the HHS chapter. Strengthening Management HUD is one of the nation's largest financial guarantors, with large mortgage obligations and exposure. It is responsible for managing more than $500 billion worth of insured mortgages, more than $700 billion in outstanding mortgage-backed securities, and about $120 billion instill-to-be-outlayed funds from past appropriations. To meet its commitments, HUD must improveits management capability and performance. HUD's chronic management weaknesses are well documented. The General Accounting Office labeled HUD at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement from 1994 to 2000. HUD's weaknesses harm those whom the agency was created to serve. For example, subsidized families are sometimes trapped in substandard, poorly maintained housing; homebuyers are exposed tofraudulent practices; and some families receive excessive rental subsidies that could have beenused to aid others in need. HUD has resolved to fix these problems as part of the President'sManagement Agenda. HUD will adopt a rating system to objectively measure subsidized housingperformance with mandatory remedies for lack of performance. HUD will greatly reduce fraudulent practices in FHA by holding lenders accountable for the performance of brokers and appraisers. HUD will develop an expert system to help lower the 60 percent error rate in calculating the rentsof subsidized tenants.182 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014HUD has the oldest workforce of any Cabinet department. After many years of downsizing, HUD faces a potential retirement wave and loss of experienced staff. HUD's managers for many years have been hindered by a lack of workforce measurement tools to evaluate how long tasks take or determine staff productivity. Inaddition, after several reorganizations, HUD workers are not all in the right places withthe right skills to do priority work. The D epartment is taking actions to correct these deficiencies. HUD is expanding recruitment programs, including a new intern program tohelp replace those who could retire soon. The Department is delegating more hiring to the field offices to accelerate the filling of vacancies. The Department's new work measurement system will complete its first full year of data collection in December.Managers then will create a staffing plan based on needs to better align work effortwith priority tasks. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014HUD works primarily through intermediaries or grantees to deliver its programs to recipients, seeking to maintain a proper balance betweenin-house expertise and oversight capacity and outsourcing. The General Accounting Office and the HUD Inspector General have repeatedly found long-standing deficiencies in HUD's program oversight. HUD has failed to analyze regularly its tasks to determine ifcompetition of functions identified as commercial would result in better performance andvalue for the government. However, given HUD's significant downsizing over the pastdecade, opportunities for additional outsourcing may be limited. In an effort to eventuallycompete 50 percent of all commercial activities in accordance with the President's Management Agenda, HUD will need to compete at least five percent, or 290 positions, in 2002 and an additional 10 percent, or 580 positions, in 2003. \u007f Financial Management \u2014HUD's financial systems have been plagued with deficiencies for many years. HUD's fi nancial statements improved last year to merit an unqualified audit opinion, albeit with citations for 10 reportable conditions and four materialweaknesses. In 2002, the Department will continue progress by maintaining an unqualified audit opinion and eliminating at least three of its material weaknesses or reportable conditions. The Department will revamp its funds control system in 2002 toovercome internal control deficiencies that led to overspending of its appropriation in2000. The Department will improve the inadequate FHA accounting system with a newFHA general ledger by October 2002. A Departmental task force has been working withHUD's intermediaries and clients for several months on plans to r educe the overpayment of rent subsidies; HUD will set aggressive interim targets to reduce overpayments in each of the next three years. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 183 Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014HUD has encountered chronic implementation problems in delivering information technology (IT) systems. Often HUD's IT investments start well but then experience problems and start to lag, and some projects are never completed. Recently, HUD made improvements. It installed a capital planning process for all major ITsystems. HUD now requires a business case to make better investment decisions. HUDstages projects in modular increments that can be more carefully tracked for success orfailure. The challenge is to deliver IT systems on time and within budget. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014HUD has too little focus on outcomes, or how programs influence them. Some programs do not measure important outcomes, only inputs. For example, HUD measures the amount of money spent to subsidize housing for a low-income household. However, HUD does not measure if that subsidizedhousehold now does better in terms of employment, earnings, children's education,or stability of the family, nor does it track the length of time the household continuesto receive housing assistance. This lack of performance information inhibits HUD'sability to compare different types of programs and strategies. HUD is also hindered by inconsistent collaboration between performance planning and budgeting. Recently, though, HUD has made progress in simplifying its budget to a more understandablepresentation. In the coming year, HUD will integrate its performance planning into the2004 budget process in the proper sequence, i.e., to determine the outcomes it aimsfor first and then the program and resources required. \u007f184 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Department of Housing and Urban Development (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Community Development Block Grant: Existing law ................................................................................. 5,112 5,000 4,716 Legislative 1,130 Legislative proposal ................................................................... \u2014 \u2014 153 AIDS Housing Grants ..................................................................... 257 277 292 Housing Certificate Fund (Housing 17,527 Public Housing ................................................................................. 6,228 Housing (HOPE IV) ........ 574 574 574 Housing for Special Populations (elderly and disabled) ............ 994 1,024 1,024 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) ....................................... 2,702 2,066 2,285 Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity ............................................ 46 46 46 Lead Hazard Reduction ................................................................. 100 110 126 All other programs ........................................................................... 943 443 138 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1........................ 28,412 29,470 31,497 Remove contingent adjustments ................................................... 55 Total, Discretionary budget authority ................................................ 28,357 29,415 31,441 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: Community Development Block Grant ......................................... \u2014 2,700 \u2014 Inspector General ............................................................................ \u20141 \u2014 Total Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources .............. \u2014 2,701 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays .............................................................................. 921 3,445 1,607 Credit activity: Direct Loan Disbursements FHA ................................................................................................... 2 129 54 Other loans ....................................................................................... 24 17 1 Total, Direct loan disbursements ....................................................... 26 146 55 Guaranteed Loans FHA ................................................................................................... 122,687 150,584 141,566 Community Development Loan Guarantees ............................... 335 400 400 Other Guaranteed Loans ............................................................... 21 47 59 Total, Guaranteed loans ...................................................................... 123,043 151,031 142,025 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

DOI protects much of the nation'snatural and cultural resources, includingproviding for their responsible use, and serves as the largest supplier and manager of water in the 17 western states. DOI is responsiblef o rm e e t i n gm a n yo ft h eg o v e r n m e n t ' strust responsibilities to Indian tribes andaffiliated island communities. The agency alsodisseminates U.S. earth science information and research findings to the public. 185186 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Overview The nation's vast lands, waters, minerals, fish and wildlife, and other natural and cultural resources provide both social and economic benefits to our population. Careful management of these resources is required to ensure they are used in an environmentally responsible manner. DOI's activities largely fall within four broad categories: \u007fConservation (such as wilderness protection, habitat conservation, and historic preservation); \u007fRecreation (such as hiking, hunting, bird-watching, and camping); \u007fEnergy and Other Resource Development (such as development of oil, gas, coal, and other minerals, as well as cattle grazing and timber production); and \u007fAmerican Indian programs (including Indian education and trust fund management). Major units include the 385 National Parks, 538 National Wildlife Refuges, 70 National Fish Hatcheries, 406 hydroelectric facilities and reservoirs, and 264 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM)-administered public lands. DOI also manages trust funds and assets for more than 300 of the 558 American Indian tribes. Improving management and performance is a common theme throughout the 2003 President's Budget. This chapter explains how the 2003 Budget will help improve management and performancewithin DOI. It begins with a status report on select DOI programs and identifies strong and weakperformers. A short section on congressional earmarks discusses how these unrequested mandates have a tendency to detract from agency performance. The chapter then discusses how the President's Budget helps to address performance issues in key DOI programs. The programs discussed areseparated into the four main categories that reflect the main thrust of the agency's work as identifiedabove. The chapter concludes by identifying how DOI will address the specific government-widemanagement and performance initiatives included in the President's Management Agenda. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs to higherpriority or more effective ones. In limited cases, the answer to fixing less effective or ineffectiveprograms is increased funding (e.g., increases for national park maintenance). In such cases, plansare underway to improve program performance. In other cases, an effective program\u2014like the National Wildlife Refuge System\u2014gets rewarded with additional funding offset by a reduction in funds from ineffective programs, such as the National Fish Hatchery System. The accompanyingtable illustrates specific programs that have been rated by the Administration, most of which arediscussed in this chapter.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 187 Program Assessment Explanation National Wildlife Refuge SystemEffective Effectively prioritizes identified needs; better performance measuresare still needed.

National FishHatchery System Ineffective Lacks clear direction and adequate performance measures. State orprivate programs may be more effective. Bureau of IndianAffairs SchoolPerformanceIneffective Academic performance of many students at BIA schools is far belowpublic school counterparts. Congressional Earmarks DOI has, or is developing, systematic methods for determining priority projects for funding. For instance, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has established its Refuge Operations Needs Systemto monitor, manage, and prioritize operational staffing, resource conservation, and public use needs on refuges. The President's Budget largely reflects the results of such analysis. Unfortunately, congressional earmarks divert funds from these high priority and effective programs. For example, in 2002, DOI received funding for 284 unrequested projects, totaling $323million. Of this amount, $154 million in earmarks were for construction and land acquisitionprojects alone, representing 24 percent of all funding in these two categories (see accompanyingtable). While the Congress reduced its earmarking in 2002 of construction and land acquisition projects, more still needs to be done.188 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Congressional Earmarks DOI Construction and Land Acquisition Projects NumberBA in millions of dollarsPercent of Total 2001 ....... 105 180 36 2002 ....... 101 154 24Over the past 10 years, more than 40 percent of National Park Service (NPS) constructionproject funding was earmarked for lowerpriorities, at a time when national parks werestruggling with a deferred maintenance backlog.Important projects that will be further deferred in 2002 due to earmarks include utilities and campground upgrades in Acadia National Park,preservation work on the Lincoln Memorial,and rehabilitation of the park headquartersbuilding at Yellowstone National Park. For some unrequested projects, park construction funds are not even spent on park facilities\u2014they are simply passed through to others; such is the case with the state-owned Palace of the Governors in New Mexico. The following sections discuss how the Administration is working to improve the performance of DOI's programs, in part by redirecting earmarked funds to more effective uses. Conservation With one million visitors each year, BLM's Red Rock National Conservation Area near Las Vegas, Nevada is one of the manyunparalleled sites managed by DOI.DOI plays a key role in protecting and preserving some of the nation's mostremarkable natural areas and is responsiblefor conserving and protecting threatenedand endangered species. The Presidentis committed to the conservation and stewardship of our lands, watersheds, and other natural resources. To that end, this budget addresses a long-ignored problem by refocusingenvironmental stewardship on achievingresults. For example, in 2003: \u007fFWS will restore 125,000 acres ofwildlife habitat on refuges; helpprevent three species from being addedto the Endangered Species list; work to remove five more species from the list; and increase wildlife refuge visitation to 40 millionvisits. \u007fNPS will restore over 13,500 acres of targeted parklands that have been disturbed bydevelopment; contain or restore 102,600 acres of land impacted by invasive plants; andrehabilitate 270 park historic structures, bringing the total amount of park historic structures in good condition up to 46 percent. \u007fBLM will conduct 50,000 acres of proactive resource inventories; restore and protect 230 \"at-risk\" cultural and paleontologic sites; implement water quality improvement projects in 14 watersheds within priority areas; remediate 60 abandoned mines; and plug or reclaim 15 orphan wells.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 189 \u007fThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will expand data collection and management with 15 new terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity studies to inform land and resource management; add twomore decision support systems for ecosystem restoration in the Everglades; and develop a new web-based information system to inform local urban development decisions in coastal areas. \u007fThe Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) will provide approximately 2.5 million acre feet of water to conserve threatened or endangered species and preserve, restore, or establish over 9,776 acres of wetlands habitat and 15 miles of instream or riparian habitat to offset project impacts. The agency will increasingly rely on these and other performance measures to guide conservation and resource management on DOI lands. In many cases, performance measures for DOI programsare scarce or inadequate, however, the agency has accepted the difficult task of better defining andtracking relevant indicators. For example, performance measures for the Wildland Fire Management program have traditionally focused on achieving all-out fire suppression goals, regardless of effectiveness or the impact on long-term ecological health. DOI is working to improve its measures for this program,with a significant focus on cost effectiveness and integration of the various parts of the fire program.(See the Department of Agriculture (USDA) chapter for further discussion of the DOI/USDAWildland Fire Program.) Partnering for Conservation through Better Science The Department's National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) increases access to data and information on the nation's biological resourcesin order to promote the use of science as a basisfor determining local, regional, and nationalconservation strategies. The NBII website(www.nbii.gov) links the diverse, high-quality biological databases, information products, and analytical tools maintained by this growingnetwork. Federal funding of $6 million in 2003 isexpected to be matched many times over by themore than 200 partners in the NBII network. Theamount of data accessible on the NBII site will more than double by 2003.Complementing this renewed emphasis on performance is an increased focus on utilizingpartnerships. By partnering with states, localgovernments, conservation organizations, tribes, and interested private parties, DOI can leverage non-federal resources to achieve moreconservation for each federal dollar spent.The federal government has a broad array oftools and programs to fulfill its conservationresponsibilities, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Wildlife Refuge System, and the Endangered SpeciesAct. The following sections discuss, in greaterdetail, a number of these important programsand initiatives and how the Administrationis emphasizing partnerships within these programs. Land and Water Conservation Fund The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was established in 1965 to support natural resource conservation and outdoor recreation at the federal, state, and local levels. LWCF funding in recent years has focused on acquiring land. This past year, however, the LWCF funded two of the President's priorities, both of which recognize that federal acquisition is not always the best or onlyway to conserve land and other natural resources. These programs\u2014Landowner Incentive Grantsand Private Stewardship Grants\u2014provide new ways to cooperate with private landowners to enhancehabitat for imperiled species and encourage conservation efforts on private lands.190 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Innovation in Conservation Conservation easements can benefit fish and wildlife as well as agriculture. David Mannix of the Mannix Brothers Ranch in Montana put it best when he said, \"Agricultureand wildlife have much in common in that agricultureneeds open space to stay in business and wildlife needopen space to stay alive.\" The Fish and Wildlife Servicepurchase of easements from the Mannix Brothers Ranch provided the money necessary for expansion of their ranch, allowing future generations to stay on theland. Since the land remains in private ownership, localproperty taxes still flow to the local government, creatinga winning scenario for fish, wildlife, agriculture, and thelocal community.Conservation easements represent another tool in the effort to protectand conserve land. Easements provide flexibility for landowners who are interested in conserving their landbut want to retain ownership (seeaccompanying box). In some cases,conservation easements can also bemore cost effective than outright land purchases. For example, two recently acquired conservation easements atthe Fish and Wildlife Service's DakotaTallgrass Prairie Wildlife ManagementArea in North and South Dakota wereless expensive than outright purchase of the land by 43 percent and 78 percent, respectively. As promised, the President's Budget fully funds LWCF at over $900 million to promote conservation in a variety of ways. This includes theprograms funded out of LWCF last year, plus an additional four conservation programs designatedto receive funding through the LWCF: Existing LWCF Programs Added LWCF Programs \u007fFederal land acquisition \u007fLWCF State Grants \u007fState and Tribal Wildlife Grants \u007fLandowner Incentive Grants \u007fPrivate Stewardship Grants\u007fCooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund Legacy 1Programs within USDA's Forest Service . Each of these programs has a different emphasis, but they all recognize that partnerships encourage the stewardship of our natural resources and can be more powerful and effective thantraditional land acquisition or litigation. For example, a dollar spent acquiring land through theNorth American Wetlands Conservation Fund could leverage anywhere from one to seven dollars inadditional funding from partners. Especially important among these programs is $200 million for LWCF state grants, including $50 million as part of the Cooperative Conservation Initiative discussed below. States often have a bettersense than the federal government of areas that are locally or regionally important, so the Presidentis proposing a 39 percent increase in these grants\u2014the highest funding level since 1980.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 191 Conservation Tax Credit The President's Budget also includes an incentive for private, voluntary land protection through a 50-percent capital gains tax exclusion. Private landowners who voluntarily sell land or water to a government agency or qualified conservation organization for conservation purposes are eligible for the exclusion. This incentive is another example of a cost effective, non-regulatory, market-basedapproach to conservation. Cooperative Conservation Initiative We are all stewards of the land. Yet problems arise when national leaders dictate decisions from afar, rather than building partnerships with the states, local governments, and local citizens who areclosest to the land and best know the problems and how to fix them. Partnerships achieve more conservation for the same investment. An excellent example of this approach is the Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI). To leverage funds and promoteconservation, the CCI allocates $100 million in matching funds for natural resource conservation projects. Projects can range from working with The Nature Conservancy to remove invasive species from Channel Islands National Park, to working with local communities to reclaim abandoned minesites on public lands. Half of these funds would be allocated through cost-shared programs betweennon-federal partners and DOI's NPS, FWS, and BLM. The other half would be distributed to statesas part of the LWCF state grant program. However, as with other LWCF programs, all of the fundshave a common goal: to get more conservation results by working in concert with the people who know the land. NPS Natural Resource Challenge This initiative establishes a framework for measuring the Park Service's performance in preserving natural resource conditions in national parks. The Natural Resource Challenge is designed to collect and inventory baseline data on park resources and then identify and monitor the \"vital signs\"\u2014such as nitrogen levels in streams or populations of waterbirds\u2014that most effectivelyshow changes in those resources. With an increase of $18 million in 2003, 52 parks will havemonitoring programs to measure park resource health, and NPS will establish vital sign measuresin 12 of 32 monitoring networks. Additionally, NPS will complete all resource inventories by 2008,two years earlier than previously planned. National Wildlife Refuges In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote a new chapter in conservation when he set aside land to protect pelicans and other birds on what is now called the Pelican Island National WildlifeRefuge in Florida. Some 95 million acres later, the 538 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) stand out as outstanding examples of efforts to effectively balance species conservation with public access.192 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR On March 14, 2003, Americans across the nation will celebrate the Centennial anniversary of theNational Wildlife Refuge System a milestone in the history of fish and wildlife conservation inAmerica.But the NWRS is not without its problems. Due to poor prioritization of funding in thepast and continuous expansion over manyy e a r s ,t h er e f u g es y s t e mh a sd e v e l o p e dabacklog of unmet operations and maintenanceneeds. To address this backlog, the Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a well-prioritized list of these needs. Theseneeds reflect an untapped potential for improving species protection and habitat restoration as wellas enhancing public use opportunities. Protecting songbirds, such as this endangered Golden-cheeked warbler, is part of the Department's mission.The refuge system's centennial offers an excellent opportunity to highlight this effective program and improve the refuge system's performance. The President's Budgetproposes an increase of $52 million for thehighest priority operations, maintenance, andplanning needs and provides an additional$5 million for challenge cost share programs on wildlife refuges through the CCI. In future years, the Royalties ConservationFund proposed in the National Energy Policywould provide additional funds to help reducemaintenance backlogs for refuges as well asother federal lands. The increase for refuges in the President's 2003 Budget will fund a variety of activities,such as monitoring and protecting listedspecies of the barrier beach ecosystem at Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia, andconstructing viewing decks at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge near Austin, Texasto better observe endangered songbirds, such as the Golden-cheeked warbler. These and other projects in the President's Budget will help ensure that, in 2003, the top priority needs of the refuge system are met, 125,000 acres of habitat are restored, and the system is capable of handling theprojected 40 million visitors. Endangered Species The Department of the Interior is also charged with conserving threatened and endangered species and their habitat. Preventing species from becoming endangered as defined by theEndangered Species Act (ESA), improving the status of listed species, and taking recovered speciesoff the list are key measurements of the success of the program. In 2001, DOI's efforts helped tokeep five species from being listed; stabilized or improved 320 of 616 species listed for a decade ormore; and removed the Aleutian Canada Goose from the ESA list of \"threatened\" species. The 2003 President's Budget provides $126 million for the FWS' Endangered Species program. This funding supports the direct efforts of FWS to implement the ESA. The budget also includes $25THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 193 million for DOI to help carry out the \"reasonable and prudent alternative\" of the Columbia River Basin biological opinion. The Administration's main focus on imperiled species, however, involves working with partners to prevent listings in the first place and to recover those already listed. The budget provides over $200 million for such activities through various grant programs, including the CooperativeEndangered Species Conservation Fund and the State and Tribal Wildlife, Landowner Incentive,and Private Stewardship grant programs\u2014the latter two of which are Presidential initiatives.These and other programs emphasize working with and encouraging states and landowners toprotect a variety of species and their habitat, thereby garnering matching funds and support of these conservation efforts. In 2003, the President's Budget will help prevent three species from becoming listed under the ESA, maintain or improve the status of roughly 376 listed species, and remove five species from theESA list because of recovery efforts. Species that may be taken off the list include the Tinian monarchflycatcher, the Gulf coast population of the brown pelican, and the Douglas County (WA) populationof the Columbian white-tailed deer. Recreation Protecting and preserving land and open space provides more than just environmental benefits: it benefits our economy as well. Outdoor recreation has become big business in the United States, andthe public lands provide countless opportunities for many Americans to engage in healthy, wholesomeactivities. Every year, more and more Americans turn to DOI's public lands for a sense of peace and solitude in an increasingly crowded and fast-paced world, and recent events have only heightened this need. Much of the general public's exposure to the Department of the Interior comes by wayof visits to national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands. The number of visits is a roughmeasure of recreational use of DOI lands. 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000050100150200250300350400 Bureau of Land Management Fish and Wildlife Service National Park ServiceRecreation Visits on DOI Lands Visits in millions Source: Department of the Interior.Visitation to DOI sites is steadily increasing. While over 90 percent of visitorsto DOI's public lands rated their experience asgood or very good, the quality of visits can befurther improved. In particular, national park facilities are buckling under the weight of heavy use,while funding is stretched by the continuousaddition of new parks. Our national parkshave a backlog of billions of dollars in deferredmaintenance, as evidenced by the broken toilets, washed out trails, and crumbling roads found in many parks. Eliminating this backlog will improve the quality of visits and encouragemore visits while protecting natural resources.194 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Recreation and user fees have greatly helped to reduce backlogs in national parks and other public lands, now that agencies can retain fee receipts and spend them on priority needs. The amount offee receipts available to agencies has gone from less than $15 million in 1996 to nearly $200 million in 2000, principally due to the Recreation Fee Demonstration program, which the budget proposes to make permanent. Fort Y ellowstone jail is slowly crumbling from lack of maintenance. Water intrusion andsubsequent freezing and thawing have caused half of this historic structure to erode.National Park Service Maintenance Backlog The President's Budget will make visiting our national treasures better than ever. First, the President committed to eliminating the current deferred maintenance backlogin national parks by 2006. This budget keeps that promiseon track. NPS funding for facility maintenance andconstruction is at an all-time high (over $660 million,compared to $354 million as recently as 1996). In the future, the proposed Royalties Conservation Fund would also provide funds to reduce the maintenance backlog inour national parks. But more money does not always mean the parks will get fixed faster. Therefore, the President's proposal also takesthe first step to identify and prioritize what needs fixing and figure out a way to measure progress for getting the job done. The Service will complete initial assessments of parkfacility conditions by the end of 2003. As assessments arecompleted, NPS will compile a Facility Condition Index toevaluate the status of facilities and, starting with the 2004Budget, measure agency performance in improving those conditions. Energy and Other Resource Development In addition to scenic vistas, wildlife habitat, and recreation, our public lands also provide critical resources such as oil, coal, minerals, and timber for the general welfare of our nation. DOI managesthese natural resources for a strong economy, while balancing these needs with the need for a healthyenvironment. Oil and Natural Gas The United States currently consumes about 19 million barrels of oil a day and almost 7 billion barrels every year, of which over half is imported. Of the oil and gas that is domestically produced, 29percent and 35 percent is produced on federal lands, respectively. However, over the last five years,production on federal lands has leveled off. The National Energy Policy proposes to expand and diversify our nation's energy supplies. Diversity is important not only for energy security, but also for national security. To carry outTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 195 the National Energy Policy, DOI's Minerals Management Service (MMS) and BLM are issuing or proposing leases on federal offshore (Outer Continental Shelf) and onshore tracts with known orprobable petroleum deposits and where safe and environmentally sound mineral development can occur, consistent with current drilling moratoria. After review of the bids submitted to ensure fair market value, the company with the highest bid wins the lease and is encouraged to develop theresource as quickly as possible or risk losing the lease. 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 20010100200300400500600700800 012345678 Oil GasMillions of barrels Trillions of cubic feetOil and Natural Gas Production On Federal Lands Source: Department of the Interior. Includes offshore and onshore production.To ensure environmentally sound OCS oil and gas development, the MMS seeks to limit oil spilled to 10 barrels spilled per millionbarrels produced. In 2000, the actual oilspill rate was 5.35 barrels per million barrelsproduced. MMS estimates naturally occurringoil seeps introduce 150 to 175 times more oil into U.S. marine waters than do OCS oil and gas activities. DOI is carrying out the National Energy Policy by: \u007fworking with the Congress to authorize exploration and, if resources are discovered, environmentally responsible development of the most promising reserve areas within thecoastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; \u007fmoving forward with Outer Continental Shelf oil and natural gas leasing and approvingexploration and development on predictable schedules; \u007fconsidering additional oil and natural gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), which the Congress established in 1976; \u007fpromoting enhanced oil and natural gas recovery from existing wells through new technology; and \u007fimplementing economic incentives for offshore oil and natural gas development. Renewable Resources DOI also manages the use of renewable resources such as rangeland forage, timber, and renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power. The Bureau ofLand Management administers over 21,000 grazing allotments, covering 161 million acres of publicrangeland, and manages over 49 million acres of forested land for multiple uses, including supply oftimber and other forest products. For several years, BLM has struggled with a grazing permit backlog resulting from insufficient planning and a spike in the number of expiring permits. In 2003, BLM will process approximately 1,500 expiring grazing permits, allowing the backlog to be completelyeliminated by 2004.196 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR With development costs declining, wind farms-like this one on BLM land near Palm Springs,California-increasingly offer a clean, affordablealternative to fossil fuels.The Bureau of Reclamation operates 58 hydroelectric plants that produce over 10 percent (or 42 billionkWh) of the electricity in 17 states, while the Bureau of Land Management administers geothermal leases in several high resource areas such as Nevada andSouthern California. The National Energy Policyplaces a high priority on developing alternative energysources that may reduce our dependence on foreignoil and eventually replace fossil fuels. Working closely with the Department of Energy, DOI is doing its part to evaluate and remove unnecessary impediments tothe development of alternative energy on DOI lands,while ensuring that the environment is protected inthe process. The two departments recently held a jointrenewable energy summit to discuss opportunities to expand the use of renewable energy on our public lands. (See the Department of Energy chapter for additionaldiscussion of renewable energy issues). Coal As America's most abundant fuel source, coal is expected to remain the dominant fuel in meetingincreasing electricity demand through 2020.Recognizing this, the National Energy Policy also calls for increased domestic coal production. Newclean coal technologies show that air pollution can be reduced and energy efficiency increased. DOIplays a large role in domestic coal production. In 1999, coal mined on lands controlled by DOI's BLM accounted for about 35 percent of domestic coal production. However, unnecessary delays in lease application processing can be costly to businesses and may even result in missed opportunities.Currently, the average processing time for a coal lease application is 18 months. DOI is examiningways to expedite permits and other actions necessary for energy-related project approvals. Theagency is also actively working to resolve disputes between coal and natural gas producers in one ofthe country's largest coal-producing regions, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. American Indian Programs DOI is responsible for fulfilling the federal government's trust responsibilities to Native Americans and promoting self-determination on behalf of tribal governments, American Indians,and Alaska Natives.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 197 Enhancing Educational Opportunities for American Indian Children Gila Crossing Day School in Laveen, AZ, serving 241 students in grades K through 6, is a success story for tribally operated schools. Gila Crossing's reforms include: standards-basedmath, after-school tutoring, guided reading, andan extended school year. Over a period of three school years, student proficiency in math skills jumped from 33 percent to 63 percent, while language skills proficiency soared from 26 percent to 90 percent. Enrollmentincreased by 73 percent, while daily attendancealso increased from 89 percent to 97 percent.Through treaty requirements and federal statutes, the federal government has aresponsibility to ensure American Indian children have access to quality educational opportunities through specific Indianeducation programs. The Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA) operates, either directly orthrough tribal grants and contracts, 185schools serving more than 48,000 students (approximately 10 percent of all Indian students in the country in elementary andsecondary schools) in 23 states. Whilethere have been some success stories, suchas the Gila Crossing Day School, a recentGeneral Accounting Office study found that \"the academic achievement of many BIA students ...is far below the performance of students in public schools.\" The President's 2003 Budget places new emphasis on improving academic performance at BIA schools and continues the 2002initiative to eliminate the school maintenance and repair backlog. Academic Performance at BIA Schools The President proposes to use competition to improve the worst performing BIA-operated schools and to enhance the opportunities for American Indian children to succeed in learning.The accompanying table illustrates the dramatic differences between student performance at BIAschools and public schools in the critical skills of reading, writing, and math in the grades tested.While external factors do contribute to poor academic performance, the time has come to reevaluate BIA's role in the education of American Indian children. Following tribal consultations, the BIA will solicit private entities to manage those schools that the tribes do not elect to contract themselvesthrough self-determination grants.198 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AVERAGE STUDENT PERFORMANCE State Assessment Tests in 1999-2000 School Year BIA Schools Public Schools StateLow High Low HighMeasure1 North Dakota.............. 25 33 64 71 Percentile Range South Dakota ............. 25 28 60 67 Percentile Range Arizona...................... \u2014 27 15 71 Percent Source: General Accounting Office Report O1-934 1North and South Dakota use average national percentile rankings while Arizona uses four categories\u2014Falls Far Below, Approaches, Meets, or Exceeds.

The President iscommitted to eliminating the backlog by theend of 2006. The 2003 Budget provides asecond installment ($164 million) for school maintenance and repairs. When it is not feasible to repair an existing school, the entirefacility will be replaced. The budget alsoprovides $120 million to build six replacementschools, leaving only three schools on the BIA'scurrent priority replacement list. Indian Trust Fund Management The President's 2003 Budget provides a significant increase of $84 million to remedy deficiencies in trust programs and meet the mandates of a U.S. District Court in the Cobell v. Norton case. For decades, Indian trust funds have lacked modern accounting systems, reliable management systems,and effective financial control systems. In December 1999, a federal judge ordered the agency tocorrect the breaches of trust responsibilities and file progress reports on trust reforms. SecretaryNorton has undertaken actions to strengthen DOI's trust reform efforts.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 199 Funding for Indian Trust Reforms 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003050100150200250300350 Office of the Special Trustee Bureau of Indian AffairsBudget authority in millionsBIA manages 56 million acres of Indian trust lands owned by tribes and their members.Over 110,000 oil, gas, timber, and other leases generate about $1.1 billion in annual income for the Indian landowners. The Office of theSpecial Trustee for American Indians (OST)is responsible for the distribution of $800million each year to 1,400 tribal trust accountsand $300 million each year to about 285,000 individual trust accounts. The OST budget includes $161 million, a $49 million increase,to implement modern land title, leasing,and accounting systems; address probatebacklogs and improve risk managementanalyses; consolidate fractionated ownership of trust lands; and undertake other related trust management improvements, such as improving information technology (IT) security. BIA's budget includes $153 million, a $35 million increase, tofurther expand trust program operations and services at headquarters, regional, and tribal levels.DOI is continuing to make changes to its trust reform strategy, organization and management, andimprovement projects in response to recent court reports and independent consultant reviews. Strengthening Management Consistent with the President's Management Agenda, DOI intends to improve management and performance in 2003. One of the first steps is to address the government-wide management andperformance initiatives identified in this agenda. As DOI's performance measures reflect, it is charged with diverse responsibilities. The agency acts as steward for vast amounts of federal land, collects billions in oil and gas leasing revenues, serves as the trustee for Native Americans and Territorial Island communities, and contributes to a vast array of scientific disciplines. Because of its large geographic domain and varied missions, DOI's bureaus have tended to go their own way\u2014creating many management challenges for DOI as a department. Although DOIhas centralized some management systems such as time and attendance, financial accounting,and contracting, the agency does not have standardized performance measures or program cost definitions. DOI plans to centralize more of its administrative operations to gain cost savings and increase the use of common standards. DOI will also develop an integrated financial andperformance system, and will revise its strategic plan so that it is based on priority managementgoals and measures, rather than a loose collection of bureau plans. The following table provides a snapshot of DOI's 2001 status for each of the five government-wide management initiatives along with descriptions of each initiative and the steps DOI is taking to improve in these areas.200 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014DOI, like most other federal agencies, faces human capital-related challenges such as an aging workforce with retirements expected in critical skill areas. For example, DOI's Fish and Wildlife Service expects 40 percent of its 201 law enforcement officers to retire by the end of 2005. The agency will develop a comprehensive five-year plan tocoherently guide human capital management decisions to address these challenges. The planwill identify specific organizational changes to address competitive sourcing, skill-mix changes,streamlining and other management objectives. In addition, DOI will pursue co-location of BLMand USDA Forest Service field offices and conduct a Regional Office study for the FWS to help assess potential areas where it can become more citizen-centered. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014To meet the Administration's goal of completing public-private or direct conversion competition of federal employees performing commercial functions, DOIplans to compete or directly convert no fewer than 1,015 positions (five percent) in 2002. Anadditional 2,320 positions (10 percent) will be competed or directly converted in 2003 for a totalof 3,335 positions, or 15 percent of the agency's commercial activities workforce. To provideguidance, assistance, and oversight of this effort, the Department is launching a Center for Competitive Sourcing Excellence in 2002 and has designated a senior coordinator for this initiative. DOI's plan has been offered as a model for other agencies to use in the developmentof their competition plans.\u007f Financial Management \u2014Due to problems with its tribal trust accounting, DOI cannot provide assurances that its trust management systems and internal controls meet federal standards.All other DOI components, however, do meet these standards, and the department did receive a clean audit opinion. DOI has developed a High Level Implementation Plan to complete the trust accounting systems and implement the internal controls required to correct its trustaccounting weaknesses. Additionally, DOI will finish an enterprise architecture study to launcha new financial system enabling it to better integrate performance and budget information. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 201 Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014Historically, DOI has made major information technology (IT) investments without thorough analysis of realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals for new acquisitions. As a result, DOI puts large sums of public funds at high risk for failure and does not comply with either the Paperwork Reduction Act or the Clinger-Cohen Act. For example,the agency does not fully develop business cases for major IT investments and lacks anenterprise architecture to make Department-wide IT investment decisions. However, DOI iscommitted to improving its review and approval of IT investments centrally, and has alreadyhired a contractor to survey DOI's IT environment and make recommendations, due in June 2002, that will guide future investment decisions. DOI's Inspector General is reviewing the Department's IT investment process as well. DOI has taken a government-wide leadershiprole as managing partner for an intergovernmental Recreation One-Stop project and a similarOne-Stop project for geospatial information. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014DOI cannot monitor with sufficient precision the cost and effectiveness of many of its programs. For example, DOI does not know how much it coststo house its park rangers or reservation school teachers. Many programs, such as wildland firefighting and national park fac ilities maintenance, lack measures to evaluate interim progress towards long-term outcomes. Performance measures for USGS are particularly weak. DOI'soperating and financial systems are not linked, and the Department has few agency-wideperformance measures for program analysis. The agency is revising its Strategic Plan to useDOI-wide measures and is pursuing activity-based costing to better track full costs. \u007f202 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Department of the Interior (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: National Park Service ..............................................................

Department of Justice John Ashcroft, Attorney General www.usdoj.gov 202-514-2000 Number of Employees : 129,679 2002 Spending : $23.1 billion Six major bureaus : Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Attorneys, and U.S.Marshals Service.The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces the nation's laws, combats terrorism, protects public safety, helps prevent and control crime, provides just punishment for criminals, andensures the fair and impartial administrationof justice. The Department has six majorbureaus: the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Prisons(BOP), United States Attorneys, and theUnited States Marshals Service (USMS). 203204 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Defending the Nation Against Public Enemy Number One Terrorists strike on American soil.Defending the nation and its citizens against terrorist attacks and ensuring the protection and security of our homeland under the law is now the Department of Justice'sfirst priority. The Department has promisedthe American people that it will: \u007fdisrupt and dismantle terrorist activityand terrorist networks; \u007fbolster homeland security by preventingterrorist attacks before they occur; and \u007fhelp bring to justice those who wouldperpetrate terrorist acts againstAmericans. 2003 Counterterrorism Enhancements (Budget authority in m illions of dollars) Immigration and Naturalization Service .............. 994 Federal Bureau of Investigation ............................ 646 United States Attorneys ......................................... 99 General Legal Activities ......................................... 35 Counterterrorism Fund .......................................... 35 United States Marshals Service ........................... 47 All other .................................................................... 118 Total .......................................................................... 1,974The September 11thattacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in the air overPennsylvania brought home the heightenedthreats to the nation and illustrated tragicallythe gaps in our counterterrorism efforts.While many corrective actions have been taken, such as the shutting down of financial networks exploited by many terrorists, muchr e m a i n st ob ed o n e . T h eP r e s i d e n t ' sB u d g e tproposes a number of initiatives to addressthese challenges and increases funding by$2.0 billion to support these efforts. As shown in the accompanying table, most of this funding goes to the FBI and INS. The Mission: Seek, Find, Destroy Some of the major areas proposed for improvement are highlighted below. \u007fTimely and useful intelligence is a key to preventing terrorist attacks .The budget provides $155 million for the FBI and INS to improve their intelligence gathering and dissemination capabilities. This funding would support additional intelligence analysts, surveillance staff,and electronic surveillance equipment. It would also expand the use of Joint Terrorism TaskForces, which combine the resources and talents of federal, state, and local law enforcementagencies at locations throughout the country. This funding also includes $35 million for theAttorney General to enhance other intelligence gathering capabilities, including those of the Drug Enforcement Administration. \u007fCybercrime attacks against our critical infrastructure could result in major disruptions and economic loss. The budget strengthens the FBI's efforts to detect and prevent such attacks. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 205 \u007fThe northern border has become an attractive gateway for potential terrorists. The budget builds on 2002 initiatives for the northern border by adding enough resources to more thandouble the number of Border Patrol agents and inspectors and design and construct new Border Patrol and inspection facilities. Putting Technology on the Beat The 2003 Budget also expands ongoing efforts to correct the FBI's seriously deficient information technology infrastructure by providing $186 million for additional upgrades. While the FBI will continue to face information technology challenges beyond 2003, the funding that has been provided in 2002 and requested for 2003 will enable the FBI to enhance internal communications, upgradepersonal computers, and institute new security measures. Out with the Old... In with the New The FBI's basic information technology capabilities have fallen behind othergovernment agencies and the privatesector. Speedy personal computers arenot available to many FBI employees. Inefficient sharing and searching of information contained in the FBI'smany databases hinder investigations.Databases housing sensitive informationneed to be better protected fromexternal attacks and internal misuse, as evidenced by the loss of classified information to convicted spy RobertHanssen. The FBI is aggressivelycorrecting this situation, using a large infusion of funds provided in 2002. To be effective, law enforcement programs must be supported by a wide array of physical and technical capabilities and infrastructure. The budget includes a number of initiatives to improvecurrent capabilities. For example, the INS will modernize and expand its systems to control aliensentering and exiting the United States through visitors', temporary workers', and other visas. Also,FBI and DEA will improve safeguards that protect critical information systems from unauthorizedaccess or misuse. Also, the FBI will replace older fleet aircraft with newer, more sophisticated aircraft with advanced surveillance and investigative capability. The INS will increase its air surveillance fleet to enable more thorough coverage of border areas. The FBI and DEA willalso improve protection for their personnel, facilities, and information from attack and the U. S.Marshals Service will upgrade security at federal courthouses nationwide.206 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Border Security To address the gap in securing the nation's borders, the budget proposes a bold, new initiative. The Border Security Initiative brings additional law enforcement personnel together with advanced, state-of-the art technology and systems to better prevent illegal entry into the country, target persons who are a threat to homeland security, and assist with non-U.S. citizens entering and exiting thecountry. Components of this initiative include: \u007fImplementing a comprehensive entry/exit system to track the arrival and departure ofnon-U.S. citizens while speeding entry of routine, legitimate traffic and dramaticallyimproving our ability to deny access to those that should not enter. The new system will leverage advanced technology and construction investments to ensure a timely and secure flow of traffic; \u007fDeploying force-multiplying equipment, including remote operated infrared cameras, to monitor isolated areas where illegal entry may have once occurred; and \u007fIntegrating now-separate information systems to ensure timely, accurate, and complete enforcement data is available to the field. The Honor System Gone Haywire When Immigration inspectors close up shop, those who wish to cross the border are on their honorto either report to the unmanned video cameraor wait until morning. Prior to the September 11 thattacks, many northern border crossings were left unmannedovernight. So persons wishing to enter the U.S.legally were required to turn back and wait untilthe next morning or proceed, often many miles,to the nearest open port-of-entry. No effective border enforcement was in place at these locations. Today, as a result of emergencyfunding to cover overtime pay, all official border crossings are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing grant programs orthose that have outlived their usefulness, to those programs that support the fight against terrorismand ensure that our homeland is secure.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 207 Program Assessment Explanation Immigration enforcementModerately EffectiveImmigration enforcement activities have made progress in gaining control along specific sections of the Southwest border, resulting in a decrease in apprehensions. Yet, total illegal immigration, including people overstaying their visas, remains high. Immigration services Ineffective Unacceptably large application backlogs and lengthy processingtimes frustrate those who wish to legally enter the United States,unfairly disadvantaging them relative to undocumented immigrants.The Department is, however, making progress toward eliminating thebacklog by the end of 2003, but needs to ensure a thorough screening of all applicants for deficiencies. Community Oriented Policing Services(COPS)Unknown COPS grants have contributed to the spread of innovative policepractices. However, the net effect on police hiring and national andlocal crime rates is uncertain. Other State andLocal GrantProgramsUnknown The overall effect on crime is unknown because of widely varyingprogram objectives, the lack of performance measures, and therelatively small share of local criminal justice spending. Congressional earmarks also limit the Department's ability to target funding where it is needed most. Incarceration Effective Although the current supply of prison bed space is inadequate,alternative solutions are being utilized to address the problem.Additional prison capacity, either from new prison construction or thepurchase of private or other prison facilities, will r educe crowding levels and continue to provide secure and humane confinement for inmates.208 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Redirecting Funds from Outmoded, Underperforming Programs to New Initiatives To help offset the cost of increased funding for homeland security and counterterrorism in DOJ, the budget proposes reductions in grant and other departmental programs that have accomplishedtheir mission, failed to demonstrate a clear impact on crime, or have been extensively earmarked bythe Congress. State and Local Assistance Programs As discussed in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chapter, the budget requests $3.5 billion for FEMA to improve the terrorism preparedness of state and local first responders,including police, fire and emergency personnel. This represents a shift in priorities and fundingfrom Department of Justice grants, which are reduced by $1.2 billion. However, total federal aid tostate and local law enforcement will increase. 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 200304080120160 Source: State and local data from Bureau of Justice Statistics.In billions of dollarsSources of State and Local Law Enforcement Funding State LocalFederal Law EnforcementGrantsFederal FirstResponderGrantsIn recent years, departmental state and local assistance programs have included theState Criminal Alien Assistance Program(SCAAP), Byrne formula grants, LocalLaw Enforcement Block Grants, JuvenileAccountability Block Grants, and COPS hiring grants. Despite spending billions of dollars since 1994, virtually no evidence exists provingthat these programs have had an impact onthe nation's falling crime rate, and all lackverifiable measures of performance. SCAAP isnot even intended to reduce crime, but merely to reimburse state and local government expenditures. Nevertheless, the President'sBudget continues to support flexible grantfunding for state and local law enforcement by merging several of these block grants into a newJustice Assistance Grant Program with stronger emphasis on performance accountability. Thisprogram will be funded at $800 million. Alternatives to Prison Construction Between 1993 and 2001, the federal government has spent over $4 billion constructing new prisons. During that time, the federal prison population has grown by over 76 percent, from 88,565in 1993 to 156,572 in 2001. In response to rapid inmate growth, federal prison facilities grew from 72 in 1993 to 100 in 2001, with 18 additional institutions now underway. Purchase of excess private sector and other correctional facilities may offer an affordable alternative to federal construction of additional prison space. The Department will evaluate thefeasibility of purchasing private facilities for use by BOP. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 209 Other Changes to Improve Program Performance Congressional Earmarks Crime rates remain at their lowest level in over 25 years, and the Department continues to spend over $4 billion a year to help state and local governments prevent, investigate, prosecute, and punishcriminal behavior. While some programs that focus resources on high-crime areas have been effective,most of the several dozen Justice grant programs has not demonstrated a clear impact on crime.Their effectiveness and accountability have been further compromised by the congressional practice of earmarking funds for unrequested, non-competitive projects. In 2002, earmarked projects made up 15 percent of total grant funding and 32 percent of non-formula funding. Some programs were hit especially hard: 100 percent of the COPSLaw Enforcement Technology Program; 42 percent of the Methamphetamine Enforcement andClean-Up Initiative; 75 percent of Crime Identification Technology Act Grants; and 99 percentof the Safe Schools Initiative. The Edward Byrne discretionary grant program had 98 percent of its appropriation earmarked, including $2 million for a Rural Agricultural Crime Program in California; $1 million for a distance degree program at Excelsior College, N.Y.; and $3 million forthe Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Bi-State Public Safety Project in Idaho. The budget consolidates these programs, eliminates earmarks, and, as part of the President's Homeland Security initiative, funds efforts where all levels of law enforcement entities can combatthe threat of terrorism. Office of the Federal Detention Trustee The need for federal detention bed space has more than doubled in the last five years, from 32,000 detainees in 1996 to 67,000 detainees in 2001. This dramatic rise has resulted in anincreased reliance on state and local governments and private contractors to provide bed space for federal detainees. This year alone, the Department will spend $1.8 billion on federal detainees. Currently, the INS, USMS, and BOP detain prisoners, with little department-wide coordination.Previously, the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee was established to manage the risingdetainee population and exercise financial control and efficiency in federal detention operations.For 2003, the Administration proposes consolidating detention funding from INS and the FederalPrisoner Detention program under the Detention Trustee to improve financial accountability and ensure coordination throughout the department. This is the first crucial step toward achieving the Administration's goal of centralizing federal detention policy-making and funding and redresses thedisconnect between the Department's bureaus. Office of Domestic Preparedness The budget transfers the functions of the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to FEMA, together with $235 million in funding. ODP has provided anti-terrorism equipment grants andtraining for state and local first responders.210 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Timely Citizenship Bring Us Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Hungry ...A Promise of Better Service Thousands of people endure long waits at INS offices or at home for action on their immigrationapplication. Those waiting in line hope thattoday they can talk with an INS official and filean immigration application. Others wait at home for months and even years to hear from the INS. This is an unacceptable situation the immigrants to our country deserve better. By the end of 2003,the INS expects to achieve a six-month averageprocessing goal for all applications. In addition to securing the border, the INS is also responsible for processing immigration applications and petitions, such as \"green card\" or citizenship applications. Currently it takes onaverage 13 months for the INS to decide on an application for a green card.

Persons seeking citizenship wait 10 months on average. U.S. citizenship ceremony.The Administration is committed to building and maintaining an immigration service system that ensuresintegrity, provides timely and accurate services, andemphasizes a culture of respect. Last year, the Administrationlaunched a five-year initiative to provide quality serviceto all legal immigrants, citizens, businesses and other INS customers. To support this commitment, the INS has developed a five-year plan to eliminate the immigration benefit backlog,a component of which is to ensure the thorough screening ofall immigration applicants for deficiencies prior to their beingadmitted into the United States. The plan also provides for asix-month processing standard for all applications. In 2002, INS will implement several information technology initiatives to improve customer service, including providing on-line filingof multiple immigration applications. In addition, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the INS in achieving its mission, in November 2001 theAttorney General unveiled a restructuring plan for INS that will reform the agency's structure by separating its service and enforcement functions. The restructuring of INS fulfills President Bush's pledge to reform the agency by creating aclear division between INS' two vital missions\u2014service and enforcement.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 211 Election Reform Grants The budget includes $400 million in 2003 for a new DOJ matching grant program to enable state and local jurisdictions to take advantage of improved voting technologies and administration, including voting machines, registration systems, voter education, and poll worker training. This new program is consistent with the recommendations of a report on election reform issued by anational commission headed by former Presidents Ford and Carter. Strengthening Management In 2001, the Attorney General established the Strategic Management Council (SMC) to provide direction and leadership on strategic planning, resource management, and performance accountability. This \"corporate board\" now oversees the Department's resources and providesdirection and leadership for long-range planning. The SMC evaluates and prioritizes fundingrequests submitted by departmental bureaus and was instrumental in aligning the budget requestwith the Department's strategic goals and objectives. The Department is making progress inaddressing various President's Management Agenda initiatives. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014The Department submitted a workforce-restructuring plan that was developed prior to the attacks of September 11th. The plan did not address the following core criteria: human capital planning; standards for internal accountability systems; or acomprehensive citizen-centered, de-layered organizational structure. On November 8, 2001, the Attorney General announced a comprehensive reorganization to meet the counterterrorism mission. The Department's human capital strategy will be revised to address this new restructuring. The revised plan will ensure that the Department sustains a high-performing workforce that is continually improving in productivity and strategically usesexisting personnel, tools, and technology. Specifically, the revised plan will: 1) identify skillgaps and deficiencies; 2) describe strategies to reward high performers and address lowperformance; and 3) develop an outsourcing st rategy to accommodate the needs of displaced employees.\u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014The Department has not completed public-private or direct conversion competition for 15 percent of the government positions performing commercial functions. The Department has a competitive sourcing plan for achieving the five percent goal in 2002 and 15 percent by 2003, equating to 190 positions , based upon a 2000 commercial activities inventory of 1,264. Justice has increased the size of its commercial activities inventory from onepercent in 2000, to over nine percent of its total workforce. The Department needs to continueto identify additional positions that could be added to its commercial activities inventory. \u007f212 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Initiative 2001 Status Financial Management \u2014The Department is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act. The Department also does not meet federal accounting standards related to property accounting. Since the Department has material system non-conformances, it cannot provide a clean assurance statement about its controls.Justice received a clean opinion on two of its financial statements (i.e., the balance sheet andstatement of custodial activity) and a qualified opinion on the remaining statements for 2000,due to lingering accounting problems at the INS. The Department has made progress in addressing issues identified by its auditor during the course of its annual financial audit. Justice expects to receive an unqualified opinion for 2001. In addition, DOJ will move forward to migrate its components from old financial systems tonew systems that meet applicable standards. \u007f E-Government \u2014The Department has a number of significant and pervasive information technology security weaknesses. In spite of recent progress, significant work remains to carry out a capital planning process fully. Justice's timetable calls for all bureaus to have completedplans by the end of 2002. To ensure system compatib ility and improve information sharing and security, Justice's enterprise architecture efforts must be a high priority throughout the Department. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014The Department does not have a performance plan that is tied to specific outputs, outcomes, or activities. There is no clear linkage between resourcelevels and outcomes. On November 8, 2001, the Attorney General announced a series of goals and management initiatives that reflect the changed priorities of the Department. These goals include revising the Department of Justice Performance plan to include clear, consistent performance measuresthat support the Department's Strategic Plan. The Department will focus on revising its planand on improving the linkages between resources and outputs/outcomes in budget formulationand execution. In addition, the Department wil l demonstrate how performance influences budget decisions. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 213 Department of Justice (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Federal Bureau of Investigation ............................................................ 4,415 4,744 4,605 U.S. U.S. Attorneys ........................................................................... 1,303 and Less Crime Victims Fund delay3.......................................... \u2014\u2014 1,261 Remove contingent adjustments .......................................... 440 465 492 Total, Discretionary budget authority ......................................... 21,192 21,461 21,318 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: Federal Bureau of Investigation ............................................. 37 785 \u2014 Immigration and Naturalization Service ................................ \u20145 8 4 \u2014 Office of Justice Programs ...................................................... \u20141 9\u2014 All other programs .................................................................... 41 0 3 \u2014 Total, Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ...... 41 2,191 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: Immigration and 2,091 September 1,998 2,576 2,605 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 45 51 54 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 571 1,807 4,668 1In 2003, $615 million is transferred from INS to the Detention Trustee, and is included in the \"All Other Programs\" total. 2Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewin g programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget generally seeks to redirect funds from poorly performing programs to more effective ones. The table that follows shows the status of some DOL programs. 215216 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Program Assessment Explanation Job Corps Effective Residential program for disadvantaged youth is a cost-effective investment, despite its high cost per participant-slot ($31,700 per year). It increases their lifetime earnings. Bureau of Labor Statistics Effective Produces accurate, timely, and pertinent data andhas considerably improved the accuracy of its priceindexes. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Effective In insuring certain pensions against companybankruptcy, between 2000 and 2002, it shortened the time it takes to calculate affected workers' final benefits by almost two years. One-Stop Career Centers Unknown Grant program helps fund local one-stopemployment centers nationwide but has not beenevaluated. Employment Service Unknown Currently rates its performance only in terms ofservices provided to job seekers, but is developing measures based on whether job seekers find work. Veterans' Employment and Training ServiceIneffective Unnecessary overhead. Duplicative bureaucracymonitors another employment program, rather thanhelping veterans find and retain jobs. H-1B Technical Skills Training Grants Ineffective Does not raise skills of U.S. workers in specialtyand high-tech jobs so that employers' demandfor temporary alien workers with H-1B visas will decline. Alien Labor Certification Ineffective Processing employer applications for permanent certification is labor intensive and takes up to sixyears. Federal and state reviews are redundant. Prevailing Wage DeterminationSystems (Davis-Bacon and ServiceContract Acts)Ineffective Paper-intensive, user-unfriendly processes requiremodernization.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 217 Comprehensive Reform of Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service The Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Service (ES) system needs reform. The Administration proposes short- and long-term reforms that promote flexibility and strengthen the critical unemployment insurance and employment services that states provide to America's workers and employers. Near-term reforms are designed to meet the immediate needs of unemployed workers during the current economic slowdown. The Administration supports an economic security package in 2002 thatincludes: \u007fExtended Unemployment Benefits. A temporary extension of up to 13 weeks of unemployment benefits would be available in all states. \u007fImmediate distribution of billions in Reed Act funds. States would receive $9 billion in excess funds in the U.S. Treasury's Unemployment Trust Fund, some of which are scheduled to be distributed on October 1, 2002. These funds could be used to expand benefits and services, shore up low reserves in state trust funds, or allow a cut in employer payroll taxes. Consistent with these immediate reforms, the Administration's long-term vision will make unemployment insurance benefits and employment services more responsive to the needs of workersand employers, give states needed flexibility, and promote economic growth. This long-term reformconnects the principles articulated in the President's economic security package with the long-term reforms needed for workers, employers, and states, which have clamored for change for the past decade. For example: \u007fWorkers argue that it is currently too difficult for states to \"trigger\" extra weeks of UI benefitsduring a recession. \u007fEmployers complain that their federal unemployment taxes are too high, and that too few oft h o s ef u n d sg ob a c kt os t a t e st or u nt h eU Ia n dE Sp r o g r a m s . \u007fStates are frustrated that current funding arrangements have hampered their ability toprovide timely, accurate benefits and effective reemployment services. The Administration's long-term reforms will address these concerns by: \u007fEnabling more workers to receive Extended UI Benefits, by making the program more responsive to unemployment swings. \u007fReducing employers' federal payroll taxes, spurring economic expansion. \u007fAllowing states to control their own administrative funding, which will help improve thetimeliness and accuracy of benefit payments, and target more resources on preventing anddetecting overpayments. The Administration's reform proposal includes five components. They are: 1. Reforming Extended Benefits (EB). In many states, it is currently very difficult to \"trigger on\" EB during a recession. The Administration's proposal would make EB more responsive to unemployment swings, while continuing to pay half the cost of EB. 2. Cutting FUTA taxes. The Administration proposes to cut the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) payroll tax by 25 percent in 2003, with gradual reductions over the next four years. Beginning in 2007, FUTA will be maintained at 0.2 percent of the first $7,000 in wages, compared with 0.8 percent currently.218 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 3. Allowing states to finance UI and ES operations. Currently, state taxes pay for unemployment benefits. The federal government pays the cost of administering the UI and ES programs.Under the Administration's proposal, states would use their existing UI taxes to finance UI and ES administration, and tailor unemployment and employment services to meet the unique needs of their workers and employers. 4. Ensuring a smooth transition. During the five-year transition, the Administration would help states implement the funding changes by providing billions from the U.S. Treasury's Unemployment Trust Fund. In addition, phased implementation would allow states ampletime to enact any necessary legislation. 5. Continuing loans to states. To ensure that no worker would be denied UI benefits because of funding shortfalls, the federal government would continue to provide loans to any state thatruns short of funds to pay unemployment benefits. With the Administration's short- and long-term reforms, states will be well positioned to respond immediately to changing economic conditions and better serve workers through a strengthenedunemployment insurance and employment service system. Reform of Federal Job Training Programs The President's commitment to providing employment and training services to dislocated workers is reflected in the Administration's bipartisan support of a economic security plan, throughwhich $4 billion would be available in 2002-2003 through the National Emergency Grants (NEG)program. Besides providing job training and reemployment services, states could also use these funds to provide targeted assistance for dislocated workers with distinctive needs, including additional assistance with health care costs. The flexible, targeted NEG program will providecustomized assistance to help dislocated workers make the transition through a difficult period andreturn to work as quickly as possible. Although the Administration is committed to providing the services for dislocated workers as soon as they are needed, estimates indicate that about $3 billion of the NEG funds from the bipartisan economic security plan will be carried forward into 2003. In addition, $1.3 billion in unspent resources will be carried forward from state formula grant training and employment programs, and the 2003Budget includes $5 billion for the programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Asa result, more than $9.3 billion will be available for investments in job training and other dislocatedworker services in 2003. This is 36 percent more than is expected to be spent through these programsin 2002. (See table on unexpended resources and the bipartisan economic security plan.) As a result, total available resources could support approximately 500,000 to 800,000 more participants than the 2.2 million participants expected in the WIA programs in 2002.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 219 Unexpended Resources and the Bipartisan Economic Security Plan Allow Large Increase in Investments in Job Training and Other Dislocated Worker Services Budgetary Resources (In millions of dollars) 2001 Amount Spent ............................................................................... 4,525 2002 New Budget Authority .................................................................. 5,631 Unspent from prior years ............................................................ 1,532 National Emergency Grants (NEGs)\u2014Bipartisan Economic Security Plan ............................................................................4,000 Total ...................................................................................... 11,163 Amount expected to be spent1................................................... 6,827 Amount expected not to be spent .................................................. 4,336 2003 New Budget Authority .................................................................. 4,976 Unspent from prior years ............................................................

While the Administration is supporting a large near-term increase in funds for dislocated worker assistance, the 2003 Budget is launching a long-term reform of the federal government'soverlapping training and employment programs. The federal government has at least 48 trainingand employment programs scattered around 10 agencies. Although the programs vary considerably,their common goal is to improve participants' employment and earnings. However, no consistent measure exists to compare results across these programs. Definitions vary, data quality is uneven and collected using different statistical techniques. Many federal training programs tend to adopteasy performance measures (such as participants served) rather than outcomes like landing andkeeping a job or earnings increases.220 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR The Federal Government's Multiple Job Training Programs Agency (and selected programs)Number of ProgramsTarget Group2003 (In millions of dollars)Cost Per Participant 2002 2003 Department of Labor ........................... 17 9 6,892 Dislocated Workers ............................

The proposed reforms would reduce the number of job training programs from 48 to 28 (see table on federal job training programs). Reforms include: The Job Corps provides students with skills that help them secure jobs such as electrical technician.\u007fExpanding an effective program. The 2003 Budget proposes $1.5 billion forJob Corps, a residential vocationaltraining program for disadvantagedyouth. Although Job Corps is DOL's costliest program, with a unit cost of roughly $31,700 per service year,research has demonstrated that it is acost-effective federal investment. The2003 Budget provides a five percentincrease above 2002, increases funding for teacher pay and new centers, and supports 122 residential trainingcenters\u2014an increase of four centersover 2001-2002. \u007fReauthorizing WIA. In 2003, the WIA's authorization expires, providing the Administration an opportunity to evaluate critically thecurrent program structure, financing, and performance. The Administration will undertakethat work in the coming year, and the 2004 Budget will outline a proposal to further consolidatetraining programs. National Skill Standards Board The National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) is intended to help industries develop voluntary skill standards for occupations in 15 industry clusters.Since its inception in 1995, NSSB has spent $45million to help create sta ndards in occupations that include bellboys, bus boys, and waiters.The 28-page standard for bus boys includes detailed instructions for clearing tables. The manufacturing industry standard includes as askill \"be depended on not to steal equipment andmaterials.\" The 2003 Budget terminates fundingfor the NSSB.\u007fTransferring veterans' employment programs to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The 2003 Budget will transfer $197 million to VA that DOLcurrently uses to finance three veteransemployment programs. This proposalwould implement a recommendationof the 1999 Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, which concludedthat DOL's programs do not serveveterans well. With VA demonstratingits commitment by demandingemployment results, the programs will better serve veterans' employment needs. \u007fClosing ineffective programs. The 2003 Budget will end funding for several training programs that have a history of poor performance, or where the federal role is inappropriate. For example, no funding isrequested for the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker program, which has demonstratedlittle success in helping these low-income workers secure good jobs outside of agriculture.Roughly three-fourths of this program's participants never enroll in training. The population222 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR previously served by this program is eligible for the WIA Adult Activities program, the Migrant High School Equivalency Program (HEP) and College Assistance Migrant Program(CAMP), which help migrant students complete high school and succeed in college. The budget also ceases funding for the National Skill Standards Board, whose funding for industry skill standards has not been a cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars. Reform of Worker Benefit Programs Through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), DOL provides benefits to individuals who are unable to work due to occupational injury or illness. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) and Black Lung Benefits Act (Black Lung) programs provide cash and medical benefits along with rehabilitation services to disabled federal employees and coal miners,respectively. DOL's Inspector General and others have proposed reforms for the FECA program to identify and prevent fraud, reduce the number of frivolous claims, and improve customer service. The Black LungDisability Trust Fund, from which Black Lung benefits are paid, faces a mounting $8 billion debt. In 2002, the Trust Fund's interest payments on its debt alone will not only surpass the program's benefit and administrative costs, but also its total excise tax revenues. FECA improvements. In 2003, the budget proposes four reforms to improve FECA's management. They include changes to: \u007fStrengthen program integrity. In 2003, OWCP will continue efforts to review claimants periodically to: determine if claimants still are unable to work; prevent overpayments to individuals and medical providers; and review the appropriateness of medical services. Periodic claims reviews have saved an estimated $500 million since 1992. \u007fImplement \"full cost\" budgeting for FECA. The budget amends FECA to allow DOL to add an administrative surcharge to the amount billed to federal agencies for their FECA compensation costs. This change requires that federal agencies bear the full costs(administrative as well as benefit) of their employees' FECA claims, bolstering their incentiveto improve workplace safety. \u007fDiscourage frivolous claims. T h eb u d g e tp r o p o s e st oa m e n dF E C At om o v et h ew a i t i n gp e r i o d for benefits to immediately following an injury, and apply it to all claims in line with everystate workers' compensation system. This change would deter illegitimate claims. \u007fPromote benefit equity. Because FECA benefits are tax-free, they are, on average, about 25 percent more generous than an individual could receive under the federal retirement system,possibly providing an incentive for individuals to remain on the FECA rolls past when theywould otherwise have retired. The budget does not propose to reduce the benefits of anycurrent FECA beneficiaries. However, for future FECA beneficiaries, the budget proposes to change the program so that individuals over age 65 receive the same benefits as are available under federal retirement programs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 223 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006024681012Black Lung Disability Trust Fund Debt In billions of dollars Source: Department of Labor.Black Lung reforms. The 2003 Budget will attack two longstanding problems in theBlack Lung program. The Administration will: \u007fRestructure the debt. In the program's early years, Black Lung's excise taxrevenue was not enough to fund theprogram, so DOL borrowed fromt h eT r e a s u r yt oc o v e rt h es h o r t f a l l .Although excise tax revenue has generally been sufficient to cover medical and income support costssince 1990, the revenue has not beensufficient to cover the interest paymentsdue on Treasury borrowing dating from1978. To date, DOL has repaid none of the principal and has been forced to borrow additional funds just to meet its interest payments on what has grown to be an $8 billion debt (see accompanying chart). TheAdministration will propose legislation to restructure the Trust Fund's debt, prevent furthergrowth, and eventually retire it. \u007fConsolidate administration. The budget proposes to consolidate administration of all Black Lung benefit cases in DOL, relieving the Social Security Administration of the duty toadminister claims filed prior to 1974 and improving administrative efficiency. Promoting Voluntary Compliance with Labor Laws Easing DOL 's Regulatory Burden A key part of helping employers comply with regulatory requirements is ensuring that the regulations are reasonableand comprehensible. OSHA's \"means of egress\" rule setsrequirements for emergency exits but is filled with jargon onlyan attorney could love. The rule warns employers that no\"furnishings, decorations, or other objects shall be so placed as to obstruct exits, access thereto, egress therefrom, or visibility thereof,\" rather than saying simply that emergency exits mustnot be blocked. OSHA is simplifying its rules to cut out jargonand make them understandable to small businesses. Also,DOL is reviewing all regulations it planned to impose onsmall and large businesses, states and localities, community organizations, and the public to remove rules that are outdated or overly burdensome. As a result, DOL has reduced by 25percent the number of regulatory actions it has planned for thenext year.DOL enforces more than 180 worker protection laws. However, its \"cop on the beat\" activities have their limits. The OccupationalSafety and Health Administration(OSHA), for example, can conductabout 36,000 inspections peryear. Although the number looks impressive, it also means that the agency can reach eachworkplace only once every 167years. Through its electroniccompliance assistance tools,however, OSHA can help millions of employers assess and improve the safety of their workplaces.Helping employers to comply withworkplace laws and regulationsis DOL's most cost-effective wayto protect workers from on-the-job injuries and illnesses.224 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Compliance assistance tools, such as self-audits, are designed to encourage employers to voluntarily correct violations before employees are hurt. If given clear, timely, and accurateinformation on legal and regulatory requirements, the vast majority of employers will comply voluntarily. On-line tools, as well as training and technical assistance, help employers and workers understand labor laws and requirements. For example, \"eTools\" are Web-based, menu-drivenmodules designed to help employers put occupational safety and health regulations into effect.The 2003 Budget request includes an estimated $188 million for compliance assistance efforts ofOSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Pension and Welfare BenefitsAdministration (PWBA). Improving Performance Wide-ranging reforms proposed in the 2003 Budget are designed to improve performance of many of DOL's existing programs and attack longstanding problems. DOL's program to certify foreign workers as eligible for permanent employment in the United S t a t e sc a nt a k ee m p l o y e ra p p l i c a n t su pt os i xy e a r st on a v i g a t ea st h e yc o m p l e t et h ep a p e r w o r k that allows prospective workers to petition for work-based visas. While this complex, labor-intensive process drags on, applications pile up and many foreign workers awaiting certification are employedin violation of U.S. laws. The Administration is taking action to overhaul this broken program andproposing legislation in the 2003 Budget to redirect certain existing employer application fees toeliminate the large backlogs. The new application process is expected to take three weeks for mostapplications and a maximum of six months' processing time for certification applications that are audited. The Administration proposes a two-pronged solution that would: H-1B Training Grants The H-1B Training Grant Program is supposed to train U.S. workers for jobs in which labor shortages havecaused employers to hire foreign workers through theH-1B visa program. These highly educated workerstypically work in the high-tech and health care industries.Unfortunately, DOL's $138 million H-1B Training program, which is financed through a $1,000 fee paid by employers, never has filled and has no prospect of filling these l abor shortages. At times, funds wind up training workers fordecidedly low-tech jobs. One grant financed trainingfor cable installers; another trained licensed practicalnurses; while a third was open only to union members in the entertainment industry. The budget will take the program's H-1B fees funding and redirect it to eliminatelarge backlogs in the permanent alien labor program,thereby better serving workers and employers alike.\u007fIntroduce regulatory reform. During 2002, DOL will proposeregulations to reform thepermanent alien labor certificationprogram and prevent futurebacklogs by automating application processing and reducing the state workload after 2003. DOLstaff would assume processingresponsibilities, and mostdeterminations would be madewithin 21 days of the date an application is filed. \u007fRedirect H-1B fees. Legislation would redirect the portion of DOL's revenues from the existing H-1B fee that currently supportsan ineffective training grantprogram. The $138 million grantsprogram\u2014which has provenTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 225 ineffective\u2014would be redirected to clear the backlog for the permanent certification program at the state and federal levels. Strengthening Management Erroneous Unemployment Insurance Benefit Payments In 2001, the Unemployment Insurance system paid $27 billion in benefits to unemployedworkers. DOL estimates that benefitoverpayments were about $2.3 bi llion\u2014or approximately $200 per beneficiary. An IG investigation found that a Las Vegas man created13 fictitious companies and submitted UI claimsfor 36 fictitious claimants. He was sentenced toprison and ordered to pay $230,500 in restitution.In 2003, DOL will continue to address its management challenges to further its contributions to a strong U.S. workforce.Secretary Chao is aggressively implementingthe President's Management Agenda. InAugust 2001, the Secretary created theManagement Review Board (MRB) to combat agency decentralization and ensure a coordinated, Department-wide approachto promoting management reforms. MRB'saccomplishments include an overhaul of DOL'sperformance appraisal system for managersand executives to evaluate personnel against progress on management agenda items. In addition, MRB is consolidating DOL'sdisparate e-mail systems to improve efficiency and customer service. Stewardship of taxpayer funds requires systematic policies and procedures to ensure sound financial management of federal programs. In the UI program, DOL and the states operateprograms to detect and pursue recovery of overpayments, but more work must be done. The 2003 Budget includes two proposals to cut UI waste and fraud. First, $2 million is requested for the Inspector General to uncover fraudulent benefits schemes and train states to detect and reduceoverpayments. Second, $10 million is requested to finance state efforts to use existing databases toeliminate fraudulent payments to employed workers, illegal aliens, and fictitious employers. DOL is actively implementing the President's faith-based and community initiative. It aims to improve delivery of social services by drawing on the strengths of faith-based and community groups and ensuring that these organizations compete for federal grant funds on a level playing field. To encourage greater competition and participation in DOL's grant programs by these organizations,DOL scrutinized its program applications to strip away barriers. For instance, DOL discovered thatunder the Women in Apprenticeships and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) program, applicantswere required to demonstrate a \"history of commitment to economic and social justice.\" DOL droppedthis ambiguous and restrictive language, and received 37 applications, more than twice the average received in recent years. Of the 11 grant recipients, four were new applicants who never had received a WANTO grant. One of the new grantees is the Access Agency of Willimantic, Connecticut, whichis connecting Spanish-speaking women to language programs and employers for career-ladder jobopportunities.226 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014DOL has completed a Workforce Restructuring Plan that demonstrates its full awareness of certain sk ills and performance gaps, and is taking action to address its needs. DOL has overhauled the performance appraisal system for its 2,100 managers and seniorexecutives. Also, DOL effectively uses succession planning, and retention and recruitmentbonuses to retain and hire effective employees. In 2003, DOL will implement significantrestructuring to better align its workforce with its mission. It will eliminate 373 positions that are unnecessary, resulting in savings of $31 million. It also will consolidate five duplicative public affairs offices in DOL 's agencies into the Secretary's Office, eliminating nine positions atsavings of $1 million. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014DOL has not effectively examined its workforce to determine all the tasks that its employees perform that are available commercially, including certain administrative and financial activities. Further, DOL has not identified activities necessary to meet the Administration's 2002 or 2003 competitive-sourcing targets. Possible areas toconsider include training specialists, administrative personnel, and claims processing clerks. Toget on track and take advantage of competitive sourcing, DOL will reevaluate all of its positionsand reclassify some so that only those positions that are truly \"inherently governmental\" areremoved from consideration for competitive sourcing. DOL also will finalize its plan to compete or directly convert at least 140 positions in 2002 and 280 in 2003 to meet the Administration's two-year 15 percent goal, in an effort to eventually competitively source 50 percent of itscommercial activities. \u007f Financial Management \u2014Although DOL has received \"unqualified\" opinions from independent auditors on its financial statements since 1997, it has identified two small systems in its Wage & Hour Division that do not comply with accepted federal standards for financial management andinternal controls. Recognizing the importance of financially sound systems, DOL will correctthese problems in 2002. DOL will improve its oversight of the performance of its grantees andcontractors and increase its auditing and technical assistance to states to identify fraud andreduce erroneous payments in Unemployment Insurance.\u007f E-Government \u2014DOL 's information technology (IT) is built on a strong enterprise architecture and planning process. DOL is the only federal agency with Department-wide IT financing toensure that its investments are cost-effective and serve the entire organization mission. DOLhas used IT to serve citizens better. For example, OSHA accepts health and safety complaintsover the Internet; individuals can use the Internet to discover lost pensions; and a pilot project allows people to calculate approximate retirement benefits on line. In 2003, DOL will continue to lead a government-wide project for Eligibility Assistance On line, which provides citizenseasier access to information on benefits and services for which they are eligible. DOL also willincrease opportunities for citizens, businesses, and unions to electronically file claims, reports,and other documents for programs and benefits administered throughout much of DOL.\u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 227 Initiative 2001 Status Budget/Performance Integration \u2014The data that DOL collects are often of poor quality and reliability. Also, often data are not available soon en ough to tie funding to performance. Much of the data come from states and localities, and the challenges that DOL faces are due inpart to problems there. Starting in 2002, DOL will integrate planning and budgeting in itsannual performance plan. It will demonstrate significant progress toward aligning programs'funding with their performance. In that spirit, DOL will work with other agencies, including the Department of Education, to develop a crosscutting performance measure for all federal job training programs.

The foreign affairs functions of the U.S. Government are carried out through a complex structure of agencies\u2014with foreign policy and diplomatic relations led by the Department of State; development assistan ce led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); international finance led by the Department of the Treasury; international trade and investment finance by the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Tradeand Development Agency; international broadcasting by the Broadcasting Board of Governors; andother functions carried out by a number of other agencies, including the Peace Corps. The Secretaryof State is responsible to the President. 229230 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS For 2003, the President's Budget includes $24.3 billion for these functions, a $1 billion increase over the $23.3 billion appropriated for 2002. Increased funding has been allocated based on threebroad goals: 1) to support our highest priority foreign policy objectives, especially the war on terrorism; 2) to enhance security for American personnel and facilities; and 3) to advance the effort to connect resources to performance. In pursuing the first objective, the budget includes $5.2 billionfor programs that are essential in pursuing the war on terrorism. The President's Budget also addresses the management challenges of our complex foreign affairs structure to eliminate redundancies, improve the delivery of foreign assistance, and strengthenthe administration of foreign affairs. As examples, the budget launches an initiative to assure that the money taxpayers contribute to pay the high cost of stationing employees of more than 30 government agencies overseas is well managed. The budget seeks to deploy the right agencies withthe most efficient number of people serving overseas advancing U.S. interests. The budget alsoconsolidates most food aid programs under USAID, in order to ensure that U.S. food aid is deliveredas efficiently and effectively as possible to feed hungry people. And, as with other agencies in thefederal government, it sets forth a comprehensive agenda for strengthening management in the Department of State and USAID. DEPARTMENT OF STATE Department of State Colin Powell, Secretary www.state.gov 202-647-4000 Number of Employees : 28,967 Number of Embassies and Posts Abroad :2 6 0 2002 Spending : $15.9 billionThe State Department represents the United States in 180 foreign countries and 43international organizations, operating a totalof 260 embassies, consulates, and other posts.The past year has been a period of significant foreign policy achievement for the Bush Administration. The Administration has abroad, comprehensive foreign policy agendafor the future. In addition to the President'sspecific proposals, the State Department willemphasize efforts to: \u007fMaintain and strengthen the international coalition to fight global terrorism in all its forms; \u007fMaintain our core alliance relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),Japan, Australia, and the Republic of Korea; \u007fIntegrate Russia and China into cooperative frameworks to improve our relations and therebyhelp prevent the revival of destructive great power rivalries; \u007fPrevent conflict and promote reconciliation in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, NortheastAsia, and South Asia; \u007fCombat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; \u007fEnlist new support from Pakistan and other countries in the region for our efforts in Afghanistan, and assist the Pakistani government through diplomatic support and economic assistance; \u007fHelp open markets, encourage investment, promote environmentally sound development, and expand economic opportunities around the world; andTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 231 \u007fPromote human rights and democracy and further basic American values, including freedom of religion. Overview The State Department is the lead agency in formulating and implementing U.S. foreign policy. Since September 11, 2001, the Department's top priority has been the war on terrorism.The Department has led the effort to build and manage the broad-based international coalitionthat helped defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and is now destroying the al Qaeda terroristnetwork around the world. The Department also diplomatically supported the creation of a post-war government for Afghanistan in 2001 and continues to lead the international community in developing programs to provide humanitarian relief, security, and economic reconstructionassistance to help the Afghan people create a more peaceful, prosperous, and free future. While the war on terrorism is our top foreign policy priority, the President has stressed that it cannot be our only one. We live in an age of tremendous opportunities to advance America'sinterests. The Department will continue to promote the Administration's broad foreign policy agenda. In addition, the Department administers some foreign aid programs, such as the counternarcotics program in Colombia. To help preserve America's essential openness, the State Department alsoplays a critical role in facilitating safe travel to and from the United States. Every year the StateDepartment issues seven million passports to U.S. citizens so they can travel abroad, and it processesover 10 million visa applications submitted by those wishing to visit our country. Some of the Department's core programs, such as issuing visas or passports, are tangible and measurable. In government-wide customer satisfaction surveys, the Department's services to p a s s p o r ta p p l i c a n t ss c o r eh i g hi na l lo ft h ea r e a sm e a s u r e d ,w i t ha no v e r a l ls c o r eo f7 6o nas c a l eo f1-100, which is five points higher than the national American Customer Satisfaction Index scorefor private sector services. Other programs, however, are intrinsically more difficult to evaluate,such as those that promote democracy and human rights. For these programs, successes\u2014such assupport for the transition from authoritarian to democratic rule in Serbia and Peru\u2014are the best, but admittedly infrequent, measures of effectiveness.232 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS War on Terrorism President Bush addressing the United Nations, November 10, 2001.Funding in 2003 for the Department of State, USAID, the Department of the Treasury, and other agencies with foreign relations responsibilities concentrates onsustaining current partnerships and buildingnew relationships as the war against terrorexpands around the globe. As the frontshifts, the United States must be prepared to help countries strengthen their internal counter-terrorism capabilities. We must tailorprograms to meet specific local needs so thatterrorists can find no safe haven, no openfinancial or geographic border. This taskis both large and long term. It will require support for a wide range of programs from blocking terrorist assets and combating moneylaundering to improving management of border controls, including increased cooperation among border agencies to share data and guaranteethe integrity and reliability of visas used to enter the United States. The United States will seek toimprove the capabilities of those who agree to share our burden in the war against terrorism. This budget provides roughly $3.5 billion for economic and security assistance, equipment, and training for states on the frontline of this war. We will defeat the terrorists by destroying their network, wherever it is found. We will also defeat the terrorists by building an enduring prosperity that promises more opportunity and better lives for all the world's people. President George W. Bush October 20, 2001Strengthening counter-terrorism cap- abilities alone will not be enough. As we learned in Afghanistan, terrorists seek refugeand build support where the rule of law anddemocracy have been destroyed or failed. Ifwe are to succeed, our commitment to endterrorism must integrate counter-terrorism initiatives with programs that tackle the desperate conditions which fuel violent,transnational extremism in many countries. In addition to offering our friends and allies help, the United States must accelerate efforts to protect Americans serving and traveling abroad.Al Qaeda bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998\u2014which killed over 200 people and injured thousands\u2014marked a new level of destructiveness in its terror campaign. In the World Trade Center and other attacks, Americans lost their lives alongside people from dozens ofnations and ethnic and religious backgrounds.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 233 New U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya under construction after al Qaeda bombing.While the State Department continues to conduct its normal diplomatic work, itspersonnel and those of other U.S. agencies now carry the added burden of serving in the frontline of the war on terrorism. Accordingly,the State Department is expanding itsinvestment in security with nearly $1.4 billionprovided in this budget. Of this amount,$837 million is for the State Department and USAID to continue to expand the worldwide security upgrade program launched in thewake of the 1998 embassy bombings. Therequested funding will construct nine newembassies plus purchase armored vehicles,communications gear and other equipment. Some additional key elements from the President's anti-terrorism agenda are: Jordan Strategically located along the borders of both Iraq and Syria, Jordan will be provided substantial new resources in 2003 to strengthen its securitycapacity and enhance its economic potential.The President is requesting $198 million inForeign Military Financing (FMF) and $250 millionin Economic Support Funds (ESF), increases of $123 million and $100 million respectively over 2002. The money will be used to improve bordercontrols targeting the flow of weapons, includingweapons of mass destruction; and to supportfinancial training, trade and investment and tostrengthen educational opportunities.\u007fAfghanistan assistance: The United States worked with our allies and the anti-Taliban Afghan groups to establish a broad-based interim governmentin Afghanistan. The United Statesremains committed to helping thepeople of Afghanistan rebuild and enjoylong-term stability. We will continue to provide food and development assistance. At the January pledgingconference in Tokyo, the U.S. committed$296 million to support these efforts.As Secretary of State Colin Powellstated, the United States has \"an enormous obligation to not leave the Afghan people in the lurch, to not walkaway as has been done in the past.\" \u007fAnti-terrorism assistance: $121 million is being provided for counterterrorism engagement programs, training, and equipment tohelp other countries fight global terror. As part of this commitment, the President seeks $52million to establish a Center for Anti-terrorism and Security Training (CAST). Once it isfully operational, the CAST will train 7,500 American and coalition partner law enforcementpersonnel annually in advanced anti-terrorism and security measures, thereby enhancing security of U.S. interests abroad.234 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Andean Counterdrug Initiative All of the cocaine sold on America's streets comes from South America. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) provides assistance to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela for drug eradication, interdiction, economic development, and development of government institutions. The President's 2003 request for ACI is $731 million. This assistance boosts the impactof U.S. domestic law enforcement and supports the Andean governments' efforts to destroy local cocacrops and processing labs. Since 2000, U.S. assistance has provided 76 helicopters for the Colombiannational police and army, giving the Colombians airlift and reach into areas previously inaccessible.In 2001, the Colombian army and police destroyed over 700 cocaine base labs, where the first stage of cocaine processing occurs, and 20 cocaine HCl labs, where the final active ingredient in cocaine is extracted. Data is not yet available to determine the program's effect on overall coca cultivationand flow of cocaine into the United States. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 20000100200300400500600 Source: The Department of State.Coca cultivation in thousands of acresReduction in Andean Coca Cultivation PeruColombia BoliviaIn addition to the State Department's law enforcement programs, USAID has launchedalternative crop development and voluntary coca eradication programs with the goal of eliminating about 37,000 hectares (91,000acres) of illegal crops. USAID also has fundedits 18 thcasa de justicia . This program funds community level legal services to Colombia'spoorest people. In a country with significant human rights abuses and gaps in the rule of law, legal solutions are urgent everydayrequirements. In 2003, the budget will extend the reach of counter-narcotics brigades in southernColombia while beginning training of new units to protect the country's economic lifeline, an oil pipeline. In 2001, Colombia was the source of about two percent of U.S. oil imports, creating a mutual interest in protecting this economic asset. The United States has devoted considerable resources to reducing coca cultivation in the Andes and had achieved modest results by the end of 2000, the last year for which data is available (seeaccompanying chart). The State Department is expected to define clear benchmarks for evaluatingthe impact of U.S. assistance and the current strategy. The effectiveness of this strategy will become clearer when the State Department releases its assessment of 2001 coca cultivation in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report in March 2002. Congressional Earmarks A large proportion of foreign assistance funding for programs implemented by the Department of State or USAID are subject to Congressional earmarks, which are either specific requirements in the appropriations bill itself or language in the report that normally accompanies an appropriations bill. The majority of these earmarks set in law or report language the amounts and priorities that theAdministration requests. Only a small proportion require the Administration to fund projects that itwould otherwise not have implemented. While the number of these decreased somewhat in the 2002Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, additional reductions in 2003 will be useful.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 235 Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs on an objective to higher priority or more effective programs focused on that objective. The table below rates the performance of some important State Department programs that are either effective ortargeted for rapid improvement. Program Assessment Explanation International Law EnforcementProgramsUnknown Data does not exist to measure program impact. Program evaluationmethodology to be developed. Humanitarian Demining Program (HDP)Effective To help evaluate how well the program is working, the HDP identified outcome-based indicators, such as mines removed, area of land declared mine-free and the percentage reduction in reported civilianlandmine casualties. This program also uses performance-basedcontracting. PassportModernization Effective State's Bureau of Consular Affairs completely revamped passporttechnology and systems in a short period of time. Regarding customer service for passport services, the Bureau has scored well in American Customer Satisfaction Index surveys in both 1999 and 2000. Educational andCultural ExchangeProgramsModerately EffectiveSurveys of changes in attitude and professional decisions made by alumni demonstrate the program's impact. For example, nineindependent external surveys of alumni indicate that the ExchangeBureau programs succeed in conveying knowledge (88 percent),building relationships with the United States (76-82 percent), altering the behavior of participants (73 percent), and benefiting the larger community or organization (76 percent). The Bureau's competitionof grants, recruiting, tracking, and networking of participants andsolicitation of feedback on program effectiveness are worthy ofemulation. Despite its overall success, the Bureau needs moredetailed performance benchmarks for measurement and stronger monitoring of expenditures by grant recipients.236 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Program Assessment Explanation Economic Assistance to RussiaSome Moderately Effective, SomeIneffectiveSince 1992, the United States has spent over $2.9 b illion on non-security assistance to Russia. The results have been mixed. Progress in building the foundations of an efficient market economy has been slower than anticipated. For much of the 1990'sgovernment-to-government technical assistance programs haddisappointing results. But when assistance was properly structured,as in the cases of tax and judicial reform as well as local governmentbudgeting, it had important impacts. Also during the 1990's, enterprise funds and some training programs did not perform according to expectations. High school and college student exchange programshave had a positive impact, while shorter-term visitor programs havehad less effect. The amount of assistance we have provided couldonly make a small contribution in dealing with Russia's profoundeconomic problems. Without measurable performance indicators for many programs, judging their effectiveness has been difficult. For example, the impact of small and micro enterprise promotionprograms has not yet been demonstrated. A recent interagency reviewrecommended that U.S. assistance focus on areas such as promotingcivil society and improving the capacity of small business, whileeliminating funding for less effective programs. A comprehensive set of benchmarks for use in management and funding decisions is being developed for the Russia program.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 237 Improving Performance U.S. international affairs agencies must respond quickly to changes in the global landscape. In the past, the State Department's necessary emphasis on rapid and flexible response to world events reduced the attention the Department has given to critical management problems. Some of these problems are laid out in the President's Management Agenda, in the following sections. When Funding Arrives Before the Mission is Clear: Kosovo Women's Initiative In 1999, the State Department provided $10 million to the United Nations High Commissi oner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the Kosovo Women'sInitiative to ensure that women's needs were met as refugees returned home. U NHCR failed to effectively target and manage the funds so thatresources promptly served the urgent needs ofhundreds of thousands of needy families. Forexample, the Initiative funded sewing and aerobicclasses, while family health clinics and shelters lacked resources.To address these problems, the State Department created a high-level internal President's Management Agenda (PMA)council responsible for implementing allPMA initiatives within State. Also, OMBand the State Department are jointly leadingthe Administration's efforts to rightsize the U.S. government's presence abroad. It is too early to assess the impact of initiatives onimproving the Department's managementeffectiveness, particularly with respect toinformation technology and staffing. Diplomatic Readiness The State Department has launched a Diplomatic Readiness Initiative to foster ahigh performing, well trained corps of professionals. This initiative will enable the Departmentto have the personnel to carry out its mission and to improve professional training and career development opportunities for every Department employee. The Department's Diplomatic Readiness Task Force will continue to implement far-reaching measures to recruit well-roundedprofessionals possessing the skills required in their career track, thereby reducing the amount oftime needed to train new hires in areas such as language, economics, and management. The TaskForce will also devise additional performance measurements to evaluate the Department's progressin recruitment, placement, training, career development, and retention. Rightsizing Overseas Presence In the spring of 2001, OMB and the State Department attempted to identify the number of U.S. government employees serving abroad, which agencies they represented, their cost, and theirpurpose. OMB determined there is no comprehensive resource available that can explain how many people serve in embassies and posts overseas, let alone describe what they are doing. This lack of information results in both cost and security problems. There is no basis on which to makerational decisions. With estimates as high as 60,000 employees representing over 30 agencies,with cost estimates per American overseas ranging from $250,000 to $550,000 per year, there aremajor financial implications to maintaining a large U.S. overseas presence. In the wake of the 1998embassy bombings in Africa and the heightened level of threat after September 11, 2001, there is an urgency to understanding appropriate staffing patterns.238 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Who Knows Who's Where and Why? Recently, the Administration tried to get a better idea of how many federal employees havebeen posted abroad since the mid-'90s. It isno surprise that the State Department, thePentagon, the Peace Corps, and other agencies have staff overseas. But who knew the Interior Department had an average of 17 people postedoverseas from 1995 to 2001? Or, furthermore,that NASA had staff in Paris?As a result, the Administration has launched a rightsizing initiative with the goal of assuring that the right agencies and rightnumber of people are serving U.S. interestsoverseas. As a first step, in the fall of 2001,the Administration began to collect data fromall government agencies with staff overseas between the years 1995 and 2001. The initial evaluation found that most agencies reportinformation to State with neither a thoroughjustification of need for each staff position, noran evaluation of costs per position, per agency,nor where the position fits with current United States foreign policy, agency mission or skill requirements at a given post. Rarely do agencies examine whether vacant positions can bedone away with. The State Department must maintain the considerable cost of the infrastructureto support this presence. In 2002, the Administration will take another step forward to address these shortcomings through an evaluation of the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, which in 2001 included more than 5,000 employees, 49 embassies, 23 consulates and 5 smaller offices. This evaluation will examine the staffing and costs at each post and will help the Department to revise its MissionPerformance Planning (MPP) process to apply to all posts and agencies with overseas staffing. Therevised MPP will refine performance measures that can be used at all posts and applied acrossall regions and agencies working overseas. It will also incorporate uniform performance measuresfor each position and agency at each post. In addition, OMB and the Department of State are developing a surcharge proposal whereby all U.S. government agencies with staff overseas will examine staffing requirements in advance of new construction of an embassy and will pay part ofthe construction costs of new buildings based on space they will use in embassy buildings.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 239 Strengthening Management To implement the President's Management Agenda the State Department's Director of the Office of Management Policy is coordinating an internal council to establish performance requirements and provide regular reports to the Under Secretary for Management. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014State has begun to implement a Diplomatic Readiness initiative to address certain long-standing management problems in the foreign service, such as training. It has placed renewed emphasis on recruitment and human resource management, and has madestrides, but significant progress is still necessary. It also must develop a comprehensiveworkforce plan to match organizational needs with the knowledge, skills, and abilities of itsForeign Service, Civil Service, and Foreign Service National employees. More progress isexpected from State on reducing management layers and making administrative processes more efficient. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014While State has identified 39 percent of its global workforce as performing activities that are commercial in nature, it has not completed public-private ordirect conversion competition for 15 percent of those identified commercial activities. State isdeveloping plans to increase the percentage of commercial positions that will be competed ordirectly converted to reach the President's goals.\u007f Financial Management \u2014State received an unqualified opinion on its 2000 financial statements and submitted them on time. Nonetheless, State's financial systems are not compliant with federal requirements and have received only a qualified assurance statement.State plans to fix these issues through office consolidation and installing a new system that willmeet the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act requirements. The new system willbe completed by the end of 2003. \u007f E-Government \u2014The Department has not completed an enterprise architecture to guide information technology (IT) investments. Moreover, State's central capital planning and investment control process does not routinely scrutinize all IT investments. State intends to complete its enterprise architecture and improve the scope and comprehensiveness of itscapital planning process. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014Except for the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account, State's budget and performance planning functions are not linked. TheBureau of Resource Management should unite these functions under the leadership of the new Chief Financial Officer. Although State has been simplifying bu reau performance plans, the 2003 State Performance Plan contains inadequate performance measures and sixteen overly broad goals. State is working with OMB to improve the performance planning processand has made progress since October 2001. \u007f240 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS We want our wealthy nation to be a decent, generous and compassionate nation. These are the goals that unite our country. These are the goals that inspire my administration. And these are the goals, when achieved, that will continue America's greatness. President George W. Bush May 31, 2001 U.S. Agency for International Development Andrew Natsios, Administrator www.usaid.gov 202-712-0000 Number of Employees :7 , 7 5 6 Number of Posts Abroad :7 5 2002 Spending : $6.5 billionThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) advances U.S. foreignpolicy through the implementation ofdevelopment and humanitarian assistanceprograms to developing and transitioncountries throughout the world. This includes supporting the Middle East peace process and the transition of the successor states of theformer Soviet Union to market economies.USAID gives special attention to post-coldwar issues such as globalization and conflictprevention. The agency uses a variety of means to implement its programs, including \"technical assistance\" (the transfer of knowledge and expertise), and the delivery of equipment, commodities and urgenthumanitarian assistance including food aid. The majority of USAID's programs are initiatedby its overseas missions and implemented by U.S. or overseas private sector firms or non-profitnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the Red Cross. This year, USAID has reoriented its program structure into four \"pillars.\" The first is a new business model, the Global Development Alliance, to better incorporate the knowledge and resources of the public sector, corporate America, and NGOs into USAID's development assistance programs.In addition, three programmatic pillars incorporate the spectrum of development activities in whichUSAID is engaged: \u007fEconomic growth, agriculture and trade; \u007fGlobal health, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; and \u007fDemocracy, conflict prevention, and humanitarian assistance. The 2003 Budget requests funding for all general USAID development assistance activities, including those aimed at health and population, in one Development Assistance program, ratherthan funding the health and population assistance in a separate Child Survival program. The 2003request for this consolidated account is $2.7 billion. Combining the programs will allow USAIDgreater flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to changing development and foreign policy priorities.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 241 Overview The 2003 Budget enhances USAID's ability to target its assistance in ways that best meet foreign policy, development and humanitarian requirements. In 2003, USAID will: \u007fIncrease its already significant efforts to combat the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other infectiousdiseases in the developing world; \u007fSupport the economic and humanitarian assistance elements of the war on terrorism; \u007fStrengthen its focus on helping countries develop their agriculture sectors, includingproviding increased grants to non-governmental organizations to strengthen the \"foodsecurity\" of developing countries; \u007fStrengthen its focus on helping countries develop productive sectors that will increase tradeand investment in order that they might benefit more fully from the global economy; \u007fIncrease resources available to protect vulnerable tropical forests; and \u007fContinue to provide swift and targeted humanitarian and other assistance that saves lives inoverseas disasters, or where possible prevents such disasters from occurring in the first place. In 2002, USAID demonstrated its ability to address complex disaster situations with its quick and effective provision of food aid and other humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, helpingto avert what might otherwise have been a major humanitarian crisis. The 2003 Budget includesfunding for continued recovery and initial reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan. Feeding Hungry People The United Nations' (UN) World Food Programme estimates more than 800 million people in the world, or about 15 percent, suffer from hunger and malnutrition. About 24,000 people die every dayof hunger or related causes. The United States consistently provides about 50 percent of food aidworldwide, far more than any other donor. The Administration remains committed to maintaining U.S. leadership in supplying food aid to vulnerable people. Support for food aid is even more vital in this new era of terrorist threats as hunger leads to desperation, and potentially, violence. Making Food Aid User Friendly Private voluntary organizations (PVOs) are eligible for grants of commodities for food securityprograms in the former Soviet Union under fourof the six U.S. food aid programs, run by twoagencies. Each program requires a separate application and is governed by different sets of rules and regulations. The Administration'sproposed reform of food aid will streamline thebureaucracy so that virtually all food aid grants toPVOs are administered under one agency with asingle set of rules and regulations.Currently, two federal agencies run six programs to provide international food aid, leading to inevitable inefficiencies and overlapof functions. The Administration intends toconsolidate programs to improve performance.The Department of Agriculture will continue tofurnish government-to-government programs while USAID will take responsibility for all programs run through private voluntaryorganizations and the World Food Programme.As a result, food aid will be better integratedwith the U.S. government's overall assistanceprograms.242 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS 02004006008001,0001,200Top 10 Donors to the World Food ProgramIn millions of dollars USA JapanEC NetherlandsGermany Australia DenmarkCanada Norway France 2001 Contributions Source: The World Food Programme.Another reform will be to eliminate the dependence of America's food aid programs onthe availability of surplus U.S. commodities. Dependence on surplus commodities means little year to year predictability of supplyfor hungry populations overseas and thenon-profit organizations that serve them.A surplus donation program was virtuallynon-existent in 1997; however, it rose to a level of $1.2 billion in total program costs in 2001. In part to reduce reliance on the availabilityof commodity surpluses, the 2003 Budget willrequest a 39-percent increase, or $335 million,in USAID-run food assistance resources thatdo not depend on surpluses. The Administration intends to increase resources for direct food distribution programs to the hungry and reduce programs that sell food, to generate revenue for more general developmentassistance activities. This approach will assure food aid serves our intended target\u2014thetruly hungry and needy. Over time, USAID will reduce the proportion of commodities sold innon-emergency programs to a target level of 30 percent as ongoing programs are completed. TheAdministration also intends to make more Development Assistance program resources available to support food security related development programs of non-governmental organizations. By concentrating food aid on feeding programs, the U.S. government will continue to feed people atsimilar levels as in recent years. Fighting HIV/AIDS As we enter the third decade of the AIDS pandemic, our hearts go out to those who have been afflicted with or affected by this deadly disease. We resolve to stand together as a nation and with the world to fight AIDS on all fronts. We resolve to provide the resources necessary to combat HIV/AIDS. And we resolve to ensure that those suffering with HIV/AIDS receive effective care and treatment, compassionate understanding, and encouraging hope. President George W. Bush World AIDS Day, 2001 ProclamationAs of December 2001, 40 million adults and children worldwide were estimated tobe living with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), with five million new infectionsand three million deaths occurring during2001. Sub-Saharan Africa, which has only11 percent of the world's population andone percent of the world's income, has 70 percent of HIV/AIDS cases and 77 percent of AIDS deaths: these numbers are fueled byt h er a t eo fo t h e ri n f e c t i o u sd i s e a s e s ,s u c ha stuberculosis (TB), the major cause of deathin those that are HIV positive. This pandemichas effected every continent and is poised to explode, especially in key countries in Asia. AIDS is not merely a health tragedy, but it also is destroying the economic and social fabric of many countries, especially in sub-saharan Africa. AIDS related deaths decimate educators, administrators,health workers, and the general population. The President has made fighting this pandemic andTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 243 other key infectious diseases a major foreign policy objective of both U.S. bilateral and multilateral assistance programs. The 2003 Budget proposes total bilateral and multilateral assistance for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in developing countries of nearly $1.2 billion, up from $1 billion in 2002. The U.S. commitments in these two years will account for more than a third of estimated internationaldonor funds. USAID is the single largest bilateral donor. The budget provides $200 million,including $100 million from the Department of Health and Human Services, to the Global Fundfor HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis. The Administration is prepared to increase funding tothe Global Fund over the 2002-2005 period if appropriate burden sharing arrangements with other donors are agreed to, and if the fund becomes an effective operation. 0200400600800Malaria & Tuberculosis AIDS Research AIDS Prevention & Care Global Trust FundIn millions of dollarsAssistance for Global HIV/AIDS, Malaria & Tuberculosis 2001 2003 20021,0001,2001,400Recent HIV/AIDS trends in Uganda, Thailand, and a number of other countrieshave shown that focused resources toimplement comprehensive AIDS programscan be successful in reversing the epidemic. USAID has an approved strategic and focused plan, with emphasis on 23 country/regionalprograms to fight against the HIV/AIDSpandemic. Four countries (Cambodia, Kenya,Uganda, and Zambia) have been identifiedfor rapid scale-up of their HIV/AIDS program coverage. USAID, with a new Office of HIV/AIDS in recognition of this program'simportance, and the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) are expanding these country programs in an effort to shorten the period needed to reach prevention and care goals.By the end of 2003, USAID and CDC plan to meet the following goals in the four rapid scale-up countries identified above: \u007fReduce HIV prevalence in young adults by 30 percent; \u007fI n c r e a s ec a r et o3 2 1 , 0 0 0i n f e c t e dp e o p l e ; \u007fIncrease orphans receiving community services to 168,000; and \u007fIncrease HIV-infected pregnant women getting antiretrovirals to 21,000, in order to prevent mother-to-child-transmission.244 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the Federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs to higher priority or more effective programs. The table below rates the performance of a few important USAID programs. Program Assessment Explanation Development Credit Authority (DCA)Ineffective DCA is a credit tool for USAID to finance development assistancein addition to or in lieu of grant funding where appropriate. Sincethe inception of DCA in 1999, USAID has begun 16 credit projectsproviding over $35 million. However, the program has obligated only16 percent of their 2001 credit subsidy funding, due in part to thelength of time it has taken to develop effective credit budgeting and credit subsidy calculation mechanisms. Because of the need for continued improvements in these areas, as well as the $25 millionfunding pipeline, additional credit subsidy funding is not requestedfor this program in 2003 but authority to carry forward unused 2002funding is requested. Expanded Responseto HIV/AIDS Effective USAID programs emphasize HIV/AIDS prevention throughreproductive health programs to reduce risk behaviors and efforts to prevent mother to child transmission. In the hardest hit countries, USAID programs provide care and support for those infected andto survivors, particularly orphans and other children affected byAIDS. A revised USAID strategy now directs increased funding toselected countries based on magnitude and severity of the disease,and likelihood of success. Impact indicators have been finalized and monitoring systems are being put into place in these priority countries. The 2003 Budget requests a $115 million increase for USAID'sHIV/AIDS programs. Emergency CentralAmerican andCaribbean Hurricane ReconstructionIneffective Hurricane Georges hit the Caribbean in September of 1998 and Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America in late October andNovember of 1998. In May of 1999, Congress approved an emergency supplemental package that included $621 m illion for disaster recovery for the countries affected by Hurricanes Georges and Mitch. Theemergency package was intended to provide timely assistance to thehurricane victims, yet USAID had only expended 41 percent of thefunds by December 31, 2000, one and a half years after funds wereprovided. By the end of 2001, USAID had completed approximately 93 percent of its programs. As testified to Congress by GA O, two factors contributing to the delayed response were USAID's lack of experience in rapidly designing and implementing a large-scale infrastructureprogram with short-term goals, and the need to coordinate with the 13other federal agencies that helped to implement the program.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 245 Improving Performance Despite USAID's best efforts, some programs fail. For example, USAID commissioned an evaluationof school feeding programs in Haiti that showed: \"There is no causal connection between school feeding and improved educational performance\".In addition, the report found that school feedingprograms are among the least cost-effectiveinterventions in education. As a result, in Haiti,USAID's Food for Peace Office will phase out these programs in favor of more effective programs in health, nutrition, and agriculture.USAID has made progress in developing a systematic approach to performancemeasurement, although challenges remain.The agency's Annual Performance Plan has been updated to improve the ability to summarize performance. The structureincludes agency level indicators of generalperformance, such as increased economicgrowth and reduced hunger and poverty;reduced rates of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; increased literacy; free and fair elections; and lower mortality rates indisasters. It is often difficult to demonstratea direct causal link between USAID programs and these outcomes, since in most cases, USAID programs are only a small factor promotingdevelopment. Assistance from other countries, from the World Bank and other international organizations, as well as the efforts of the developing countries themselves, play important roles in achieving these outcomes. Therefore, in addition to monitoring performance related to thesehigher level outcomes, USAID missions also track \"intermediate results\" that are more directlylinked to its programs. Examples vary, but can include the number of small businesses receivingUSAID-supported loans and how they fared with the loans, the number of new students attendingschool because of USAID programs, the number of children receiving vaccinations because of USAID funding, or the number of people receiving emergency food relief. However, numerical outputs do not address or assess the quality of the program or how well it functions. USAID needs to improveits ability to use this information for decision-making. Although USAID has used anecdotal programresults as a factor in allocating resources, the agency has yet to develop a systematic budget processthat fully and transparently bases decisions on performance considerations. USAID will continueworking to develop measures of performance to determine the extent to which programs succeed in advancing U.S. foreign policy. Strengthening Management USAID's ability to perform optimally has been seriously compromised for years by ineffective and outdated management systems and structural shortcomings. Last year, it began a major effortto strengthen its most critical systems both in Washington and overseas and to restructure its operations. While progress has been made, particularly in financial management and workforce planning, much remains to be done.246 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014USAID is undertaking a comprehensive review of its workforce and has submitted a workforce plan. USAID has committed to reducing the ratio of supervisors to employees from 1:4 to 1:5 by the beginning of 2003 and limiting the number of management levels for each bureau. Over the longer term, the agency mustconfront recruitment issues since significant attrition due to retirement is expected.USAID already has a detailed recruitment plan for the Foreign Service and is workingto complete a similar plan for the Civil Service. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014No progress has been made on this initiative. USAID has not completed public-private or direct conversion competition on 15 percent of its functions identified as commercial, and it has not submitted an approved competition plan. USAID intends to submit to OMB a competition plan detailing how it will meet theadministration's two-year, 15 percent goal. \u007f Financial Management \u2014Although a core accounting system is in place in Washington, it has not yet been deployed overseas. Therefore, almost 50 percent ofUSAID-managed funds are not within the new system. Until its field systems are modernized, USAID will be unable to gain the benefits of modern business practices in accounting, finance, procurement, and e-government. Further, while the first fullaudit of USAID's financial statement is being conducted for 2001, it is not clear thatthe Inspector General will be able to render an opinion. USAID will submit andimplement a targeted remediation plan for its financial systems. The agency studyof business practices will include strategies to accelerate deployment of the core accounting system. \u007f E-Government \u2014The business cases for USAID accounting and procurement modernization, as well as its operations and infrastructure upgrades, do not lookforward and define how the agency can deploy its new systems worldwide. USAID isundertaking a study to address how it can make more effective use of capital planning,enterprise architecture, and modern business concepts. The 2003 Budget includes acapital investment account to segregate and better manage information technology funding.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014Although USAID's reorganization has placed budget responsibility with the planning bureau, it is not yet clear how the agency willfurther integrate performance with budget decision-making. While the Agency canpoint to anecdotal examples of reallocating resources to higher-performing activitieswithin countries or countries within regions, a more comprehensive and consistent process to tie agency-level planning and budgeting to perform ance needs to be developed. USAID will submit its initial performance plan to OMB; coordinate with the State Department in integrating performance factors into budget formulation; andcontinue to refine performance indicators to improve usefulness to decision-makers. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 247 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Department of the Treasury Paul O'Neill, Secretary www.ustreas.gov 202-622-1260 Multilateral Development Banks :T h eW o r l d Bank Group, Inter-American DevelopmentBank Group, Asian Development Bank Group,African Development Bank Group, EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development,North American Development Bank, Global Environment Facility, and International Fund for Agricultural Development. Other International Financial Institutions/Mechanism : International Monetary Fund and Exchange Stab ilization Fund Bilateral Programs : International Debt Restructuring and Treasury Technical Assistance 2002 Spending : $1.7 billionThe Treasury Department is responsible for a number of international programs,including U.S. relations with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and administration ofthe Exchange Stabilization Fund. Treasuryalso is responsible for U.S. relations with the World Bank and other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), and administersU.S. contributions to these institutions.Treasury negotiates and manages U.S.participation in multilateral debt reductioninitiatives, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative, and handles funds for the U.S. portion of such initiatives.Finally, Treasury operates a small technicalassistance program to help our partners in thewar against terrorism fight money launderingand other financial crimes, as well as help finance ministries in developing countries implement fiscal and financial policy reforms. Improving Multilateral Assistance to the Poorest Countries Clearing U.S. Arrears Outstanding U.S. arrears to all MDBs now equal $533 million, $34 m illion greater than last year's total of $499 million. The President'sBudget requests $178 million to help meet U.S.international commitments under a plan to clearall arrears, on a pro-rata basis by institution, over the next three years.Since its establishment in 1944, the World Bank's goal of post-war reconstruction in Europe has broadened significantly. The World Bank and the regional developmentbanks now seek to encourage economic growthand poverty reduction in developing andtransition countries, while the specializedfinancial institutions like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) maintain narrower, specific mandates. Over the past 25 years, the United States has consistently been the largest donor tothe multilateral development banks. While our contributions leverage other donor commitments,it is important to insist that these institutions significantly improve conditions for their principal constituency, the world's poor. As recent World Bank data shows, more people today live in poverty on less than $2 a day than did so a decade ago.248 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS The President's concerns about these institutions' performance have caused a significant change in the Administration's policies. As proposed by the President, the United States isworking to negotiate a significant increase in the level of assistance provided to the poorest and least creditworthy countries as grants rather than loans. The United States and other donors are currently discussing replenishments for the International Development Association (IDA),African Development Fund, and GEF. We are pursuing measures to increase the focus of thesereplenishments on countries with sound policy environments and demonstrated performance, andon operations that raise productivity. At the same time, the United States is emphasizing the needfor institutions to develop reliable performance and output indicators. Recognizing the importance of demonstrating results, the United States is proposing a performance-based financing framework for its contribution to the IDA replenishment. It providesa base-level annual contribution of $850 million for each of the three years of the replenishment.Additional contributions of $100 million in the second year and $200 million in the third year willbe made available if IDA meets specific measurable results, for example in the areas of education,health, environment and trade capacity building. The Secretary of the Treasury will use measures of performance to determine the extent to which U.S. participation in multilateral financial institutions is effective. Conserving the World's Remaining Tropical Forests More than half of the world's plant and animal species lives in tropical forests, making themhome to the world's greatest amount of biological diversity.Between 1980 and 1995, more than 540 million acres of tropical forests were cutdown, a loss with major implications for theworld. Tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits, including harboring a major share of the Earth's biological resources, protectingsoil and water, replenishing the Earth'satmosphere with fresh air, and providing timber, medicines, food, and jobs. For these reasons, the Administration is committed to preserving the world's remaining tropical forests. Under the proposal contained in this budget, the United States will be able to better use its resources to achieve this important environmental goal. The Administration's new forestry conservation proposal will improve forestry conservation by providing $50 million to USAID. Upto $40 million of this amount may be available for the budget cost of debt reduction that is usedfor forest conservation under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA). The remainder will beused for grants to non-governmental organizations engaged in forestry conservation in order toaccelerate support and improve effective implementation of TFCA agreements. The Administration will develop specific criteria to determine which mechanism is most appropriate for each case. Under TFCA, to date, debt reduction agreements have been concluded with four countries: Bangladesh, Belize, El Salvador, and Thailand. In all, these countries will save over $60 millionin hard currency payments as a result of these agreements to swap external debt for forestconservation.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 249 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES Export Import Bank Export Import Bank John E. Robson, Chairman www.exim.gov 800-565-EXIM Number of Employees : 420 2002 Spending : Program: -$263 million Administrative: $62 million Lending Activity : $10.4 billionThe 2003 Budget will support an increase in lending levels from an estimated $10.4 billion in 2002 to $11.5 billion in 2003 using an appropriation of $541.4 million in programresources. The increase in lending levels is achieved with the 2003 Budget request levels becauseof the use of an entirely new credit risk methodology for all international lending programs that integrate market data withlong term market-wide default experience. New Method for International Credit Risk Until this budget, the U.S. Government (USG) used the premium charged by private sectorlenders to other governments as a proxy for thedefault costs of USG loans to these countries. While this was the best available method, it captured not just default risk, but also profits,opportunity costs, tax effects and other factorsnot relevant to the budget cost of USG credits.The new method isolates just the default riskportion of the private market premiums. In short, the risk of new USG international credits has not decreased, but budget costs are now basedonly on this default risk, not on other extraneousfactors.The Export-Import Bank is also continuing work on ways to focus its lending on caseswhere the private sector does not providefinancing. Such efforts are particularlyimportant to ensure the Bank does notcompete against the private sector, which is becoming increasingly aggressive in providing private export financing. For example,Export-Import Bank will consider higherfees where it does not affect the Bank'scompetitiveness with other official lenders,as well as applying more stringent tests for whether Bank support is necessary to finance specific transactions.250 DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Overseas Private Investment Corporation Overseas Private Investment Corporation Peter S.

Department of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta, Secretary www.dot.gov 202-366-4000 Number of Federal Employees : 118,447 (including military) 2002 Funding : $60.8 billion Offices: 12 operating administrations, including the Transportation Security Administration,Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard.The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for the nation's freedom ofmovement\u2014ensuring there are sufficient andsafe roads, rails, airways and seaways to keep the country in motion and its economy growing. Established in 1967, DOT setsfederal transportation policy and workswith state, local, and private sector partnersto promote a safe, secure, efficient, andinterconnected national transportation system. DOT's operating administrations have wide-ranging duties related to operatingor overseeing various transportation sectors,but they share a common commitment tofulfill these national objectives. 255256 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Overview The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the newest DOT organization, was established to enhance security for the traveling public. Other DOT agencies are organized by mode of transportation, including two large and well-known agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Coast Guard. FAA's responsibilities range from controlling the nation's air traffic system to regulating the safety and maintenance standards of U.S.-operated airlines. The Coast Guard acts as the fifth branch ofthe armed services and its missions extend from enforcing the fisheries laws, to cleaning up oil spills,to guarding the nation's maritime borders from illegal migrants and drugs. Several DOT agencies manage grant programs that will provide over $34 billion in 2003 to state and local transportation agencies for airports, roads, highways and transit systems. Theseinfrastructure programs help reduce congestion and expand travel options. DOT also regulateshighway, rail, and pipeline safety to reduce accidents and fatalities. The laws authorizing surface and aviation transportation programs will expire after 2003. The Administration will work with various stakeholders and the Congress to develop legislative proposals to continue the nation's investment in air, highway and transit systems. Ensuring Transportation Security ...[T]he President has asked our Department to help protect the integrity of our nation's entire transportation infrastructure. And that is what we are doing ...We will have to take precautions in transportation that we have never taken before, and we will have to do the same in virtually every aspect of American life. ...As we move forward from September 11th, we must increase our vigilance, and we must take new steps to move people and goods safely and efficiently, recognizing that the nature of the threat has changed. Secretary Mineta October 2001The events of September 11, 2001, underscore the importance of transportationsecurity as part of America's homelandsecurity. Protecting airports, seaports,bridges, highways, and mass transportation against the threat of terrorism is an imperative. In 2003, added emphasis onthis mission will be reflected in resourcesfor personnel, technology and equipmentto meet transportation security challenges.T h eP r e s i d e n ts i g n e dt h eA v i a t i o na n d Transportation Security Act, establishing the Transportation Security Administration,into law on November 19, 2001. TSA's mainmission is to increase airline and airportsecurity. TSA will play a critical role,coordinating with the White House Office of Homeland Security, federal, state, local, and private partners, to enhance the safety of the nation's transportation infrastructure. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 257 Transportation SecurityFunding (in billions of dollars) Aviation Security ....................... 4.8 Maritime Security ...................... 2.9The Aviation and Transportation Security Act imposed tight deadlines and stringent aviationsecurity requirements for DOT to implement. TSAwas created to be responsible for airport passengerscreening at every U.S. airport with commercialair service. Its staff includes law enforcement officers, Federal Air Marshals, and passenger and baggage screeners. The TSA will continue to improve baggage screening processes to enhance the safety of passengers, while facilitatingtravel. In addition to aviation, TSA will be the focal point for the security of the entire nationaltransportation system; a system administered in large part by states and localities. This budgetmeets these challenges, and the Administration has embarked on an aggressive effort to gauge progress constantly. Explosive detection systems are just one technology to ensure that passenger bags are properly screened.In 2003, the TSA will continue implementing a comprehensive aviationsecurity program. Funding is being providedto accelerate deployment of an array ofexplosive detection technology so that all baggage loaded into aircraft is safe. The TSA will continue efforts to improve security atairport screening locations and speed the flowof passengers at these checkpoints. During theyear, the TSA will complete the hiring of over30,000 Federal airport security personnel, including screeners, armed guards, and supervisors for every screening checkpoint. Toupgrade aviation security, the TSA will hire,train, and deploy an enhanced team of Federal Air Marshals. The budget provides $4.8 billion in funding for the TSA, with an estimated $2.2billion of the 2003 costs to be raised through passenger and air carrier fees. The Coast Guard conducting a patrol to ensure port security in San Francisco harbor.The TSA and the Coast Guard will jointly develop and execute the maritimecomponent of homeland security. This workis crucial because 95 percent of the nation'sinternational trade moves by water. TheCoast Guard will maintain the viability and integrity of marine transportation security by providing additional personnel to increaseport security and assess the needs of criticalseaports throughout the nation. The budgetprovides $5.7 billion in discretionary fundingfor the Coast Guard, including $406 million for increased port security. The budget also proposes a commercial navigational user feeto help pay for increased port security needs.258 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Improving Transportation Safety DOT's mission is to promote the public health and safety of the nation by working toward theelimination of transportation related deaths and injuries. DOT Performance PlanMost Americans rely on some combination of car, transit, and airplane travel to carryout daily personal and business activities.Much of the effort of promoting and increasing transportation safety centers on raising safety awareness. The economic cost of motor vehiclecrashes alone is more than $150 billionannually. The human toll on victims and theirfamilies is catastrophic. Just as important as transportation security is DOT's goal to increase safety for the traveling public. To achieve this, the Department works with communities to educate the public about safety requirements and establishes safety standards for transportation industries. The 2003 Budgetproposes nearly $8 billion for transportation safety programs to meet the Department's safety goals. Aviation Safety FAA aims to prevent aviation fatalities by preventing accidents. For example, accidents are prevented by reducing air traffic controller and pilot errors and by minimizing aircraft incidents(such as engine failures). Of particular concern is pilot or controller error resulting in \"runwayincursions\" on or near active airport runways. Runway incursions happen when aircraft on ornear runways do not maintain required distance from each other or from a vehicle or other objecton the ground. A resulting collision could mean a catastrophic loss of life, and there have been a disturbing number of close calls in recent years. In 2001, there were 52 serious runway incursions, an improvement from the 67 incidents in 2000. But continued vigilance is needed. The budgetprovides $107 million for the development and use of new technologies and systems to help preventincursion-related accidents. An additional $122 million is provided to improve pilot and controllertraining and increase visibility through improved runway surface markings. 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 20080.00.51.01.52.02.5 Rate Projection TargetHighway Fatalities per 100 Million Vehicle-Miles-Traveled Source: National Center for Statistics and Analysis, DOT.Fatality rateSurface Transportation Safety Traffic crashes claimed a total of 41,800 lives in 2000, accounting for over 90 percentof transportation-related deaths. Fatalitiesdeclined from 47,100 in 1988, but have remained relatively flat since 1992 despite significant increases in the number of vehicleson the country's roads. The Federal MotorCarrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)and the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration (NHTSA) are charged with regulating highway safety under DOT's umbrella.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 259 FMCSA, created in 1999, oversees the safety of the commercial truck industry. It seeks to reduce the number of highway deaths resulting from truck and bus crashes. The agency is committed tohelping reduce fatalities by 50 percent, from 5,380 in 1999 to less than 2,700 in 2009. To achieve this goal, FMCSA will concentrate on improving its federal oversight program by increasing federal and state inspections on the roadside and at motor carriers' facilities, and improving the CommercialDriver Licensing program. In 2003, $190 million will go to states to help them implement highwaysafety programs. In 2003, the Administration will pay special attention to FMCSA's southern border safety enforcement program. The United States will fulfill its commitment to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement and allow travel by Mexican trucks to begin in 2002. Some $68 million will be devoted to conduct on-site safety inspections in Mexico of motor carrier facilitiesby U.S. inspectors. A renewable 90-day decal with monitoring systems to ensure compliance withtruck safety rules will be instituted. Another $47 million is provided in 2003 for border safetyinfrastructure under a program to fund highway projects along the U.S. borders. NHTSA aims to reduce highway fatalities and injuries by decreasing alcohol-related highway fatalities from 17,219 in 1997 to 11,000 in 2005, and by increasing seat belt usage from 69 percent in 1997 to 90 percent in 2005. To achieve these goals, the budget provides $200 million for NHTSA'ssafety research and information programs, and $225 million for grants to states for their highwaysafety programs. Maritime Safety The Coast Guard aims to minimize boating accidents while striving to rescue as many people as possible when accidents occur. Overall, recreational boating fatalities have declined since the 1970s.In 2000, the Coast Guard recorded 742 fatalities\u2014the lowest number of deaths to date. This marksa 50 percent reduction from the 1970s, even as the number of recreational boats more than doubled.In 2001, the Coast Guard answered more than 39,000 calls for help, saving 4,184 lives of mariners in imminent danger. To improve on this in 2003, the Coast Guard will increase staff and modernize equipment. The budget funds a $90 million initiative to modernize a \"maritime 911\" system. It willimprove existing Coast Guard capabilities through broader coverage, ensuring that emergency callsget through and adding high quality location finding technology to speed Coast Guard response. Intercity Passenger Rail Service Of the 41 train routes Amtrak ran in 2001, 14 lost more than $110 per passenger and six lost more than $210 per passenger. Operating losses onthe Sunset Limited, which runs between Orlandoand Los Angeles, were $347 per passenger. Onlytwo routes turned an operating profit in 2001.The Congress created the National Rail Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in 1971 as a for-profit corporation to provide a national rail passenger system. Although it initiallyreceived federal subsidies, the intent wasfor Amtrak to graduate from requiringfederal financial support. Amtrak has utterlyfailed to meet this expectation. The federal government has provided about $24.2 billion to Amtrak since its creation (see accompanying table). Since 1979, Amtrak has failed to increasesignificantly the number of passengers it carries. Currently, Amtrak's share of the nation's intercity260 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION passenger market amounts to only one-half of one percent of all passenger miles, compared to more popular means of transportation such as auto (50 percent), air (48 percent), and intercity buses (1.5percent). Federal Subsidies for Amtrak, 1971-2002 Type of Funding Years Provided Total Funding Annual Average Federal Operating Grants ..................................... 1971-2002 $14.3 b illion 1976-1998 $4.0 b illion $760 million On November 9, 2001, the Amtrak Reform Council (ARC), an oversight board set up by the Congress, concluded that Amtrak would fail to achieve its statutorily mandated goal to run itsbusiness profitably and without federal operating assistance by December 2, 2002. As a result,the ARC will announce an Amtrak restructuring plan on February 7, 2002, in accordance with theAmtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999-1,200-1,000-800-600-400-2000Amtrak Operating Losses before Federal Grants Source: Department of Transportation.In millions of dollarsIn its 31-year history, Amtrak has never posted a profit. It has accumulated about$20.4 billion in operating losses over that sameperiod, for an average annual operating loss ofapproximately $660 million, excluding federal grants. It recently mortgaged Pennsylvania Station in New York over a 16-year period tocover approximately three months of operatingexpenses, a financial absurdity equivalent toa family taking out a second mortgage on itshome to pay its grocery bills. Other recent efforts to infuse new cash into this futile system include: \u007fA $2 billion tax credit for Amtrak in 1997, although it has never paid income taxes; and, \u007fLegislative proposals to subsidize $12 billion in new borrowing through tax credits, provide up to $28 billion in new borrowing through federal loan guarantees, and up to $36 billion in state tax-exempt bonds. Amtrak is clearly in desperate financial condition. In May 2001, Amtrak president George Warrington stated that Amtrak could not continue indefinitely under current circumstances, aTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 261 conclusion shared by the Amtrak Reform Council in its November finding. The Administration agrees. An Amtrak California train. The state of California owns the trains and assists in their operation.The Administration believes that passenger train service should be founded on a partnership between the federal government,the states, and the private sector. Such apartnership would encourage the operationof passenger trains offering high-quality,cost-effective service on viable routes or where the states have declared a public need they are willing to fund. The Administration is eagerto work with the Congress to develop solutionsthat result in a cost-effective, financiallystable system that can help meet the public'stravel needs. Pending development of a new paradigm for passenger rail service, the budget requests the same level of funding asprovided in 2002. Improving Transportation Mobility Another major DOT strategic priority is to enhance the free flow of passengers and goods. Over the last 20 years, travel for all modes of transportation, especially highway and air, has increased significantly. Surface Travel Between 1980 and 1999, highway passenger miles traveled increased almost 60 percent. Federal spending on highway projects also increased significantly, from $15.5 billion in 1992 to $28.5 billion in 2003. Under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21stCentury (TEA-21), highway spending is adjusted each year according to a formula in law that reflects the most recent data onhighway-related receipts. In 2000, 2001, and 2002 highway spending was increased significantlyby these annual adjustments. However, for 2003 this formula will produce a reduction in theamount of new commitments of highway spending, due in large part to a previous overestimate ofactual receipts in 2001. Even so, in 2003 actual spending on highway construction, including the continuation of prior-year projects, will fall less than three percent from its all-time high in 2002. 2003 highway spending will be 40 percent higher than in 1998, the first year of TEA-21. The downside of growth in travel is increased road congestion. For example, in 1987 a trip during peak travel periods took 16 percent longer than it would have taken in uncongested conditions (about10 minutes more for a one-hour trip). In 1999, a trip taken during peak travel period took 15 minutesmore for a one-hour trip. Traffic delays also lead to increased fuel consumption and higher levels of vehicle emissions. In 1999, the nationwide cost of wasted time and extra fuel consumption alone was estimated to be $78 billion.262 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Without efforts to reduce congestion, it is projected that congestion will increase by 0.5 percent each year. DOT's goal is to slow the projected growth of congested travel by 0.2 percent each year. TheFederal Highway Administration (FHWA) has implemented a range of strategies to address traffic jams. These include development and deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which provide more information to drivers faster, enabling them to take the most efficient route of travel.The 2003 Budget proposes $23.5 billion in federal funding for highways to identify and constructa mix of locally preferred road projects to reduce congestion and add new capacity to the highwaysystem. Transit also contributes to reducing road congestion. Transit passenger miles traveled increased 23 percent from 1980 to 1999. In 2000, transit ridership increased to 9.4 billion trips, the highest ever. In 2003, the budget provides $7.2 billion for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) tohelp congested regions buy more buses and build new rail systems. Within this amount, theAdministration will seek authorization of $145 million for the President's New Freedom Initiativeto make transportation more accessible for the disabled. Air Travel DOT has faced significant growth in demand for air travel, with air passenger miles increasing 123 percent from 1980 to 1999. As the aviation system adjusts to new security protocols, flight delayscould return to pre-September 11th levels. DOT must continue expanding aviation capacity by morerapidly modernizing our airspace infrastructure and cutting red tape to speed construction of planned airport runway projects. The budget provides over $1.3 billion in FAA system modernization to improve mobility, and $3.4 billion for airport improvement activities. In 2003, FAA seeks to improveairport efficiency rates (an indicator that gauges how many aircraft move through these airportsagainst capacity levels) for our busiest airports to 95 percent. To create a business-like aviation environment, by 2003 the DOT and FAA intend to implement a performance-based organization (PBO) that would focus on improved management and coordination of air traffic services and capital investments. This organization will be headed by a Chief Operating Officer and combine resources and staff from FAA's air traffic control, research, and acquisition linesof business, all of which contribute to FAA's ability to provide efficient air traffic control services. Current measures of performance\u2014such as delays and runway incursions\u2014point to management challenges in improving the operation of the current air traffic system. The new organization isintended to address some of these weaknesses by establishing performance goals for individual staff, and the organization as a whole, so that progress and advancements can be measured. The Administration plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the PBO after a year of operation. If significantimprovements in air traffic services are not achieved, the Department will look to other options,including partial privatization and franchise operation of components of the air traffic system. Status Report on Select Programs The 2003 Budget provides a total $53.6 billion in discretionary resources, including a variety of management initiatives, to improve the performance of DOT programs. The budget increasesfunding for core programs, cuts unnecessary subsidies and proposes reforms to strengthen programmanagement. It seeks to identify weaknesses, showcase effective programs, and present and meetperformance goals.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 263 Program Assessment Explanation Efficiency of Air Traffic ControlIneffective FAA management needs improvement as evidenced by serious delaysin air traffic during periods of high demand. Highway GrantsProject Management Moderately EffectiveIn the past, federal highway project oversight had been problematic (e.g., Boston's \"Big Dig\" which overran its cost estimates by 465 percent, or $12 billion, compared to the original 1985 proposal). However, FHWA has taken several steps to improve managementoversight for large highway projects. Public Transit GrantsManagement Effective GAO has reported that FTA's project management oversight programimproves quality controls, resulting in benefits for grantees and thegovernment. FTA has implemented a streamlined, web-based grants program that permits 800 grantees to submit electronic requests and FTA to electronically disburse payments. Coast GuardDeepwater Project Unknown This multiyear project begins to replace aging ships, aircraft, andrelated systems. The Coast Guard is using an innovative approachto replace its capital assets, aiming to enhance performance whilelimiting total cost. Hazardous Material and Pipeline SafetyModerately EffectiveThe Research and Special Programs Administration continues to increase oversight, inspection, and research to reduce the likelihood of pipeline and hazardous material accidents. Congressional Earmarks and Corporate Subsidies Congressional Earmarks 2000 ............ over 700 earmarkstotaling $2.1 billion 2001 ............ ............ over 1,400 earmarkstotaling $3.2 billionAcross the spectrum of transportation programs, congressional earmarks undercut the Department's ability to fund projects that have successfully proved their merits. In many cases, these earmarks divert funds tolower priority projects. This can result in the disruptionof construction schedules for higher priority projects andincrease the financing costs for the sponsors of theseprojects. In 2002, the Congress earmarked over 1,400 projects in the Department of Transportation, totaling $3.2 billion.264 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Transit Projects For 2002, Congress earmarked $218 mi llion for 44 transit rail new start projects that the President did not recommend. Within this total, $40 million was earmarked for 18 projects that are in thevery early planning stage. Several do not appearto meet eligibility requirements. For example,$2.5 million is allocated to the Northern IndianaSouth Shore commuter rail rehabilitation project, which may be ineligible because it is not for new construction. Consequent ly, Congress did not provide sufficient funds to complete prior federalcommitments to three existing projects in St.Louis, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake City.The FTA is authorized by law to provide over $3 billion a year in competitive grantsfor local transit projects, including new bus purchase, new rail line construction, and assistance to maintain existing railinfrastructure in older systems. However, for2002, the Congress earmarked every dollarof FTA's bus and new rail starts programs. Asa result, worthy projects cannot compete on their merits and funding does not go to areas with the greatest needs. For example, in 2001,DOT requested $50 million to assist the LosAngeles County Metropolitan TransportationAuthority (LACMTA) purchase 523 busesto relieve overcrowding and meet the requirements of a consent decree. Instead, LACMTA got only $4.5 million, delaying the purchase of the buses. Intelligent Earmarking? Since 1998, the Congress has earmarked 100 percent of the funding for IntelligentTransportation Systems (ITS) technologydeployment. These systems provide technological solutions to congestion and safety problems and improve operations on the nation'shighways and transit systems. FHWA would liketo award this funding based on merit. Earmarksinclude: \u007f$1 million for ITS in Moscow, Idaho, a city with a population under 25,000; and \u007f$1.8 million over three years for a research program in New Mexico that is currently unable to comply with the law or obtain required matching funds.Highway Projects The FHWA administers over $300 million in authorized competitive grant programs.States submit applications for funding andFHWA awards funding based on merit. Since2000, almost all of the funds have beenearmarked for specific projects. This practice eliminates the competitive aspect of these programs and leaves aside many meritoriousprojects that went through the applicationprocess. Elimination of Unnecessary Corporate Subsidies The Department's Maritime Admini- stration provides federally guaranteed loans to U.S. shipyards and shipbuilding companies. In many cases, these loan guarantees exposetaxpayers to substantial risk. For example, arecent bankruptcy risks defaults on federally guaranteed loans of over $350 million in 2002. The Administration believes that this program represents an unnecessary federal subsidy. The budget requests no funding for this program in 2003. Shipbuilders and shipyards could and shouldTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 265 seek to improve their competitiveness without relying on federal subsidies or exposing taxpayers to the costs of their failures. Strengthening Management In addition to the Administration's focus on improving the performance of specific government programs, the Department also seeks to make substantial progress on the five government-widemanagement priorities. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014DOT is working on comprehensive workforce planning and restructuring to reduce management layers, make DOT more citizen-centered, and better match staff to the Department's missions and goals. This work is particularly critical since 45 percent of current senior executives in DOT and over 50 percent ofstaff in many critical occupations are anticipated to retire by 2006. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014DOT has not completed public-private or direct conversion competition on the government positions working in commercial functions. DOTalso has not demonstrated that support service agreements between agencies arecompeted with the private sector on a recurring basis. DOT will meet the 2002 goal and is moving forward with an overall competitive sourcing program. \u007f Financial Management \u2014DOT's financial systems fail to meet financial management requirements and standards. Auditors could only issue a \"qualified\" opinion on DOT's2000 financial statements. They cited material control weakness, primarily for FAA'sproperty accounting. DOT also does not have integrated financial and performancemanagement systems. However, senior management is addressing these shortfalls, has submitted a new plan to comply with financial management standards, and is implementing a new, integrated financial system. \u007f E-Government \u2014DOT needs to strengthen its business cases for major information technology projects. In addition, some major projects, particularly those within FAA,are not operating within cost, schedule, and performance targets. However, DOT isimplementing e-business process initiatives that will improve agency operations. TheDepartment has an e-government leadership role for on-line rulemaking management.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014DOT's annual performance plan is cle ar and sets forth annual goals. However, accounts, staff, and activities are not sufficiently aligned with program targets, and resources are not requested in the context of pastresults. Cost of program outputs is not integrated with performance and DOT lacksa systematic performance management process to improve effectiveness. DOT isworking to improve its decision making process to base program management and resource decisions on costs and result s. \u007f266 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Department of Transportation (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budgetary Resources: Office of the Secretary .................................................................................. 90 108 145 Coast Guard ....................................................................................................

President George W. Bush September 24, 2001Treasury is redoubling its efforts to fight terrorism while continuing to implementcritical programs to guard against otherthreats, such as violent crime and illegal drug use. Financial Crimes and Terrorist Fundraising Stopping Terrorist Financing On November 7, 2001, with the help of Treasury's new counter-terrorism financial task force\u2014Operation Green Quest\u2014Treasury blocked the U.S. assets of 62 individualsand organizations connected with twoterror-supporting financial networks\u2014the alTaqwa and the al Barakaat financial networks.These networks raise, manage, invest, and distribute funds for Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist organization. Senior al Qaedaleaders are also senior leaders in other terroristorganizations. Al Barakaat and al Taqwa havea presence in over 40 nations, including theUnited States, and the United States carefully coordinates its actions with allies around the world to defeat them.Treasury leads the nation's war against the financing of global terrorism. Treasury'sFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network(FinCEN) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identify the numerous methods used by terrorist networks to financetheir operations and move quickly to freezethose assets and provide information to lawenforcement agencies. Armed with suspicious activity reports and financial transaction records maintained by financial institutions and required bythe Bank Secrecy Act, FinCEN assists lawenforcement efforts to prevent and detectmoney laundering and other financial crimes.These data, along with other commercial and law enforcement information, allow FinCEN to link business associates, bank accounts,property records, and other information toform a more complete financial trail. FinCENalso works with foreign financial intelligence units to extend its reach beyond U.S. borders. The budget provides $52 million for FinCEN's operations.

OFAC uses information from FinCEN and the law enforcement andintelligence communities to identify terroristgroups that threaten our national securityand to assess their methods of transferringfunds. This information is then used to deny these groups access to international financial systems, impair their fundraising capabilities,and expose their financial backers. OFACalso assists the nation's allies in similaractions. Since September 11, 2001, OFAC hasfrozen $34 million in terrorist assets (Taliban, Hamas, and al Qaeda) and assisted our nation's allies in freezing $33.9 million. Prior to September 11 th, OFAC successfully froze $236 million in Taliban assets. The budget provides $22 million for OFAC's operations. Border Control Homeland Security Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Customs Service threat level waschanged from Alert Level 4 (normal operations)to the highest level, Alert Level 1 (Code Red).The U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders remained open to traffic and commerce while Customs maintained an Alert Level 1 status.Land borders and all ports of entry into the UnitedStates are subject to intensive anti-terrorismoperations. The fight against terrorism has nowbecome the number one priority of the Customs Service. Customs is present at 301 ports of entry into the country\u2014international airports,seaports, and land border crossings across thecountry. Customs' budget has been substantiallyincreased in 2002 and 2003 to provide morestaffing and technology to further improve border security.The U.S. Customs Service is one of the primary enforcement agencies protecting the nation's borders, deploying an extensive air,land, and marine interdiction force supportedby an investigative division. It enforces tradeand tariff laws (2001 tariff collections were$20 billion) and interdicts illegal drugs and contraband. On a typical day, the Customs Service processes 1.3 million passengers,51,000 trucks/containers, 590 vessels, 2,600aircraft, and 355,000 vehicles. The budgetprovides $3.2 billion for Customs operations. Protecting our borders from illegal entry of narcotics is a core mission of the Customs Service. Drug trafficking often raises thefunds terrorists need to operate. Americandemand for contraband unwittingly aids theirefforts. However, it is difficult to assess theeffect of Customs' drug interdiction actions on the war against drugs, since Customs uses the amount of illegal drugs seized as aperformance measure.270 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003020406080100Percent of Imports Compliant with Trade LawsPercent Source: Department of the Treasury.In 2001, 191,000 pounds of cocaine, 3,600 pounds of heroin, and 1.5 million pounds ofmarijuana were seized by Customs. However, seizures do not tell how much contraband gets through the nation's borders. Customsis working with the Office of National DrugControl Policy to craft better measures toevaluate effectiveness. Customs' mission includes both facilitating trade and ensuring compliance with import and export laws. Customs' efforts have beenlargely successful. In 2001, an estimated91 percent of imports were compliant withtrade and tariff requirements. To cope withtrade activity that it expects to double by 2005, Customs is modernizing its automation systems and using risk management to target high-risk cargo. Customs' current automation systems are outdated, often break down, and cannot dependably handle an increasing volume of trade. The replacement system, the Automated CommercialEnvironment (ACE), will enable Customs to convert to a paperless process for importers and anaccount-based system. Customs is working with partners in the trade industry and government to ensure that ACE is completed promptly and effectively. The budget supports this modernization effort with $313 million for the third year of ACE investments. 1999 2000 2001 2002 200305001,0001,500Passengers in millions Trade volume in billions of dollarsCustoms Workload Source: Department of the Treasury.The Customs Service is responsible for collecting several user fees for servicesprovided by Customs and other agencies thataid the traveling and importing community. The Administration proposes increasing two of these Customs fees: the Air/Sea passengerf e ea n dt h eC r u i s eV e s s e lP a s s e n g e rf e e . T h ecosts incurred by Customs have increased dueto inflation, and the fees should reflect thisreality. The Air/Sea passenger fee has been in place since 1986, but has not been increased. The budget proposes to increase this fee from$5 to $11 per passenger. The Cruise Vesselpassenger fee would increase from $1.75 to $2per passenger. The increased receipts fromthese fees will enhance Customs' Homeland Security efforts through payment of inspector overtime and related expenses.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 271 United States Secret Service Our country and its leaders live in a world of increasing domestic and global threats. The Secret Service is incorporating new technology to accomplish more effectively its unique mission of protecting the President and other public officials. In response to increasing homeland security threats, the Secret Service now protects more people, and its protection workload has increasedsignificantly. To support the Secret Service's expanding responsibilities during the war on terrorism,the budget proposes additional funding for the travel and overtime of current Secret Service agentsand officers. Funding proposed in 2003 also supports over 400 new agents and officers being hiredin 2002. Secret Service agents must remain vigilant at all times to protect our leaders.While much of what the public knows about the Secret Service relates to protectingthe President, the Secret Service also plays amajor role in protecting our nation's currencyand financial integrity. Over the last severalyears, the percentage of Secret Service financial crimes cases adopted for federal prosecution has remained relatively stableat around 50 percent. The looming threat ofcyber-terrorists and increasingly sophisticatedcounterfeiters makes it more critical that theS e c r e tS e r v i c em a k em o r ee f f i c i e n tu s eo fi t s current resources to reduce the vulnerability of our nation's currency and financial networks.

ATF stands in the front ranks of the nation's battle against terrorism. Explosivesare a preferred terrorist tool, and ATF is inthe unique position of not only regulatingcommerce in explosives, but also of having therequisite expertise and authority to investigate explosives-related crimes. Through these programs, ATF investigators are positionedto thwart terrorist activity at every levelof the execution process\u2014from the theft orillegal purchase of explosives to the interdiction and neutralization of those explosives for terroristpurposes at public events. The budget provides $913 million to support ATF.272 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY The budget reflects the Administration's strong commitment to use coordinated community efforts to prevent youth and gang violence. This is epitomized by ATF's Youth Crime GunInterdiction Initiative (YCGII), which provides ATF agents and technical support to work with local law enforcement to develop firearms trafficking cases against those supplying guns to youths and to initiate comprehensive tracing of firearms. In 2001, for example, the number of YCGII defendantsincreased to 1,342 from a total of 535 in 2000. The initiative currently includes 50 participatingsites located in 32 states and the District of Columbia. The budget proposes to expand YCGII andincludes $96 million, an increase of $11 million above 2002 for ATF, to add 10 additional YCGII sites. Tax Administration IRS workers process millions of tax returns by hand each year.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) serves as the principal revenue collector for thegovernment, collecting $1.9 trillion in 2001.The budget provides $10.4 billion for IRSoperations. IRS runs the tax filing process despite being saddled with outdated and often ineffectivetechnology and an increasingly complex taxcode. In 2001, it processed 220 million taxreturns and over 1 billion information returns(e.g., W-2 wage reports from employers), and it delivered 97 million refunds. IRS has successfully responded to recent challengesby updating its systems to avoid the Year 2000problem and collaborating with the Treasury'sFinancial Management Service to deliver 86million tax rebate checks in 2001. 2000 2001* 2002 200301020304050607080Percent of Telephone Calls Answered by the IRSPercent *Peformance decrease due to 24 million tax rebate calls.Source: Department of the Treasury.IRS has trouble providing minimally acceptable customer service and ensuring thatall taxpayers pay what they owe under the law.Due to outmoded technology and managementpractices, IRS's $775 million telephone serviceprogram is unable to answer millions of phone calls each year. IRS has worked hard in recent years to improve this situation. Thepercentage of calls answered was only 49percent in 1997. Its goal is to improve to 76percent in 2003 (see accompanying chart).However, more progress is needed\u2014what business would survive for long if it failed to pick up the phone one time in four?

Audit numbers have fallen significantly in recent years, but there have been no improvements in IRS's abilityto target limited audit resources on the leastcompliant taxpayers. These problems burden honest taxpayers in two important ways. First, taxpayers often do not receive the help they need to accurately file their returns. Second, honest taxpayersbear a heavier financial burden becausenoncomplying taxpayers are not paying whatthey owe. The Administration is committed tosolving the problems at IRS and ensuring that taxes are collected fairly, efficiently, and with minimum hassle for honest taxpayers. Modernized Technology Will Improve IRS Service Millions of taxpayers call IRS each year to ask whether their returns have been received andwhen they will get their refunds. The time it takesto answer these calls diverts IRS away fromhelping other taxpayers resolve more complex problems. IRS modernization will help. For example, starting in 2002 taxpayers will be able tolog onto a secure website and receive informationon their return status. If there is an issue with thereturn, such as a math error or missing signature,the taxpayer will be informed of the nature of the problem and provided with information to help resolve it expeditiously. IRS estimates that thiswill result in a 50-percent reduction in calls frompeople asking for information on the status oftheir return.IRS is in the midst of a major reform effort required by the 1998 Restructuring and Reform Act. IRS has reorganized around operating divisions serving specific customergroups, and is in the process of modernizingits technology and management practices.The budget supports these efforts by providing$450 million for technology investments and $102 million for new customer service and compliance staffing. Modernization will yieldsubstantial improvements in IRS's efficiencyand effectiveness because IRS staff willhave up-to-date, accurate information abouttaxpayer accounts. Too often, IRS data is incomplete and out-of-date. In addition, IRS is now able to target services and employeetraining to specific types of taxpayers. Forexample, some groups of IRS employeesnow specialize in earned income tax creditissues while others specialize in helping small businesses. Until the reorganization, employees had to try to understand all areasof the highly complex tax system.274 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Electronic Tax Return Filing Today, individuals have to pay accountants, buy software, and pay fees just to file their tax return. It should not be so hard to pay taxes. For example, electronic filers must purchase an electronic filing service from aprivate vendor at an average cost of $12.50 compared to 34 cents for a first-class stamp on a paper return. The EZ Tax Filing E-Government initiative will r educe the cost and burden of filing taxes. Electronic filing is quick, easy, and far less prone to error than traditional paper returns. The Administration proposes an easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online. Further, legislation will be proposed toextend the April filing date for electronic returns by at least 10 days. IRS is also renewing its efforts to measure taxpayer compliance. This will allow it to focus more effectively its enforcement resources on noncompliant taxpayers, and reduce the burden of unnecessary audits on honest taxpayers. Finally, IRS will employ private sector contractors whereappropriate and where they can more efficiently provide services currently provided by federalemployees. Fiscal Services The Financial Management Service (FMS) serves as the central financial management office of the government, disbursing nearly one billion payments each year ($1.2 trillion) and collecting $2trillion in receipts (mostly IRS tax collections). 1999 2000 2001 2002 20032,0002,2002,4002,6002,8003,000Financial Management Service Debt Collection Dollars collected in millions Source: Department of the Treasury.In 1996, FMS became the government's central debt collector. Agencies are required totransfer non-tax debt over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for centralized collection. Treasury employs two tools to collect this debt: paymentoffset and cross servicing. Offset involvesmatching federal payments (e.g., tax refunds,vendor payments) against debt owed to thegovernment. Cross servicing involves issuing demand letters, referring debt to private collection agencies, and a variety of othermethods. Treasury is working to ensure thatagencies refer their debt that is eligible forcross servicing. Currently, they refer only 74percent.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 275 Treasury manages the $5.9 trillion federal debt, including $3.4 trillion held by the public and $2.5 trillion in Trust Fund balances (e.g., Social Security). Each year, the Bureau of Public Debt sellsapproximately 43 million savings bonds and pays $360 billion in interest. Treasury also produces 23 billion coins and 7 billion currency notes per year. Community Development Financial Institutions The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund seeks to expand the availability of credit, investment capital, and financial services in distressed urban and ruralcommunities through assistance to CDFIs. Since the Fund's creation, it has made more than $539 million in awards to community development organizations and financial institutions. However, the impact of these investments is difficult to measure. The key outcomes that the Fund monitors,such as businesses or housing units financed, do not consider that CDFIs and traditional financialinstitutions may have made some or all of these investments in the absence of government support.In response to this concern, the Fund's management plans to build a data repository on the CDFIindustry. The Fund can then use this information to measure the impact of its awards on low-income communities and better target future assistance. Status Report on Select Programs Treasury has a diverse set of programs, including manufacturing (producing coins and currency), financial management (managing public funds and borrowing), tax collection, and various lawenforcement functions. The table that follows evaluates the current performance of several of these programs. Program Assessment Explanation Financial ManagementService (FMS)Collection andPayment ProcessingEffective In 2001, FMS collected over $2 trillion in federal taxes and otherreceipts, and disbursed more than $1.2 trillion in federal payments. Byvolume, roughly 75 percent of collections and 72 percent of paymentswere processed electronically, with 99.9998 percent of paymentsmade on time. Seventy-seven percent of payments to citizens and 60 percent to businesses were made electronically. Customs Trade ComplianceEffective The Customs Service maintains a sound trade management systemthat maximizes compliance with import and export laws and movescargo efficiently. In 2001, Customs achieved its goal of ensuringthat 91 percent of imports were compliant with trade and tariffrequirements. Customs Drug InterdictionUnknown The Customs Service seizes large amounts of drugs at the border.However, the government does not know how much contraba nd gets through our borders.276 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Program Assessment Explanation IRS Customer ServiceIneffective Due to outmoded technology and management practices, IRSprovides poor service to taxpayers. However, technology investments and improving work processes are gradually improving performance. IRS Tax Compliance EnforcementIneffective Due to outmoded technology and management practices, IRS isunable to ensure that all citizens pay the taxes they owe under the law.IRS's current modernization program will give it the tools to improveperformance in this area. Strengthening Management While Treasury faces challenges to improve management and implement the President's Management Agenda, the Department is committed to making improvements in these initiatives in2002 and 2003. Initiative2001 Status Human Capital \u2014The Treasury Department is facing many human capital-related questions, such as how to deal with an aging workforce (10 percent of Treasury's workforce is eligibleto retire now; in five years this will rise to 30 percent) and make fundamental restructuringchanges to increase performance for citizens. While some bureaus have taken steps toface these challenges, Treasury has not developed a coordinated strategy that addressesskills imbalances in mission-critical occupations; succession pl anning; better use of existing personnel management tools and technology; and how the agency rewards high performers and addresses low performance. The Department will complete a comprehensive plan in2002 to address these challenges.\u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014Treasury has not yet completed public-private or direct conversion competition on any of the positions that it has identified as commercial in nature. However, theDepartment has committed to achieving the 15 percent goal by the end of 2003. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 277 Initiative2001 Status Financial Management \u2014Treasury received an unqualified opinion on its 2000 financial audit. However, substantial weaknesses in financial management systems and controls at Customs and IRS, the two largest bureaus in Treasury, hamper effective management and make itdifficult for Treasury to sustain an unqualified opinion in the future. Improvements are alsoneeded to reduce the number of improper payments. An estimated 25 percent of EarnedIncome Tax Credit payments were made incorrectly for tax year 1997. Treasury is workingto improve its financial systems and has a $154 mi llion compliance program to r educe errors in the Earned Income Tax Credit program. The Department is also moving aggressively to accelerate the preparation of monthly financial statements and expects to set the standard forthe government in timely statements by the summer of 2002. In addition, the budget proposeslegislative change to allow IRS to match the income reported on student aid applicationswith tax return data. This will help reduce errors in the Education Department's student aidprograms and save an estimated $138 million in 2003.\u007f E-Government \u2014Treasury has made progress in recent years in improving its technology investment planning and execution (i.e., using business cases and monitoring progress against performance targets). However, improvements are still needed to ensure that all investmentsare managed carefully to achieve maximum benefits. Treasury has also made progress inimplementing electronic government options for citizens (e.g., electronic tax filing and benefitspayments). The budget proposes to further expand electronic government, including newtaxpayer services and expanding the Treasury's Pay.gov on line payment system.\u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014Treasury needs to continue to improve its performance measures to include more outcome indicators and to make certain that all programs havebalanced measures of outputs, quality, and customer satisfaction. The Department hascommitted to provide a full performance plan/review to the Congress in support of the budget,and will work through 2002 to improve its measures in time for the 2004 Budget process.\u007f278 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Department of the Treasury (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Tax Administration 2,316 Fiscal Services 377 431 432 Management and Inspector General ..................................... 492 455 479 Community Development Financial Institutions ................... 118 80 68 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1................. 16,646 Remove contingent budget authority ......................................... 14,477 15,936 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: Customs Service ...................................................................... 36 429 \u2014 All other Treasury programs ................................................... 12 251 \u2014 Total, Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ...... 48 680 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: Payments Where Tax Credits Exceed Liability for Tax: Existing law .......................................................................... 27,105 35,672 38,077 Legislative proposal ............................................................ \u2014\u2014 7 7 4 Miscellaneous receipts and other mandatory spending ..... 2,764 841 2,884 Subtotal, Remove contingent Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 24,336 34,826 35,962 Interest: Financing 352,033 330,998 345,595 Credit activity: Direct Loan Disbursements: Community Development Financial Institutions ................... 91 01 0 Guaranteed Loans: Air Transportation Stabilization Board ................................... \u2014 5,000 5,000 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Department of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi, Secretary www.va.gov 202-273-4800 Number of Employees : 207,028 2002 Spending : $51.5 billion Organization : Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and NationalCemetery Administration.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the largest direct health caredelivery system in the country; administers veterans' benefits, including monthly disability payments, education assistance,life insurance, home loans, and vocationalrehabilitation; and runs a nationwide systemof veterans' cemeteries while awarding otherburial benefits. 279280 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Overview 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020051015202530 Number of Veterans Number Over Age 65Veterans Population Projections In millions Source: Department of Veterans Affairs.Today, there are 25 million veterans, but in the next 20 years this number will decline by one-third, to 17 million (as shown in the accompanying chart). Although VA ischarged with providing services to the entireveteran population, fewer than one in fiveveterans participate in VA programs. Thedecline in population ultimately will mean that fewer veterans will seek medical care, monthly disability benefits, and burials atVA cemeteries. However, on the immediatehorizon, there will be increased usage of someVA benefits and services, as veterans age andmore women draw on them. The imperative of recognizing veterans' contributions to the nation means that VA's strategy, businessplan, and infrastructure will need to adapt to ensure top-quality services and be flexible enough tohandle changing dynamics and waning population. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing the management of programs throughout the government. Poor performing programs that are not mission critical will be eliminated, cut back, or reconfigured sothat their funding can be redirected to be more effectively used. The accompanying table rates theperformance of some of VA's most important programs. Those with ineffective ratings are targetedfor rapid improvement. Program Assessment Explanation Disability and Pension Claims ProcessingIneffective VA systems and processes should be flexible to address an ever-changing, demand-driven environment. VA is automating its existing processes slowly but needs to identify and remedy the underlying causes of sluggish processing. It must modernize itsinformation technology capabilities. Care for Disabledand Low-IncomeVeteransIneffective VA's medical care system's ability to provide timely and high-qualitycare to its core disabled and low-income veterans is being jeopardizedby the rapid increase of other veterans receiving VA care. Cemetery Benefits Effective The National Cemetery Administration strives to provide high quality, courteous, and responsive service in all of its conta cts with veterans and their families. Of survey respondents, 92 percent rate the services provided by the national cemeteries as excellent. However,improvements can be made in cemetery system planning.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 281 Program Assessment Explanation Health Care Quality Effective VA is a recognized leader in health care quality and has been at the forefront of innovations such as bar coding of prescription drugs, computerized patient records, and medical error reporting. Medical Care InfrastructureAssessment(CARES)Unknown VA has fallen eight months behind schedule on the first of 22 regionalstudies, and it is yet unclear whether future studies will benefit fromcorrecting weaknesses identified in the first study. Guarantee that Veterans' Disability Claims are Processed Accurately and Quickly I must say that I think the VA has the necessary resources right now to do the job ...the Agency can't justify asking for more people right now. Vice Admiral Cooper (retired) Government Executive , November 8, 2001One of the President's top priorities is to make sure that when a veteran submits aclaim for a disability, it is processed quicklyand accurately. Disability benefits provide amonthly benefit to veterans who are disabledas a result of their military service. Currently, 2.3 million veterans receive these tax-free benefits. The amount awarded to a veterandepends on the severity of the disability. For2002, the basic monthly benefit ranges from $103 for a 10 percent disability rating to $2,163 for a 100 percent disability rating. Roughly half ofveterans receiving compensation are less than 30 percent disabled. Improving the quality of life of the disabled is a national responsibility. And yet, the time and cost of processing disability claims have steadily increased. The average number of days to processa claim has risen from 100 days in 1996 to 181 days in 2001, and the number of claims awaiting adecision has jumped from 343,000 to over 644,000 during that same period. Meanwhile, the levelof benefits paid increased by 27 percent in the past five years, while the cost of administering thesebenefits more than doubled.282 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VA benefits help veterans lead active lives.There are three main reasons for continued poor performance. First, the complexity of the claims hasincreased because veterans are requesting benefitsfor more than one disability at a time. Second, lawsand regulations are passed with immediate startdates\u2014giving VA no lead time to handle the wave of new work required. Finally, VA has failed to effectively manage its nation-wide system of benefit offices. 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003050100150200250Average Number of Days to Process a Disability Compensation ClaimDays Ultimate Goal is 74 Days Source: Department of Veterans Affairs.To handle a growing backlog of claims, VA has repeatedly turned to hiring moreand more employees. Since 1998, nearly2,000 people have been hired to help processclaims. Success, however, will ultimatelydepend not on hiring new employees, but on the application of modern information tools and, most of all, the establishment of trueorganizational accountability. In October 2001, Vice Admiral Daniel L. Cooper (retired), who led the 14-memberDepartment of Veterans Affairs Claims Processing Task Force ,p r e s e n t e d af i n a l report to VA. The report concluded that, asa result of basic flaws in organization andcommunication, VA is unable to handle the effects of judicial decisions and legislative changes onworkload. Productivity is poor, and so far management has proven incapable of introducing changeand flexibility into the workplace. VA should concentrate on radically changing the way it does business. These changes include identifying practices that work best at VA and enforcing their use across the country; allocating bothwork and funds to the best regional offices; creating specialized processing centers; and developinga computer system that allows people throughout the country to work on individual claims at thesame time.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 283 The success of these initiatives must and will be measurable. Speed should not come at the sacrifice of accuracy, or vice versa. VA will use the following two critical performance measures toensure that its efforts are balanced: \u007fProcess disability compensation and pension claims in an average of 165 days in 2003(ultimate goal is 74 days\u2014given the legal and medical complexities and VA's responsibilityto help prepare claims); and \u007fAttain an 88 percent national accuracy rate for core rating work in 2003 (ultimate goal is 96percent) To deliver services quickly and effectively, it is just as important to establish a relationship between performance and resources, but VA has not done this. The Department cannot, for example,say that for every $500,000 increase in funding, timeliness and accuracy improve by measurablepercentages. Until relationships like these are defined, it is impossible to figure out the optimal amount of funding for veterans' services. Improve Health Care Delivery by Coordinating the Medical Care Systems of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense Although VA and the Department of Defense (DoD) both operate very large medical care systems with a combined cost of over $40 billion yearly, historically there has been little cooperation between the Departments. The Departments assert that the most common barriers have been differentmissions, patient populations, and cultures, as well as differing opinions on who would lead theeffort. However, both Departments describe sharing efforts. Only $100 million\u2014or one-quarter ofone percent\u2014of $40 billion in expenses passes from one to the other. Unnecessary Paperwork All veterans, by definition, were members of the Armed Services. While on active duty their (and their families') information was tracked by a system that covered everything from securityclearances, to health care entitlements, tocommissary privileges. In an era of rapid high-tech changes, the minute veterans want to apply for VA benefits, they must provide pages of information on paper, that was already on computers at DoD. Likewise, whenthese same veterans later apply for other VAbenefits, they start the process all over again.Sharing information and technology can make a world of difference to the militaryand veteran communities. It can speedup service, ensure veterans' safety, andinform veterans of entitlements that they are due. In addition, information sharing can transmit important knowledge through thedepartments' walls\u2014replacing the myth thatthey have little in common.284 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Failure to Communicate Military retirees can use both DoD and VA medical care systems. Today, many selectivelyuse both. When a retiree goes to VA for servicesone week and DoD the next, serious errors can result if the doctors do not know what others have done. Despite information sharing effortswithin VA, if drugs ordered in each system haveadverse interactions, patients may becomegravely ill or die.In many communities, VA and DoD hospitals are close to each other and offersimilar services (e.g., primary care, surgery,or eye care). However, traditionally neitherhas considered the other as an option indetermining construction or health delivery needs. In light of the new emphasis on sharing, the DoD and VA are working togetherto solve mutual problems in the GreaterC h i c a g oa r e a ,w h e r ec u r r e n t l yt h e r ea r ef i v eVA hospitals and one DoD hospital as shownin the map. DoD needs more space and had plans to build a new hospital within walking distance of a near-empty VA hospital. NowVA and DoD are planning to jointly share this hospital and save a significant amount of money byreducing construction of new buildings. Chicago Area VA/DoD Hospitals ILLINOISINDIANAMICHIGANWISCONSIN Milwaukee North Chicago Chicago DoD HospitalVA HospitalLAKE MICHIGAN Source: Department of Veterans Affairs.The lack of sharing resources and information also results in a waste of the taxpayers' money. This has frustrated the Congress, which has mandated experimentalprograms for sharing buildings and people. Inaddition, the Congress has asked VA and DoDto work together to purchase drugs and othermedical supplies at a lower price, resulting in savings to the government. Patient Transportation If a veteran needs to be moved long distances from one VA hospital to another, he is typically transported via commercial airline. This is veryexpensive. DoD routinely transports militarypatients in planes with unused space. VA andDoD are negotiating how to put VA patients onDoD planes, thereby lowering the cost to both departments.President Bush made it one of his top priorities to coordinate the two systems. Fourareas have been identified as high-priority for coordination: veteran enrollment; computerized patient records; cooperationon air transportation of patients; and facilitysharing instead of new construction. ThePresident established a task force thatwill make recommendations this year to improve the coordination between the two Departments' health care systems.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 285 Moreover, the President's Management Agenda includes an initiative to increase coordination and delivery by VA and DoD of veterans' benefits and services. Over the past year, VA and DoD haveundertaken an effort to improve cooperation and sharing in several areas by a reinvigorated VA/DoD Executive Council. Focuses Medical Care Resources on Treating Disabled and Low-Income Veterans 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005020406080100 Source: Department of Veterans Affairs.Disabled and Low-Income Patients Decrease As a percentage of veteran patientsA 1996 law, allowing VA to treat patients in the most practical settings, changed the wayVA delivers care to veterans in very much the same way as the private sector changed. For example, the Department now provides mostof its care in clinics and homes instead of inhospitals. This shift has allowed VA to spendits resources more effectively and has providedpatients with more convenient service. At the same time, patients have also benefited from new innovative safety and quality systems.Today, VA is recognized as a world leader inquality medical care. The same 1996 law also required VA to enroll veterans for medical care in one of seven distinct priority levels. Veterans with military disabilities or low-incomes are in the higher priority levels to preserve VA's core mission. All other veterans fall into the lowest level. The enrollmentprocess requires VA's Secretary to announce, prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, what prioritylevels of veterans are eligible to receive care given the level of funding enacted into law. Each yearsince, VA has announced that all veterans are eligible to receive care. When eligible for care, aveteran is entitled to receive the full basic benefits package of services. Prior to the 1996 law, veterans in the lowest priority level were only treated on a space-available basis, and were restricted as to what care they could receive and where they could receive it. However,since the law took effect, these veterans have grown from two percent to over 21 percent of VA patientsas shown in the chart above. They have always been required to pay for a minor portion of their careby the use of co-payments. But given their rapidly escalating numbers, these veterans will consumea critical portion of VA resources at the expense of the disabled, poorer veteran population unless they are required to pay a greater portion of their care. The budget proposes a new $1,500 annual deductible amount for these veterans, whereby they would pay 45 percent of the charge until theirout-of-pocket expenses total $1,500. Although VA has changed the way it provides care to veterans, its buildings are relics of the past. VA's buildings are not located where most veterans live. Although many veterans have moved tothe South and Southwest (where waiting times for appointments have grown), VA still maintains underused hospitals throughout the North and East regions of the country (where few seek such services). The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that VA was wasting up to $1 million a dayin keeping these hospitals operating. VA should be expanding the number of clinics where disabledand low-income veterans are living and converting many of its massive hospitals to more efficientclinics, where needed. To do this, VA began a review process in the first of its 22 regions in thefall of 2000. This process is known as Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES).286 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS The contractor's recommendations were completed June 2001, but VA has not yet decided how to proceed in the other 21 regions. In addition, VA has not modified its contract methods to correct somedeficiencies identified in the first study. Savings identified will be used to provide care to veterans in the same or other geographical areas. Funds Major Expansion in Cemeteries to Prepare for Increased Burial Demands VA cemeteries are rated excellent by almost all.Over 90 percent of family members and funeral directors who have recently received services from a national cemetery rate the quality of VA's burial services as excellent. By theend of 2002, VA will operate 120 national cemeteries and over40 VA-funded state cemeteries providing burial services foralmost 100,000 veterans and eligible family members peryear. VA's goal is to ensure compassionate and good service, while searching for more efficient ways of doing business. For example, kiosk information centers are being placed incemeteries to assist visitors in finding exact gravesite locations.In addition, VA orders almost all headstones by computer toshorten the waiting times for families. Soon, VA will have a major challenge in determining the appropriate number, location, and mix of national and state cemeteries as the veteran population continues to decline andas deaths peak over the next decade (see accompanying chart). 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030300400500600700800In thousands Source: Department of Veterans Affairs.Veteran Mortality Challenge: How to manage the cemetery system to meet the increasing needsover the next five years, followed by thedeclining requirements thereafter.O n eo fV A ' sk e yg o a l si st oe n s u r et h a tm o s t veterans have a national or state veterans' cemetery within 75 miles of their home. Therecent opening of several new cemeteries, withmore on the way, has helped improve veteranaccess to burial to 73 percent in 2001. Plannedperformance for 2003 is 76 percent. VA will n e v e rb ea b l et oa c c o m p l i s h1 0 0p e r c e n t ,n o r should it. It is not cost-effective to constructnew national cemeteries in regions with fewveterans. Therefore, VA must reevaluate howbest to economically maximize caring for thelargest number of deceased veterans and their families. To date, though, VA has not defin ed the minimum number of veterans that national and state cemeteries should serve before construction is justified. Nor has the department suggestedsubstitute benefits that might be appropriate for veterans in under-populated areas.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 287 Strengthening Management Although VA has made some progress in addressing its financial performance shortcomings, it has made little progress elsewhere. The Department is working to develop a satisfactory plan to achieve the President's goals for competitive sourcing, E-Government, and human resources. The scorecard below shows VA's 2001 status on the President's management initiatives. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital\u2014 VA, like most other federal agencies, faces human capital challenges when its aging workforce retires and leaves gaps in critical skills such as disability claimsadjudicators (where it takes several years to train new employees in complex medical and legalskills). The Department will revise its current plan to incorporate more detailed methods oftackling this challenge with clear deliverables and deadlines. In addition, VA will examine the different pay options it has available in order to ensure that geographic shortages of critical medical care providers can be addressed. \u007f Competitive Sourcing\u2014 Nearly half of all federal employees perform tasks that are readily available in the commercial marketplace. The Department is developing a plan to meet theAdministration's goal of allowing the private sector to compete commercial functions currentlydone by the government. \u007f Financial Management\u2014 VA has persistent problems with internal controls, which include nine material weaknesses, all of which have been carried over from prior years. However, VA has developed a financial management plan to address its problems, and is now moving towardsimplementing an acceptable financial system. \u007f E-Government\u2014 Historically, VA has made major information technology (IT) decisions without thorough analysis. For example, the Department does not coordinate its planningand investment processes, and does not fully develop its justifications for major IT projects.It also lacks an enterprise architecture to make IT investment decisions. In early 2002, VA will produce a timetable for completion of its enterprise architecture. The department also is committed to providing qualified business cases by March 2002. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration\u2014 VA cannot monitor with sufficient precision the cost and effectiveness of many of its programs. For example, VA used the Hepatitis C crisis to arguefor, and receive, $0.7 billion of additi onal funding specific to this cause for the three years beginning with 2000. However, VA has been unable to track the expenditure of this amount to Hepatitis C care, to determine how and if the funding changed perfor mance, or report on how veterans have been served nationwide. While VA is working on a comprehensive patient Hepatitis C tracking system, no plans to link this performance with budget have beenaddressed. VA will present a timetable and plan to link key performance goals throughout theDepartment with funding levels by June 2002. \u007f288 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Department of Veterans Affairs (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary budget authority: ............................................................................. 69 74 and Prosthetic Research ........................................................... 363 384 409 Construction: 361 523 536 Major Construction .................................................................................... 66 183 194 Minor Construction .................................................................................... 170 211 211 Other Construction .................................................................................... 125 129 132 Veterans Benefits Administration: 1,049 1,166 1,408 Benefits Administration: Legislative Proposal ............................................................................. \u2014\u20142 0 Credit Administration ................................................................................. 166 168 172 VETS State Grant Awards: Existing Law .......................................................................................... \u2014\u2014\u2014 Legislative Proposal ............................................................................. \u2014\u2014 1 7 7 Other: 401 439 479 General Administration ............................................................................. 235 253 278 General Administration (credit) ................................................................ 455 Inspector General ...................................................................................... 48 55 58 National Cemetery Administration .......................................................... 114 126 138 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1.................................. 23,164 24,657 26,447 Remove contingent adjustments .............................................................

Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil Works Mike Parker: Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/cepa.htm 703-697-8986 Number of Employees (2002) : 24,800 2002 Spending : $5.0 billion Field Offices : Eight Divisions; 38 Districts; 15 laboratories and other offices.The Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program is responsible for assisting thedevelopment and management of the nation'swater resources. Its main missions are to: 1)aid commercial navigation; 2) protect citizens and their property from flood and storm damages; and 3) protect, restore and manageenvironmental resources. The Corps carriesout most of its work in partnership with stateand local governments and other non-federalentities. 291292 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS Overview The Civil Works program has seven primary business lines: 1) navigation; 2) flood control and coastal storm damage reduction; 3) environment; 4) recreation management; 5) hydropower; 6) regulatory; and 7) emergency management. Implementing these business lines involves the Corps of Engineers in the planning, construction, operation or maintenance of over 8,000 civil worksprojects. These include about 900 ports and harbors and over 275 locks and dams for navigation,4,300 recreation areas, and 75 hydropower generation facilities. The Corps' investments in newconstruction projects are typically joint ventures with non-federal sponsors. With the exceptionof navigation projects and multipurpose reservoirs, the local sponsor usually owns, operates, and maintains the project once it is built. Congress periodically directs the Corps to work in other areas that duplicate existing federal programs or are activities that should be carried out by non-federal interests. This \"missioncreep\" diverts the Corps from its primary business lines, slows down completion of higher priorityconstruction projects, and postpones the benefits that completing these projects would bring. Status Report On Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The accompanying table provides its assessment of program performance foreach of the Corps' primary business lines. The budget for the Corps proposes to redirect funds fromthe Corps' lesser performing projects and programs to higher priority or more effective ones and toimprove performance in other areas. Program Assessment Explanation Navigation: Deep-draft Moderately EffectivePlanning is typically done project-by-project rather than considering nationwide needs systematically. Shallow-draft Ineffective Many projects provide recreational benefits rather than commercial benefits. Inland waterways Moderately EffectiveOhio and Mississippi River systems highly efficient, but some other segments benefit few commercial users; traffic management systemneeds improvement; heavily subsidized by the federal government. Flood and Storm Damage ReductionEffective Projects meet performance goals; concerns with inadequate localcost-sharing of shore protection projects. Environmental RestorationUnknown Little data on environmental outcomes of completed restorationprojects and other environmental activities. RecreationManagement Moderately EffectiveGenerally high customer satisfaction; many facilities are obsolete.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 293 Program Assessment Explanation Hydropower Moderately EffectiveOpportunities exist to reduce facility \"downtime.\" Regulatory Moderately EffectiveOpportunities exist to accelerate permit processing; little data on environmental outcomes of permit actions. Emergency ResponseEffective Consistently high performance. Congressional Earmarks The 2003 Budget focuses Corps funding on the main Civil Works mission areas that benefit the nation\u2014commercial navigation, flood damage reduction, and environmental restoration. In recent years, the Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for the Corps to undertake an increasing number of projects that fall outside the scope of its historic missions, such as buildingsewage treatment plants, revitalizing local waterfronts, and maintaining waterways primarily for local recreation. Whatever the merit of these projects, they should be carried out by others. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides funds specifically for building sewagetreatment plants. These ancillary projects divert resources and delay completion of economicallyjustified projects that are within the Corps' primary mission areas. Congressional Earmarks Year NumberBA in millions of dollarsPercent of Total Budget Authority 2001 .................................. 405 367 8% 2002 .................................. 604 431 10%294 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS Mission Creep In 2002, the Congress earmarked $500,000 to start construction of the Florida Keys WaterQuality Improvements project, a wastewater treatment initiative that would require about $100 mi llion to complete. Corps funding of such projects circumvents procedures in EPA'sClean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) forensuring that these funds address the state'shighest priority wastewater needs. Florida received nearly $46 million of CWSRF funding in 2002.Unrequested earmarks include congressional directives that preempt theadministrative allocation process for smallprojects in the Corps' \"continuing authorities\"programs, and directives for larger projectsoutside the Corps' mission areas. For example, in 2002, over three-fourths of the funding for congressionally added projects in the Corps'construction program were for projects thatare inconsistent with long-established policiesfor the Corps of Engineers, which should notbe part of the Corps program. These include over 30 of the 47 new construction projects started in 2002. It would require about $5billion to complete all the projects added bythe Congress that are inconsistent with Corpspolicies\u2014that's $5 billion diverted from nationally important navigation, flood damage reduction,and environmental restoration projects already underway. Flood Damage Reduction The Corps estimates that its existing flood damage reduction projects prevent about $21 billion in damages in an average year, and over time have returned $6 for every $1 invested (see accompanyingchart). These benefits vary greatly from year-to-year depending on flood events. Despite these federalinvestments, flood damage nationwide is increasing. Federal, state, and local decisions can diminish or increase flood risks and affect flood damages. 1940 1947 1954 1961 1968 1975 1982 1989 19960100200300400500600700800 Cumulative Benefits Cumulative ExpendituresCorps Flood Damage Reduction Projects: $6 Returned for Every $1 Invested In billions of dollars Source: Corps of Engineers.Besides funding justified investments in Corps flood damage reduction projects, the2003 Budget will continue assistance to statesand communities to reduce flood risks throughplanning and promoting better floodplain management. The Corps is also increasingly incorporating environmentally beneficialdesigns into its flood damage reductionprojects. For example, the project to protectthe City of Napa, California, reestablishesformer marshes and floodplains along the Napa River. These areas will provide wildlife habitat as well as space to convey floodwatersaway from the city. The Administration's goal is to ensure that the American people get the most flood protection for each dollar invested. The accompanying tableis a rough comparison of the estimated return that the Corps expects from each dollar it spends on flood damage reduction projects with returns for selected federal programs with a similar objective. As discussed in the Department of Agriculture chapter, the 2003 Budget proposes to reduce federalfunding for the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Small Watershed Program, which has aTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 295 lower economic return than both the Corps or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) programs. The budget also proposes to restructure FEMA's 404 hazard mitigation program toimprove its effectiveness, as discussed in the FEMA chapter. Benefits from Each Dollar Invested in Selected Federal Flood Damage Reduction Programs Corps of EngineersFederal Emergency Management Agency's 404 Flood Risk Mitigation1Department of Agriculture's Small Watershed Program $1.90 $2.30 $1.40 Corps personnel are often among the first people on the scene in flood emergencies.The Corps provides emergency assistance during and after floods or coastal stormsto save lives and protect public facilitiesand critical infrastructure. As part of itsemergency response mission, the Corps also assists FEMA, states, and localities with responses to natural and other disasters.Corps personnel are often among the firstpeople on the scene in flood and otheremergencies, providing pumps, generators,sandbags, clean water, and technical assistance to search and rescue operations. For example, the Corps assisted FEMAin responding to the terrorist attacks ofSeptember 11 th, by providing the New York City Fire Department interim communications equipment to replace phone lines destroyed by the attacks, evaluating the safety of damaged buildings, providing emergency power to the financial district, and assisting with debris removal and disposal. With regard to homeland security, the budget provides $65 million for the continuingcosts of additional guard positions at critical Corps facilities. 1Cost-benefit estimate is for flood-related projects in the 404 Mitigation program. FEMA cost-benefit comparisons are not strictly comparable due t o differences in methods used to measure costs and benefits. Also, some projects in the FEMA program were exempted from cost-benefit requirements by law or regulation, because of presumed benefits.296 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS Navigation The Corps maintains nearly 11,000 miles of commercial waterways and hundreds of ports and harbors, typically through lock operations and dredging. The Corps estimates that its navigation activities provide about $20 billion in benefits every year. Each dollar it spends in 2003 to construct commercial navigation projects will return an average of $3.30 in benefits upon project completion. The 2003 Budget targets funds to those waterways providing the greatest economic return to the nation, and limits funding for those with little commercial traffic. It includes $77 million forconstruction of Olmsted Lock and Dam in Illinois and Kentucky, an increase of $37 million over2002, to expedite completion of this important modernization project on the Ohio River. The budget also provides $120 million, an increase of $31.5 million over 2002, to accelerate the transportation cost savings and other economic benefits of deepening the Port of New York/New Jersey. 05101520Corps of Engineers Costs to Operate and Maintain Selected Inland Waterways Cents per ton-mile 0.05 0.088.43 0.1617.97 RiversAllegheny RiverKentucky RiverThe Corps operates and maintains some harbors and segments of the inland waterwaysystem that benefit few commercial users. Theaccompanying chart shows the wide variation in cost to operate and maintain segments of the inland waterway system in terms of costper commercial ton-mile, where the lower costis indicative of higher commercial benefits.The 2003 Budget targets funds to thosewaterways that provide the greatest economic return, and substantially reduces funding for those that provide minor commercialnavigation benefits. For two projects withminimal commercial usage\u2014the navigationfeatures on the Fox River, Wisconsin, andLocks and Dams 5 through 14 on the Kentucky River, Kentucky\u2014the Corps is in the midst of transferring ownership, operation, and maintenance responsibilities to non-federal interests. Environmental Restoration Enhancing the environment is another Corps main mission. The 2003 Budget includes substantial funding for Corps of Engineers environmental projects: \u007fThe budget provides a total of $245 million for Everglades restoration. This includes Corpsfunding of $149 million, a $10 million increase over 2002, and $96 million for programswithin the Department of the Interior. The budget includes $46 million specifically forimplementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, of which $37 millionis for the Corps and $9 million is for research, monitoring, and planning studies in theDepartment of the Interior. Everglades restoration efforts may start to pay off as early as September, 2003, when five of the 68 known federally endangered and threatened species in South Florida are expected to be changed from \"endangered\" status to \"threatened\" status orremoved from the list of federally protected species.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 297 \u007fThe budget ensures that the Corps will meet environmental requirements for salmon conservation in the Columbia River Basin (WA, OR, ID). It provides $128 million for theCorps' salmon conservation efforts, a $19 million, or 17 percent, increase over 2002 funding. This allocation includes $100 million for the Columbia River Fish Mitigation and Lower Columbia River Ecosystem Restoration programs, $17 million for operation and maintenanceactivities, and $11 million for studies and other activities needed to ensure compliance. Many of the Corps' ecosystem restoration projects are designed to improve the nation's wetlands resources. Other federal programs have a similar purpose. The accompanying table providesa rough, first-order comparison of the Corps' per-acre costs with two programs of other federal agencies with a similar mission, the Department of the Interior's North American Wetlands Conservation Fund and the Department of Agriculture's Wetlands Reserve Program. It is difficultto draw definite conclusions about program performance because the underlying cost of the landand the type and quality of resulting habitat can vary significantly by project and program. Forthis reason, the Administration will work over the next year to refine these data and to determinewhether reallocating funds among the agencies would further improve the nation's wetlands. Average Cost to Establish an Acre of Wetlands Corps of Engineers Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture $3,900 $2,250 $1,200 Improving Performance 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010510152025 Status Quo 2003 BudgetReducing the Construction Backlog Backlog in billions of dollarsThe Corps must work in a number of ways to improve its performance delivering services to the public. The Corps estimates that thebalance of funding needed to complete allactive construction or pre-construction work(including projects that are being studied,but are not yet authorized for construction) is over $40 billion. Of this, more than $21 billion of future federal funding is necessaryto complete the flood control, navigation, andenvironmental restoration projects funded inthe budget for the Corps' primary constructionprogram. Therefore, its major challenge is to complete those projects already underway in its primary construction program. Thisbacklog needs immediate and sustained attention. It is about 12 times the entire amountappropriated in 2002 for the construction program ($1.7 billion). Put another way, it would take 12years at the rate of funding the Congress provided in 2002 for the Corps just to finish funding theongoing construction projects supported in the budget. Unfortunately, as the accompanying chart shows, this backlog of ongoing construction projects has increased in recent years, as the Congress has added funds to start more new projects than can be afforded. The 2003 Budget proposes toreverse this trend.298 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS This increasing backlog also hurts the Corps' overall performance, as each new project diverts resources from completing ongoing construction efforts. This means the benefits the publicreasonably expects to receive from these projects are often delayed significantly. For example, construction work on Olmsted Lock and Dam began in 1991 and was scheduled for completion by 2006. However, it may not be finished until 2011. There are only three ways to shrink the backlog of ongoing, budgeted construction projects: \u007fprovide more funding; \u007fdefer or cease work on some ongoing projects; or \u007fstop adding new projects. Focus on Completing Projects The budget reduces the backlog of ongoing construction pr ojects in the budget from $21 billion to $13 billion over the next five years by: \u007fproviding $1.44 billion for the Corps' ongoing construction program in 2003 and comparablelevels in future years; \u007fproviding no funds for discretionary new construction in 2003; \u007ftargeting funding to projects that fall within the Corps' primary missions; and \u007fdropping funding significantly for studies of potential future construction projects. These actions will allow the Corps to complete 30 projects in 2003, which is 15 percent ofthe construction projects in the budget, and tocomplete other ongoing projects in the budgetsooner than possible under current spendingtrends.Recent experience demonstrates that more funding alone does not cut this backlog.During the last six years, funding for the Corps construction budget has increased more than 50 percent, but the backlog has grown by43 percent. Backlog growth occurred becausemore new projects were started than could befunded efficiently. Deferring or ceasing work is an option, but it is difficult to stop a project already underway. The Administration is reviewingprojects in the backlog to determine whetherany should be delayed in order to acceleratecompletion of others, but this is unlikely todramatically change the situation because the number of such projects appears to be small. That leaves not starting new projects. Stopping the flow of new commitments isa logical step toward completing ongoingprojects sooner. To the extent that the needfor a particular new project is compelling, it may be necessary to defer funding of one or more ongoing projects. Finally, an additional important challenge confronts the Corps. If it is to improve its performance in its main missions, it must find waysto prevent the diversion of resources away from these missions. As noted previously, many of theunrequested Corps projects added by the Congress are either not a federal responsibility or should be funded by other federal programs. The budget does not include funds for the Corps to continue these projects.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 299 Improving Hydropower Performance In 1999, the General Accounting Office found that the Corps' hydropower facilities are twiceas likely to experience \"unplanned outages\" as private-sector facilities, because the Corps does not always have funds for maintenanceand repairs when needed. Such outages resultin lost power production. The budget's proposalfor direct funding of the Corps hydropowermaintenance by Power Marketing Administration customers should enable the Corps to cut its unscheduled \"downtime\" by up to 40 percent overthe next few years and achieve a performancelevel matching that of non-federal hydropowerfacilities.The 2003 Budget includes several other initiatives to improve the Corps' performance.It proposes a $17 million, or 13 percent,increase in funding for the Corps' regulatoryprogram for activities affecting navigablewaters and wetlands. This increase would allow the Corps to reduce the average time for reviewing individual permit applicationsto 120 days by 2004, compared to the estimateof 160 days for 2002. The funding boost alsowould allow the Corps to issue 70 percent ofindividual permits within 120 days, compared to the estimate of 54 percent for 2002. It would strengthen protection of wetlands bysupporting watershed approaches in sensitiveareas and through improved oversight ofmitigation efforts. T h eb u d g e ta l s oi n c l u d e sap r o p o s a lf o r the Power Marketing Administrations to provide direct funding from power sales revenues for the operation and maintenance costs of Corps'hydropower facilities. This new financing arrangement will permit more timely maintenance ofhydropower facilities, which will enable the Corps to reduce facility \"downtime\" and increase powergeneration. Strengthening Management The Corps of Engineers has made progress addressing certain parts of the President's Management Agenda. For example, the Corps expects to achieve a clean opinion on its balancesheet for 2001. However, it has made little progress on other initiatives, and has failed to develop asatisfactory plan to achieve the President's goals for competitive sourcing and human resources. Ascorecard and summary of the Corps' status is shown below. In addition, the 2002 Budget Blueprint highlighted reforms needed in the Corps' project planning process to ensure higher quality, objective analysis of potential construction projects. The ArmyCorps of Engineers has made some progress on these reforms. The Assistant Secretary of the Armyfor Civil Works has established a new group to strengthen the policy consistency of Corps studies. TheAdministration will soon release its proposal for independent review of significant projects, anotherreform highlighted in the Blueprint .300 CORPS OF ENGINEERS\u2014CIVIL WORKS Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014The Corps has reduced its staff and supervisory ratio over the past eight years. However, its human capital plan does not adequately address competitivesourcing, e-government, workforce skills, or field office workload and staffingrequirements. The Corps plans to complete a human resources plan by March 2002. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014The Corps currently contracts out about 60 percent of its work, but still has a significant inventory of commercial work performed by governmental employees. It has agreed to complete its assessment of competitivesourcing opportunities and its competitive sourcing plan by September 2002, toachieve the Administration's two-year 15 percent goal in an effort to eventuallycompete 50 percent of all commercial activities. \u007f Financial Management \u2014Auditors were unable to give an opinion on the Corps' 2000 financial statements because of unresolved issues with valuing property, plant, and equipment, and a material weakness with computer security. The Corps expects toachieve a clean opinion on its 2001 statements. \u007f E-Government \u2014The Corps failed to prepare adequate business cases for all of its major information technology investments. It is developing business cases andimproving the planning and control processes that support these investments. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014The Corps' 2003 Budget submission included little integration of either outcome or output performance information to support proposed resource levels. The Corps will improve performance information in several key areasfor the 2004 Budget (e.g., operation and maintenance and regulatory activities). \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 301 Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil Works (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Construction, General ............................................................. 1,736 ................................... 2,046 1,939 1,979 General Investigations ............................................................. 166 159 108 Flood Control, Mississippi River and Tributaries .................. 366 353 288 Regulatory Program ................................................................. 131 134 151 All other programs .................................................................... 350 276 323 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1................. 4,795 4,597 4,290 Legislative Proposal, Operation and Maintenance .............. \u2014\u2014 149 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 108 111 115 Total, Discretionary budget authority ......................................... 4,687 4,486 4,026 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ................. \u20141 3 9 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: Operation and Maintenance, General: Existing law .......................................................................... 33 5 5 Legislative proposal ............................................................ \u2014\u2014 6 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. \u2014\u20144 9 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Environmental Protection Agency Christine Todd Whitman, Administrator www.epa.gov 202-564-4700 Number of Employees: 17,645 2002 Spending: Program, and $7.8 billion in total Organization: 17 labs and 10 regional offices across the country.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protects human health and the environment. EPA is generally focused on four areas: 1) air pollution; 2) water pollution;3) solid waste; and 4) regulation of chemicalproducts. It also cleans up hazardous wastesites and leaking underground tanks. Statesare largely responsible for implementing these programs. For example, approximately one third of EPA's funding is spent ongrants to states to build and maintain waterinfrastructure, including sewage treatmentplants and drinking water facilities. 303304 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Overview In the last 30 years, the United States has dramatically improved the protection of human health and the environment by reducing pollution. The reversal of environmental degradation to environmental improvement is one of this country's greatest success stories. Few, if any other nations have achieved such a turnaround on such a tremendous scale. For example: \u007fAmerican drivers now emit 41 percent fewer pollutants from their cars despite now driving143 percent more miles since 1970; \u007fSince 1988, the human health risk index from chronic exposure to toxic chemicals decreasedby over two-thirds from 100 to 27 points; \u007fMost of our lakes and rivers continue to get cleaner. For instance, the Bass Anglers SportsmanSociety rates the Potomac River\u2014the river President Lyndon Johnson once called a \"nationaldisgrace\"\u2014as one of the top 10 bass waters in the United States; and \u007fToday, more than 265 million Americans who rely on public water systems enjoy some of thesafest drinking water in the world. However, health and environmental problems remain. Unfortunately, many government policies that achieved successes over the past 25 years need to be updated. The National Academy of PublicAdministration and other experts who have reviewed the nation's environmental protection systemconclude that today's system is limited, uncoordinated, and inflexible. Because of the environmental challenges that lie ahead and the inefficiencies of the current system, government policies must evolve for progress to continue. The system must become as efficient and low cost as possible whileat the same time maintaining environmental progress. Preserving the gains we have made, it is timeto move to the next generation of environmental protection. The Administration is implementing policies that support the next generation of environmental protection. Approaches that will deliver significant additional health protection and greatly improve the environment reflect five major themes: stewardship, sound science, state and local control, innovation, and compliance. Ensuring continuous improvement toward effective implementationof these themes requires preparing for terrorist attacks, funding projects based on merit ratherthan earmarking, managing for performance, environmental federalism and ensuring that a strongscientific basis undergirds the regulatory process. Homeland Security EPA has adjusted well to its new role of supervising the decontamination of anthrax infected buildings. However, this experience has shown that better information and new technologies areneeded for this work. The President's Budget includes $75 million in new research funding to helpdevelop technologies to clean up buildings attacked by bioterrorists. In addition, the President'sBudget includes $20 million to continue assessing and addressing potential vulnerabilities of the nation's drinking water systems. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 305 Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from poorly performing programs to higher priority or more effective ones. The following table provides illustrative examples of the ratings for some of EPA's programs. This chapter also discusses how some of these programs may be improved. Program Assessment Explanation Acid Rain Program Effective By 2010, sulfur dioxide emissions from utilities will be reduced by approximately 50 percent of the 1980 baseline. EPA estimates directcosts to be around $2 billion annually, which, at around $200/ton, is among the best performing air quality programs at EPA. Thiscap-and-trade program enjoys almost 100 percent compliance. Nonpoint Source Grants to StatesUnknown Although nonpoint sources are the biggest remaining water pollutionproblem, states have not focused sufficiently on eliminating nonpoint source impairment of water quality. EnvironmentalEducation Ineffective This program has supported environmental advocacy rather thanenvironmental education. The budget transfers funding to the NationalScience Foundation's (NSF) math and science programs so that aconsolidated program can better serve educators and students. Common Sense Initiative (CSI)Ineffective The CSI was developed in 1994 to devise new approaches toenvironmental protection. This program struggled to produce results because of a lack of clear objectives and inflexibility. No legal authorityfor CSI exists, so litigation and risk of failure are high. PesticideReregistrations Ineffective EPA worked for almost 30 years to reregister old pesticides on themarket based on updated toxicity tests. Congress rewrote the statutetwice to speed the process. Fees begun in 1987 to finish the process by 1996 have been extended for seven years. The program has had limited success identifying and reducing exposure to highest riskpesticides. Congressional Earmarks The President's Budget generally provides funding for specific projects and programs based on an analysis of national interest, demonstrated needs, and statutory requirements. Unfortunately,Congressional earmarks ignore these determinations and divert funds from higher priority andmore effective programs. During the past two years, Congress has earmarked over six percentof EPA's discretionary funds. This budget meets the President's priorities and EPA's needs by eliminating earmarked projects and focusing EPA funding on activities needed to carry out its missions. Congressional earmarks include research projects targeted to specific institutions thatbypass the normal competitive process; projects that benefit a limited geographic area with no306 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY national significance; and infrastructure projects that bypass the State formula allocation and priority-setting process. Some Congressional earmarks have nothing to do with improving theenvironment, such as $250 thousand to the County of Maui to remove seaweed from the beach. Over $343 million in earmarks were made for drinking and wastewater projects alone.

National air quality,measured at thousands of monitoring stationsacross the country, has shown improvements for each of the six principal air pollutants, including carbon monoxide, lead, and nitrogendioxide. This means with each passing year,people breathe a little easier, see a little better,and the environment is a little cleaner. EPA sets air quality standards to protect the health of sensitive populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly inaccordance with the Clean Air Act. The agencytracks trends through its pollution standards index. As the chart shows, the percentage of daysacross the country that air quality violated a health standard has dropped from almost ten percentin 1988 to three percent in 2000. On those relatively few days of noncompliance, the standard generally was violated for only a few hours. Not only has the number of days of noncompliance declined, the air is less polluted on those days when standards are exceeded. EPA's primary method for controlling air pollution is regulation. In 2003, EPA is expected to spend almost $560 million on reducing emissions into our air. However, in terms of social costs, all ofus, mainly through increased prices, pay one hundred times that: approximately $50 billion to $60billion annually for clean air. The challenge is to continue to reduce emissions into the air at the same or even less cost.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 307 Markets Work for Environmental Protection The Administration believes that innovative and market-based approaches can achieve clean air cost-effectively. The Administration isworking on a legislative proposal for a flexible,market-based program to significantly reduce andcap emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,and mercury from electric power generators. The program would be phased in over a reasonable period of time, provide regulatory certainty, andoffer market-based incentives to help achieverequired reductions.Although the next generation of environmental protection relies on thecooperation inherent in the marketplace, market-based approaches are already demonstrating cost-effective air pollutioncontrol. EPA has pioneered the use ofeconomic incentives and market basedapproaches that allow pollution sources to buyand sell emission allowances. For example, the Acid Rain program was established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to controlpower plant emissions of sulfur dioxide andoxides of nitrogen, both of which contributeto acid rain. Each utility must have sufficientallowances to cover annual emissions. To cover the necessary allowances, the utility must either purchase allowances or reduce emission levels. Excess allowances can be banked forlater use. EPA conducts an annual auction for purchasing or selling allowances. One hallmarkof this program is its compliance rate, which is close to 100 percent. By one estimate, the savingassociated with this \"cap-and-trade\" program is 55 percent compared with costs for doing thisthrough traditional enforcement. Water Quality and Safe Drinking Water Like air quality, water quality has significantly improved since the Clean Water Act became law in 1972. The gains are so large, in fact, that storm water runoff from homes, streets, and fields (called\"nonpoint source pollution\"), now cause more water pollution than industrial sources. Nearly all the improvements in water quality can be attributed to legislation enacted since EPA's formation in 1970 and the significant federal, state, local, and private investments in theirimplementation. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA administers both regulatory and voluntaryprograms in conjunction with the States. For example, 44 states and EPA regulate the dischargeof point source pollutants from factories and wastewater treatment plants. Since 1988, the federalgovernment has provided over $19 billion in grants to the clean water state revolving funds (CWSRF), and these funds have made over $37 billion available for loans. Currently, approximately 99 percent of wastewater treatment plants provide secondary treatment or better, significantlyreducing pollutant loadings to the nation's waterways. EPA's goal is to increase by 100 (for a totalof 600) the number of the nation's 2,262 watersheds that will have more than 80 percent of theirassessed waters meet all water quality standards by 2003.308 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005050100150200250300350400450 7681869196Safer Drinking Water for America Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, EPA.

For 2003, EPA aims to have 92 percent of the population served bycommunity systems with water that meetsall health-based standards in effect by 1994.The hurdle has been raised from 83 percentin 1994. Actual reports of waterborne disease outbreaks, compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have beenvery low for some time except for an outbreakin 1993 and are expected to stay level with2001. Regulations have been put in placeto prevent outbreaks from microbes, such as cryptosporidium outbreak that occurred during 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is shown in the chart above. In total, the 2003 President's Budget for EPA would provide approximately $3 billion to support its performance goal of clean and safe water, including $2 billion to improve local wastewater anddrinking water infrastructure through the CWSRF and drinking water state revolving fund. Water quality is not free. Although the EPA will spend approximately $3 billion in 2003 on restoring, maintaining and protecting water quality, all of us pay for clean water through taxes, utility bills, and increased prices. These costs to society are estimated to be over $80 billion, oralmost 30 times EPA's water budget. Once again the challenge is to continue to improve waterquality at the same or less cost. The President's Budget provides $20 million for a new watershed initiative. Twenty pilot projects will be funded that will help stakeholders protect and restore their watersheds. EPA will work with other federal agencies, states, tribes, communities and others to select watersheds primarily based on community support and the likelihood of positive environmental outcomes. This collaborativeapproach can provide more efficient and effective solutions to water pollution. The results of thesepilot projects will be measured and will be made available to the public. The budget also funds severalpilot projects on water quality trading. Trading to achieve water pollution reductions in a watershedwill improve water quality at less cost. Widespread use of incentive programs will substantially speed progress toward cleaning up areas that do not currently meet water quality standards and help to achieve this goal in a cost-effective manner. Solid and Hazardous Waste EPA runs the $1.3 billion Superfund program that aims to clean up contaminated sites and remove substances that pose an immediate threat. Where groundwater is contaminated, wells are dug and the water treated. Where soil is toxic, it is removed and safely disposed. The goal is to make the siteuseful again. When EPA determines who is responsible for the contamination, it has the authorityto compel them to pay. But cleanups have often been delayed by litigation.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 309 410498585670757804844884 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 200302004006008001,0001,2001,4001,600Number of Hazardous Waste Sites Cleaned Up Number of construction completions Source: EPA.Current Total Number of Sites on NationalPriorities List = 1,479As the accompanying chart shows, 804 hazardous waste sites have been cleaned up.T h i si sp r o j e c t e dt or i s et o8 8 4b yt h ee n do f 2003, or 60 percent of the current number of Superfund sites.

Where once leaking barrels contaminated water supplies, there is now an open wildlifearea. The Army Creek Landfill of New Castle, Delaware before being cleaned up under the Superfund program. Now a wildlife area flourishes where the Army Creek Landfill used to be. After the Superfund program began, concern emerged about whether many abandoned industrial sites were contaminated and who was responsible for cleaning them up. Developers worried aboutliability and steered clear of these properties. To reinvigorate development of these fallow areas, states and local communities, as well as the federal government created the brownfields program. The program assesses sites for potential contamination to assure developers and where necessary,clean sites to make them suitable for new development. The President's brownfields program willremove obstacles to cleanup and reform cleanup mechanisms. This budget keeps the President'scommitment to clean up these sites by doubling current funding to $200 million, subject to theauthorizing legislation recently passed by the Congress. Toxic Chemicals EPA also works to reduce risks from toxic substances. EPA uses a wide range of tactics to accomplish this. Activities include making available important chemical and hazard data toworkers and to the general public; reviewing commercial and industrial chemicals; and registering pesticides to ensure adverse risks are not introduced to the public at large.310 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Pesticides can pose risks to humans through food consumption. Thus, EPA administers programs designed to reduce these concerns and promote a safe food supply. For example, EPA sets maximumlimits on the amount of pesticide residues on food and reviews limits set in the past to ensure that they meet current scientific standards. By the end of this year, EPA expects to reassess a cumulative 66 percent of these limits and, by the end of 2003, EPA expects to reassess a cumulative 70 percentof the total 9,721 that need to be reviewed by 2006. This includes 75 percent of the 893 that have thegreatest potential impact on dietary risks to children. Also, EPA registers new pesticides to help ensure that they do not pose significant risks. Through this program, EPA expedites the registration of safer pesticides to encourage the use of lower risk products. New pesticides are judged to be \"safer\" if they pose less risk to human health and the environment or have lower toxicity than current, conventional pesticides. Usage trends show thatthe percentage of agricultural acres treated with safer pesticides increased from 1.8 percent to 4.3percent between 1996 and 1998. Sound Science From air to water to toxic substances that persist in the environment, sound science plays a pivotal role in adequately managing the risks involved. Many of the Agency's priorities reflect this.For example, in 2003, EPA will begin new biotechnology research. This is expected to result in animproved capability to address three areas: the allergenicity risk from genetically modified foods,the ecological risks from genetically modified organisms, and the management of gene transfers and resistance issues. This research will help determine better metrics for meeting the goal of reducing risks to human health and the environment. Sound science will also be enhanced through improvedhuman capital planning that addresses workforce issues such as retirements and skill gaps. Analysisshows that 60 percent of the Agency's physical scientists and chemists in the Office of Research andDevelopment will be eligible to retire by 2005. This potential skill shortfall needs to be addressednow in order to ensure future scientific integrity of EPA programs; thus, EPA plans to complete a workforce restructuring plan by May 31, 2002 to support its mission goals and strategic plan. 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998020406080100Air Emissions Water Releases Offsite Incineration Offsite LandfillChronic Human Health Risk Index for Pollution and Managed Waste Risk index, 1988 = 100 Sources: EPA and Florida State University; reflects latest data available.100 83 686472 5053 54 323027Scientifically sound metrics must be used when evaluating the success of efforts toprotect human health and the environment. Measuring the impact of toxic chemicals on human health is a difficult undertaking, butEPA is developing indicators that measurethese relationships. The chart shows a roughindex of risk from chemicals by weightingreleases by toxicity and their fate in the environment. The Administration is fully committed to ensuring that the rules it issues are basedon sound science, public health and safety,and the needs of the economy, consistent withapplicable law.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 311 Improving Performance Environmental Federalism In many respects, EPA programs are models of federalism. Under most pollution control statutes, EPA conducts research and promulgates national standards for protecting human healthand the environment. EPA has generally delegated implementation of these statutes to the states,which take primary responsibility for monitoring pollution, permitting emissions, and enforcingthe permits. State enforcement of environmental laws has generally worked well, with states conducting 90 percent of enforcement actions. Currently, 49 states run air pollution programs and 48 run the core hazardous waste programs. EPA has delegated the management of waterpollution programs to 44 states. Thus, most facilities that discharge water pollution are regulatedby state governments. As an example of the excellent job states do in controlling such pollution,most facilities discharge amounts of water pollution that are well below their permitted limits. Forexample, in 1998, municipal and industrial sources actually discharged in total less than half of the amount of organic water pollution that they were allowed to discharge under the law. Furthermore, only a small amount of those discharges (three percent in 1998) exceeded legal permit levels (seeaccompanying chart on five-day biological oxygen demand). 1995 1996 1997 199802004006008001,0001,2001,4001,600 Actual pollutants discharged Discharges with full compliance Water Pollutants Are Discharged Well Below Permitted Limits Millions of kg/yr of five-day biological oxygen demand Source: OMB compilation of EPA permit compliance data; reflects latest data available.Permitted Limits Discharges over limitDespite this degree of delegation, EPA still maintains over 1,000 enforcement personnelto assist the states with their workload. T h eb u d g e tp r o p o s e st os t r e n g t h e nE P A ' s partnership with states by shifting moreenforcement responsibility and resources tostates through establishment of a new $15million state enforcement grant program.Such an approach properly recognizes that states have the primary responsibility to implement pollution control programs andthat increasing state resources would result inmore \"cops on the beat,\" more inspections, andmore enforcement, since state enforcementcosts are lower than federal costs. Recognizing that the needs of interstate commerce may require uniformity in many circumstances, EPA will work to ensure that patchwork regulatory activities by states under the federal program donot burden interstate commerce.312 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Better Regulation through Transparent Analysis In total, the benefits of EPA's pollution control efforts far exceed the costs. However, whenconsidered on a case-by-case basis, some actions are more effective than others. For example, overall benefits from air pollution control are due mainly to reductions in lead andparticulate matter and not other air pollutants. In1997, EPA developed new regulations for ozoneand particulate matter. EPA's data show that the new ozone standard results in a net cost (the costs exceed the benefits) to society rangingfrom $1.1 billion to $8.1 billion annually, whereasthe new particulate matter standards are likely toresult in significant net benefits.Improving the Regulatory Process The President's Budget reinvigorates the role of science at EPA by supporting funding ofa top-level policy office. The office will, amongother responsibilities, ensure that soundscience has been incorporated into decisions and that the analysis behind decisions is transparent to the public. Environmental protection, like any major undertaking, depends on performance. Thecost-effective delivery of this service demandssolid management, planning, and evaluation. Using common metrics across government, each agency, including EPA, has been ratedaccording to key resource managementinitiatives. These ratings are designedto ensure better performance and tighterlinkages between management and budget. Strengthening Management Central to improving government performance is aggressive implementation of the President's Management Reform Agenda. EPA's actions in each of the five initiatives will lead to improvementof EPA's programs. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014EPA does not have an up-to-date workforce strategy that supports mission goals and its strategic plan. Significant skill imbalances exist in critical occupations importantto electronic government and sound science initiatives. For example, all statisticians and 53percent of computer specialists in the Office of Environmental Information, and 60 percent ofthe physical scientists and chemists in the Office of Research and Development will be eligibleto retire by 2005. EPA plans to complete a restructuring plan by May 31, 2002.\u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014EPA has established an intra-agency-working group headed by the deputy CFO to implement the President's competitive sourcing initiative. EPA is in the process of finalizing its plan to meet the two-year 15 percent goal on its way to eventually compete 50percent of all commercial activities. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 313 Initiative 2001 Status Financial Management \u2014EPA is unable to provide an unqualified assurance statement as to systems of management accounting and administrative controls because of material weaknesses, including information security and NPDES permits. EPA is working to correct these material weaknesses. \u007f E-Government \u2014Most of EPA's capital asset planning for information technology (IT) acquisition is well done and on average, major IT projects operate near cost, schedule, andperformance targets. EPA plans to make regulatory information including proposed rulesand comments on them more readily available on-line to the public through a consolidateddocket. The agency aims to improve capital planning and investment control; integrate its enterprise architecture and budget process; implement a broad based network for efficient electronic sharing of environmental information; develop an agency-wide security action plan;and promote E-Government through central data exchange. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014EPA has integrated presentation of resources with performance goals. The agency budget sets forth goals and output targets. Its budgetaccounts were reorganized by the Congress to allow more flexibility in resource management. The agency is working on continuing improvement in linking results and resources. As part of this effort, EPA is expected to include social costs in each of its goals when revising itsstrategic plan. The agency is studying reducing the number of strategic goals; deliveringflexibility in program missions; and establishing a budgetary accounting system for managerialaccountability. \u007f314 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Environmental Protection Agency (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Operating program ................................................................... 3,940 funds (CWSRF) 1,212 Drinking water state ................... 823 850 850 Brownfields cleanup funding1................................................ \u2014\u2014 1 2 1 Targeted water infrastructure funding .................................... 465 459 123 Requested ............................................................................

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) then responds with disaster supportwhile coordinating the assistance of up to 27other agencies and volunteer organizations.FEMA helps the nation prepare for andreduce the impact of natural and technological hazards, such as Y2K-rel ated critical computer failures. FEMA also responds to the aftermath of terrorism, such as thedestruction wrought by the incidents of September 11 th. FEMA helps people protect themselves, their homes, and their communities from hazards that can lead to emergencies or disasters. FEMA also manages a number of important national security activities to ensure that the government is ready to meet its responsibilities in all situations. 315316 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the government to identify strong and weak performers. Often, as in the case of FEMA, the budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs\u2014or programs with unknown performance\u2014to higher priority or more effective programs. Program Assessment Explanation Terrorism-related ProgramsEffective Well established working relationships with first responders, includingfirefighters, police, and emergency medical technicians, foster well-targeted assistance. Disaster Responseand Relief Programs Effective Effectively responds to meet the needs of victims and communities afterdisasters; better performance measures are needed. Flood InsuranceProgram Moderately EffectiveProcesses flood damage claims quickly; however, many at-risk homes and businesses are not insured. Disaster Mitigation Ineffective Formula funding and lack of rigorous cost-benefit criteria for fundedprojects limit program's effectiveness; better performance measures are needed. Flood Map Program Ineffective Inadequate funding hinders program; maps are needed to assist rebuilding after disasters and to steer future development away fromfloodplains. Enhance State and Local Terrorism Preparedness The President recognized the need to increase our nation's preparedness for terrorist attacks even before the events of September 11, 2001. On May 8, 2001, he directed FEMA to establish an Office of National Preparedness (ONP). The President wants FEMA to work closely with state and localgovernments to ensure their planning, training, and equipment needs are addressed, and with otheragencies to ensure that the response to weapons of mass destruction threats is well-organized. Asdemonstrated during the response to September 11 thwhen more than 300 police and firefighters lost their lives, first responders bear a unique burden. All Americans are grateful for their service and FEMA will continue to work in support of their efforts. THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 317 Urban Search and Rescue Team uses canine at the World Trade Center site.The budget provides FEMA $3.6 billion to address these new priorities, an increaseof $3.2 billion over 2002. Most of this funding will be used for terrorism-related equipment for states and localities, as wellas training grants for first responders,including firefighters, police, and emergencymedical technicians. While state and localjurisdictions will have discretion to tailor the assistance to meet local needs, it is anticipated that more than one-third of the funds willbe used to improve communications. It isfurther assumed that an additional one-thirdwill be used to equip state and local firstresponders and that the remainder will be used for training, planning, technical assistance and administration. More than11,000 emergency response personnel couldbe equipped and trained in 2003. The fundingalso would allow FEMA to provide grants tostates to train 400,000 citizen volunteers for Community Emergency Response Teams, which provide assistance and support to first responders following terrorism incidents and other emergencies. The First Responder state/local preparednessgrant program would consolidate several existing programs, including a first responder grantpreviously funded within the Department of Justice (funded at $635 million in 2002). As part of theconsolidation, FEMA will take over the functions of Justice's Office of Domestic Preparedness. TheFirst Responder program also would encompass the recently created FEMA Fire Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) grant program (funded at $360 million in 2002). Today, numerous departments and agencies have programs to deal with the consequences of a potential use of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon in the United States. Many of these programs offer training, planning, and assistance to state and local governments. But to maximize their effectiveness, these efforts need to be seamlessly integrated, harmonious, and comprehensive. President George W. Bush May 8, 2001The budget also provides $50 million for FEMA's Office of National Preparedness to work with states and localities on terrorismpreparedness, as well as to administer thefirst responder grant program. In November2001, FEMA completed work with eachof the states and territories to develop plans for terrorism preparedness training and equipment for chemical and biologicalthreats in 2002. These plans are beingused to help allocate first responder grantassistance provided in the 2002 EmergencySupplemental Appropriations Act.318 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Improve Assistance for Credible and Cost-Effective Disaster Prevention Strategies ... [M]itigation works. The Seattle-Tacoma area did not suffer significant losses [following the February 28, 2001, earthquake] because 20 to 30 years ago local leaders invested in its future by passing building codes and issuing municipal bonds that implemented solid protective measures. FEMA Director Allbaugh Congressional testimony, May 16, 2001Much of the devastation caused by disasters can be minimizedthrough well-designed mitigationprograms. For example, properties in flood-prone areas can be elevated or moved. Homes and businessescan be braced for better protectionagainst earthquakes. And, stormshutters and other features can beadded to buildings to reduce wind damage. Having a significant, dedicated stream of funds for these programs is critical to FEMA's efforts to protect individuals and communities from future disasters. Flooding stands out as the single most pervasive disaster hazard facing the nation. It causes an estimated $6 billion in property damage annually. FEMA spends approximately 57 percent of itsdisaster relief resources alleviating flood damage. Yet much of this after-the-fact spending can beavoided with some up-front planning. In the past, many of the nation's efforts to avert flood disasters have focused on structural changes to waterways\u2014for example, building dams and levies. Focusing flood reduction efforts on identifyingthe areas at risk for flooding and steering development away from those areas can be a less costlylong-term approach to mitigation. Modernizing the nation's flood maps is critical to that effort. Many of the nation's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are out of date and inaccurate\u201463 percent of maps are more than 10 years old. A third of maps are more than 15 years old. About 2,700 communities are not mapped at all. New and updated FIRMs can provide crucial guidance for future building, development, and flood mitigationefforts\u2014determining how and where individuals, private developers, and local governments build.In 2003, FEMA will invest $350 million to modernize flood maps. FEMA also will digitize its mapsand make them available over the Internet. Effectiveness of Mitigation Programs From 1993 to 2000, 45 percent of projects funded from FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program were either minimally cost effective or not cost effective at all. FEMA data provided to the Congress in 2000FEMA also will dedicate $300 million to a new competitive grantfor predisaster mitigation. This new program will replace the formula-based Hazard Mitigation Grant Programcurrently funded through the DisasterRelief Fund. The new program willoperate independently of the disasterrelief programs, assuring that funding remains stable from year to year and is not subject to spikes in disaster activity. Awarding grants on a competitive basis will ensure that the most worthwhile, cost-beneficial projects receive funding.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 319 Disaster Relief 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001012345Disaster Relief Fund Outlays in billions of dollars Northridge, CA Earthquake Hurricane FranTropical Storm AllisonHurricane FloydWhen major disasters strike, FEMA provides disaster assistance to meet emergency needs of families and individuals, and to help pay for the rebuilding and repairof critical community infrastructure. In 2001,FEMA responded to 50 major disasters and15 emergencies, as well as funding continuingneeds from previous disasters. Major disasters in 2001 included the September 11 thattacks, Tropical Storm Allison, and the Seattle-Tacoma earthquake. The Administration has set a goal of meeting the needs of disaster victims forshelter, food, and water within 12 hours after the President declares a major disaster. FEMA has automated its core disaster information processing systems to improve its response timefor disasters. The budget provides for a program level of $2.9 billion for FEMA disaster relief\u2014a level consistent with the five-year average of obligations. To fund the program, the budget provides $1.8 billion in newbudget authority and commits to an intensive review of unspent balances beginning with the 1994 California Northridge earthquake that is expected to result in $1.1 billion in grant recoveries over a two-year period. Unspent balances often result from mitigation and other projects that appeared to beneeded in the aftermath of a disaster but were not pursued after public review or further examination. The five-year average is a reasonable benchmark for the resources FEMA will need to respond to disasters. It is not always possible, however, to anticipate extraordinary events such as the incidentsof September 11 th. Proposed Reforms \u007fPhase out taxpayer subsidies of sec ond homes and vacation properties. \u007fRequire that mortgage borrowers insure the full replacement value of their properties. \u007fEnd state taxation of flood insurance policies. \u007fInclude the cost of expected coastal erosion losses in premiums for policies issued in coastal areas. Reforms for the National Flood Insurance Program The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) faces major financial challenges. In some years, the program has expenses greater than its revenue from insurance premiums, preventingit from building long-term reserves to handle the costs of flood insurance claims. A large portionof policyholders\u201429 percent\u2014pay only a portion of the cost of their premiums, with the Treasury320 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY subsidizing the rest. By law, FEMA is prohibited from charging full premiums for properties built before adoption of NFIP building standards by local communities. A small number of these olderproperties are poorly situated and are repeatedly flooded, accounting for a significant share of the program's losses. In contrast, FEMA charges true actuarial rates for newer properties and requires that new construction comply with floodplain management guidelines. The budget proposes several reforms to improve financial performance and transfer greater financial liability to individuals building in flood prone areas, as shown in the accompanying box. In 2001, FEMA paid out $1.5 billion to settle flood insurance claims. The Administration seeks to aid the recovery of individuals, businesses, and communities after floods by increasing the number of flood insurance policies in force. FEMA will increase the number of policies in force by five percent in 2003\u2014to 5.1 million policies. Transfer the Emergency Food and Shelter Program The Emergency Food and Shelter Program was created in 1983 to help meet the needs of hungry and homeless people throughout the United States by providing funds for emergency food and shelter. Funds are used to support homeless shelters and other organizations that provide assistance for those who are homeless, facing eviction, or in need of food assistance. FEMA has notdemonstrated the effectiveness of this program and has no expertise in managing programs for thehomeless. The budget proposes to transfer this program to the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment\u2014permitting better coordination of services for the homeless. Strengthening Management Charged with managing the response to major disasters, as well as coordinating consequence management for terrorism events, FEMA effectively coordinates direct assistance\u2014principally cashgrants\u2014as well as the relief activities of other agencies and volunteer organizations. Generally,FEMA performs well in getting resources to stricken communities and disaster victims quickly. Theagency performs less well in its oversight role to ensure the effective use of such assistance. Further, the agency suffers from an inability to clearly measure program performance, or to link resources to performance information. FEMA has begun to address the President's Management Agenda, buthas a poor starting point in all key areas.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 321 Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014FEMA lacks a strategy for linking human capital to fiscal resources and agency goals. FEMA needs to develop a workforce-restructuring plan that addresses how the agency will attract and retain personnel wi th the skills to perform core agency functions including program oversight and analysis. FEMA needs to address managing a fluctuatingcadre of temporary staff that performs front-line disaster assistance functions. FEMA alsoshould develop a strategy for redirecting supervisory positions to citizen service delivery.FEMA must produce an interim workforce restructuring report by mid-2002 that will address many of these issues. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014FEMA has not produced a plan for meeting the Administration's short- and long-term competitive-sourcing goals. FEMA must develop a new competitive sourcingand management plan, then complete public-private competitions or direct conversions on 15percent of the jobs on its list of positions that are commercial in nature by the end of 2003. \u007f Financial Management \u2014Despite the fact that FEMA has received audit opinions for three years that the financial statements as a whole are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the agency has had repeated material weaknesses in its financial management system, which does not comply with standards. FEMA's financial managementsystem is unable to generate timely and reliable financial statements. In addition, FEMA needsto improve its disaster cost projections, oversight of state administration of public assistanceand mitigation grants, and monitoring of unspent funds. FEMA will develop an implementationplan for system improvements and develop improved disaster cost projections by mid-2002. \u007f E-Government \u2014Although FEMA has documented processes for outlining its systems and capital planning investment needs, FEMA has not provided adequate justificationor documentation of its information technology (IT) projects to OMB and the Congress.Traditionally, little oversight has been given to FEMA's IT spending, and FEMA reallocatedfunds from its various accounts to pay for projects. This led to ineffective and costly IT projects,such as the agency's core information tracking system, NEMIS, or National Emergency Management Information System, which cost $67 m illion. The system has a history of crashing during disaster response operations and cann ot be easily adapted to program design changes. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014FEMA lags other agencies in integrating budget and performance information. FEMA needs to develop performance measures that better capturethe relative effectiveness of its programs. The agency should link program activities to strategicgoals, and clearly articulate output and outcome goals for use in subsequent budgets. \u007f322 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Federal Emergency Management Agency (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Salaries and Expenses ........................................................... 224 245 249 Disaster Relief Fund ................................................................ 1,597 2,113 1,821 Emergency Management Planning and 431 3,750 Pre-disaster Mitigation Grant Program ................................. \u2014\u2014 3 0 0 Emergency Food and Shelter: Existing Law ......................................................................... 140 140 153 Legislative Proposal (Transfer to HUD) ............................ \u2014\u2014 153 Flood Map Modernization Fund ............................................. 18 32 300 All other programs .................................................................... 97 109 143 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1................. 2,448 3,070 6,563 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 13 Total, Discretionary budget authority ......................................... 2,435 3,058 6,550 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: ........................................................... \u20142 5\u2014 Disaster Relief Fund ................................................................ 2,000 4,357 \u2014 Emergency Management Planning and Assistance ........... \u20142 2 0 \u2014 Total, Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ...... 2,000 4,602 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: National Flood Insurance Program: Existing Law ......................................................................... 172 296 317 Legislative Proposals .......................................................... \u2014\u2014 43 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 172 296 360 Credit activity: Direct Loan Disbursements: Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Programs .......................... 31 25 25 Total, Direct loan disbursements ................................................ 31 25 25 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration Sean O'Keefe, Administrator www.nasa.gov 202-358-0000 Number of Employees : 19,005 Federal and 140,000 Contractor 2002 Spending : $14.5 billion Field Offices : Nine federal centers and one federally funded research and development center.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pushes the frontiersof discovery in space and aeronautics. It supports science, technology, and exploration in four areas: 1) Space Science to betterunderstand the origin and evolution ofthe universe; 2) Earth Science to bettercomprehend environmental forces includingthe Earth's climate; 3) Biological and Physical Research that studies living and physical systems in the environment of space; and 4)Aeronautics Technology to improve aviationsafety, reduce air traffic congestion, andenable breakthrough aircraft design. NASA's work in science, technology, and exploration would not be possible without its pursuit of supporting capabilities such as space launch vehicles (e.g., the Space Shuttle) and orbiting platforms (e.g., the Space Station). Supportingcapabilities currently consume about two-thirds of NASA's $15 billion budget. 323324 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds where appropriate from lesser performing programs to higher priority or more effective programs. Particularly, when low performing programs are in priority areas, deficiencies will be addressed through reforms to improve performance. Thefollowing table presents the ratings of selected programs for illustrative purposes. Some of theseprograms will be improved by proposals described in this chapter. Program Assessment Explanation Discovery and Explorer ProgramsEffective Space science missions competitively selected from researcherproposals. Successful cost/risk management and science results. Mars ExplorationProgram Moderately EffectiveRobotic exploration of Mars. Completed major restructuring in wake of spacecraft failures. Recovery f rom failures successful so far.

Although ideally no NASA enterprise would demonstrateany cost growth, a goal of not exceeding 10percent cost growth across all developmentprograms within an enterprise would berealistic. NASA's Space Science and Earth Science enterprises nearly meet this goal. Through management reforms and cost-savinginitiatives, NASA will increase the proportionof its budget that goes directly towardsscience, technology, and exploration activitiesas described in the following section. Science, Technology, and Exploration 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20020100200300400500600 020406080100120140NASA Earmarks Have Risen Dramatically Total cost in millions of dollarsNumber of congressional earmarks Source: NASA.In making investments in the nation's future, NASA must set priorities and establishan integrated portfolio of research and technology investments. One foundation of ensuring quality science is the competitiveselection of merit-reviewed research. In mostareas NASA does this well. Its three scienceenterprises will competitively award in excessof 80 percent of their research in 2002\u2014with Space Science at 99 percent. The integrity of NASA's merit-based research is seriouslyeroded by the practice of congressionallydirected spending known as earmarks. NASAhas suffered from a surge in both the numberand cost of earmarks. Earmarks Disrupt NASA's Science Activities Many earmarks in NASA's budget have little to do with the agency's mission in scientific research, technology development, and exploration. For example, the Congress earmarked NASA's current budget to fund corporate jets, college dormitories, libraries, and museums. Some especially damaging earmarks divert fundsfrom critical NASA needs and reverse good cost management decisions at NASA. For example, after costshad doubled, NASA cancelled its Pluto-Kuiper Belt mission last year, but the Congress earmarked funds toput the mission back in NASA's bu dget. However, the Congress only provided $30 m illion, while over $400 million more is needed to finish the mission. C ongress also redirected $40 million from the Space Station 2002 budget to an unaffordable space test vehicle at a time when NASA is trying to get Station costs under control. Finally, the Congress earmarked funds for a low priority propulsion lab by cutting the very researchthe lab it is meant to support.326 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION While the Congress adds partial funding to pay for some earmarks, funding often must be diverted from higher priority activities. Unfortunately, the number and cost of earmarks have increased morethan fivefold in recent years (see accompanying chart). This detracts from the important science, technology, and exploration activities described below. Space Science NASA is the sole federal agency that conducts planetary exploration, and is a major contributor to studying the universe beyond our solar system. NASA develops and operates a wide array of space probes and telescopes to answer fundamental questions about the evolution and structure of the universe, galaxies, and stars including: how our own star\u2014the sun\u2014affects our planet; the originsand development of planets and life; and the existence and distribution of life beyond Earth. Overall Performance. NASA now routinely launches multiple missions in place of the once-a-decade, multi-billion dollar missions that previously dominated Space Science research.NASA currently has over 30 Space Science missions in operation, over 20 missions under development, over 40 missions under study, and participates in many other international missions. For Space Science missions under development, total cost overruns average 11 percent, and 60percent of missions are within 10 percent of their planned development schedule. Images of gullies on Mars taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission indicatethat large amounts of liquid water may be erupting from the surface today. This image shows an area of nearly seven square miles.In recent years, research sponsored by NASA and the National Science Foundation identified approximately 80new planets outside our solar system, and last year the Hubble Space Telescope obtained the first chemical data on the atmosphere of one of these planets. Future NASA spacetelescopes will search for smaller planets, with the intentof eventually finding and characterizing planets similarto Earth. NASA planetary probes have also found thatwater, a key ingredient in the development of life: existed on Mars in the distant past; may still be present under the surface of Mars (see accompanying image); and may existas underground oceans on one or more moons of Jupiter.Future planetary missions will attempt to confirm thesewater-bearing environments and search for evidence of life. Despite these successes, NASA's largest and most technically challenging Space Science missions still suffer from poor cost and schedule estimates. The Outer Planetsprogram, whose goal was to uncover clues about the origins ofand potential for life on Jupiter's moons and beyond, cannotbe implemented as planned because some mission cost andschedule estimates have nearly doubled. For example, NASA proposed to cancel the Pluto-Kuiper Belt mission because of its skyrocketing costs. The Outer Planets program is also seriously hindered by the long timeneeded to travel to key targets in the outer solar system and by a lack of adequate power sources. Improving Performance. T h eA d m i n i s t r a t i o np r o p o s e st oi m p r o v eS p a c eS c i e n c eb y : \u007fImproving Planetary Exploration . Given continued growth in cost and schedule estimates, the President's 2003 Budget redirects funding to a reformulated New Frontiers program driven byTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 327 four key principles: clear science prioritization; frequent and affordable missions; competitive innovation; and advanced technology. The budget redirects funds to this program by cancelingNASA's existing Outer Planets Program. The revamped program will set science priorities that support key goals for understanding the origins and existence of life beyond Earth. These priorities will be flexible enough to allow NASA to maintain regular and affordable missions.NASA will also select missions through open competitions instead of assigning developmentto a NASA field center. NASA's highly successful Discovery program will serve as the modelfor this competitive selection process. \u007fGreatly Expanding the Science Capability of Future Missions . The budget proposes investments in safe and reliable nuclear-electric propulsion and nuclear power technologiesthat will enable much faster and more frequent planetary investigations with greaterscience capabilities. In this decade, nuclear power technology will enable NASA to land a rover on Mars to conduct experiments over several years, instead of several months, thereby expanding scientific returns many fold. With nuclear-electric propulsion, affordableplanetary missions: could reach targets in half the time it would take now; would not belimited by the power and mass constraints of today's spacecraft; and could conduct long-termobservations of multiple planets or moons. W h yS t u d yt h eS t a r s ? Astrophysical research sponsored by NASA and other federal research agencies tells a lot about where we come from, whether we're alone in the universe, how the fundamental laws of the universe work, and how events beyond Earth may influence our future. NASA's Chandra X-ray Telescope mission, launched in 1999, can observe neutron stars, black holes, and quasars, allowing physicists to see how the physical laws of the universe operate under conditions thatcannot be replicated on Earth. Another recently launched mission will create a baseline for observing howfuture changes in the Sun's energy output work as a major driver of change in the Earth's climate. Other space telescopes to be launched later this decade will be capable of detecting Earth-like planets that may harbor life around other stars, and seeing how the earliest stars and galaxies formed in our universe. Earth Science NASA's Earth Science program seeks better scientific understanding of Earth's environmental system, thus enabling improved prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards. Overall performance. In the past three years, Earth Science has successfully launched 11 missions. Current missions under development have cost overruns averaging 12 percent and mostare experiencing launch delays, as only 15 percent of missions are within 10 percent of their planned development schedule. Earth Science funds and performs the scientific inquiries to explain satellite observations and improve climate predictions. For example, NASA's Earth observing satellites and research: providedadvance warning of the last El Nino; aided control of major forest fires in the Western statesby providing near-real time data to the U.S. Forest Service; improved NOAA's marine weather328 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION forecasting; and collected the first high resolution data on global land cover and topography for both basic research and applications such as agriculture and civil engineering. NASA has improvedclimate-modeling speed tenfold since 2000, matching the best capabilities in Europe, and expects another fourfold improvement by the end of 2002. Such improvements permit Earth scientists to dramatically improve climate projections. Nonetheless, significant challenges confront NASA's Earth Science enterprise. Several of its Earth Observing System missions now in development are facing costly delays in completion. Also,NASA must demonstrate the ability to transfer responsibility for data collection from researchsatellites at NASA to the operational satellites at the agencies that use them. NASA will be undertaking two such demonstrations\u2014the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project and the Jason follow-on\u2014which will measure key variablesthat are needed to provide long-term, quality data to understand how the Earth's climate ischanging. Improving Performance. The Administration proposes to improve Earth Science by: Why the Increasing Uncertainty About Global Change? Although increased knowledge usually reduces uncertainties, sometimes the opposite can be true. Take the question of global climate change.Since 1990, many billions of dollars has beendevoted to research on climate change, yetpredictions regarding the range of possiblechanges in temperature due to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations has become broader, rather than narrower. This is not a failure of theresearch community. Scientists have gained agreat deal of knowledge over the past decade. Abig part of that new knowledge has been that theEarth's atmosphere is much more complex and unpredictable than originally thought.\u007fFocusing Science . The President's Budget proposes a multi-agencyClimate Change Research Initiative (CCRI), which will focus on providing useful information and understandableclimate products in the near term (twoto five years). In 2003, NASA willparticipate in CCRI but will not initiatedevelopment of new follow-on satellite missions until a government-wide review of the interagency UnitedStates Global Change ResearchProgram determines the best means forachieving CCRI goals. \u007fM o r eS c i e n c ea tL e s sC o s t . NASA has traditionally owned and operated thesatellites it needs to provide scientificdata. However, with the development of commercial satellites that sell Earth images to customers, NASA willnow purchase data from commercial sources to sustain the 30-year set of images of theEarth's surface, rather than building and flying an eighth Landsat satellite. NASA willshare its remote sensing capabilities with other federal agencies, as well as state and localgovernments seeking to achieve their own objectives. Biological and Physical Research NASA uses space to accelerate scientific progress and to understand and control the health risks to humans in space. Space provides a unique environment to focus on the fundamental biologicalprocesses that are masked by the presence of gravity here on Earth.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 329 1998 1999 2000 2001 200205001,0001,5002,000 Station Research Shuttle ResearchSpace Station Significantly Increasing Crew-Hours for Research Annual crew-hours Source: NASA.No Research MissionsOverall Performance. The Space Station is the primary means to conducthigh-quality biological and physical research for the foreseeable future. The accompanying chart illustrates how the Space Station hassignificantly expanded the number of hoursthat astronauts spend conducting researchin orbit. Forty-seven distinct experimentshave already begun on the Space Station. One discovery revealed growth patterns in microscopic crystals that could lead toimproved manufacturing for pharmaceuticalsand other materials. However, NASA's sciencestrategy does not adequately prioritize amongthe many disciplines interested in the Space Station and their multiple objectives, thus impeding significant progress. Moreover, the development of research equipment for the SpaceStation has suffered from multiple design changes, repeated delays, and insufficient oversight. Poorcost controls have been the result. Improving Performance. The Administration proposes to improve Biological and Physical Research by: \u007fEstablishing and Pursuing Science Priorities. This year, NASA will be working with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to engage the scientific community andestablish clear high-priority, affordable science objectives with near-term focus on improvingscientific productivity. The results of this review will help set the science agenda for Biologicaland Physical Research that will in turn drive how the Space Station is used. It should increasethe efficiency and output of research at the Station, and realign NASA's research portfolio to reflect current priorities. \u007fDiversifying Research Platforms. While the Space Station will be the focus of biological and physical research, alternative space platforms are needed to fill gaps in research the Station cannot do. Examples include conducting radiation experiments on probes beyond the Van Allen belts\u2014where the near-Earth environment no longer provides shielding from solar andgalactic cosmic radiation. This budget provides increased funding for the Space Radiation andSpace Biology Generations programs to launch multigenerational research both in low-Earthorbit and beyond the Van Allen belts, that could uncover the effects of those environments onevolutionary processes. Aeronautics Technology NASA develops aeronautics technologies to address long-term issues in the nation's air system. NASA works with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to advance technologies that canimprove aircraft safety, alleviate airport congestion, and reduce air and noise pollution from aircraft. Overall Performance. NASA assesses its progress in aeronautics research by measuring the potential impact of new technology developments on the aviation system. For example, NASA330 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION investments in engine technology have the potential by 2005 to reduce the pollution from jet engines to half of what they were in 1999. Although NASA's aeronautics programs generally demonstrate good progress, there is no way to ensure that NASA is developing technology that will actually be incorporated into the national air system. NASA also conducts the majority of its aeronautics research itself, rather than opening upcompetition that could take advantage of skills and innovation in the private sector and academia. Improving Performance. The Administration proposes to improve Aeronautics Technology by: \u007fImproving the Likelihood Technology Gets Used. To ensure that NASA technology investments are incorporated into the national air system, NASA will strengthen its ties with the FAA. Also, OMB and OSTP will be working with major research agencies to develop new criteria for evaluating applied research, like NASA's aeronautics research, in preparation for the 2004Budget. \u007fExpanding Quality Reviews and Competitive Opportunities. NASA will have the National Academy of Sciences undertake reviews of its aeronautics technology program (as wellas space transportation and fundamental technology) every three years. These reviewswill provide independent quality assessments of NASA's technology research and programplanning, whether the research can be performed by universities or corporations outsideNASA, and how well NASA's technology research integrates with customer needs. NASA will also seek to reduce institutional costs at its field centers so more funds can be invested in technology research through openly competed NASA research announcements and throughuniversity and industry partnerships. Supporting Capabilities Only About a Third of the NASA Budget Is for Science & Technology Science & Technology $6 Billion Supporting Capabilities $9 BillionNASA has had many technical successes, but is hampered by the high cost of access to space\u2014nearly a third of its budget\u2014andstruggles to achieve a management capabilitythat matches its technical capability. Therehas been significant cost growth in severalareas, and a lack of competition to help spark innovation. Needed reforms are beginning to improve NASA's ability to manage itslong-term, complex and challenging programswithin cost and schedule plans. NASAwill build a new foundation to prepare itscapabilities for the future, while reducing the cost of supporting capabilities\u2014now nearly two-thirds of the agency budget. Space Launch NASA provides transportation to and from space for humans and cargo using the Space Shuttle, and uses commercial expendable rockets for the launch of many science spacecraft.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 331 1991 1996 2001 200605,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,000 0100200300400500600700Space Shuttle Reliability Improved while Staffing Levels Decreased Staffing level Expected launches before failure Source: NASA.Potential Range with CompetitiveSourcing Main Engine Health Monitoring Auxiliary Power UnitCockpit Avionics Phase I050100150200250 Source: NASA.Cost Overruns of Shuttle Safety Upgrades Percent cost overrun from 2001 to 2003 CancelledCancelled NASA Goal: 10%Overall Performance. The Space Shuttle is the only U.S. vehicle that can launchhumans into space and return experimentsfrom orbit. Since the Challenger tragedy,NASA has been improving the safety of theSpace Shuttle, from an estimated risk of catastrophic failure during launch for each mission of one in 78 in 1986 to one in 556 now.This improvement took place even as staffingfor the Space Shuttle has dropped significantly(see chart on Space Shuttle reliability). NASAcontinues to invest in improving Shuttle safety, but some of the planned investments are experiencing significant problems (seechart on cost overruns). For example, theelectric auxiliary power unit was the highestpriority safety upgrade last year, but delays,technical difficulties, decreasing safety benefits, and a tripling of its projected cost led NASA, with the support of its advisorycommittee, to cancel the project. While the safety and schedule record of Shuttle operations has been very good, andcosts have come down considerably in the last decade, the Shuttle remains a very expensive vehicle to operate. Moreover, in the lastfew years, Shuttle costs have been risingconsiderably, due to personnel costs, aginginfrastructure, growing vehicle obsolescence,and a shrinking industrial base. A comparison of the cost to orbit for the Shuttle relative to other space launch systems is provided inthe accompanying chart, which underscoresthe need to quickly develop a new system forspace launch. Improving Performance. T h eA d m i n i s t r a t i o np r o p o s e st oi m p r o v es p a c el a u n c hb y : \u007fImproving Shuttle Safety. This budget continues to invest in safety improvements for the Space Shuttle and increases investment in repairing aging Shuttle infrastructure. Plannedsafety upgrades will enhance safety during launch by 12 percent, to a one in 620 risk ofcatastrophic failure. Delays in the planned implementation of these upgrades continue to bea concern, so funding will be set aside specifically to accelerate the availability of plannedupgrades. \u007fPursuing Shuttle Competitive Sourcing . Competitive sourcing will enable the full transfer of Shuttle operations and possibly some portion of infrastructure ownership to a private entity,based on criteria in the accompanying box. The benefits of pursuing competitive sourcing are:332 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 1) greater flexibility to recruit and retain the skilled personnel necessary to safely operate the Shuttle; 2) avoiding potential continued cost growth for Shuttle operations by moving toa private organization that has greater flexibility to make business decisions that increase efficiency; and 3) significant culture change in Human Space Flight at NASA by making it a purchaser of services rather than an operator of infrastructure. Adapting such an approachwill let NASA focus on advancing the state of science, technology, and exploration. NASA willrelease competitive sourcing plans this year that will address important issues such as howto effectively transfer critical skills from the federal workforce to a private entity. Shuttle Competitive Sourcing Criteria 1)Safety . Maintain safety over operating life for at least the next 10 years. Provide for appropriate government role to ensure essential safety features. 2)Competitive Sourcing . Transfer appropriate NASA personnel, assets, and facilities needed for Space Shuttle operations to a private entity. Enable NASA to focus on advancing the state of science, technology,and exploration. 3) Competition . Ensure a competitive environment to satisfy government space launch requirements and maintain a robust U.S. space launch industry. 4)Cost . Establish a baseline and conduct cost compa risons based on the full cost (operations, maintenance, upgrades, infrastructure, personnel) of the Shuttle program, not to exceed the President's2003 five-year budget for the Shuttle. 5) Business Base . Enable pursuit of other government and commercial business opportunities consistent with principles of a level playing field and international trade policy. Business risks from dependence on outside business will be borne by a private entity, not the government. 6)Future Plans . Ensure consistency of Shuttle launch c ommitments, upgrades and infrastructure investments with future decisions on development of new launch systems. 02468101214Goal to Reduce Launch Costs Space Launch InitiativeU.S. Commercial RocketsSpace ShuttleDollars in thousands per pound of cargo to orbit Actual Goal Sources: NASA and Federal Aviation Administration.\u007fControlling Shuttle Cost Growth .A s recommended by the International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation task force, reducing SpaceShuttle flights to four per year appearssufficient to meet Station needs.However, NASA will be reviewing thisdecision to determine whether any additional flights are necessary. Other adjustments are being pursued as well,such as the size of the astronaut corpsand the period of time between Shuttleoverhauls.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 333 Reduced Launch Costs Create Opportunities SLINASA BudgetLaunch Costs Reduced Current SituationFuture if Space Launch Initiative (SLI) is SuccessfulNew Opportunities\u007fPursuing Space Launch Initiative. Another major investment in spacetransportation is the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) which could pave the way for replacing the Space Shuttleearly in the next decade with much saferand less costly vehicles. Investmentsin SLI will reduce the huge burden onNASA's budget from the high cost of access to space. Reducing the nearly $5 billion annually that NASA spends onaccess to space will free up billions forfuture opportunities (see accompanyingchart). To minimize costs across NASA'sprograms, NASA will coordinate and potentially integrate emergency crew return capabilities for the Space Station with SLI vehicle design efforts. To most efficiently use government resources, NASA will also increasecoordination with the Department of Defense on launch technologies, and improve cost andrisk management capabilities. Space Station Research on the Space Station has already made important discoveries that could improvemanufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals andother materials on Earth.NASA is building the International Space Station to create a laboratory for scientific research in theunique environment of space. Overall Performance. With the second phase of Space Station construction now complete, a fully functioning orbital research laboratory circles the Earth every 90 minutes. Astronaut crews aboard theStation have been exceeding expectations by devotingan increasing amount of time to science activities. In spite of these technical successes, the Space Station has not succeeded at staying within planned costs. Last year, NASA determined that it needed a 50 percent funding increase to its remaining $8.3billion budget to finish the planned Space Station.The request marked the latest chapter in a historyof cost growth. To keep the Station within plannedbudgets, the Administration scaled it down to a core Station. The Space Station's Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) task force called on the spaceagency to undertake management changes to achievet h ec o r eS t a t i o n ' sg o a l s .334 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Improving Performance. The budget adopts many of the key recommendations of the IMCE task force, including: \u007fImproving Science Efficiency . NASA is exploring how to increase the amount of time available for research, to achieve the maximum scientific benefit from the investment in the Space Station. One option involves creating a non-governmental organization (NGO) as soonas possible to more efficiently manage research aboard the Space Station. NASA createda similar organization in 1981 to support the Hubble Space Telescope, and the availabilityfor research time rose by a factor of two. NASA is exploring many other options to increasescience efficiency such as easing the maintenance burden on the orbiting crew and increasing automation of research facilities. \u007fDemonstrating Needed Reforms within Two Y ears . NASA must demonstrate over the next two years that it has made the necessary management reforms and changes in the human space flight program to get the Space Station costs under control. For example, NASA must give the Station program more authority over contractors and civil servants working on the SpaceStation. Less than half the Space Station's contractors and only a sixth of the civil servantsworking on it report directly to the program. The Administration is developing criteria tojudge NASA's success. If NASA is successful, the Administration will address the resourcerequirements to expand the capability of the Station, based on research priorities. If NASA is not successful, U.S. assembly of the Space Station will end with the completion of the core Station, expected sometime in 2004. Field Centers NASA relies on nine field centers and one federally funded R&D center for implementation and day-to-day management of its programs. 1994 2000 20060100200300400500600700800 Outside Research In-House Research and SupportNASA Ames Research Center Spending More on Outside Research In millions of dollars Source: NASA.88 526135 514355 352Overall Performance. Although all NASA field centers have room forimprovement, performance varies widely.Lean field centers unburdened by institutionalneeds are more agile and thus more capable of pursuing future directions in science, technology, and exploration. Theaccompanying chart shows that NASA's AmesResearch Center in California has begun toreduce institutional and in-house activities toexpand opportunities for competitive, external research. Such dedication to institutional reform ensures that research per federal dollaris maximized. Improving Performance. To improve program and institutional management, NASA will take the following actions this year: \u007fStrategic Resources Review . NASA will begin outsourcing and consolidation efforts to improve the ability of its field centers to respond to future challenges in science, technology, and exploration. One pathfinder effort would transfer a portion of NASA's Ames Research Centeractivities to a University-Affiliated Research Center organization, in order to greatly improveTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 335 the flexibility of its workforce and facilities and ensure access to world-class researchers. Other pathfinder efforts may include consolidating some NASA facilities with militaryinstallations. \u007fImproving Cost Management . Huge cost growth on the Space Station has highlighted the need for improved cost estimating capability in Human Space Flight, but this capability needs tobe strengthened across the agency. NASA will implement a plan of action to: 1) generate independent cost estimates, particularly in Human Space Flight, and improve the capability of program offices to credibly estimate costs; 2) strengthen and use the capabilities of the chieffinancial officer and system management offices at all NASA centers; 3) strengthen NASAheadquarters capabilities for cost assessment and tracking program execution; and 4) increaseNASA's use of outside experts to conduct rigorous independent cost and risk estimates of majorprograms. Strengthening Management Apart from the specific performance improvements discussed above, the Administration seeks to improve the management of NASA in a number of areas that will benefit all activities. Five specificproblem areas slated for improvement are part of the government-wide President's ManagementAgenda. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014NASA is pursuing management reforms that will alter its workforce. NASA needs to continue to attract and retain employees with critical skills whiledepending on outside organizations for most others. Two obstacles complicateresolution. NASA has skill shortages in some key areas and excesses in others.NASA also has limited capab ility for pers onnel tracking and planning. To address these challenges, NASA will develop and implement an overall human capital strategic plan complete with needed reforms. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014NASA has identified 4,333 of its 19,005 positions as engaging in commercial activities, but has yet to develop a plan to achieve the competition goalsfor its commercial positions (15 percent by 2003 and 50 percent long-term). NASA alsoneeds to significantly increase the portion of its functions classified as commercial,and to exempt fewer of them from cost comparisons. NASA will incorporate the three major outsourcing efforts for Space Shuttle competitive sourcing, Space Station non-government organization, and Strategic Resources Review initiatives in its nextanalysis. NASA will present an integrated competitive sourcing plan in 2002 toachieve the 50 percent long term goal including, for each year, specific targets, costs,schedules and explanations of competitive sourcing mechanisms.\u007f Financial Management \u2014NASA financial management systems allow the agency to track resources, but the agency lacks systems to support day-to-day operations and track task completion. Implementation of NASA's Integrated Fi nancial Management System (IFMS) in 2004 will provide support in the future and implement full costmanagement with NASA's 2004 Budget. NASA will proceed with IFMS implementationand seek to accelerate it where justified. \u007f336 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014NASA has failed to adequately justify its information technology (IT) investments. NASA will continue to improve its Enterprise Architecture, and the Chief Information Officer will ensure that the IT p lanning process is integrated into agency decision-making processes. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014NASA has had difficulty in identifying appropriate annual R&D measures for multi-year programs. NASA will prepare multi-yearprogram-level performance measures for all programs for its next performance plan.These performance measures will originate with the program and project managers. \u007f National Aeronautics and Space Administration (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Human Space 227 144 Inspector General ................................................ 24 25 26 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1............................................................. 14,357 14,904 15,117 Remove contingent adjustments .................. 104 111 117 Total, Discretionary budget authority .................... 14,253 14,793 15,000 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources .............................................................. \u2014 108 \u2014 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

National Science Foundation Dr. Rita Colwell, Director www.nsf.gov 703-292-5111 Headquarters : Arlington, VA Number of Employees :1 , 2 0 4 2002 spending : $4.6 billionThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is responsible for advancing science andengineering in the United States. NSF carries out its mission primarily by making merit-based grants to individual researchersand groups at more than 2,000 U.S. colleges,universities and other institutions. AlthoughNSF represents about four percent of the totalfederal budget for research and development, it accounts for approximately one-fourth of all federal support for basic research at academicinstitutions. NSF evaluates research and education proposals using two criteria: the scientific merit of the proposed activity and theprospective impact on society. NSF categorizes its programs to align with its three strategic goals:1) Ideas (research); 2) People (education); and 3) Tools (facilities and instrumentation). Ideas To foster discoveries in science and engineering, NSF primarily invests in researchers and educators at colleges and universities. The majority of grant recipients' work is in basic research(Ideas), which can yield important scientific discoveries that may lead to many applications. These 337338 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION applications have driven economic growth and have enhanced the quality of life through advances such as better weather forecasting, earlier detection of cancerous tumors, and the creation of theInternet. Although private industry has expanded its support for basic research over the past several years, its research focuses mostly on the short-term in order to bring new products to market. Federalinvestments in basic research provide a long-term foundation for breakthrough applications in areasnot usually supported by private industry. NSF-supported scientists are using a video camera on the back of a horseshoe crab to decipher the neural code for vision.Overall Performance. NSF is the leading performer among federal agencies funding basic research. For example, of the nearly 10,000 awards NSF makes annually, 94percent of the research awards are madethrough competition, based on merit review.A competitive merit review process ensuresthat high-quality research is funded. The accompanying table displays the percent of research competed at selected federal agencies. NSF's competitive approach pays rich dividends. Its grants often lay the earlyfoundation for future breakthroughs. Forexample, of the 11 Nobel Prize winners in the sciences in 2001, eight received NSF funding for the research that won them the award. AgencyPercent of Research Competed in 2001 National Science Foundation ...................................... 94 Department of Health and Human Services ............. 83 National Aeronautics and Space Administration ...... 75 Department of Commerce ........................................... 42 Department of Energy .................................................. 24 To further ensure high quality in its programs, external panels assess approximately one-third of NSF's programs each year, so that all programs are reviewed in a three-year period. During the past two years, these panels have judged the majority of the programs assessed to be of high quality and efficiently managed. NSF's reputation for running an efficient and effective competitive merit-reviewprocess has enabled it to provide leadership to other agencies, such as the Environmental ProtectionAgency and the Department of Education, in improving their research programs.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 339 Creation of the Internet and the World Wide Web Computers and information networks have significantly changed the way we live and howpeople interact with each other. NSF has been pivotal at many steps along the way. The NSF-supported NSFNET (1986-1995) has beentransformed into today's Internet. Its backing ofcomputer science research led to the creation ofa graphic browser (MOSAIC) which precipitatedt h ec r e a t i o no ft h eW o r l dW i d eW e b .One of NSF's many strengths is its flexibility to redirect resources to emergingscience and engineering opportunities.Unlike other agencies that own and operatenumerous laboratories, NSF owns facilitiesrelated to only a few programs, such as the U.S. Antarctic Program. NSF is largely free from ongoing institutional obligations. Inaddition, NSF awards do not last indefinitely.The average NSF grant is typically for threeyears. This minimizes research stagnation orfunding research that ceases to be important or cutting-edge. NSF also maintains programmatic flexibility by funding overone-half of new grants entirely in one year, rather than through installments. Instead of carrying financial commitments into future years,NSF can quickly redirect resources to new areas of emerging opportunity. Small Streams Contribute Far More Than Previously Thought to Cleaning Waterways Excess nitrogen can cause ecologically damaging effects in large waterways. Small streams remove nitrogen from water faster thando their larger counterparts. This finding is basedon data collected from streams in NSF's ArcticTundra Long-Term Ecological Research site inAlaska. According to the research, the smaller the stream, the more quickly nitrogen can be removed. Taking greater care to ensure smallstreams can work effectively to clean the waterwill reduce the overall nitrogen load that makesits way into larger bodies of water. The findingcould have important implications for land-use policies in watersheds from the Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast to Puget Sound in the West.All these features contrast starkly with the increasing amount of federal research dollarsdirected by congressional earmarks to projectswithout due regard to competition or merit. The Administration's overall aim is to position NSF to invest in priority researchareas, such as information technology andnanotechnology, which connect discoveryto learning, innovation, and benefit tosociety. Nanotechnology, which involves controlling the building of small and large structures atom by atom, holds promise forthe development of technologies that couldrange from higher-performance materials tobiomedical instruments as small as humancells. Priorities like these tend to arise from NSF's core research efforts-disciplinary andmultidisciplinary programs that support ideasgenerated by the academic community. NSFallocates approximately 25 percent of its research budget in priority areas that will deliver scientificbreakthroughs, and 75 percent in core programs to build the capacity needed for the emergence of new technologies. Improving Performance. The President's Budget proposes to improve the quality and efficiency of federal funding of basic research at NSF by: \u007fEmphasizing research in highly promising, multidisciplinary areas . I na d d i t i o nt o nanotechnology, the 2003 Budget provides significant NSF funding for fundamental research340 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION related to bioterrorism, information technology, mathematics, and climate change. Each of these areas has the potential for significant breakthroughs. \u007fImproving the quality of a number of science and engineering programs by transferring them toNSF . Based on NSF's noted expertise and success in funding competitive research, the budget transfers the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Sea Grantprogram and the U.S. Geological Survey's toxic substances hydrology research program to NSF to conduct merit-based competition and improve program effectiveness. The Sea Grant program will be administered in partnership with NOAA to ensure that the agency's researchand outreach objectives are reflected in the program's ongoing work. The Administration mayalso transfer non-competitive funding from the Smithsonian Institution's astrophysics andenvironment programs to NSF, following a program review by an independent panel. \u007fImproving efficiency of research by increasing grant size . One means of improving research efficiency is by providing adequately-funded grants to ensure the proposed work can beaccomplished as planned. Inadequately funded grants can result in an inefficient researchprocess, with an award only funding a portion of a research project. A researcher then has to write additional proposals to get funding to complete the project and realize research objectives. The 2003 Budget increases the average annual NSF award size to $120,000,an increase of approximately $30,000 since 1998. NSF believes reaching this award sizewill result in approximately 200 fewer awards (a two percent reduction), from 2002. NSFalso believes that the increased size will help ensure that its grants are more effective inachieving research project objectives. People NSF-supported graduate fellows are helping teach math and science concepts to students in kindergarten through twelfth grades.NSF invests in People\u2014students, researchers, and educators\u2014to strengthenmath, science, environmental, and engineeringeducation, thus equipping the American workforce for the challenges of the 21 st Century. Overall Performance . Longtime concern persists over the state of grades K-12 scienceand mathematics education in the UnitedStates. The Third International Math and Science Study compared American and other countries' students in math and science andfound that U.S. fourth graders did relativelywell in both subjects. But by the time theyreached their senior year in high school,U.S. students ranked among the worst in the world. In 2000, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed no improvementin U.S. student performance in science andlimited improvement in mathematics since1996.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 341 NetherlandsCanada FranceGermany RussiaItaly United StatesSouth Africa300400500600Math and Science Literacy in Final Year of Secondary School Source: Third International Math and Science Study, 1996.Achievement score Average Score - All CountriesAchievement in mathematics and science is most directly dependent on state andlocal educational systems. NSF's role is in supporting new models of math and science education. In the past decade, NSF hassupported new models that, if successful,could be adopted by state and local districts,which have the resources to implement thosemodels. Initial indications are that some of these NSF-supported models are proving successful in improving student achievement.F o re x a m p l e ,o v e rt h ef i r s ts i xy e a r so ft h eN S F - f u n d e dC h i c a g oU r b a nS y s t e m i cInitiative, the percentage of fourth gradestudents meeting Illinois state standards in science increased from 46 to 66. For the NSF-funded San Antonio Urban Systemic Initiative, the average scores of African-Americans in grade 4 on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skillsincreased by 32 percent over four years, and those of Hispanic students by 39 percentage points,compared to a 16 percentage point increase for Texas fourth-graders overall. In the area of graduate education there is concern that fewer U.S. students are enrolling in U.S. graduate science and engineering programs. Since 1993, enrollment of U.S. students in graduate level science and engineering programs dropped by nine percent. During the same period, enrollment of foreign students on temporary visas increased by three percent. If fewer scientists and engineersare entering the workforce, U.S. high technology firms may have to increasingly rely on foreign hightechnology workers who are in the U.S. on temporary non-immigrant worker visas. A recent survey of the Department of Education found that 57 percent of surveyed U.S. baccalaureate recipients did not apply to science and engineering graduate programs for financial reasons. Using their bachelor in science or engineering degree to get a job that may pay more than twice the level of a graduate student stipend (salary) is often more enticing to a person carryingdebt from undergraduate school. One strategy of enabling U.S. students to go on to graduate schoolis to provide competitive stipends to ease the financial burden. NSF performance in the 1990s inproviding competitive stipends was not good. From 1993 to 1999, NSF stipend levels dropped asa percentage of starting salaries for bachelor students in the sciences and engineering from 65 percent to 52 percent and the difference may be growing wider. Higher Scores in West Virginia Students in West Virginia are considered \"proficient\" if they score above the 50thpercentile on the SAT-9. At the outset of the NSF-funded Appalachian Rural Systemic Initiative education project in 1996, schoolsparticipating in the project were scoring below the state average in both mathem atics and science. By 2000, those same schools show a marked improvement in the number of students scoring in the upper percentiles.Most importantly, students in participating schools have not only \"closed the gap\" but all participating schools have surpassed the state average in mathematics.342 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION Improving Performance . The President's Budget proposes to strengthen math and science education in the United States by: \u007fImproving the quality of math and science education in Grades K-12 through the President's Math and Science Partnerships Initiative. Support for the President's Math and Science Partnerships initiative is increased in the 2003 Budget. The Partnerships Initiative buildson the fact that while states and local governments deliver education, NSF has a provenrecord in supporting successful models to enhance math and science curriculum and studenttest scores as a result. The Initiative provides funds for states and local school districts tojoin with institutions of higher learning, particularly with their departments of mathematics, science, and engineering, to beef up math and science education. \u007fAttracting the most promising U.S. students into graduate level science and engineering by providing more competitive stipends. The 2003 Budget increases the annual stipends for NSF's fellowship and traineeship programs from $21,500 to $25,000 to further attract U.S. students to graduate level programs in science and engineering. NSF also will conduct a study ongraduate stipends in 2002 to recommend what the ultimate target for graduate stipends shouldbe as well as develop measures to assess its impact on the larger national effort to increaseand improve graduate students in science and engineering. \u007fImproving quality of environmental education programs. Based on NSF's noted expertise and success in funding competitive programs, the budget transfers the Environmental ProtectionAgency's environmental education program to NSF to improve program effectiveness andmerit-based selection. Tools The Gemini North Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii provides some of the sharpest imagesof any telescope on Earth.NSF invests in widely accessible, state-of-the-art science and engineering Tools\u2014sophisticated instruments,equipment, facilities, databases, and large surveys. NSF'sfunding of facilities has grown and diversified and now includes shared-use research facilities that are often connected by high-speed networks. Except for U.S. Antarctic Program facilities, NSF does not directly operate the large-facilities that it supports, suchas the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii or the TerascaleSupercomputer in Pittsburgh. NSF primarily makes awards to universities and non-profit organizations to construct, manage, and operate large projects. Overall Performance. Research agencies must strive to keep the development and upgrade of researchfacilities on schedule and within budget. In running thefacilities, agencies should keep the operating time lost due to unscheduled downtime to a minimum. NSF does relatively well in meeting these goals. In 2000, all 11 constructionprojects that NSF supports were within 10 percent oftheir estimated annual cost, and seven of the 11 projectswere within 10 percent of meeting their annual scheduleTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 343 milestones. Also in 2000, 22 of 26 operating facilities kept time lost due to unscheduled downtime to less than 10 percent of the total scheduled operating time. For major capital projects completedsince 1996, cost growth on five science projects was eight percent (or $36 million), generally less than the average cost increase for major projects at most science agencies. Although NSF has done relatively well in managing construction of its large facilities, project complexity, cost, and risk are increasing. Future projects will challenge traditional NSF approaches.To address this concern, the Administration directed NSF to develop a plan to enhance itsmanagement of large facility projects. In response, NSF is now implementing a Large FacilitiesProjects Management and Oversight Plan that improves the process for reviewing and approving large projects and increases oversight of its projects. All current and future large projects will be subject to these new guidelines and oversight. Improving performance. The President's Budget proposes to improve NSF investments in Tools by: The Really Sharp and The Really Fast The Gemini Telescope Project is an international partnership that will result in two 8.1-metertelescopes (each telescope has a main mirror over 26 feet across.) One telescope, partly funded by NSF , is located on Hawaii's MaunaKea, and the other on Chile's Cerro Pach\u00f3n.Each of the Gemini telescopes is designed toprovide some of the sharpest images of anytelescope on (or even above) our planet. In many instances, the Gemini telescopes will outperform even the Hubble Space Telescope in clarity. Bothtelescopes will be fully operational in 2002. With the capability to perform up to six tr illion calculations every second, the NSF-fundedTerascale Computing System in Pittsburgh will be the world's most powerful computer doing public research. In tests in 2001, the machineestablished itself as the second-most powerful inthe world. The Terascale computer will be usedfor large-scale research modeling in areas thatinclude the life sciences, weather forecasting and climate change.\u007fEnhancing infrastructure capabilities in astronomy, earthquake research,and the environment. The budget proposes initiating construction of the international Atacama Large Millimeter Array telescope in Chileand the Earthscope projects across theUnited States. The Atacama LargeMillimeter Array will be the world'smost sensitive, highest resolution, millimeter-wavelength telescope. This telescope will serve as a testingplatform for theories of star birth andstellar evolution, galaxy formationand evolution, and the evolution ofthe universe itself. Earthscope will provide several instruments, some portable, to investigate the structureand evolution of the North Americancontinent and the physical processescontrolling earthquake and volcaniceruptions. This will provide significant data to assess and mitigate national risks associated with earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, and landslides. The2003 Budget also provides funding totest at least two sites of the NationalEcological Observatory Network, which will provide an integrated network of regional environmental research observatories. \u007fImproving priority setting and the visibility of the selection process for large facility projects. For the first time, the 2003 Budget identifies funding for early-stage planning and development of potential new, large facility projects. This will increase the visibility of NSF's344 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION facility selection process. The Office of Science and Technology Policy also will request that the National Academy of Sciences review the scientific merit of IceCube and other proposedU.S. neutrino collectors in the context of current and planned neutrino research capabilities throughout the world. Neutrinos are one of the fundamental particles that make up the universe and are also one of the least understood. Understanding neutrinos better will meangreater understanding of the universe. Research Network Brings Wireless Internet to Native American Reservations In August 2000, the University of California, San Diego received a $2.3 mi llion NSF award to develop a prototype wide-area network for research and education. The High Performance Research and Education Network is overcoming geographical, social and technical barriers to bring high-speedInternet access to the La Jolla and Pala Native American reservations. In remote San Diego County, the network connects the low-lying San Diego coastl ine with the county's mountainous eastern region, home of the reservations. This network also links the University with the Mount Laguna Observatory, anearthquake-detection site. The network is a prototyp e that could be useful for geophysicists, astronomers and ecologists, while demonstrating that the same tools can connect under-served educational users atremote locations like the Pala and La Jolla reservations. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs to higherpriority or more effective ones. Program Assessment Explanation Information Technology ResearchEffective Began focusing on long-term, high-risk information technology research in 2000. Priority goals and objectives identified. Five-year funding plan established. Program will be evaluated in 2002. Nanotechnology Effective In 2001, began emphasizing long-term fundamental research aimed atdiscovering novel phenomena, processes, and tools at the nanoscale(10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair). Prioritygoals and objectives identified. Five-year funding plan established.Program will be evaluated in 2003. Core Research Effective Individual research divisions have research strategies; however,overall core research strategy is not well communicated by NSF .External evaluations of programs have generally produced positivereviews while occasionally identifying areas for improvement.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 345 Program Assessment Explanation Education and Human ResourcesModerately EffectiveAn overall strategy for NSF's education programs is not well articulated. External evaluations of programs have generally given positive reviews while occasionally identifying areas for improvement. Major Research Equipment andFacility ConstructionModerately EffectiveAppropriations account established in 1995 to fund development of major research facilities. New process being implementedto determine priorities among new facility projects. New facilitymanagement guidelines are being developed. Strengthening Management NSF is a relatively well-run agency. Funding for the agency has grown significantly in the past decade, while the agency's staffing level has remained flat. The agency has accommodated theincrease in funding and responsibilities through the use of information technology and continued reliance on outsourcing support of NSF's review process to the academic community. Nevertheless, there are major hurdles on the horizon. Of the total federal funds NSF receives, 95 percent go to researchers and educators; the agency's overhead is only five percent. Many in Congress and the NSF Inspector General have questionedwhether the agency has enough resources to adequately manage its growing portfolio and conductadequate oversight of its awards. The 2003 Budget addresses these concerns by providing a significant funding increase to expand award oversight by providing for more travel to review large award recipients, providing additional personnel through temporary and permanent appointments,and enhancing information technology (IT) systems to improve worker productivity and efficiencyof the award process. NSF has been better managed and has a better baseline evaluation than most other agencies. For example, NSF is the only agency to receive the top rating for financial management. NSF is also a federal government leader for e-government and information technology. The growing demands on NSF, however, will require it to further improve its management. In particular, NSF needs to improveresults of its human capital management, competitive sourcing, and integration of performance andthe budget efforts. A scorecard of NSF's activities for the President's management initiatives follows.The agency is performing well, but there are areas of concern.346 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014NSF's human capital strategy is not in tegrated into its budget and strategic plans and the agency does not implement succession plans. NSF does use staffing flexib ilities well, such as those provided in the Intergovernmental Personnel Act. NSF is moving expeditiously to develop a Training Academy and to conduct an Organizational AssessmentSurvey. The agency also will initiate a significant workforce analysis in 2002. The Foundationis developing a five-year administration and management strategic plan to lay out how it plansto address its workforce issues in the coming years. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014NSF has not yet launched a viable competitive sourcing initiative. In its 2000 analysis of workforce activities, NSF identified 533 positions as performing commercial functions. NSF has not decided if it will compete any positions at this time. The agency wants to wait until it gets results from its upcoming workforce analysis before it makes a decision oncompeting positions. At that rate it will be difficult for the agency to meet 2003 competitiongoals. NSF must develop and submit a competitive sourcing plan to meet near-term goals. \u007f Financial Management \u2014NSF is the federal leader in financial management and has met all core criteria for a green rating for financial management. NSF's financial management systems meet federal financial management system requirements and it has received unqualified and timely audit opinions on its annual financial sta tements. NSF expects to maintain this position. \u007f E-Government \u2014NSF meets most, but not all, of the standard core criteria for expanding E-Government. All major information technology projects provided sufficient business cases. However, NSF's Government Information Security Reform Act report reflects deficienciesin a number of important areas of security. These concerns include failure to implementappropriate security controls to protect critical information and risk of disruption of essential services. NSF has submitted its corrective action plans and will be reallocating 2002 funds to quickly correct identified problems. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014NSF's budget does not tie resources to results, provides limited focus on outcomes, and does not charge the full budgetary cost to individual activities.There are inherent difficulties in integrating the budget with performance given the long-termnature of research, in which results may not occur until 10 years or more. Nonetheless, NSF could do more. In Spring 2002, OMB and OSTP will work with major research agencies to develop criteria for evaluating basic research during the formulation of the 2004 Budget. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 347 National Science Foundation (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Research and Related Activities ............................................ 3,357 3,598 3,783 Education and Human Resources ......................................... 785 875 908 Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction ........ 122 139 126 Salaries and Expenses ........................................................... 167 176 210 Inspector General ..................................................................... 678 Subtotal, Discretionary authority adjusted1................. 4,437 4,795 5,035 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 6 budget authority ......................................... 4,431 4,789 5,028 Mandatory Outlays: H-1B Fee Programs ................................................................. 11 100 97 All other programs .................................................................... 28 45 49 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 39 145 146 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Small Business Administration Hecto V. Barreto, Administrator 202-205-6605 Number 2002 Spending: $1.1 billion Field Offices: 93 nationwideThe Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small businesses and help families and businesses recover fromphysical disasters. Critical to this missionare SBA's efforts to foster a business-friendlyenvironment, help clients to succeed, andserve as the federal disaster bank. Providing Access to Capital Through a variety of financing programs, SBA guarantees general small business loans, equipment loans, and microloans, as well as venture capital equity investments. These programs offer a wide spectrum of assistance, from an average of $12,000 for microloans to a maximum of $1.5million for general business loans. Guaranteed equity investments can be as high as $20 million. To address the lending needs of small businesses affected by the September 11 thattacks, the Congress passed and the President signed legislation that temporarily lowers fees for SBA lending progra ms and transfers more risk to the government. While the fee reductions may help a small number of businesses cope, it also means that SBA's lending programs will be more expensive. Given the additional cost, the Administration intends to target the available resources 349350 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION to credit-worthy small businesses most likely to be underserved by the commercial capital markets including start-ups and those seeking loans of less than $150,000. These types of firms need theextra assistance because they generally entail more risk for lenders and their smaller loans are more administratively burdensome. Without SBA support, the private sector may not make these loans because they do not produce the same profit margins as larger loans. AH a n dU pN o taH a n dO u t [T]he government can never guarantee success in the private sector. That's not what happens in a system based upon free enterprise. And so the best thing we can do is help you to get your business started. President George W. Bush December 3, 2001Historically, SBA's lending programs served less than one-tenth of one percent of the nation's small businesses annually andprovided less than one percent of annualsmall business lending. The Administrationwill work with the Congress and the lendingand small business communities to explore new approaches to ensure that a greater number of the nation's small businesseshave adequate access to capital, such asCapital Access Programs (CAPs). Under aCAP program, the bank and the borrowerpay an up-front insurance premium typically between three and seven percent of the loan amount into a reserve account, which is matched by state governments. CAPs or other innovative state programs that place greater emphasis on marketsolutions may point the way toward modernizing SBA's lending programs. Disaster Assistance In the wake of physical disasters, SBA's disaster loans are the primary form of federal assistance for individuals and businesses. SBA's disaster loans help homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations finance rebuilding and recovery efforts from physical damage.Working closely with other federal disaster assistance agencies, particularly the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, SBA establishes temporary field offices in disaster areas where it helps thepublic apply for low-interest construction and economic assistance loans. In 2001, SBA responded toabout 70 disasters and approved $986 million in loans. In 2002, the Administration sought and the Congress provided nearly $1.4 billion in lending, including almost $600 million to support businesses adversely impacted by the September 11th attacks. For 2003, the budget requests funding to supportSBA's activity level consistent with its five-year average. SBA Provides Front-Line Disaster Relief \"They were the most efficient, most humane organization I've ever dealt with ,\" says Marvin Rafeld, owner of a small business in lower Manhat- tan. The SBA approved his loan request for nearly$125,000 less than 24 hours after he applied. \"I was shocked by how quick it was. \"I m p r o v eD i s a s t e rR e s p o n s e . SBA's Disaster Loan Program plans tosignificantly improve response capabilitiesin 2003 by installing a paperless loanapplication processing system. The new system will allow SBA to process loan applications electronically, thereby reducingturnaround time as well as personneland administrative costs. SBA's goal isto increase its productivity by at least 25percent. The new system will also enableTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 351 SBA to review electronic files anywhere regardless of where a disaster occurs, and to share data more easily with other SBA programs and other disaster relief agencies. Technical Assistance SBA's technical assistance programs annually provide direct assistance to more than 1.3 million small businesses through grants that support more than 1,000 Small Business Development Centers(SBDCs). SBA and its resource partners provide training and counseling to small businesses ontopics ranging from developing business plans to managing cashflows. SBA has 389 Service Corpsof Retired Executives (SCORE) chapters, as well as grants provided for microloan lenders to provide business assistance. Across the United States, small business owners struggle to understand the overwhelming number of governmentregulations.Measuring the performance of these programs has been difficult because manyfactors beyond SBA assistance affect smallbusiness sustainability and growth. Inaddition, the SBDCs have been reluctant to provide information to SBA. In fact, Congress passed legislation prohibiting SBA fromcollecting client-level information. SBA haspledged to work more aggressively with itstechnical assistance grant recipients to collectinformation on business longevity, increased taxable business activity, and the number of start-up firms attributable to technicalassistance services. This data is necessary tomonitor the impact of SBA resources and holdprogram managers accountable for results. In addition, duplication and overlap in these technical assistance programs can lead to confusion and diminish service delivery. The budget includes $161 million for these programs and saves taxpayers $31 million by eliminating orreducing poorly performing or redundant programs such as the One-Stop-Capital Shop programand the Program for Reinvestment in Microentrepreneurs (PRIME). Federal Procurement The federal government annually purchases about $200 billion in goods and services and in 2003, the Administration expects to award about $44 billion in contracts to small businesses. TheAdministration is committed to achieving the government-wide small business procurement goal of23 percent. In 2001, while the federal government met its small disadvantaged business procurement goals, it fell short elsewhere, having problems meeting statutory goals where participation of eligible small businesses remains low. For example, Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) business goals were not met. Though it is not clear how many eligible small businessesexist, a recent study by the General Accounting Office cited poorly designed eligibility criteria and352 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION burdensome and costly application processes as major barriers to small business participation in the HUBZone program. SBA is working to correct these problems through regulatory changes. Small Is Beautiful Complying with regulations is a major burden for small businesses and a principal impediment to their success. Laid end to end, federal regulations measure 16 feet long\u2014and this does not include state and local laws. Apartfrom being particularly costly for firms with fewer than 20 employees, regulations are just too hard for the typicalsmall business to find. Under the present arrangement, each of the nation's 25 mi llion small businesses must coordinate with dozens of agencies to order licenses, select locations, negotiate leases, pay taxes, even hireemployees. No wonder many small business owners do not even know where to start. To address this problem, SBA has launched BusinessLaw.gov , an Internet-site that provides one-stop access to more than 30 types of regulatory information, 20,000 links to state and local laws, along with interactive help tofind additional solutions. As part of the Administration's E-Government initiative, SBA will continue to offer smallbusinesses more on-line options to make complying with regulations easier. Status Report on Select Programs The Administration is reviewing programs throughout the federal government to identify strong and weak performers. The budget seeks to redirect funds from lesser performing programs to higher priority or more effective ones. Program Assessment Explanation Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)Effective The SBIC venture capital program serves small businesses whose needs are usually below $5 million. Disaster Loan Program (direct loans)Effective The disaster program responds quickly to disasters and processes loanapplications in a timely manner. 7(a) General BusinessLoan Program Moderately EffectiveDeclining defaults have improved performance but lender oversight needs to be improved. Small BusinessDevelopment Centers (SBDCs)Unknown SBA should develop measures to determine if the SBDCs effectively use the $88 million they receive in annual federal funding.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 353 Program Assessment Explanation Section 8(a) Program Ineffective A recent Inspector General report noted that a small number of the same businesses receive most 8(a) contracts and award dollarsyear after year. Both business participants and agency procurementofficials are concerned about the administrative burden imposed by theprogram. One-Stop-CapitalShops Ineffective Duplicates other SBA technical assistance programs. Strengthening Management SBA is making progress on the President's Management Agenda. For example, it is one of only four agencies whose financial systems met the Federal Financial Management Improvement Actrequirements. However, the Loan Monitoring System (LMS), SBA's largest information technology(IT) investment, which has significant impact on SBA's ability to manage its $50 billion loan portfolio, is behind schedule, over budget and not performing to expectations. To advance the Administration's management goals, SBA is administering a successful asset sales program. The program is improving the collection of outstanding debts and moving loan servicingfunctions to the private sector. In fact, SBA has sold more than 110,000 loans totaling over $4 billion,collecting more from its sales to private sector investors than if it held and serviced the loans tomaturity. Some 135,000 loans worth $4.5 billion will be sold over the next few years. However, even more improvements can be made. For example, the asset sales program has significantly reduced SBA's loan servicing workload yet SBA has not reduced staff for such activities. This year, the Administration will implement a fundamental reorganization of the SBA's field office operations. Back office operations (servicing, liquidations, loan processing, etc.) will becentralized or contracted out. District offices will focus on reaching a much larger percentage ofthe small business community and improving oversight and marketing to lending institutions. Specific strategies will be tested through District Office pilot projects in three offices during 2002 with implementation for 20 Districts in 2003. The pilots include using telecommuters, videoteleconferencing, and restructuring the relationship with SBA's technical assistance grant recipientsto increase accountability.354 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014The agency has not articulated a clear vision of what role it should fulfill in the marketplace. In addition, the benefits of asset sales and technological improvementshave not been translated into human resource efficiencies. While SBA recognizes the need torestructure, little progress has been made to date. SBA expects to better articulate goals in a2002 restructuring plan.\u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014SBA's analysis of its workforce indicates that 66 percent of SBA's activities are commercial in nature. However, SBA has not developed a competitive-sourcingplan, something it will do in 2002. This effort will be closely coordinated with SBA's humanresource restructuring. \u007f Financial Management \u2014SBA has received an unqualified and timely audit opinion five years in a row, and its financial management system is compliant with relevant federal law. Inaddition, SBA is improving the accuracy of cost estimates for its general business loan programand will continue its successful asset sales program. In contrast to these successes, the Loan Monitoring System (LMS) technology project is over budget, behind schedule, and not performing as expected. SBA's inability to implement LMS adversely affects its risk management and oversight of its $50 billion loan portfolio. SBA is refining the LMS project and developingspecific implementation milestones. \u007f E-Government \u2014SBA has a documented enterprise architecture and capital planning investment process, which help inform busin ess decisions and the allocation of the agency's $50 million tec hnology budget. SBA will lead the government-wide efforts in creating a one-stop regulatory compliance tool for businesses. However, SBA's difficulties continue in developingcost, schedule, and performance goals for ot her E-gov projects and corresponding security plans, such as the LMS. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014SBA submitted an integrated budget and performance plan, which attempted to tie resources to output targets. However, SBA has been unsuccessful atovercoming barriers to the collection of meaningful performance measures in some programs,such as the SBDC program. SBA has pledged to work more aggressively with its technicalassistance grant recipients to collect informa tion on performance measures such as business longevity, increased taxable business activity, and the number of start-up firms attributable to technical assistance services. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 355 Small Business Administration (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Business Loans ........................................................................ 298 208 223 Disaster Loans .......................................................................... 188 214 197 Non-Credit Business Programs ............................................. 245 177 144 Salaries and Expenses ........................................................... 175 171 218 All Other Programs .................................................................. 14 12 15 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1................. 920 782 797 Remove contingent adjustments ............................................ 20 20 18 Total, Discretionary budget authority ......................................... 900 762 779 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary Resources: Disaster Loans .......................................................................... 100 75 \u2014 Business Loans ........................................................................ \u20147 5\u2014 Total, Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ...... 100 150 \u2014 Mandatory Outlays: Loan Reestimates and Loan Asset Sale Proceeds ............. 1,380 70 238 Total, Mandatory outlays .............................................................. 1,380 70 238 Credit activity: Direct Loan Disbursements: Disaster Loans .......................................................................... 683 1,334 976 Business Loans ........................................................................ 67 41 29 Direct loan disbursements ................................................ 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Smithsonian Institution Lawrence Small, Secretary www.si.edu 202-357-2700 Number of Employees :4 , 5 6 0 2002 Spending : $548 million Facilities : 15 museums, plus the National Zoo and three major scientific centersThe Smithsonian Institution's mission is \"the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\" The Smithsonian fulfills both parts of its mission through scientific research and byoperating 15 museums in New York City andWashington, D.C., as well as the National Zoo.More than perhaps any federal establishment,the Smithsonian must maintain its facilities to safeguard the nation's priceless collections. The Smithsonian receives about two-thirdsof its annual operating funds from federalappropriations. The remaining one-thirdcomes from the Smithsonian Trust funds, which include donations, income from the Trust endowment, proceeds from Smithsonian business ventures, grants, and contracts. Over the past five years, federal appropriations have increased 24 percent, providing a total of $2.2 billion. On the Trust side, funding has risen 20 percent, providinga total of $1.1 billion. Museums Overall performance . Smithsonian museums educate and entertain the public. If the number of visits is used as a yardstick for overall performance, the Smithsonian has three of the four top-performing museums in the United States. Five of the Smithsonian museums and facilities\u2014Airand Space, Natural History, American History, the Castle, and the National Zoo\u2014receive over 85percent of all Smithsonian visitors. The remaining 11 welcome less than 15 percent of the visitors, 357358 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION yet consume over 35 percent of the Smithsonian's operating costs. Moreover, these museums will require over 50 percent of future capital project costs. Air and SpaceAmerican History Natural HistoryHirshhorn National ZooSackler/ Freer African Art05101520Cost per Visit Varies Across Smithsonian Museums Dollars per visitJust as important as measuring the number of visitors, their enjoyment and learning, is the cost of providing those services.This can be measured by the dollars pervisit spent operating the museums. Lookingacross the Smithsonian's museums, there aregreat differences in the efficiency of providing museum services. As the accompanying chart shows, the cost to taxpayers of a visit to aSmithsonian museum ranges from about $2 tonearly $20. Improving performance . The Institution will continue to improve efficiency, and will expand its performance data to determine cost per visit at each of its museums in2003. Beginning in 2003, Institution performance also will be measured by visitor assessments ofenjoyment and learning. Research Smithsonian researchers utilize the vast collection of fossil plants belonging to the Institution.Overall performance . Scientific research at the Smithsonian is as vast and varied asits collections, and ranges from paintings andinsects to artifacts to animal reproduction.In addition to its collections-based research,the Smithsonian operates a trio of scientific research centers. The Smithsonian recently appointed a commission to review its science programs.The charge to this commission is to answerthe question: How should the Smithsonian setpriorities for scientific research in the years ahead and, in general, carry out its historic mission more effectively? This commission willprovide its report later in 2002. In general, a merit-based, competitive process should govern the investment of federal research funds. For decades, the scientific community has agreed that such a process producesthe highest quality science and the most innovative research. This approach is consonant with the Administration's emphasis on better management of federal programs. The President's Management Agenda, released in August 2001, calls for a results-oriented government thatpromotes innovation through competition. While most federal research and development agenciesallocate at least some of their federal funds through merit-based competition, the Smithsonian doesnot.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 359 Improving performance . An outside group will be appointed to recommend how much of the funds directly appropriated to the Smithsonian for scientific research should be awardedcompetitively. The review will encompass all Smithsonian scientific research. It will focus on enabling Smithsonian scientific research to compete on a level playing field with other potential performers of the research, where that potential exists. Following the review, if appropriate, theAdministration will submit its request to transfer necessary amounts from the Smithsonian to theNational Science Foundation. Any transferred funds would be available directly to the Smithsonianto ease the transition in 2003 and then made available for competition in future years. Facilities The National Museum of the American Indian will occupy the last remaining space along the National Mall in Washington, D.C.Overall performance .T h e S m i t h s o n i a n must maintain over 400 buildings, andcurrently has commitments to build twomore: the National Museum of the AmericanIndian, and the Udvar-Hazy extension of the Air and Space Museum at Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C. These new buildingswill increase the size of the Smithsonian'smuseums by nearly 20 percent, from 4.5million to 5.5 million square feet. The Smithsonian has not stayed within cost estimates for significant projects. Estimates for the cost of construction of the AmericanIndian Museum and the restoration of thePatent Office Building (where the American Art Museum and the Portrait Gallery are housed) have nearly doubled since 1999. Substantialimprovement in the Smithsonian's ability to estimate costs is expected from its use of new cost estimating techniques and management controls that were recently endorsed by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). In addition, the Smithsonian has hired new managementstaff in this area. 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006050100150200250300Maintenance & Restoration Costs of Facilities Source: Smithsonian Institution.In millions of dollarsAt the same time, deterioration of existing buildings over the past decade at the expenseof expansion and new museums has created a huge maintenance and restoration backlog (see accompanying chart). In 1995, the Commissionon the Future of the Smithsonian indicated that$50 million per year for the subsequent decadewould be needed. After steady budget increases,that level was reached in 2001. However, a new assessment indicates more is needed, due to more deterioration than was previously realized.A recent report from the National Academyof Public Administration estimated the totalcost of repair, restoration, and alterations overthe next decade at $1.5 billion. Based on these360 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION projections, the Smithsonian's maintenance and restoration budget would need to increase fourfold within five years. Because such massive funding increases will not be possible under current budgetconstraints, the Smithsonian will set priorities within the Institution for repair and restoration. Improving Performance. The 2003 Budget addresses some of the Smithsonian's most significant performance challenges. The budget increases resources for maintenance, boostingfunds to reduce the large backlog of currently identified revitalization needs by six percent from2001. The budget completes the federal commitment to construct the National Museum of theAmerican Indian and provides funds for the ongoing restoration of the Patent Office Building. Thebudget addresses physical security for both collections and visitors, correcting currently identified hazardous conditions. In addition, it provides funding for improvements in financial management. Making the Smithsonian Safe and Secure Keeping collections of plants and animals requires that they be preserved for future study. Certain kinds of animal samples are preserved in potentially hazardous solvents such as alcohol. Currently, the Smithsonianhas a significant amount of alcohol on hand to store and preserve scientific specimens. The budget providesfunding to design a separate offsite building to store t hese collections. In addition, the budget provides $20 million to address immediate security concerns following the events of September 11 th. Strengthening Management Aggressive implementation of the President's Management Reform Agenda is central to improving government performance. For each initiative, the scorecard below describes how well the Smithsonian is executing the management initiatives, and where it scored in 2001 against the overall standards for success. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014The Smithsonian does not have an adequate plan for managing its workforce. Total federal FTEs at the Institution in 2002 stood at 4,560. In addition, theSmithsonian's trust side supports approximately 1,400 FTEs. The Institution will provide aworkforce plan to control costs and improve management with the 2004 Budget. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014The Smithsonian produced an inventory that lists 1,146 positions (25 percent) as potentially performing commercial activities. Of that group, however, all but 36 were categorized as exempt from the cost comparison process. Among the exempt was theInstitution's security workforce of 628. However, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum hasoutsourced its security workforce and is satisfied with its performance. The Smithsonian has atimeline for completing a competitive sourcing plan by June 2002. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 361 Initiative 2001 Status Financial Management \u2014Although it has received clean opinions on its audited financial statements, the Smithsonian is concerned that the unqualified opinion may be in jeopardy due to the inadequacy of its accounting system. The recent NAPA report notes that \"the Smithsonian's accounting system provides useful information only at the summary level anddoes not support either federal requirements for obligation and outlay information or theSmithsonian's internal project management requirements.\" A recent congressional request forobligations and outlay information for repair projects required a labor-intensive effort by theSmithsonian budget office staff. Replacement of the financial management system is a high priority, and funds for it are included in the 2003 Budget request. \u007f E-Government \u2014Information Technology (IT) investment at the Smithsonian includes a request for $64 million in 2003. Considerable effort has been poured into justifications andbusiness cases for two of the investments: Enterprise Resource Planning and Managed ITInfrastructure (totaling $14 million of the 2003 r equest). A review of the IT portfolio indicates duplicative system efforts. Over the next year, the Smithsonian will assess this issue and crafta strategy for unifying and simplifying business processes and systems. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014To date, the Smithsonian has not finalized an updated Strategic Plan or a Performance Plan. In previous years, the Smithsonian's budget requestwas based on incremental funding increases, such as pay raises and increases in utilitiescosts, with no information on performance. For 2003, the budget shows some improvementin performance measures. Performance information will be much more integrated with thebudget request in 2004.\u007f Smithsonian Institution (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Salaries and Expenses ................................................................................. 406 418 455 Capital Projects .............................................................................................. 68 98 93 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted1....................................... 474 516 548 Remove contingent adjustments .................................................................. 19 19 20 Available from prior years ............................................................................. \u2014\u20141 4 Total, Discretionary budget authority, gross .................................................... 455 497 542 Total, Discretionary budget authority, net ........................................................ 455 497 528 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources ....................................... \u20142 2\u2014 1Adjusted to include the full share of accruing employee pensions and annuitants health benefits.

Social Security Administration Jo Anne B. Barnhart, Commissioner www.ssa.gov 800-SSA-1213 Headquarters : Baltimore, Maryland Number of Employees : 63,464 2002 Spending : $492.7 billion Field Offices :1 , 3 3 7The Social Security Administration (SSA) promotes the economic security of the nation through disbursing America's major incomesupport entitlements for the elderly, disabled,and their dependents. SSA manages theOld-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance(OASDI) programs, universally known as Social Security. SSA also administers the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programfor low-income aged and disabled individuals.In addition, the agency provides services thatsupport the Medicare program on behalf of theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Administering Benefits SSA is responsible for paying around $40 billion in benefits to more than 50 m illion people every month, processing more than five million new claims for benefits each year, handling approximately 61 million phone calls to its 800-number, and issuing 136 million Social Security statements. Otheractivities include issuing Social Security numbers, maintaining earnings records for wage earnersand self-employed individuals, updating beneficiary eligibility information, educating the publicabout programs, combating fraud, and conducting research, policy analysis, and program evaluation. These activities are largely i ntegrated across the various programs that SSA administers. The 2003 Budget includes resources to increase productivity in customer service areas while also redeploying staff to front-line customer service positions, thus improving performance in importantareas as identified in the accompanying table. 363364 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Performance Measurements Goal 2001 2002 2003 Percent of retirement claims processed within 14 days .................................................................................... 83% 85% 88% Percent of SSA's customer-initiated services available to customers either electronically via the Internet or through automated telephone service ........ 21% 30% 40% Percent of callers that access SSA's 800 number within five minutes of their first attempt ......................... 92% 92% 94% The Ticket to Work program helps people with disabilities return to work.Services for Persons with Disabilities. The Ticket to Work and Work IncentivesImprovement Act of 1999 was designed toreduce barriers and increase incentives for individuals with disabilities to participate in the workforce. Ticket to Work makes iteasier for disability beneficiaries to obtainemployment services and lets them choosefrom a wider array of service providers.The program also provides for cooperative agreements and grant programs in each state for activities aimed at educating beneficiariesabout available employment support servicesand helping them understand the workincentives built into the law. For example, oneimportant incentive gives Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries the opportunity to test their ability to earn wages during a nine-month trialwork period without affecting their eligibilityfor benefits. As part of his New Freedom Initiative, the President supported swiftly implementing Ticket to Work. The program will be up and running in 13 states this year. SSA will expand Ticket to Work to all states and U.S. territories in 2003, and the program will be fully operational byearly 2004. Over the long run, Ticket to Work is expected to increase the percentage of DI and SSIbeneficiaries who are employed. Achieving this goal generates at least a three-way benefit. First,the federal government sees benefit payments to such persons drop. Second, the U.S. Treasurycollects taxes on wages earned. More importantly, though, the beneficiaries return to the dignity and independence of work. The budget includes $40 million for SSA's return-to-work activities in 2003. Stewardship SSA conducts activities that at some point touch nearly everyone in America\u2014including issuing Social Security numbers, maintaining earnings records that will later be used to calculate SocialSecurity benefits, and administering the benefit programs. As such, SSA has an obligation to ensureTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 365 sound financial management of its programs, as well as accurate and reliable processes in other areas such as Social Security number issuance. A crucial aspect of good management in income support programs is ensuring that only eligible individuals receive benefits, and that they receive benefits in the correct amount. SSA undertakes a variety of activities to minimize improper payments through means such as verifying beneficiaries'eligibility status, collecting debt, and investigating and deterring fraud. Despite these efforts, theSSI program, in particular, remains inherently vulnerable to payment error and consequently hasbeen designated as a high-risk program by the General Accounting Office since 1997. SSA has two major tools for ensuring payment accuracy: Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) and SSI non-disability redeterminations. The first does what its title implies to ensure that only those who remain disabled continue receiving benefits. Redeterminations are used to assess whetheran SSI recipient continues to meet the financial eligibility requirements or has experienced a changeof circumstances that would affect his or her monthly benefit amount. Detecting and Preventing Payment Errors. The budget supports activities undertaken by SSA to ensure the integrity of records and payments. The Administration proposes a total of $1.05 billion for conducting CDRs and redeterminations for 2003. The amount for CDRs ($642 million) and redeterminations ($411 million) will enable SSA to conduct CDRs on schedule and increase thenumber of SSI redeterminations conducted by nine percent over the budgeted 2002 level. This level offunding will allow SSA to conduct almost 1.4 million CDRs and 2.5 million redeterminations in 2003.Approximately two out of every five SSI recipients will receive a redetermination in 2003 with thislevel of funding. SSA targets its redetermination effort on cases that are most likely to experience a change in eligibility, such as when a beneficiary's non-SSI income changes. SSA's experience shows $11 in program savings for each $1 invested in CDRs and approximately $7 in program savings fromoverpayments collected and prevented for each $1 invested in redeterminations. Protecting Social Security Numbers. Social Security numbers (SSNs) themselves have taken on added importance as the SSN has become widely used as the key to a person's identity. Firmsrequest SSNs for such basic activities as employment, opening a bank account, and applying for credit. Their value motivates unscrupulous individuals to fraudulently acquire and use them. To effectively reduce SSN fraud, SSA is reexamining its enumeration process to improve its ability toassess whether individuals applying for SSNs are who they say they are. SSI Recipient Used Over 30 Aliases to Conceal His Identity SSA's Inspector G eneral investigated a man in 2001 who used multiple SSNs and identification documents to obtain SSA benefits under various aliases. Duringsearches, investigators seized counterfeit identifications, SSN cards, and fakem i l i t a r yd o c u m e n t s .T h ee v i d e n c es h o w e dt h em a nu s e d3 3o rm o r ea l i a s e s ,w a s a five-time convicted felon, and was a federal fugitive for 17 years. The man, a career criminal, at various times posed as a firefighter, traffic investigator, animal control officer, Central Intelligence Agency agent, and U.S.Marine Corps officer. At times, he portrayed himself as a highly decorated combatveteran and former prisoner of war. He was incarcerated and ordered to pay$56,900 in restitution to SSA.366 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SSA has gotten more sophisticated at preventing SSN fraud. Software changes planned for 2002 and 2003 will interrupt the issuance of a card in cases where suspicious circumstancesexist. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain, especially with regard to verifying some documents presented as identification. Working in partnership with other federal agencies, SSA will remain at the forefront of conquering any technological obstacles and institutional barriers that provide anopportunity for fraud to occur. S t r e n g t h e n i n gS o c i a lS e c u r i t yF o rT h eL o n gT e r m For more than 60 years, Social Security has provided retirement security for tens of millions of Americans. Yet, Social Security itself is showing signs of insecurity. Increasing life expectancies and falling birthrates have combined to put the current system on a path to insolvency. Social Securitycosts are projected to exceed annual cash revenues starting in 2016, and the gap between costsand revenues will continue to grow thereafter. Between 2016 and 2038, Social Security trust fund\"balances\"\u2014consisting of debt the government owes itself\u2014will make up the difference, althoughall this means is that general tax revenues will increasingly be tapped to pay benefits. After 2038, incoming Social Security revenue will only cover 73 percent of currently scheduled benefits. The President appointed a bipartisan commission in May 2001 to develop recommendations to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to Social Security, based on the following principles: \u007fModernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees. \u007fThe entire Social Security surplus must be dedicated to Social Security only. \u007fSocial Security payroll taxes must not be increased. \u007fGovernment must not invest Social Security funds in the stock market. \u007fModernization must preserve Social Security's disability and survivor components. \u007fModernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment the Social Security safety net. In December, the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security released its analysis of the financial problems confronting Social Security and its recommendations for addressing them.The Commission determined that reforming Social Security to include personal retirement accountswould lead to better long run outcomes for future beneficiaries, the Social Security program, and theeconomy as a whole. Highlights of Commission Findings Personal accounts would increase retirement security because they would facilitate wealth creation for all participants. Establishing personal accounts in Social Security would advance a highly progressive principle: it would provide an opportunity for wealth creation to the approximately half of American households who save nothing in an average year after contributing 12.4 percent of their wages to support the Social Security system. In addition, personal accounts could addvaluable protections for widows, divorced persons, low-income households and other Americans atrisk of poverty in old age. Asset ownership would lead to improved financial security by diversifying risk. Over the decades, lawmakers have changed the Social Security benefit formulas and payroll tax rates numerous times in response to fiscal conditions. Future Social Security benefit levels remain uncertain due to theTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 367 current projected funding shortfall in the program. Social Security participants could hedge against this political risk by holding some of their future retirement benefits in the form of personal accounts,to which they would have a legal right of ownership. Workers could invest their accounts as they saw fit, and those wishing to avoid market risk could invest exclusively in government securities. Commission to Strengthen Social Security: Models for Reform Model 1. Future retirees who remain wholly in the traditional Social Security system would potentially receive currently scheduled benefits, subject to future actions to restore solvency. Expected benefits for those whoopt for personal accounts would be substantially higher. Option to redirect two percent of payroll taxes topersonal account, in exchange for partial offset to defined benefit. No provision for additional revenues or othermeasures to maintain solvency, so future benefit levels are uncertain. Model 2. Future retirees who remain wholly in the traditional Social Security system would receive defined benefits at least as high as today's retirees in real terms. Expected benefits for those who opt for personalaccounts would be substantially higher. Higher benefits for survivors and lifelong low-wage workers. Option toredirect up to four percent of payroll taxes (capped at $1,000) to personal account, in exchange for partial offsetto defined benefit. Temporary transfers of general revenues to the trust funds to maintain solvency. Model 3. Future retirees who remain wholly in the traditional Social Security system would receive defined benefits higher than today's retirees in real terms, but less than currently scheduled benefits. Expected benefits for those who opt for personal accounts would be substantially higher. Higher benefits for survivors and lifelonglow-wage workers. Larger reductions for early retirement. Option to redirect up to 2.5 percent of payroll taxesto personal account (capped at $1,000), conditional on 1 per cent out-of-pocket contribution (subsidized for low-wage workers), in exchange for partial offset to defined benefit. Additional federal revenues dedicatedto Social Security indefinitely to maintain solvency. Benefit and Cost Projections under the Three Models Under all three models, expected benefits would be substantially higher than those payable with current-lawSocial Security revenues. The accompanying table compares expected benefits and costs under the threemodels with currently scheduled Social Security defined benefits, which are slated to grow in real terms forfuture retirees because they are indexed to the average wage level. However, currently scheduled benefits are uncertain after 2038 because the system is underfunded. The cost of currently scheduled benefit obligations would exceed Social Security revenues by $4.2 tr illion over the next 75 years. The model benefit projections are not directly comparable to one another. For example, while Model 1's total benefits are higher than Model 2, the Model 1 defined benefit is subject to considerable uncertaintybecause additional actions would be required to maintai n solvency. Models 2 and 3 each fully fund the system. Model 2 provides an expected combined benefit higher than currently scheduled benefits for most workers, at significantly less cost to taxpayers than maintaining currentl y scheduled benefits under the existing system. Model 3 benefits are higher than Model 2, because Model 3 explicitly requires more federal revenues, as well as additional out-of-pocket account contributions from workers that are not captured in the measureof federal costs.368 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Comparison of Costs and Benefits of Currently Scheduled Payments and Models for Reform Low Earner Medium Earner High Earner Currently scheduled benefits, 2052 (2001 dollars)New revenues needed1 $986 $1,628 $2,151 $4.2 trillion Change in expected benefits, with account proceeds, 20522Change in new revenues needed3 Model present value of the net cash flow required from the general fund over the next 75 years to pay currently scheduled benefits. 2Expected percent change from currently scheduled benefits for new retirees in 2052.

Partial advance funding should be a goal of any effort to strengthen Social Security. Advance funding would increase the nation's capital stock and productive capacity. This would increase the total economic resources available to support a large population of retirees and would reduce SocialSecurity's financial burden on future generations. Advance funding should occur through personalaccounts rather than government investment in private securities. Government investment wouldlikely lead to inappropriate political interference in the market, inefficiency, and conflicts of interest. A Social Security system with personal accounts would offer higher total expected benefits to individuals than a system without accounts, regardless of what other steps are taken to b alance the system's finances. Personal accounts improve total expected benefits by giving workers the opportunity to realize the gains that come from returns on capital. The Commission presented threemodels for balancing Social Security's finances and incorporating personal accounts. The modelsdiffered with respect to the extent to which they addressed Social Security's fiscal imbalance. Undereach model, individuals with accounts invested in a standard portfolio could expect higher total benefits than individuals without acc ounts. Personal accounts can reduce the long-term cost growth of Social Security, thus improving its fiscal sustainability . Each of the reform models developed by the Commission would allow individuals to redirect part of their payroll tax revenue toward a personal account. In exchange for the opportunityto pursue higher returns, individuals would agree to forego the defined benefit that would have beenfinanced by these payroll taxes assuming a low interest rate. As long as the personal account earned a return highe r than that interest rate, both the individual and the Social Security system would come out ahead.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 369 Social Security could be made fiscally sustainable in a number of ways, all of which would require some combination of changing the rate of benefit growth and committing additional revenues to thesystem generated by taxation or by the proceeds of investment. In the absence of personal accounts, the only choices are to increase taxes, slow the scheduled growth of benefits, or some combination of the two .Whatever measures are ultimately taken to produce a fiscally sustainable system, voluntary personal accounts improve the system by offering individuals the opportunity to pursuehigher expected returns by investing in a low-cost, diversified portfolio. Finally, the Commission recommended that the Congress and the President engage in a period of national discussion for at least one year to carefully consider the alternatives, as well as the consequences of inaction, and then take the appropriate steps to strengthen and modernize Social Security. The full text of the Commission's report is available at www.csss.gov. Improving Performance Service Delivery Assessment The Commissioner of Social Security is committed to assessing the level of service that SSA should be providing Americans, relate that to current service levels, and determine the necessary action toreach service delivery goals. Disability Process Improvements 0100200300400500Number of daysAverage Wait for an Applicant to Receive a Disability Decision Source: Social Security Administration.One Year Hearing Decision 308 Reconsideration Step 70 Initial Disability Claims Decision 106 Note: Claimant may receive a favorable decision before the final step.A long-standing management challenge for SSA has been the timeand expense involved in processingclaims for disability benefits, particularly appeals of unfavorable initial determinations. Initial claimsare processed by state employees atstate disability determination serviceagencies fully funded by SSA. In 2001,the average processing time for initial claims was 106 days, or about three and a half months. For those whose claimsare denied, hearings are conducted bySSA's Office of Hearings and Appeals(OHA). Applicants requesting a hearingwaited an average of another 10 months in 2001 for OHA to return with a decision (see accompanying chart). The disability determination process is inherently complex. It involves the collection and evaluation of medical and other evidence from the claimant, physicians, and sometimes fromemployers or other individuals who may have information about the claimant's impairments orability to work. SSA is exploring ways to automate the transmission and storage of case files, but370 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION the process remains largely paper driven. Fragmentation across SSA's field offices, state agencies, and OHA also contributes to long processing times. SSA periodically has investigated ways to reduce disability processing times. The most recent effort began in the mid-1990s and has not achieved expected results. The number of disability claims is expected to rise substantially in coming years, as the Baby Boom generation reaches the agesat which the incidence of disability increases. It is imperative that SSA develop the capacity toefficiently manage these workloads. SSA will examine potential process reforms that would useadministrative resources more efficiently and improve management controls. The budget commitsto reducing processing times for initial disability claims by five days in 2003. The budget also proposes a management improvement by establishing a standard for accuracy in SSI disability awards identical to that which applies to Social Security Disability Insurance. Leveraging Technology SSA anticipates moderate increases in its workloads over the next five years and then considerable increases as the post-World War II Baby Boom generation enters retirement starting in 2008. Unless SSA improves upon its current business processes by investing in and making use of technologyimprovements, resources may not be able to meet workload demands over the next 10 years. Whencombined with procedural changes, exploiting the full potential of information technology will allowSSA to handle the workload increases and improve customer service without increases in staff. 21st Century Communication. SSA is developing a strategy to encourage citizens to interact with the agency in the most cost-effective manner possible, particularly through the Internet or SSA's 800-number. SSA has made progress in recent years, especially in its Internet presence. The agencyhas rapidly expanded the types of online interactions that customers can conduct, such as filingclaims for retirement benefits over the Internet. However, SSA remains a paper-driven agency. Only 3.5 percent of retirement claims are handled over the Internet at this time, and other online services also experience low utilization rates. SSA is developing aggressive outreach efforts to educate SSA customers about their options and encourage them to interact with the agency through electronic means when possible. Since there are situationswhich require an in-person visit to a local field office, and some customers prefer to conduct theirbusiness in person, the option to visit a field office will remain available. However, most routinetransactions for those who have Internet access could be handled at lower cost to the agency andgreater convenience to the public through electronic means. SSA will establish performance goals for the number of business transactions to be conducted via the Internet and through automated telephone service. This information will be included in performance and accountability reports as aperformance indicator. SSA's goal is to have 40 percent of customer-initiated services available either via the Internet or through automated telephone service in 2003, rising to 67 percent by 2005. The President'sBudget provides $688 million in 2003 for SSA information technology, which will allow the agency to maintain its existing technology infrastructure as well as expand its Internet services, improve security capabilities, support electronic wage reporting by employers, and make a variety of otherimprovements.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 371 Strengthening Management SSA has made progress in implementing several components of the President's Management Agenda. In the area of financial management, SSA has already eliminated many of the serious deficiencies seen in most government agencies. Specifically, SSA is one of only four agencies that has received unqualified opinions on its financial audits since the agency first began submitting themin 1996. The scorecard below establishes how SSA stood in 2001 against the standards for successin each initiative. While the agency received one of the best evaluations overall, there are areas forimprovement. The plans to improve management are identified in each of the management agendasections. Initiative 2001 Status Human Capital \u2014SSA has reduced its supervisor to employee ratio from 1:8 in 1990 to its current level of 1:14, which is one of the lowest percentages of the 23 largest federal agencies. In addition, from 1990 to 2001, SSA increased the number of front-line workers by over 5,000 while its workforce shrank two percent. However, given the expected future workloads andthe state of customer service, there is a compelling argument for additional redeployment of staff to front-line positions. \u007f Competitive Sourcing \u2014While SSA identifies 19 percent of its workforce as performing commercial tasks, there remain significant additional positions to be classified as commercial.SSA will implement a management plan for increasing competitive sourcing that identifies by function and location the competitions or direct conversions to be conducted as well as a time line for when and how they will take place. The management and competition plan willdescribe the strategies used to ensure that at least five percent of commercial positions will becompeted or directly converted in 2002, and that SSA will compete or directly convert at least15 percent of the commercial positions by 2003 to meet the Administration's two-year goal in abroader effort to eventually compete at least 50 percent of all commercial activities.\u007f Financial Management \u2014In 2001, SSA received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements, and its accounting and internal control systems met federal standards. However,SSA does not have fully integrated financial and operating management systems, whichsupport day to day decision making. SSA is on track to integrating its financial and performancemanagement system, and will continue to integrate them through implementation of a newcost accounting system in 2002. Another key performance area is reducing erroneous payments. The problem plagues the agency's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which remains a high-risk programdue to improper payments. In recent years, SSA has increased its funding for initiativesfocused on identifying erroneous payments. The 2003 Budget will enable SSA to increaseSSI non-disability redeterminations by nine percent and achieve a payment accuracy rateof 94.7 percent.\u007f372 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Initiative 2001 Status E-Government \u2014SSA has a broad strategic goal of attaining a paperless environment by 2010. SSA has taken constructive steps in the last two years by rapidly expanding online customer service options. These include retirement claims, Medicare replacement cards, online \"account\" status, access to change one's address and telephone number, and directdeposit. Despite these new services, SSA remains a paper-driven agency that still relies onmoving claims folders from one site to the next for processing. To address this issue, SSAwill give high priority to E-Government projects that will result in large productivity increasesby improving the business process, such as with the \"e-dib\" project. This is a paperless process centered on employees sharing an electronic folder in a secure environment to review disability beneficiaries' files. SSA's capital planning process has improved markedly over the last two years. However, SSA will improve its risk management assessment, set performance goals associated with specificinformation technology (IT) projects, and develop a cost-tracking system that consolidates costinformation for IT projects. \u007f Budget/Performance Integration \u2014SSA has a wide range of performance measures for the various activities the agency conducts. However, SSA needs to strengthen the linkage between performance and funding. Currently, SSA's budget relates funding to outputs, by calculatingthe workforce it needs to process all of the work i t expects to receive at given production rates, taking account of planned efficiencies and other changes. Only in a few activities (ContinuingDisability Reviews and SSI Redeterminations) does SSA have costs specifically aligned with outcome measures. SSA will improve its ability to present a performance budget that permits direct comparisons between incremental budgeted amounts and outcomes in specific activities. \u007fTHE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 373 Social Security Administration (In millions of dollars) Estimate 2001 Actual 2002 2003 Spending: Discretionary Budget Authority: Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE)1......................................... 7,448 7,907 8,283 Office of the Inspector General .................................................................... 72 79 87 Research and Development ......................................................................... 23 30 23 Subtotal, Discretionary budget authority adjusted2....................................... 7,543 8,016 8,393 Remove contingent adjustments .................................................................. 327 Total, Discretionary budget authority ............................................................... 7,216 7,673 8,043 Emergency Response Fund, Budgetary resources .......................................

T h eO f f i c eo fN a t i o n a lD r u gC o n t r o lP o l i c y( O N D C P ) ,w h i c hi sp a r to ft h eE x e c u t i v eO f f i c eo f the President, is responsible for developing the government-wide National Drug Control Strategyand the budget that supports it. This strategy involves most of the major Cabinet Departments andencompasses programs that attempt to prevent the use of drugs, treat those who are addicted toillegal substances, enforce the nation's drug laws, interdict drugs before they reach the Americanborder, and help other nations eliminate the production of illegal drugs. ONDCP also is directly responsible for four drug control programs, with funding totaling close to $500 million. Overview Although some progress in reducing drug use has been made, the record is clearly mixed. Use of illegal drugs by youths fell substantially between 1979 and 1992, but has increased since then.Among persons 18 and older, and among adolescents and young adults, reported use dropped over a 20-year period, but has not dropped significantly since the early 1990s. Yet costs associated with drug use, such as incarceration, illness, and premature death, continue to rise and are estimated to exceed $160 billion annually. Despite substantial spending by all levelsof government, and concerted efforts of parents, friends, schools, and faith-based organizations, druguse in the United States remains unacceptably high and imposes considerable costs on society. Onepart of the problem is reflected in the way the federal government confronts the drug problem. Much of the $19 billion spent in 2002 in the name of drug control actually reflects the failure of our drug efforts by funding the consequences of drug use. 375376 FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAMS A Greater Emphasis on Education and Community Action Above all, we must reduce drug use for one great moral reason: over time, drugs rob men and women and children of their dignity and character. Illegal drugs are the enemies of ambition and hope. And when we fight against drugs, we fight for the souls of our fellow Americans . President George W. Bush December 14, 2001The President believes the most effective w a yt or e d u c et h es u p p l yo fd r u g si nA m e r i c ais to reduce the demand for drugs in Americaby stopping drug use before it starts. The President's Budget recognizes the central role of prevention in reducing drug use and thebudget this year provides funding for severalmajor efforts. More than anything else, prevention means sending a consistent message. Two examples are the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and the Drug-Free Communities Program. The President's Budget includes $180 million for the media campaign, which attempts to educate youngpeople about drug use and its consequences through targeted, paid messages in both the traditionalmass media and on other media like the Internet. The Drug-Free Communities program, fundedat $60 million in 2003, furnishes matching grants to local anti-drug coalitions trying to prevent theillegal use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by youth. Disrupting the Market: Attacking the Economic Basis of the Drug Trade Local efforts by themselves are not enough. Disrupting the drug trade remains an essential part of the federal government's approach to drug control. It is a two-front campaign. Internationally,disrupting the drug trade includes tracking and stopping aircraft and ships attempting to smuggleillegal drugs into the United States, cooperative efforts with other nations to dismantle drug production facilities, taking apart drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, and building the political and legal institutions to deter future drug trafficking. A key component of this effort is the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The President's Budget includes $731 million for this initiative, $106 million more than enacted in 2002. This fundingrequest continues programs to aid law enforcement in the Andean region, including the operationsand maintenance of the Colombian National Police and Army Counternarcotics Brigade. More details on the Andean Counterdrug Initiative can be found in the Department of State and International Assistance Programs chapter. Increasing Support for Drug Treatment When prevention and enforcement efforts fail, we must treat those who abuse drugs. There are approximately five million heavy users of illegal drugs in America today\u2014one-third of whom ingest two-thirds of all drugs. In order to help those seeking treatment, the President has made increasing drug treatment a priority. The President's Budget proposes an increase of nearly $110 million forthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Targeted Capacity Expansionprogram, which is designed to support a rapid response to emerging trends in substance abuse. Italso includes a $60 million increase for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant,which will provide additional funding to states for treatment and prevention services.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 377 However, the majority of those who need treatment do not seek it voluntarily, and for that reason, $77 million is proposed for the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program. RSATdistributes funds to states that support drug and alcohol treatment in state correctional systems. The budget also proposes $52 million for the Drug Courts program, which uses the courts' authority to force abstinence from drugs and to alter behavior with escalating sanctions, mandatory drug testing,treatment, and strong aftercare programs. Emphasizing Performance The President has committed the federal government to manage by results, and nowhere is the need for improved management greater than in federal drug control efforts. For example, the effectiveness of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program has been questioned. While laudable in itsgoals, a recent Rand report on the program found that the locally-designed initiatives \"are rarelybased on proven models,\" and concluded that the program has not been credibly evaluated. Toimprove evaluation and better direct program activities in 2003, the Department of Education willdevelop an evaluation plan for these grants, one that will impose program accountability, while alerting schools to problem areas. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program was set up so that law enforcement agencies could zero in on areas designated by ONDCP as \"centers\" of major drug production,manufacturing, importation, or distribution. The program has grown from the five original HIDTAsof a decade ago to 28 HIDTAs currently. Much of the increase in the HIDTA program is the result ofcongressional direction of funds to specific HIDTAs. However, there are questions about whether some of these areas deserve to be designated as HIDTAs. No systematic evaluation of the HIDTA program has been conducted and no credible performance measures have been developed. Thebudget proposes $206 million for HIDTAs, a reduction of $20 million from the 2002 enacted level,and provides funding to measure performance. Principal Goals of the National Drug Control Program Two-Year Goals: Reduce current drug use by 10 percent for ages 12-17 and for persons ages 18 and up. Five-Y ear Goals: Reduce current drug use by 25 percent for ages 12-17 and for persons ages 18 and up.ONDCP will continue the work to bring accountability to drug control programsthrough better performance measurements.Right now, the national program has aPerformance Measures of Effectiveness (PME) system with five goals, 31 objectives, and nearly 100 performance targets. TheAdministration will carefully examine thissystem and its complex relationships todetermine what fundamental changes andadjustments should be made. In arraying so much detail, this system obscures the fundamental aim of the Drug Strategy\u2014toreduce drug use in America. Therefore, as an additional management reform, ONDCP will judgethe overall success of the National Drug Control Program by focusing on two specific two-year andfive-year goals, using as a baseline the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.378 FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAMS Restructuring the Drug Control Budget To bring greater accountability to drug control efforts, the Administration will propose a significant restructuring of the drug control budget. The national drug control budget includes close to 50 budget accounts totaling $19 billion for 2003. Recent independent analyses commissioned by ONDCP, as well as ongoing, required reviews by Inspectors General, have identified weaknesses inthe methodologies agencies use to measure drug control spending. These budgets are imprecise andoften have only a weak association with core drug control missions. Reform of the national drugcontrol budget is needed. In the coming months, the Administration will develop a new way to report the drug control budget, based on the following guidelines: \u007fall funding items displayed in the drug control budget should be readily identifiable line items in the President's Budget or agency budget justifications; and \u007fthe budget presentation should be simplified by eliminating several supporting agencies fromthe drug control budget tabulation. Only agencies with a primary supply reduction or demandreduction mission would be displayed in the drug control budget. Agencies with no or littledirect involvement in drug control would be excluded from the revised drug control budgetpresentation. The aim is to distinguish between funding for drug control efforts and funding for the consequences of drug use. It is the first category, drug control, that should be strengthened and emphasized. The second category, consequences of drug abuse, simply catalogues our policy failures. We should notconfuse large expenditures on this second category with effective action against drug abuse. This stricter definition of drug control is likely to reduce dramatically the federal funding deemed to represent drug control funding, but in fact represents a renewed federal commitment to actuallyreducing drug use. For example, the traditional methodology used in the accompanying table shows 2003 drug spending of $19.2 billion. The new methodology, when applied to this estimate, might show annual drug control spending to be several billion dollars less. This presentational change, whiledramatically lowering the amount of funding attributed to the drug control budget, will not have anegative effect on federal drug control efforts. In fact, it will improve those efforts by focusing onmanaging programs genuinely directed at reducing drug use. The proposed methodological changeswill be discussed more fully in the 2002 National Drug Control Strategy, and will be shared with the Congress and key stakeholders in the coming months. The 2004 Budget will show the changes in full.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 379 Federal Drug Control Funding by Agency (Budget authority, dollar amount in millions) 2001 2002 2003 Change 2002- 2003

AGENCIES COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates U.S. futures and options markets. It strives to protect investors by preventing fraud and abuse and ensuring adequate disclosure of information. The President's Budget includes a proposed fee on each round-turn commodities futures and options transaction. The fee will be phased in during 2003. This proposal recognizes that marketparticipants derive direct benefits from the CFTC's oversight, which provides legal certainty andcontributes to the integrity and soundness of the markets. The 2003 Budget provides $83 million tofund mission critical activities (e.g., enforcement and market surveillance) and to strengthen U.S.competitiveness, as required by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2001. In 2003, the CFTC will work to review every contract market designation application and derivatives transaction execution facility registration application within 30 to 60 days and respondto applicant exchanges with a notification letter. CFTC also will review requests for approval ofproducts and rule changes and respond to trading exchanges (e.g., Chicago Board of Trade) inwriting within 90 days. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION The primary responsibility of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is to protect the public from unreasonable risk of injury connected with consumer products. CPSC also helps developuniform safety standards for consumer products, and conducts and promotes research into preventingproduct-related deaths, injuries, or illness. A substantial portion of the CPSC's work focuses on decreasing fire hazards linked to consumer products and on reducing head injuries to children. CPSC's programs have helped drive down home fire death rates from consumer products by 46 percent since 1985, and head injury rates for childrenby 15 percent since 1986. The Commission carries out its mission by emphasizing voluntary standards first, moving to mandatory standards only when necessary. CPSC also seeks to obtain major product recallscooperatively with industry. It works actively with industry leaders to promote good product safety practices through conferences, special events, and expanded use of its toll-free hotline, 1-800-638-2772 and its website, www.cpsc.gov . CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) provides service opportunities for more than 1.5 million Americans in educational, public safety, and environmental activities through programs such as AmeriCorps and the National Senior Service Corps (NSSC). CNCS and its service opportunities are key components of the Administration's USA Freedom Corps\u2014a 381382 OTHER AGENCIES new initiative to engage citizens in promoting homeland security and civic volunteering at home and abroad. The budget requests $1,035 million, a $299 million or 41-percent increase, for theCorporation to support 75,000 AmeriCorps members, strengthen homeland security efforts, and expand service opportunities for an additional 100,000 seniors. This includes support for some 6,300 AmeriCorps VISTA members to provide outreach and technical assistance to community andfaith-based organizations. National Service and Homeland Security. Since the attacks of September 11 th, the President has encouraged all Americans to help fight terrorism on the home front by \"making a commitmentof service in our own communities.\" The budget includes $118 million across all CNCS programs to support these efforts. It also places senior citizens and other volunteers in community activities to strengthen homeland security. CNCS will furnish grants to states and community organizations tosupport and mobilize volunteers in public safety, public health, disaster relief and preparedness. Expanding Opportunities for Service Through AmeriCorps. The AmeriCorps program enables Americans of all backgrounds to serve in local communities through programssponsored by nonprofit organizations. The 2003 Budget includes an increase of $230 million to support an additional 25,000 AmeriCorps members. The Corporation's programs will support community-service organizations in meeting local needs and will conduct activities to promotepublic safety, public health, and emergency preparedness. The budget also includes $10 million forchallenge grants for teaching and other national service programs under section 126 of the Nationaland Community Service Act, where private sources provide at least 50 percent of funds required tooperate the program. Senior Service and Special Volunteer Programs. The National Senior Service Corps (NSSC) uses the talents of more than 500,000 older Americans to meet a wide range of community needs.Consisting of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, the Foster Grandparent Program, andthe Senior Companion Program, the NSSC serves young people with special needs, helps seniorslive independently in their homes, and provides support services to youth ex-offenders. The budgetincludes $213 million for the NSSC, a $6 million increase over 2002 and the second step of the President's five-year strategy to increase annual funding for the Senior Corps to $250 million over five years. In addition, the budget proposes $55 million for Special Volunteer Programs to provideservice opportunities for an additional 100,000 seniors, including activities in homeland security anda new Parent Drugs Corps. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The nation's capital city faces new and unique challenges following the events of September 11th. The President's Budget provides additional federal funding to support the District of Columbia'spublic safety response to events directly related to the federal government's presence in the District.The Congress provided $200 million in 2002 to help the District address immediate security needsarising from the September 11 thattacks. The 2003 Budget adds to these resources by proposing $15 million to support the District's role in homeland security. The budget continues to support the D.C. Resident Tuition Assistance program with $17 million in funding. The program was started in 1999 and allows District residents to attend public collegesnationwide at in-state tuition rates and to receive grants to attend private colleges in the D.C.area. This program is intended to ensure that D.C. residents have the same access to postsecondaryeducation as residents of states. The budget also proposes $1 million for Transportation Systems THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 383 Management to implement recommendations in the National Capital Planning Commission's October 2001 report. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS The District of Columbia Courts receive funding from the federal government under the 1997 National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act. In 2002, a new Family Courtof the D.C. Superior Court was created, which provides increased coordination and continuity forchild- and family-related cases. The President's Budget provides $191 million to the D.C. Courts,including funding to increase staffing for the Family Court Division. This funding includes $32 million to address long-term capital infrastructure needs associated with the expansion of the Family Court Division and overall deterioration of the D.C. Court facilities. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) works to enforce laws that prohibit employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability. The EEOC sets out to enforce the nation's equal employment laws through selective litigation, mediation, and alternative dispute resolution. Beyond enforcement, EEOC strives to preventemployment discrimination through outreach, training, and technical assistance to promoteemployer compliance. The 2003 Budget provides $324 million for EEOC. The budget reflects efficiencies that EEOC expects to realize through workforce restructuring and a reduction of decision-making layers to serve citizens more cost effectively. The budget will enable EEOC to continue to reduce its case backlog. The budget also includes $30 million for state, local, and tribal fair employment and more than $15million for critical information technology improvements. EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT The Executive Office of the President (EOP) encompasses a number of offices, councils, and accounts dedicated to serving the President. As part of the 2003 Budget, the Administration is requesting a consolidation and financial realignment for the EOP . The initiative would consolidatethe 12 individual annual appropriations for the salaries and expense accounts for the EOP agenciesand fund them with a single appropriation. It would consolidate the resources for commonacquisition-related goods and services into the EOP's Office of Administration, including the VicePresident's needs. This proposal would give the President maximum flexibility in allocating resources and staff in support of his office and is intended to: permit a more rapid response to changing needs and priorities;allow the President to address emergent national needs; produce greater economies of scale and otherefficiencies in procuring goods and services; and enhance accountability for performance. This initiative would enable the President to effectively manage and align EOP resources consistent with decision-making in an efficient and straightforward manner, while enhancing the accuracy of the financial systems and significantly reducing the administrative volume and cost of processing transactions through the U.S. Treasury. This initiative is carefully crafted to properly 384 OTHER AGENCIES support the President and the Vice President separately as the two senior constitutional officers of the Executive Branch, while achieving substantial efficiencies. Resources requested for the EOP in 2003 are $336 million. These resources will support approximately 2,000 personnel, information technology, and other infrastructure needs to serve the President and the Vice President. The EOP budget also includes new funding for the USAFreedom Corps. While the 2003 request is above the 2002 enacted level, the entire increase isdue to additional homeland security requirements. These homeland security expenses include theestablishment of the Office of Homeland Security and a separate counter-terrorism directorate inthe National Security Council, and the costs associated with ensuring the security of the President, the Vice President, and the staff that serve them. If homeland security expenses are excluded, the budget for the EOP grows by less than the rate of inflation. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION The President's Budget requests an appropriated spending level of $278 million for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), $248 million of which will be offset by regulatory fees. This funding level supports increased efficiency in the FCC's work processes through information technology investments and the FCC's Excellence in Engineering initiative. The FCC worksto encourage a fully competitive marketplace in communications and to promote affordablecommunications services for all Americans. Through more efficient licensing, the FCC will ensuremore rapid introduction of new services and technologies. In 2003, the FCC will complete 95 percentof its licensing activities for communications services within agency-established timeframes for each activity, such as 90 days from license application to issuance for wireless services. Also, 85 percent of all FCC applications will be filed electronically. In 1993, the President and the Congress gave the FCC authority to assign spectrum licenses through competitive bidding, which has proven to be an efficient and effective way to allocate thisfinite public resource. Upcoming spectrum auctions are expected to generate more than $25 billionover the next five years. The Administration will propose legislation to provide more certainty in upcoming auctions. The legislation will establish a framework for the FCC to develop regulations that promote clearing thespectrum in television channels 60-69 (747-762 and 777-792 MHz) for new wireless services in aneffective and equitable manner. Such legislation also would shift the statutory deadlines for theauction of channels 60-69 from the elapsed 2000 date to 2004 and for the auction of channels 52-59(698-746 MHz) from 2002 to 2006. Providing more certainty about how and when the spectrum in channels 60-69 will become available to new entrants and shifting the deadlines for both auctions would increase expected revenues by $6.7 billion. To facilitate the clearing of analog television broadcast spectrum and provide taxpayers some compensation for use of this scarce resource, the Administration will propose legislation authorizingthe FCC to establish an annual lease fee totaling $500 million for the use of analog spectrum bycommercial broadcasters beginning in 2007. Upon return of their analog spectrum license to the FCC, individual broadcasters will be exempt from the fee.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 385 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE The purpose of deposit insurance is to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's financial system. Federal deposit insurance, offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), is designed to protect depositors against losses from failures of insured commercial banks, thrifts (savings institutions), andcredit unions. Individual deposits up to $100,000 are covered in virtually all U.S. banks, savingsassociations, and credit unions. Currently, the federal government insures more than $3 trillion in deposits at more than 20,000 institutions through the FDIC and NCUA. These agencies maintain insurance reserves to use when resolving failed institutions. The FDIC and the NCUA fund these reserves through assessments on insured institutions, recoveries of assets liquidated from failed institutions, and interest earned onthese reserves in U.S. Treasury securities. The Administration is developing proposals to strengthen the deposit insurance system that draws on the framework released by the FDIC under former Chairwoman Donna Tanoue in April 2001. \u007fThe FDIC has been prohibited from charging premiums to \"well capitalized\" institutions since 1996. Therefore, under the current pricing structure, only seven percent of banks and 11 percent of thrifts pay regular insurance premiums. The framework would have all institutionspay at least a nominal amount for federal deposit insurance and would assess new deposits. \u007fUnder the current system, the FDIC is required to maintain a designated reserve ratio (DRR,the ratio of insurance fund reserves to total insured deposits) of 1.25 percent. If the DRRfalls below 1.25 percent, all institutions could be required to pay premiums averaging 23 basispoints if the DRR cannot be restored to 1.25 percent within a year. This current structurerequires institutions to face a cliff of high premium payments when they are weakest. TheFDIC framework would replace the current fixed reserve ratio with a flexible range. The framework would merge the bank and thrift funds, which offer an identical product. A merged fund would be stronger and better diversified than either fund standing alone. Additionally, giventhat many institutions currently hold both bank- and thrift-insured deposits, merging the fundswould eliminate the need to track bank and thrift deposits separately and would help streamlinemergers and acquisitions. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has jurisdiction over the financing of election campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency, and the Vice Presidency. TheFEC is composed of six commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. TheFEC discloses campaign finance information, enforces limits and prohibitions on contributions, andoversees the public funding of Presidential elections. The President's Budget includes $47.0 million for 2003, $3.0 million more than 2002, to allow the FEC to meet its increasing workload. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces various consumer protection and antitrust laws that prohibit business practices that are anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair to consumers. The FTCalso works to promote informed consumer choice and public understanding of the competitive process,386 OTHER AGENCIES seeking to accomplish this mission without impeding legitimate business activity. The proposed 2003 operating budget of $177 million is more than offset by anticipated fee collections. In 2003, the FTC will expand its contribution to the Administration's consumer privacy agenda by helping victims of ID theft, increasing enforcement and outreach on children's online privacy, and increasing enforcement against \"spam.\" It will also seek to establish a national \"do-not-call\" list thatwould protect consumers from unwanted and intrusive telemarketing calls, and bring nationwideconsistency to the current patchwork of lists administered by states and the private sector. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION The mission of the General Services Administration (GSA) is to help federal agencies better serve the public by offering at best value: quality workplaces, expert solutions, acquisitionservices, and management policies. For 2003, GSA is proposing six agency-wide strategic goals:1) provide best value for federal agencies; 2) achieve responsible asset management; 3) operateefficiently and effectively; 4) ensure financial accountability; 5) maintain a world-class workforceand workplace; and 6) help federal agencies comply with their social, environmental, and other administrative responsibilities. GSA has recognized previous shortcomings in its ability to measure the achievement of its strategic goals and has begun to build and implement a new PerformanceManagement Process. This new process will include performance measures beyond the traditionalmeasures of customer satisfaction, such as performance against customer expectations and industryand government benchmarks for quality, timeliness, cost, and return on investment. Data gatheringand reporting systems will be improved to present the performance of GSA's business lines and to show its policy role in helping agencies improve the management of administrative activities. Most of GSA's employees provide or procure commercial services for other federal agencies on a reimbursable or fee-for-service basis. Since GSA operates a collection of business-like services,it has significant opportunities to improve its overall performance by subjecting its activities tomarket-based competition. By the end of 2003, GSA will have conducted such competitions for atleast 15 percent of its \"commercial activities\" workforce. The 2003 Budget also recognizes GSA as operator of the official federal portal for providing citizens with one-stop access to federal services via the Internet or telephone. This is a key element of thePresident's vision for expanding electronic government (E-Gov). The E-Gov initiative will improvethe value of the federal government to its citizens, just as American industry has learned to usethe Internet to improve efficiency and customer service. Full implementation of the President'sE-Gov vision will also require cross-agency approaches that permit citizens, businesses, and state and local governments to easily obtain services from and electronically transact business with the federal government. The Administration's interagency Quicksilver E-Gov Task Force identified 23high priority Internet services for early development. Though best known for the services it provides other federal agencies, GSA operates two programs, the Federal Consumer Information Center (FCIC) and FirstGov, that provide the publicwith electronic access to federal and other government information and services. GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy includes several information technology support activities that were part of this E-Gov task force and whose continued involvement is essential to the success of the E-Govinitiatives. The President proposes to consolidate GSA resources involved in implementing thecitizen-centered aspects of the President's E-Gov vision into a new Office of Citizen Services.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 387 For 2003, the President also proposes $45 million for an E-Gov Fund to finance interagency E-Gov projects. Although a significant increase over the $20 million requested in 2002, this year's requestis supported by specific project plans developed by the Quicksilver Task Force. In 2003, GSA expects to provide its federal agency customers over $34 billion in office space, supplies and equipment, motor vehicles, telecommunications, information technology, and otheradministrative services. Agencies will reimburse GSA's revolving funds for $15 billion of thisamount and pay the remaining $19 billion directly to vendors under GSA's Multiple AwardSchedules contracts. The budget includes $6.9 billion in new obligational authority to providesecure, cost effective workplaces for over 1.1 million federal employees. Of this amount, over $135 million in additional funding is provided for increased guard services, building security equipment, and other security initiatives to ensure the safety of federal employees. Through its regulations and delegated property management and procurement activities, GSA influences an additional $70 billion in federal spending and the management of assets valued at $450billion. Although its agency customers reimburse GSA for almost all of its annual expenses, certainexpenses are funded by appropriations. In 2003, for example, the Administration proposes $551 million (net discretionary budget authority) for GSA, primarily for the construction and renovation of federal buildings. This amount also funds the Office of Government-wide Policy, the Office of CitizenServices, the Office of the Inspector General, and certain operating expenses related to propertydisposal, information technology security, and agency-wide management activities. INSTITUTE OF MUSEUM AND LIBRARY SERVICES The Administration continues to recognize the important role that libraries and museums play in the nation's education system and communities. The Institute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS) provides state grants and competitive awards to assist the nation's museums and libraries inexpanding their services to the public. Evaluations of IMLS's programs have shown them to have apositive effect on the operations of grantees. The budget increases funding for core IMLS programsand administrative support that benefit libraries and museums nationwide from $195 million to $211 million. It does not continue narrow, special-interest projects that were designated by the Congress for funding in 2002. The President's Budget proposes a $10 million initiative to recruit and train library professionals. In May 2000, Library Journal Magazine reported that 40 percent of librarians indicate they planto retire in nine years or less. According to the July 2000 Monthly Labor Review, 57 percent ofprofessional librarians were age 45 or older in 1998. To help recruit a new generation of librarians for the 21st Century, this initiative will provide scholarships to graduate students in library and information science, support distance learning technology for training programs in underservedareas, and recruit librarians with diverse language skills. IMLS's two offices, the Office of Museum Services and the Office of Library Services, receive their funding through two different appropriations bills. Having one agency receive fundingfrom two sources creates inordinate complexity for all parties involved. For simplicity's sake, the Administration recommends that funding for the entire agency come from the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations subcommittee. In addition to making grants, IMLS also undertakes a number of research and policy development activities. A recent example of its work includes a collaborative effort with the National ScienceFoundation to share complementary research information in digital library technology. The388 OTHER AGENCIES Administration believes that the establishment of the Museum and Library Services Act of 1996 has been successful, and recommends continued authorization of these programs. NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) safeguards records of all three branches of the federal government and ensures ready access to essential evidence that documentsthe rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the national experience. In 2003,the budget proposes $272 million for NARA. Of these resources, $2.3 million will enable NARA tocontinue leading the Electronic Records Management project. This effort will pilot government-wide procedures and tools for electronic records management and will pave the way toward solving the substantial challenge of preserving and providing access to the government's electronic records.To manage electronic records in the future, NARA also will gradually deploy components of theElectronic Records Archive. Moreover, NARA will complete installation of the Federal Register's electronic editing and publishing system. This system will accommodate digital signatures andelectronic submission of documents for Federal Register publications, as well as real-time revisions of the Code of Federal Regulations . NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SCIENCE The National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) was established in 1970 as the agency primarily responsible for assessing issues related to library and informationservices policy. With the creation of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the growth of the information science industry, issues that used to be the exclusive domain of NCLIS are now part of the mission of many other agencies. As noted earlier in this chapter, IMLS iscurrently involved in significant research and evaluation concerning museums and libraries. Whilethe Administration supports the nation's libraries, it does not support duplicative or ineffectiveagencies. NCLIS' products\u2014primarily reports on a wide variety of information issues\u2014have failedto have a significant impact on public policy. NCLIS does not operate programs; 100 percent of its funding has been for salaries, travel, and other expenses for its commissioners and staff. The Administration believes that other agencies can take on the responsibilities of NCLIS that continue to be necessary, such as compiling basic statistics on libraries. NCLIS' other activities havefailed to demonstrate that their results justify their cost. The budget recommends eliminating thisagency in 2003, saving taxpayers $1 million. NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) supports efforts to enhance the availability and appreciation of the arts. In 2003, NEA will promote hands-on art education programs for childrenfrom pre-school through grade 12. At the same time, NEA will support activities designed to fostera variety of arts endeavors, state and regional arts organizations, and efforts to expand the reachof the arts into America's underserved communities. The budget requests $117 million to carry out these activities, a slight increase over 2002.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 389 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) works to support educational and scholarly activities in the humanities, preserve America's cultural and intellectual resources, and provide opportunities for Americans to engage in lifelong learning in the humanities. In 2003, the budget requests $127 million for NEH to continue partnerships with state humanities councils, efforts topreserve brittle books and serials, the strengthening of humanities teaching, learning, and museumexhibitions, documentary media projects, and reading programs that reach popular audiences. NEHalso will enhance its efforts to collect, analyze, and disseminate information about the state of thehumanities. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regulates private-sector employer and union relations to minimize interruptions to commerce caused by strikes and worker-management discord.The NLRB supervises elections in which employees determine whether to be represented by aunion. It is also authorized to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by unions or employers. In 2003, the Board expects to receive 30,000 unfair labor practice cases and 6,000 representation cases. Fair and expeditious case resolution is the NLRB's highest priority. The agency is more effective when it can achieve a voluntary resolution of meritorious cases, thereby reducing the need fortime-consuming and costly litigation. The NLRB will continue its goal of settling 95 percent of itsunfair labor practice cases before they require a decision by the five-member Board. Through its performance goals, the NLRB will continue to place a high priority on reducing its case backlog, especially on the oldest pending cases. The 2003 Budget includes $246 million for the NLRB. In particular, the budget provides: $1 million for information technology to strengthen computer security; $1.3 million to finance licensingagreements to support software upgrades that will promote long-term savings; and $1.3 million tosupport an integrated administrative management system for budget, finance, personnel/payroll, and procurement. NATIONAL TRANSPORATION SAFETY BOARD The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is charged with determining the causes of transportation accidents and promoting transportation safety. The Board investigates accidents,conducts safety studies and issues recommendations, and evaluates the effectiveness of other government agencies in preventing transportation accidents. It also coordinates federal assistance to the families of victims of catastrophic domestic transportation accidents. The 2003 Budget provides $73 million for salaries and expenses for the NTSB to fulfill its role in improving the nation's transportation safety.390 OTHER AGENCIES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates nuclear material use in the United States. NRC's actions protect public health and safety, promote common defense and security, and guard the environment. NRC faces several challenges in the coming year. In light of the September 11thterrorist attacks, the NRC is conducting a top-to-bottom analysis of all aspects of the agency's safeguards and physicalsecurity programs. These programs set the standards for security that must be maintained byNRC licensees. The NRC uses such standards to evaluate the security and safeguards of regulatedf a c i l i t i e sa n dm a t e r i a l s . T h eN R Cm u s ta l s ob ep r e p a r e dt oe v a l u a t en e wr e a c t o rd e s i g n sa n dt o license the possible construction of new nuclear plants. The NRC will continue its preparations to review a potential application to construct a high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain,Nevada. The NRC will also review an increasing number of reactor license renewals to extend theuseful lives of existing nuclear reactors and power uprate applications to increase the reactors'electrical generating capacity. To carry out these and other activities of ongoing necessity, the budget proposes $605 million in 2003 for the NRC, a five percent increase over 2002. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides human resource management leadership to the President, federal agencies, and their employees. It oversees the federal civil service meritsystems and provides retirement, health benefit, and other insurance services to federal employees, annuitants, beneficiaries, and agencies. OPM is leading agencies in implementing the President's human capital initiative. This effort is designed to make government more citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based. OPM isworking closely with agencies to ensure that they strategically use the broad range of existing humanresources management tools to recruit, retain, and manage a high-performing workforce. To supportthis clear customer-focus, OPM itself has embarked on a significant agency restructuring. Total discretionary funding of $274 million in 2003 is almost evenly divided between OPM's two major missions: 1) managing and overseeing its government-wide human resources and 2)administering the federal employees benefits trust funds (retirement, health insurance, and lifeinsurance). It also includes $60 million for information technology projects and government-widepayroll modernization aimed at increasing efficiency and maximizing citizen service. Theseinitiatives will streamline and automate the exchange of federal personnel information, cut the cost and time to complete security clearances, deliver training services electronically, simplify federal job applications while reducing hiring times, make claims processing faster, cheaper, and moreaccurate, and modernize federal payroll systems and service delivery. In addition to the discretionary funding, OPM will pay out employee benefits totaling $79 billion in 2003: $53 billion in annuities to more than 2.4 million retired federal employees, their survivors,and other beneficiaries, $24 billion in health insurance for nine million enrollees and dependents; and $2 billion in life insurance claims. Beginning in 2003, OPM also will make group long-term care insurance products available to approximately 20 million members of the federal civilian anduniformed services, their families, and retirees.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 391 RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD The Railroad Retirement Board administers retirement, survivor, unemployment, and sickness insurance benefits for qualified railroad workers and their families. In 2003, it is estimated that $8.8 billion in retirement-survivor benefits will be paid to some 663,000 individuals, while about $124 million in unemployment and sickness benefits are estimated to be paid to some 37,000 persons. The railroad retirement system benefits are financed through railroad employer contributions, railroad employee payroll deductions, payments from the Social Security trust funds, and taxpayersubsidies. Unlike other private industry pension plans, the rail industry pension program is the onlyprivate industry pension subsidized by federal taxpayers and administered by a federal agency. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act increases benefits for railroad workers and their families, reduces employer taxes initially, and establishes a trust to invest therailroad pension fund assets in private equities. Currently, the pension fund confronts an unfundedliability of $39.7 billion, as measured by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act standards.Consequently, the effects of this law will need to be monitored closely to ensure the solvency of therailroad retirement pension fund. REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES The President's Budget requests funding for three regional economic development agencies: 1) the Appalachian Regional Commission ($66 million); 2) the Denali Commission ($41 million);and 3) the Delta Regional Authority ($10 million). These agencies provide grants to communitiesin designated geographic areas for public infrastructure, business development, education, and job training related to long-term economic development. The budget proposes that funding be focused on distressed communities and be used for projects that provide sustainable increasesin employment and economic activity. The Administration is working to develop comparableperformance measures for these agencies. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates U.S. capital markets and the securities industry. It strives to protect investors by preventing fraud and abuse in U.S. capitalmarkets and ensuring adequate disclosure of information. The SEC conducts compliance inspectionsand examinations in order to review and monitor the conduct and financial conditions of securitiesfirms and their affiliates. Today there are over 1,000 investment companies with $6.7 trillion in assets under management, more than double the amount of deposits at commercial banks. At the same time, there are over 7,000 investment advisors registered with the SEC. In 2001, the agency exceeded planned complianceinspections for investment companies. In 2003, the agency also will begin placing greater emphasison risk-based inspections in order to achieve the goal of conducting at least one examination of everyregistrant every five years. The 2003 Budget includes $481 million to carry out mission-critical activities, implement E-Gov initiatives, and respond to changes in the financial markets driven by global competition and technology.392 OTHER AGENCIES In January 2002, the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act was signed into law. The legislation reduces the rates of tax-like fees collected by the SEC on certain securities transactions.Enactment of the legislation is consistent with the Administration's efforts to invigorate free markets and reduce costs imposed on those markets by the government, while ensuring that the SEC will have the ability to continue to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the nation's securitiesmarkets. Without this legislation, the SEC would be collecting five times its annual budget in feeswithout any benefit to investors or the markets. The legislation also authorizes the SEC to provide additional compensation and benefits to employees if the same type of compensation or benefits are then being provided by any federal banking agency. This authority will be carried out by the executive branch in a manner that assists in the performance of the mission of the SEC while minimizing inequities with similarly situatedfederal employees. TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY Established in 1933 as an experiment to promote economic development and flood control management, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) today is a major U.S. government-owned corporation with two main roles. It is the fifth largest electric utility in the country, generating andselling electric power worth an estimated $7.3 billion in 2003 (about four percent of the nationwidetotal). It is also a natural resource management agency, with an annual operating budget of morethan $50 million, providing navigation, flood control, recreation, water supply and related servicesthroughout Tennessee and in six neighboring states. During 2003, TVA estimates it will spend $5.6 billion to produce power at its 11 coal-fired power plants, five nuclear units, and 30 hydropower facilities. TVA forecasts it will use $1.4 billion in 2003to upgrade the agency's power plants and expand its 17,000-mile high-voltage transmission system.The remaining $300 million TVA will use to reduce its outstanding debt, which stood at $25.4 billionat the end of 2001. Over the next five years, TVA estimates it will reduce its debt by $2.4 billion. TVA is reducing its debt to prepare the agency for the major changes now occurring in the electric power industry, where competition and restructured transmission systems are replacing integrated monopolies in existencesince the 1930s. TVA will work with the 158 municipal utilities and cooperatives that distribute TVA power to renegotiate current sales contracts and end its exclusive supply relationship with those entities.TVA will also work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, and other utilities to improve the nation's transmission system. The effort will include forming regional transmission organizations to reduce the cost and increase the reliability of the region's and thenation's power supply. TVA will continue to work with independent power producers to enable themto tie into TVA's transmission network. As a result, increased regional power supplies and enhanced competition will soon give TVA's distributors more power sources to choose from. TVA will also work with the municipal utilities and cooperatives that distribute its power to design and implement power-pricing policies, such as time-of-day pricing systems, that encourage cost-effective energy conservation.SUMMARY TABLES This set of Summary Tables corrects the omission of minus signs in this section of the Budget .

Estimates are not made for subsequent buybacks. 2A decrease in the Treasury operating cash balance (which is an asset) would be a means of financing a deficit and therefore has a positive sign. An increase in checks outstanding or deposit fund balances (which are liabilities) would also be a means of financing a deficit and therefore would also have a positive sign. 3Besides checks outstanding and deposit funds, includes accrued interest payable on Treasury debt, miscellaneous liability accounts, allocations of special drawing rights, and, as an offset, cash and monetary assets other than the Treasury operating cash balance, miscellaneous asset accounts, and profit on sale of gold. 4Consists primarily of Federal Financing Bank debt. 5Consists of unamortized discount (less premium) on public issues of Treasury notes and bonds (other than zero-coupon bonds) and unrealized discount on Government account series securities. 6The statutory debt limit is $5,950 billion. 7Treasury securities held by the public and zero-coupon bonds held by government accounts are almost all measured at sales price plus amortized discount or less amortized premium. Agency debt securities are almost all measured at face value. Treasury securities in the government accountseries are measured at face value less unrealized discount (if any). 8At the end of 2001, the Federal Reserve Banks held $534.1 billion of federal securities and the rest of the public held $2,785.9 billion. Debt held by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years.GLOSSARY Accrual Method of Measuring Cost Records cost when the liability is incurred. As applied to retirement benefits, cost is recorded when the benefits are earned rather than when they are paid or at some other time. Authorization An authorization is an act of Congress that establishes or continues a federal program or agency, and sets forth the guidelines to which it must adhere. Balanced Budget A balanced budget occurs when total receipts equal total outlays for a fiscal year. Budget Authority (BA) Budget authority is the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990 The BEA is the law that was designed to limit discretionary spending while ensuring that any new entitlement program or tax cuts did not increase deficits. It set annual limits on total discretionary spending and created pay-as-you-go rules for changes in entitlements and taxes. See Pay-As-You-Go and Cap. Budget Resolution The budget resolution is the annual framework that Congress uses to set targets for total spending, total revenues, and the deficit, as well as allocations, within the spendingtarget, for discretionary and mandatory spending. A budget resolution does not becomelaw and is not binding on the Executive Branch. Cap A \"cap'' is a legal limit on annual discretionary spending. See Discretionary Spending . Capital Planning and Investment Control A decision-making process for ensuring that information technology (IT) investments integrate strategic planning, budgeting, procurement, and the management of IT insupport of agency missions and business needs. 419420 GLOSSARY Clinger-Cohen Act The Clinger-Cohen Act is also known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996. The act supplements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 byestablishing a comprehensive approach for executive agencies to improve the acquisitionand management of their information resources. Competitive Sourcing Competitive sourcing is a management initiative to make government more market-based, allowing the public sector to embrace the principles of competition,innovation, and choice. It determines the most effective method of obtaining services available in the commercial marketplace. One commonly used process is found in OMB Circular A-76 and may result in a public-private competition or the conversion ofin-house work to the private sector. Deficit A deficit is the amount by which outlays exceed receipts in a fiscal year. Discretionary Spending Discretionary spending is what the President and Congress decide to spend through the 13 annual appropriations bills. Examples include money for such activities asthe FBI and the Coast Guard, housing and education, space exploration and highwayconstruction, and defense and foreign aid. See Mandatory Spending . E-Government E-Government refers to the federal government's use of information technologies (such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) to exchange informationand services with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. Enterprise Architecture Enterprise architecture is an agency-wide framework for incorporating business processes, information flows, applications, and infrastructure to support agency goals. Entitlement An entitlement program is one in which the federal government is legally obligated to make payments or provide aid to any person who meets the legal criteria for eligibility.Examples include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Food Stamps. FAIR Act The Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 requires federal agencies to submit annually to OMB an inventory of all activities performed by federal employees that are not inherently governmental in nature (i.e., that can be performed by the private sector). After OMB review, the agency must send a copy of the inventory to Congress andalso make it available to the public.THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 421 Federal Debt Debt Held by the Public \u2014The cumulative amount of money the federal government has borrowed from the public and not repaid. Debt Held by Government Accounts \u2014The debt Treasury owes to other accounts within the federal government. Most of it results from the surpluses of the SocialSecurity and other trust funds, which are required by law to be invested in federal securities. Debt Limit \u2014The maximum amount of federal securities debt that may legally be outstanding at any time. It includes both the debt held by the public and the debt heldby government accounts. When the debt limit is reached, the government cannot borrowmore money until the Congress has enacted a law to increase the limit. Fiscal Year The fiscal year is the federal government's accounting period. It begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. For example, fiscal year 2003 begins on October 1, 2002 and endson September 30, 2003. Full-time Equivalents (FTEs) Civilian employment in the Executive Branch is measured on the basis of full-time equivalents. One FTE is equal to one work year or 2,080 non-overtime hours. For example, one full-time employee counts as one FTE, and two half-time employees also count as one FTE. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) GDP is the standard measure of the size of the economy. It is the total production of goods and services within the United States. Human Capital Human capital refers to the education, knowledge, skills, and competencies of the personnel of an agency. Mandatory Spending Mandatory spending is authorized by permanent law rather than annual appropriations. An example is Social Security. The President and the Congress can change the law tochange the eligibility criteria and thus the level of spending on mandatory programs,but they don't have to take annual action to ensure the continuation of spending. SeeDiscretionary Spending . Offsetting Collections and Offsetting Receipts Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are monies that are deducted from outlays, rather than counted on the receipts side of the budget. They are often paid in returnfor providing goods or services. For example, payments the Postal Service receives for stamps are offsetting collections.422 GLOSSARY Off-Budget By law certain programs, such as Social Security and the Postal Services, are accounted for separately from all other programs in government and are accorded this separatetreatment. On-Budget Those programs not legally designated as off-budget. Outlays Outlays are the amount of money the government actually spends in a given fiscal year. Pay-As-You-Go Created by the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA), pay-as-you-go refers to requirements that new mandatory spending proposals or tax reductions must be offset by cuts in othermandatory spending or by tax increases, to ensure that the deficit does not rise or thesurplus does not fall. See Budget Enforcement Act . Performance-based Budgeting Performance-based budgeting separates programs that work from those that do not. It allocates budgetary and human capital resources by comparing historical and expectedfuture performance levels with the full cost of producing desired program outcomes asdefined in the agency's strategic goals and objectives. Receipts Receipts are the collections of money that result from taxes and other government activity. Examples of receipts include income taxes, excise taxes, and customs duties. They do not include collections from the federal government's business-like activities, such as the entrance fees at national parks. Business-like collections are subtractedfrom total spending to calculate outlays for the year. Surplus A surplus is the amount by which receipts exceed outlays in a fiscal year. Trust Funds Trust funds are federal government accounts set up by law to record receipts and spend them for specified purposes. Unified Budget The unified budget includes receipts from all sources and outlays for all programs of the federal government. It is the most comprehensive display of the government's finances.OMB CONTRIBUTORS TO THE 2003 BUDGET The following personnel contributed to the preparation of this publication.
