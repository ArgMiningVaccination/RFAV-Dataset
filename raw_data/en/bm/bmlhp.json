Though you may be aware of acupuncture as an existing treatment at Tannenbaum Chiropractic of Beverly Hills, there are a few things you should know about the procedure in regard to its accessibility, effectiveness, and the treatment itself. Read on to learn more about how and why implementing acupuncture treatments into your regular chiropractic care visits may be right for you! 1. Acupuncture treats more than pain The most common reason people receive acupuncture treatments may be for pain relief, but that is not the only problem acupuncture can help resolve. The list of proven improved health benefits from regular acupuncture treatments include: - Depression and anxiety - Athletic injuries - Gastritis and other digestive issues - Adverse reactions to chemotherapy treatments - Seasonal allergies - Postpartum healing - Facial pain, including from dental issues and TMJ - Hypertension and hypotension - Sciatica - Headaches and chronic migraines - Labor induction - Other discomforts caused by pregnancy - Nausea - Ulcers - Arthritis - Stroke - Surgery recovery - Insomnia - Pediatric medicine - Weight Loss 2. Acupuncture is backed by the World Health Organization and National Institute of Health WHO is an agency of the United Nations that focuses on international health. As such, WHO recognizes and advocates for accessible health treatments beyond western medicine procedures. Because acupuncture is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and widely practiced in other parts of the world, it is a popular medicinal treatment for people globally, and there is ample empirical evidence of its success as a result. 3. Acupuncture has been in practice for over 3,000 years The history of acupuncture treatments and holistic practices dates back to ancient China, with millenniums of professional acupuncturists perfecting the craft. Acupuncture operates within the ancient Chinese belief system that energy flows throughout the body\u2014this understanding of energy flow and its connection to the body's whole body wellness runs parallel to chiropractic studies of the central nervous system and its role in nerve communication and body function. In short, when our energy receptors are interrupted or blocked, physical, mental, and even emotional imbalances occur. Acupuncture is a method to clear these blockages, based on thousands of years of studying acupuncture points that allow energy (and blood and oxygen) flow throughout the body naturally as a method of holistic, natural healing. 4. Acupuncture treatments are covered by some health insurance plans While Medicaid/Medicare has yet to include alternative medicine within their covered care, many larger private insurances have become privy to the benefits of acupuncture treatments and do. This usually does depend on the reason for your acupuncture visit\u2014health issues such as chronic pain, nausea, migraines, and pregnancy symptoms are more likely to be covered. Check with your insurance provider to learn about your options! 5. Acupuncture does not hurt\u2014and the treatment sessions are fast Despite the use of needles, acupuncture treatments are said to be a relaxing experience. The needles used are as fine as human hairs, and only inserted into the skin \u00bd - \u00bc an inch. A tingling, but pleasant feeling is often said to be felt at the point of insertion, with an overall experience comparison to a deep tissue massage. It is also quite fast\u2014the average acupuncture treatment generally only takes about thirty minutes. 6. Acupuncture is just one treatment under the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) umbrella Also referred to as Eastern Asian Medicine (EAM), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) encompasses a variety of modalities for holistic health treatments. While acupuncture is gaining traction in the U.S. most recently, there are other facets of TCM such as herbal medicine, Chinese medical massage, cupping, and heat therapy. Overall, TCM treatments seek to restore balance in the body naturally by approaching the body both holistically, as well as on a personal level. 7. Acupuncture requires a series of visits Just like regular chiropractic care visits are necessary to maintain your overall health, your first acupuncture treatment is not going to be a one-time-cure-all visit. Acupuncture works best with a full assessment, followed by a personal treatment plan that will include a series of consistent visits. Like physical therapy, the more chronic or serious the condition, the more visits you will likely need. Your wellness approach may call for multiple visits per week, or once a week depending on your individual circumstance. Natural approaches to wellness such as Traditional Chinese Medicine take time to see progress, and are also dependent on the patients age, condition, and lifestyle. 8. Acupuncturists are highly trained Like chiropractors, acupuncturists are specialists in the medical field that require rigorous study, practice, and accountability as medical professionals.
