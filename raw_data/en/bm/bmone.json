The approach we use is based on our judgment and years of experience. The primary adjusting techniques we use include: Diversified Technique At Erickson Healing Arts, we may incorporate an adjusting style commonly referred to as \"Diversified.\" After examination and palpation, we will identify the malposition of spinal bones, and a specific manual adjustment is made. The direction, speed, depth and angle that are used is the result of years of experience, practice and a thorough understanding of spinal mechanics. A diversified adjustment improves spinal biomechanics and reduces interference with the nervous system. Virtually all joints of the body can be adjusted to help restore proper range of motion, alignment, and neurological homeostasis. SOT stands for Sacro Occipital Technique, a chiropractic technique designed to help normalize the relationship between the pelvis and the head. The Foundation We are especially interested in the \"tone\" of your body, which is reflected in the tightness of your spinal cord. The integrity of the spine, and the function of the nervous system it protects, begins with the pelvis. This foundation is constantly subjected to the pull of gravity. When stability is lost, it produces effects throughout your body. The Cranium Proper control of every cell and tissue of your body is affected by bones of the skull and tension on your spinal cord. Think of your spinal cord as a string on a harp. Is it flexible and healthy? Or stretched and drawn tight? Blocking the Spine We use wedge-shaped devices known as \"blocks\" to help correct your spine and properly \"tune\" your nervous system. By knowing exactly where to position these blocks, we use the weight of your body to make corrections, naturally. Safe and Comfortable By using gravity and your own body to effect correction, new healthier patterns of spinal function can result. Along with safe, consistent results, SOT is known for emphasizing patient comfort. A lack of health indicates a chemical, mental or structural imbalance. Applied Kinesiology borrows from many different disciplines, using muscle testing as a guide for diagnosis and patient care. The ancient Chinese observed that every muscle in the body links to a specific organ, gland or acupuncture meridian. By testing the strength of its related muscle, we get a glimpse of the condition of that particular organ or tissue. Simple muscle testing helps us uncover the structural, chemical and mental problem that may be in your body. It can also direct us to the best options to restore your health. Finding the Problem First, we review the history of your health situation. This is followed by a thorough physical examination. Instrumentation and laboratory tests may be needed. Then we analyze your posture, the way you walk, turn and bend. By combining these findings with muscle testing, we develop a unique insight into the cause(s) of your problem. Testing various muscles of the body (one of your arms is convenient) helps reveal underlying health issues when the muscle goes weak. Resolving the Problem With an understanding of your problem, we select from a variety of healing modalities, which may include: Chiropractic adjustments Joint mobilization Acupuncture meridian therapy Nutrition supplementation Osteopathic cranial techniques Muscle rehabilitation As the discipline of Applied Kinesiology has been refined, it has broadened to include the evaluation of vascular, lymphatic systems and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. CranioSacral Therapy is a full body gentle healing technique that releases restrictions in the soft tissues that surround the central nervous system. The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by membranes and fluid that surround, protect and nourish the brain and spinal cord. Stress and strains can interfere with the healthy performance of the central nervous system and the body as a whole. Normalizing the environment around the brain and spinal cord enhances the body's ability to self-correct and alleviate a wide variety of conditions. CranioSacral Therapy can be profoundly relaxing. We have excellent results using craniosacral therapy on patients with headaches and migraines, TMJ, fibromyalgia, stress, neck and back pain, chronic sinusitis, and brain and spinal cord injuries. Craniosacral Therapy is also effective for infant and childhood issues like birth trauma, nursing difficulties, colic and reflux, chronic recurrent ear infections, ADD/ADHD, PDD, and childhood injuries. Chiropractic Care During Pregnancy and Beyond Dr. Erickson is certified in Webster Technique which is a and gentle and effective chiropractic analysis and treatment during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the body goes through structural and physiological changes which can be supported by chiropractic care. As the pregnancy progresses, sacral misalignment may cause the tightening and torsion of specific pelvic muscles and ligaments. It is these tense muscles and ligaments and their aberrant effect on the uterus which may prevent the baby from comfortably assuming the best possible position for birth. The Obstetric literature has determined that correct positioning of the baby in-utero affects birth outcome and decreases the potential for undue stress to the baby's developing spine and nerve system. Obstetric literature has also determined the importance of pelvic neuro-biomechanics for the prevention of dystocia (difficult birth). Chiropractic literature has determined the significance of sacral adjusting in normalizing pelvic neuro-biomenchanics, which helps allow the baby to assume the best position for birth as well as decreasing labor time. Regular chiropractic care during pregnancy and after the child is born supports maternal and infant health during this miraculous time. Chiropractic For Infants, Children, and Adolescents Dr. Erickson uses an integrated approach including chiropractic cranial-sacral therapy, diet, homeopathy, and essential oils to treat [infants, children and adolescents](/pediatric-chiropractic/). The techniques we use are gentle, safe, and effective at maintaining health and wellness as well as treating a wide variety of conditions. A partial list of pediatric conditions we treat are listed in the [Conditions we Treat.](https://www.ericksonhealingarts.com/conditions-we-treat/) Other Techniques used: Cold Laser/ Low Level Light Therapy Cold laser therapy is a non invasive therapy that uses light at wavelengths that do not produce heat to promote healing. We have had excellent results treating patients with Cold Laser who suffer from neck and back pain, muscle soreness, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, rotator cuff tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and TMJ. Massage Therapy Dr. Erickson incorporate massage therapy into all sessions. Massage therapy melts away stress and tension, improves blood and lymphatic circulation, and reduces pain, complimenting chiropractic. It is effective in relieving stress, headaches, neck pain, back pain and muscle tightness. Myofascial Release Myofascial Release is a bodywork technique that restores normal function to the connective tissue that covers every muscle and organ in your body. Dr. Erickson incorporates this soft tissue technique into sessions to make chiropractic adjustments more effective. Mind Body The mind is a powerful way to heal the body and bodywork is a powerful way to heal the mind. Dr. Erickson may incorporate mind-body techniques into your care including breathing exercises, meditation, yoga and mindfulness. Nutrition Nutrition is a powerful way to heal your physiology. Proper macro-nutrients ( what's on your plate) and proper micro-nutrients (vitamins, minerals, and enzymes) help your body decrease pain and inflammation, recover from stress, improve digestion and immunity, and increase mental clarity and sense of well-being. Dr. Erickson may suggest modifications in your diet or recommend supplements to enhance your recovery and well-being. Exercise Everything we can measure medically is improved by exercise whether its cholesterol, bone density, body mass index or cognitive function. Dr. Erickson will recommend exercises appropriate for your body that incorporate strength, flexibility, and endurance drawing from resources as varied as the gym, yoga, Pilates and Central Park. Essential Oils and Aromatherapy Dr. Erickson incorporates therapeutic grade essential oils into sessions to reduce inflammation, decrease pain, improve circulation, and promote profound relaxation. Using scent stimulates important brain structures that promote physiological homeostasis and sense of well being. In addition to using essential oils in the office setting, Dr. Erickson may recommend that patients use specific essential oils at home to promote healing.
