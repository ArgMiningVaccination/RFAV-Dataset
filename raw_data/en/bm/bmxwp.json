Drs. Trzeciak and Mazzarelli published Compassionomics in 2019, a meta-analysis of over 200 studies on compassion in healthcare, concluding definitively: \"Compassion matters not only in meaningful ways, but also in measurable ways\" and that compassion \"belongs in the domain of evidence-based medicine.\" The concluding chapter is titled simply: \"Compassion as an Antidote to Burnout.\" CBCT\u00ae (Cognitively Based Compassion Training) offers a comprehensive method for training compassion that draws on the ancient lojong tradition of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Its approach is supported by current scientific research in fields such as evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience. Since 2014 CBCT has been offered each semester to Emory School of Medicine faculty, staff, and students. A randomized control study by Professor Jennifer Mascaro, PhD, found that CBCT significantly correlated with increased compassion and decreases in loneliness and depression in second year medical students. Over the years, a number of outstanding physicians have become certified CBCT Teachers and have taught at the Emory School of Medicine, including Ellen Coggeshall, Stephen Blount, Charles Lane '23, and most recently William J. Eley, Executive Dean of Education. Registration is open for the 8-Week Fall 2023 CBCT for Emory SOM Courses, free for all those associated with the SOM: The course for faculty and staff will meet from 5:30 - 6:45pm on Wednesdays from September 20 - November 8, 2023. Taught by course developer Professor Lobsang Tenzin Negi, PhD, and Dr. Eley. The course for students has two options: All courses are held in person at the School of Medicine.

This has created compassionate leaders at every level, from the security guards at the point of entry to the hospital manager.\" Improving the healthcare system is part of India's larger goal to become a developed nation by 2047. This report confirms what we all know at heart - that compassion is integral to delivering quality services respectfully and making them available, affordable, and accessible.

May 10, 2023 Honoring Nobility Compassion illumines the path to freedom for a soul seeking the embrace of a soft and gentle peace. Recently I signed a form declaring my intention to bequeath assets. They are to be dedicated to CBCT\u00ae (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training), a facet of Emory's Center for Contemplative Science and Compassion-Based Ethics. What does that have to do with honoring nobility? To begin, those dedicated funds are there in large part because my father had a strong work ethic and a desire to care for my mother when he died. After he died, my mother was a good steward of those resources. And generous, too. Her heartfelt desire was to protect them so that she could pass them on to me and my sister for our well-being. And I'm able to protect them. My life has been blessed with the generosity of others besides my mother. Their acts of kindness have contributed to a financial stability that allows me to leave my invested assets untouched. As I approach the end of my life, I'm seeking further stewardship of those funds. Here's where trust rides on nobility. I've come to know Dr. Lobsang Tenzin Negi, Timothy Harrison, and others who are a part of advancing CBCT for a safer, kinder world. I've observed their devoted efforts to uphold ethical and moral principles themselves and to teach mind-training techniques that foster the development of those noble character traits, contributing to human thriving. Compassion illumines the path to freedom for a soul seeking the embrace of a soft and gentle peace. While taking CBCT myself, I faced my own suffering from the effects of eight years of chronic, debilitating Lyme disease. While engaging with my own intense emotional pain, I came to understand the suffering of others. And I yearned to ease their pain. I bow to the soundness of the CBCT process as an agent of positive change, and one our world needs for survival. We humans cannot commit atrocities if we can feel empathy and compassion for others. I bow to those who do the work at Emory's Center for Contemplative Science and Compassion-Based Ethics. I trust them to steward my family's funds, serving humanity with wise and loving hearts. I trust them and those who come after them to be my hands when mine can no longer do the work of making this world a better place to be. While ending my remarks about legacy making, my mother's smile brightens my face. I feel heartfelt gratitude for the opportunity to be generous. And for the opportunity to honor the nobility of all of the people and circumstances that make that possible.

April 28, 2023 The Torch and Trumpet Award was presented to Executive Director Lobsang Tenzin Negi The Torch and Trumpet Award was presented to Executive Director Lobsang Tenzin Negi, PhD, at the opening session of the Science on Spirituality Symposium by George Grant, MDiv, PhD, Executive Director of Spiritual Health and co-director and co-founder of the Emory Center for Psychedelics and Spirituality. Spiritual Health at Emory Healthcare is a longtime partner with CBCT in the creation of the research-based chaplaincy program, [Compassion-Centered Spiritual Health](https://ccsh.emory.edu/). Dr. Negi's work with CBCT began with the seed planted by His Holiness the Dalai Lama during a visit to Emory University in 1998. Addressing the graduating class, the Dalai Lama said, \"Education is the way to achieve far-reaching results; it is the proper way to promote compassion and tolerance in society.\" This visit to Emory by His Holiness led to the creation of the Emory-Tibet Partnership, now called the Center for Contemplative Science and Compassion-Based Ethics. A few years later, it was one of Dr. Negi's students who encouraged him to begin a mediation practice for Emory students and the community. CBCT developed soon into a research-based meditation protocol. Since those early days, CBCT has grown into an international discipline, translated in many languages, taught in numerous countries, and is one of the most researched compassion training protocols today. CBCT has been offered for many years to faculty, staff, and students at the Emory School of Medicine and for continuing nursing education credit through the Emory Nursing Experience. CBCT is also central to the training of chaplains in Emory's pioneering Compassion-Centered Spiritual Health program, active now in all twelve of the Emory hospitals and at Grady Hospital in downtown Atlanta. Dr. Negi regularly teaches the CBCT Foundation Course to in person and online to a worldwide audience. A former monk, Negi began his monastic training at the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics in Dharamasala, India, and continued his education at Drepung Loseling Monastery in south India, where in 1994 he received the Geshe Lharampa degree - the highest academic degree granted in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Dr. Negi completed his PhD at Emory University in 1999; his interdisciplinary dissertation centered on traditional Buddhist and contemporary Western approaches to emotions and their impact on wellness. His current research focuses on the complementarity of modern science and contemplative practice.

It is comforting to know that there are a growing number of people inspired and excited in cultivating a good heart to make the world a more nurturing and kinder place to live.\" Edgar holds a Doctor in Psychology from Valencia International University in Spain and is especially interested in implementing CBCT\u00ae for individuals who have experienced psychological trauma, adapting the resources of contemplative science to modern psychology and neuropsychology, and investigating the role of contemplative practices as a resource for preventing psychopathology. His current research at the Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas Puebla (UDLAP) in Mexico includes collaboration with the World Health Organization, adapting tools and resources to evaluate and address the health implications in adulthood of adverse childhood experiences. Edgar is lead author of the 2018 article: \" [Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Clinical Trial Stud](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1177%2F1534735418772095&data=05%7C01%7Csgoard%40emory.edu%7Cc1237397eee0447de3b408db1a706bbd%7Ce004fb9cb0a4424fbcd0322606d5df38%7C0%7C0%7C638132842361124993%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3qg2%2Fvz1JzQQS%2FXfSRBU1KfpXizAL61ZpdpKK5hyC2M%3D&reserved=0)y,\" published in the journal Integrative Cancer Therapies. Based on this research, he co-edited the 2021 book, Hero\u00ednas compasivas. La Heroines: Life as Breast Cancer Survivors] with Rebeca Diego Pedro and Lobsang Tenzin Negi, developer of CBCT\u00ae. This book provides a fictionalized account of Esperanza, a woman struggling with cancer, as she experiences the full sequence of CBCT's training exercises. The book explores the resilience, self-compassion, and sense of purpose that can emerge through compassion training, and it provides encouragement and hope to cancer survivors and their caregivers, as well as to clinicians, counselors, psychologists, and meditation practitioners who work with serious illness in any form. As happy as we are to welcome Edgar to this role, the occasion is tinged with sadness as we continue to grieve the passing of our dear friend and collaborator, Samuel Fernandez-Carriba, PhD. This program would not be what it is today without the skill, intelligence, and exuberant energy of Samuel, who pioneered the Spanish-speaking CBCT Teacher Certification program from its early planning stages in 2018 all the way through to late 2022 when a third encounter with cancer took his life. The Center intends to honor his legacy by carrying on his vision for spreading the practice of compassion and compassion training with enthusiasm and hope, especially on the Spanish-speaking international stage. For those interested in the Spanish-speaking CBCT\u00ae Teacher Certification program, please reach out to us to let us know. The start date of the next cohort is not yet determined, but we are gathering names and we can connect you with Edgar if you would like to learn more. The English-speaking CBCT\u00ae Teacher Certification Program is currently accepting applications for a new cohort starting in June 2023. The program can be attended entirely online and has included individuals from all over the US and from Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.

A recently published paper in The Journal of Nursing Administration reported promising outcomes of the \"Compassion & Growth Workshop,\" a new virtual intervention aimed at frontline nurses across the US during the pandemic. Covering the topics of grounding, nurturance, and growth, the workshop drew on CBCT\u00ae along with other contemplative interventions to provide six hours of interactive training. CBCT\u00ae Senior Instructors Timothy Harrison, Associate Director for CBCT\u00ae, and Michelle Heker Liberman, Instructional Content Developer, consulted on the intervention design, along with CBCT\u00ae Instructor Deborah Disney, LCPC. Harrison co-authored the paper, and Liberman and Disney co-taught the sessions on nurturance. Through trauma-informed education and exercises combining emotional awareness with visualization, the nurses participating in the study learned skills to improve self-regulation, implement cognitive reframing strategies, and infuse compassion more intentionally into their daily lives. Visit the [CBCT research page](https://compassion.emory.edu/cbct-compassion-training/research.html) to learn more about the research. December 8, 2022 The next Teacher Certification starts in June 2023. For more information, click [here](https://compassion.emory.edu/cbct-compassion-training/certified-teachers/index.html). Alessandra Arce Hai 2022 cohort member Alessandra Arce Hai (Brazil) with a background in Education shares her perspective. \"These first two phases of the CBCT\u00ae Teacher Certification were a wonderful and challenging experience for me. Every text, discussion, and orientation broadened my perspective about others and all living creatures on the planet, including myself. It challenged my old assumptions and ideas, transforming and transmuting it in a new form of seeing, feeling, and acting. CBCT\u00ae brought to me a holistic approach where science, ethics and spirituality are connected and intertwined in an inclusive and altruistic way.\" George Brooks 2022 cohort member George Brooks (New York, US) with a background in Business shares his perspective. \"This was the first program I have seen that provides a concise framework for the development of one's practice in compassion. I learned about the conditions that allow compassion to emerge and how to use discernment to practice smart compassion. Interestingly, each module and each step are a needed aid that helps us regain our own mental clarity, resilience, and personal wellness. You can only give what you have. And once you fortify yourself with mental clarity, resilience, and self-compassion, you can then proceed to practice the steps to open yourself up to expand your circle of care to common humanity.\" After completion of the Teacher Certification program, George intends to continue to work with the Emory Compassion Center to bridge the CBCT\u00ae program into business. \"Our initial research has shown that the infusion of compassion into business provides tremendous value to employees, customers, our communities, shareholders and extends to the preservation of the planet.\" Fran\u00e7oise Gallet 2022 cohort member Fran\u00e7oise Gallet (South Africa) with a background as a coach and facilitator in the field of human and organizational development shares her perspective. \"Given the times we live in, I can't think of a more relevant and necessary training for compassionately shifting how we engage and relate to ourselves, others, and the systems we live in. Therefore, it is a huge privilege to be part of a growing global network of CBCT teachers seeding such skills in business, healthcare, schools and among individuals.\" For anyone considering applying to be in the 2023 cohort, Fran\u00e7oise noted, \"The course workload is very demanding on the working professional. In South Africa, the Afrikaans term 'vasbyt' means 'bite hard.' In certain ways, it references the English idiom 'put your head down.' Except when you 'vasbyt' in South Africa, your eyes are wide open and you can fully taste your experience - your focus or 'bite' is strong, but you are not shutting out aspects of your experience. Stepping fully into the rigor of the training and deeply grappling with it all has value. My advice to future participants: sign up and 'vasbyt.'\" Raymond Walker, III 2022 cohort member Raymond Walker, III, M.Div., BCC, CCSH-RC (Georgia, US) shares his perspective as a Chaplain. \"After completing the program, I am most looking forward to witnessing the \"Aha!\" moments experienced by participants in a CBCT\u00ae course where I am their Certified Teacher! Further, I would love to utilize what I have learned in the healthcare context with decision-makers and people in \"upper-level\" management. I believe some compassion reflection might be of good use in that context. Lastly, \"if you are considering applying to be in next year's cohort, you are halfway there. Whatever is keeping you from traveling the other half, consider bringing it with you and sharing it with the facilitators and/or cohort - likely someone else has overcome or is in the process of overcoming it as well.\" Novermber 4, 2022 Researchers to Test Compassion Meditation to Improve Health for Breast Cancer Survivors and Their Partners The Breast Cancer Survivors and Partners Online Research Together (SUPORT) Project incorporates contemplative meditation exercises over Zoom designed to strengthen and sustain compassion, while increasing emotional awareness. A team of researchers at the University of Arizona College of Nursing were recently awarded a grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effectiveness of compassion meditation to reduce stress and anxiety for breast cancer survivors and their supportive partners. Evidence suggests that breast cancer survivors often experience increased anxiety, stress, fatigue, and social isolation many years after the end of their cancer treatments. Family members who live with breast cancer survivors such as husbands, wives, significant others, partners, and adult children also experience similar quality of life changes. Unlike other meditation programs that focus solely on mindfulness, CBCT\u00ae (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) is focused on how an individual interconnects with other people, building an ethos of compassion and well-being for you and for others. \"The idea for this project came from our earlier work with Cognitively-Based Compassion Training with breast cancer survivors several years ago,\" said principal investigator Thaddeus Pace, PhD. \"Folks on our team, including Dr. Terry Badger, have studied how supportive partners are very important for the well-being of cancer survivors, so we wanted to expand our use of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for both survivors and partners together.\" While previous studies utilizing meditation have been done in-person, the pandemic inspired Dr. Pace and his colleagues at the University of Arizona to look at a new model utilizing video conferencing systems like Zoom to greatly expand access to CBCT. \"The pandemic has made everyone more comfortable with using systems like Zoom,\" Dr. Pace said. \"And we started to think it would be really interesting to create a program through Zoom. We conducted a pilot study with survivors and partners that worked relatively well, so now this project is a continuation of that on a larger scale, allowing survivors and supportive partners to participate coast to coast.\" \"The pandemic posed the great challenge of learning how to successfully deliver compassion training online,\" said Dr. Lobsang Tenzin Negi, Executive Director of the Center for Contemplative Science and Compassion-Based Ethics at Emory University. \"What started as a challenge quickly became a blessing. We have been able to share on a larger scale and offer to more people than ever before. Collaborating with the University of Arizona on this novel research project will allow us to combine new insights with previous studies and learn even more about how to benefit cancer survivors and the supportive partners.\" Participants will be grouped in either online CBCT classes or online Cancer Health Education classes that will function very similarly to an online group Yoga or exercise classes. Survivors and their supportive partners can participate from anywhere so long as they have an internet connection, a computer or tablet with a twelve inch or larger screen and can commit to the weekly courses for the 10-week program. \"There's neuroscience research that shows that people who meditate over time can actually change their brains and the way their minds work,\" said Dr. Pace. \"CBCT in particular may be really ideal for improving survivors and supportive partners [in] distress because of the way it may change how their minds work, especially in challenging and stressful situation[s] that we all encounter in our social world.\" This research is supported by the National Cancer Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health (R01 CA264047).

Between March 2020 and February 2022, Holy Cross Health (Holy Cross Hospital, Holy Cross Germantown Hospital, and Holy Cross Health Network) cared for over 8,000 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and attended over 800 COVID-19 deaths. This speaks to the level of strength, resilience, and compassion of its staff and providers. Holy Cross Health was excellent at offering compassionate care to others, but what about the needs of their staff and the medical professionals serving those patients? To celebrate their dedication, Father Kirtley Yearwood commissioned two Broadway dancers to create a video to be shown throughout the Holy Cross Health system as a means of encouraging self-compassion and promoting well-being among the staff, providers, and contracted healthcare professionals. The team responsible for this video includes Kamille Upshaw, who was the Dance Captain for Broadway's, \"MJ The Musical\" and a swing dancer in \"Hamilton,\" among other major productions. Chanel DaSilva is a choreographer for The Joffrey Ballet and a co-founder of MoveNYC. These two Julliard-trained professionals created and filmed \"A Time of Stillness: A Dance of Compassion\" on location at the Holy Cross hospitals. It is an interpretive dance that draws from the insights of CBCT\u00ae (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) as a grace-filled offering of love that expresses and acknowledges key moments in caring for COVID-19 patients. Further, it is meant to support staff and providers to be open to practicing kindness and gentleness toward self. \"A Time of Stillness: A Dance of Compassion\" premiered at Holy Cross Health on Friday, March 4, 2022 on the second anniversary of Holy Cross diagnosing the first COVID-19 patient in the State of Maryland. The ceremony was officiated by His Eminence Wilton Cardinal Gregory, Archbishop of Washington.

[Public CBCT\u00ae Courses and Continuing Education | CBCT\u00ae Compassion Training - Emory University ](https://compassion.emory.edu/cbct-compassion-training/cbct-courses/public.html) June 28, 2022 Can CBCT\u00ae Unlock Your Superpower? \"Blaming someone else has always been one of my defense mechanisms and a way of avoiding taking responsibility for my life. I didn't mess myself up, right? Why should I have to take responsibility for fixing myself?! Honestly, that is the way I thought for the greater part of fifty years - until I was introduced to Cognitive Based Compassion Training (CBCT) through Emory Healthcare in my first unit of Clinical Pastoral Education. In our class we first experienced compassion towards self by learning to recognize nurturing moments that take place throughout our day and feel the resulting kindness in ourselves. As we consciously drank that in more and more of this kindness and compassion, we were more easily able to pour it out to those we care for. This awareness opened a world that I didn't trust existed, instead of being defensive I started to feel relaxed and happy. It also became easier for me to catch a negative thought or feeling and calm it or release it before acting on it. CBCT reminded me of the gap that exists between thought and action and that space is where our freedom lies. I had a tough day at the hospital and even though I gave up drinking, I was planning a drink on the way home, where I was going to stop, what it was going to taste like, and how relaxed and good I was going to feel afterwards. Then I remembered that this was just a feeling and I wondered what was behind it? I realized that I was frustrated because I felt like I had not accomplished anything that day. As soon as I put the realization and the feeling together, my \"need\" to drink disappeared. Another day I was at the dentist and feeling a bit stressed which was reflected when the hygienist took my blood pressure, and it was sky high. A week later, I returned to the dentist, and I remembered to take myself to a nurturing moment in my mind, which I did, and my blood pressure was 35 points lower than it was the prior week! The following day I was outside feeding the birds and admiring and feeling grateful for the beautiful day, really being present, and Spirit told me that I had found my Superpower through CBCT. It was a YES! Moment. I couldn't wait to tell my husband. I have this superpower within myself, and it doesn't matter what happens outside because I am the one deciding my response. It gives me a wonderful sense of agency, of overseeing my feelings and not being pushed around my circumstances. Most importantly, it aligns me with Spirit. Another aspect of the training is expanding our compassion to all beings by picturing them as able to become happy. The first time that I did the exercise, I pictured a man that used to work for me that I never did like very well. I was able to picture him happy but hadn't thought about him again. Yesterday, Spirit set me up. I saw the man at the grocery store across from my office and actually hoped that he would stop in and see me. I would never have felt that tenderness towards him before doing the exercise! I never needed \"fixing,\" I just needed to experience love and compassion, and find it within myself. I am in control of my well-being and as a result, I am able to give from a glad heart. That's my superpower and the realization of this gift makes me cry.\" ~ Katrina Andrews, who took an introduction to CBCT\u00ae as a chaplain intern at Emory.

The program, called Atlanta's Resiliency Resource fOr Frontline Workers (ARROW), is designed to build resiliency and strengthen resolve among clinicians, police, and public safety officers. In partnership with Emory University School of Nursing, Grady Health System, and Emory University and Health System Police and Public Safety Departments, ARROW will offer comprehensive resources for resiliency enrichment, training, and professional development for both practicing and student nurses, physicians, and public safety personnel. The aim is to increase the number of frontline workers trained and certified in CBCT\u00ae (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) and in CRM\u00ae (Community Resiliency Model) to reduce, address, and prevent burnout, mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and suicide. ARROW targets workers across the 29-county Atlanta metropolitan statistical area. April 23, 2022 Have you taken the CBCT\u00ae Foundation Course? Are you interested in joining a community of practitioners skillfully sharing CBCT with others? The CBCT Teacher Certification Program application deadline has been extended to May 15. We are accepting a new cohort of experienced and eager practitioners. This high-quality training is designed for those wishing to share CBCT in their community or in research settings. A series of retreats, workshops, and coaching sessions held over several months will provide a thorough understanding of the CBCT rationale and its core content, as well as the skills to expertly lead adult learning groups and guide meditations. This June, in collaboration with Tibethaus in Germany, we will have our first German-speaking group to begin the teacher training. Other past participants have come from diverse backgrounds and locations including the U.S., Brazil, Chile, France, Israel, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.

January 26, 2022 New Research on CBCT \u00ae for HIV+ Patients We spoke recently with Boghuma K. Titanji, MD, PhD and her research partners about their new study, \"Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for HIV Immune Non-responders - An Attention-Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial,\" published in [JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes: December 7, 2021.](https://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/9000/Cognitively_Based_Compassion_Training_for_HIV.95752.aspx) Here is what they reported: \"Non-pharmacologic interventions can play an important role in reducing inflammation related to HIV-infection and should be studied. Inflammation is responsible for all of the serious diseases that reduce quality of life and longevity. In our study we demonstrated both the feasibility and potential benefit of cognitively based compassion training for people with HIV infection who have had difficulty in recovering their immune system after treatment. \"We found a significant association between CBCT \u00ae practice time engagement and a reduction in important markers of inflammation. These changes were coincident with significant increases in self-reported psychological well-being and HIV disease acceptance and benefits for CBCT \u00ae participants. \"CBCT \u00ae is a novel and feasible non-medication-based intervention that could reduce inflammation and psychological stress in people with HIV. We hope to explore this approach in larger studies to benefit this patient population.\" Timothy Harrison, Associate Director for CBCT \u00ae, was one of the contemplative investigators on the research team, alongside Compassion Center founder Dr. Lobsang Tenzin Negi. As one of the CBCT the study, Timothy reflects: \"Teaching CBCT \u00ae to men living with HIV was deeply meaningful - particularly at Atlanta's clinic downtown where so many are living on the edges of our society. Though they were naturally hesitant to engage compassion meditation at first, and perhaps only showed up for the free snacks and bus tokens, the men soon opened up and engaged whole-heartedly the course activities, meditations, and discussions. After a few class meetings, they began to report noticing habits of rumination and a new ability to tame the inner voices that excessively belittle or blame themselves. Later on, some were even able to let go of some heavy, unhelpful resentments. \"CBCT's approach seemed to speak to each of participants individually, to meet them where they were. Many found ways to work with their inner demons, to focus and to sleep better, and to accept and love themselves more fully. Several reported, in the end, that they were finding more belonging and gratitude in their relationships, not only with loved ones at home but also with the clinic workers whom they depend upon for life-saving treatments.\" November 29, 2021 \"What I appreciate most about CBCT \u00ae is that it cultivates altruistic intentions through cognitive, affective, and motivational dimensions. The program reminds us that we need to investigate how our belief shapes the way we feel and act. Each individual module can be a lifetime practice; I have new insights about myself and others every time I attend a CBCT \u00ae retreat. I'm glad that I've adopted CBCT \u00ae components for various teaching occasions, including the Women's Employment and Essential Skills program this fall hosted by Opportunity Northeast in Spokane, Washington.\" - Professor Gloria I-Ling Chien, Gonzaga University Professor Ignatian Pedagogy and Buddhist-inspired Compassion Meditation,\" in Teaching Theology & Religion 23, draws from her experience with teaching CBCT \u00ae at a Jesuit University. The research explores how \u00ae aligns with the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm's five experience, reflection, action, and evaluation. Modern Ignatian pedagogy is a distinctive feature of Jesuit education. Her second article is \"Integrating Contemplative and Ignatian Pedagogies in a Buddhist Studies Classroom\" in Religions 11. This study shows that the combination of contemplative pedagogy and the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm create a multidimensional environment in learning Buddhism in higher education. Specific examples are given of multisensory contemplation activities - such as CBCT \u00ae - that expand students' ways of knowing about Buddhist practice and foster their consideration for others. Dr. Chien's students have shared with her how contemplative practice has helped them especially during the anxious time of the coronavirus pandemic. October 29, 2021 From the CBCT \u00ae course, Trina was inspired by the quote, \"compassion is the bridge to connection.\" She said, the idea of compassion as a lens and tool to focus our attention and relational being toward interdependence, common humanity, and seeing the vulnerability of others is powerful! \"I believe the affective nature of compassion (connectedness) leads to greater understanding, acceptance, and love (of self and others). I was also pleased with the practical approaches (exercises) for meditation and self-reflection, particularly the strategies to \"shift\" negative thinking styles.\" Over the last 15 months, Trina has worked with a team to develop and implement Emory's Building Resilience and Compassion Enculturation (emBRACE) Peer Support Program. The emBRACE program is an interprofessional, systems approach to decreasing the lasting burdens of secondary trauma and moral distress experienced by Emory employees. Trained peer support leaders from Emory Healthcare and Emory University include physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, social workers, and chaplains. It turns out that many of the concepts of the CBCT \u00ae for Nurses and Other Providers' course align with the mission, goals, and objectives of emBRACE. The CBCT \u00ae course and practices offer an opportunity for self-assessment and ongoing self-reflection, as well as personal and professional growth. According to Trina, \"these complementary tools (CBCT \u00ae and emBRACE) strengthen our abilities, outreach, and impact potential for individual wellness, social community, and structural (organizational) change toward well-being and joy in work.\" Joining Emory Healthcare in December 2011, she started as a Nurse Clinician at Emory University Hospital, Unit 10E. She served in various Manager for Nursing positions at Emory Johns Creek Hospital from 2013 to April 2020, leading key strategic initiatives for nursing excellence, including EJCH's initial Magnet\u00ae designation. Trina has been in nursing leadership since April 2020, and is responsible for leading the development, implementation, and measurement of innovative, evidence-based, and evidence-informed nurse leadership preparation and support, including but not limited to, nursing leadership education, training, mentoring, and coaching. CBCT \u00ae Compassion Training for Nurses and Other Providers is a multi-part course combining a weekend workshop online via Zoom on August 7-8. CNE and CEU credits are available.

Edited by Rebeca Diego Pedro, Edgar Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, and Lobsang Tenzin Negi, the developer of CBCT and executive director of the Compassion Center, this Spanish-language book serves as a source of encouragement and hope, intended for cancer survivors and their caregivers, as well as clinicians, counselors, psychologists, and meditation practitioners Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez, an experienced CBCT instructor and professor of psychology at the Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas Puebla (UDLAP) in San Andr\u00e9s Cholula, Mexico, was inspired to pursue this project based on his own experience teaching and researching CBCT with survivors of breast cancer in Spain. The writing team included several long-time friends of the center, including CBCT teacher Sally Dodds and Thaddeus Pace who together pioneered research on CBCT with cancer survivors at the University of Arizona; senior CBCT instructor Samuel Fernandez-Carriba, a psychologist who leads the Spanish-language CBCT teacher certification program; and Timothy Harrison, associate director for CBCT at the Compassion Center. Hero\u00ednas compasivas. La vida como supervivientes de c\u00e1ncer de mama addresses the important question: How do I embrace myself with kindness after my life has been changed by surviving cancer?

In addition, she appreciated the chance to interact with fellow nursing participants. She reports, \"The CBCT \u00ae training is applicable in our everyday lives, especially healthcare professionals. Practicing CBCT \u00ae expands our empathy levels, recognizes suffering in others, builds greater compassion, develops more profound and meaningful connections with others, which brings up greater understanding and joy back into our lives.\" At the time of the course, Jenna was managing the Joy Janssen Clinic at the critical access Petersburg Medical Center in Petersburg, Alaska. Serving a population of approximately 3,000 residents, Petersburg is only accessible by air or water. As the only hospital, the staff are called upon to serve many roles. Jenna recalls that the pandemic triggered her stress response into overdrive. She found herself spending countless hours researching and implementing procedures to protect the clinic staff and patients. \"I was under such pressure that I was having difficulty calming my mind, and to the extent that I was having a hard time sleeping and coping. As a result, I was searching for ways to relieve stress and came across a course offered through Emory University, CBCT \u00ae Compassion Training for Nurses. The course was usually only offered in person, but it was being offered online due to the pandemic, and I signed up without hesitation.\" During the course, Jenna connected with others listening to their stories and struggles, while sharing her own experiences. The module that most resonated with her was CBCT \u00ae 's first module, Connecting to a Moment of Nurturance. \"I shared this practice with our hospital staff at the end of a trauma debrief. The CEO later thanked me for guiding the meditation, as he experienced a calmness and recognized that he wasn't aware of how stressed his body was feeling.\" In November 2020, Jenna with the support of her husband decided it was time to begin a new direction. She transitioned from her clinic management position and moved to Pennsylvania to be closer to family and to enroll in an RN-BSN program at Drexel University. One of her summer courses is holistic self-care and she is acquiring new stress reduction techniques, as well as sharing with others the benefits of CBCT \u00ae . Jenna states, \"I think we all would benefit from the CBCT \u00ae training. I am very thankful that I was able to participate in the course and highly recommend it!\" CBCT \u00ae Compassion Training for Nurses and Other Providers is a multi-part course combining a weekend workshop online via Zoom on August 7-8.

In October 2020, Frontiers in Psychology published a paper, [ \"Ways of Knowing Compassion: How Do We Come to Know, Understand, and Measure Compassion When We See It?\" ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.547241/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Psychology&id=547241) Authored by a consortium of scientists from different fields and universities, this interdisciplinary review explores the strengths and limitations of different approaches for studying compassion, and offers promising strategies for moving the burgeoning field forward. Notably, the majority of the paper's authors have come to the field of compassion research through their earlier research on CBCT \u00ae. Medical anthropologist Jennifer Mascaro, PhD, and psychiatrist Charles Raison, MD, are well known as pioneers of the earliest CBCT \u00ae studies on stress physiology and empathic accuracy. Religion scholar Marianne Parrish Florian, M.A., M.T.S., herself a certified CBCT \u00ae teacher, and Patricia \"Kim\" Palmer, Manager of Research Projects in Spiritual Health, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, Emory University, each have contributed to seminal research on [Compassion-Centered Spiritual Health](https://ccsh.emory.edu/), a program based on CBCT \u00ae and chaplaincy practice at Emory Healthcare in recent years. [ \"Ways of Knowing Compassion: How Do We Come to Know, Understand, and Measure Compassion When We See It?\" ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.547241/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Psychology&id=547241) is a theoretical review of how we know and understand compassion, building on the authors' observation that compassion can be characterized by three basic criteria: \"awareness of another's suffering, a benevolent emotional or affective response, and the motivation to help or act.\" The paper aims to promote communication, collaboration, and convergence across disciplines. The authors have sought to identify complements across different research methodologies in order to promote method-mixing and ultimately strengthen the evidence and rigor of research on compassion. October 27, 2020 Based at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, Corina Aguilar-Raab, PhD , is a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, and professor at the Institute of Medical Psychology. Certified to teach CBCT \u00ae since 2016, Dr. Aguilar-Raab teaches and researches in the fields of clinical psychology and psychotherapy, emphasizing how positive social interactions in close relationships can be improved. She has just completed a book on how systemic aspects of therapy can be combined with Buddhist philosophy and practice. Secular approaches, especially CBCT \u00ae, are highlighted in (Systemic Practice and Buddhism: A Guide to Mindful Therapy and Counseling) to be published in December. During the summer of 2019, Dr. Aguilar-Raab led a large CBCT \u00ae study at Institute of Medical Psychology, Heidelberg University. The focus was on depressed women and their partners. In a randomized control study design of fifty couples, half received CBCT \u00ae for couples and the other half treatment as usual. Following a psychobiological evaluation approach, first data analyses indicated the overall positive effects with the reduction of distress and symptom burdens. In the upcoming year, Dr. Aguilar-Raab will integrate CBCT \u00ae into the teaching of psychology students at Heidelberg University, and she is planning a CBCT \u00ae course for early 2021 at Tibethaus in Frankfurt. Dr. Aguilar-Raab is in the process of recruiting German-speaking candidates who will become certified to teach CBCT \u00ae to support the expansion of the program within the German-speaking world. Based in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, Bruno Vichi holds graduate degrees in both law and psychoanalysis and for 20 years has worked as a lawyer, mediator, and therapist. Certified to teach CBCT since 2017, Vichi continues to offer courses throughout Brazil to doctors, teachers, educators, and the public. In 2021, he will be support a pilot project combining CBCT \u00ae and SEE Learning in the curriculum at Centro de Ensino Fundamental 01 (CEF01), a public school for ages 6 to 15, located in the Federal District. Mr. Vichi recently led a tailored 8-week CBCT \u00ae course for a group of Brazilian women activists. Participants ranged from a host of organizations, including UN Women - the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. The idea was to create a safe and nurturing space for women working within areas of human rights, indigenous communities, food security, and environmental issues. The activists were seeking to develop personal resources, resiliency skills, and a more compassionate approach after the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. According to Erika Yamada of the United Nations Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: \" It was important to gather this group of friends and activists around a practice of meditation at that moment where everybody was feeling very hopeless and scared. CBCT \u00ae offered us important inner tools to deal with our political context, which got even more challenging the following months. With those tools, we found motivation to self-organize compassionate meetings to meditate together. We have continued to use the CBCT \u00ae vocabulary and practice to take care of ourselves and of each other. \" Help us to continue spreading compassion.

In light of COVID-19 and sudden postponement of clinical training, the school's leadership requested a special online training. Twice weekly, these future healthcare heroes are meeting virtually to develop the inner skills to support their resilience and compassion.
