It's time to embody the life of your dreams \u2014 and shed everything that's holding you back. Are you ready for your life to feel like a full body yes? We'll help you make your life, your dreams, your joy a priority. Hey, I'm Emily! I have been fortunate enough to live many lives inside this one body. My first ten years professionally were spent learning high performance tools to handle the demands of singing, dancing and acting eight shows a week on Broadway. The stress and anxiety of that lead to insomnia, sickness and going gray in my 20's. Thankfully I found meditation and it changed my whole life. After my first class, my insomnia was cured. Then, I stopped going gray and getting sick all the time. I thought, \"why isn't everyone doing this?\" So I left Broadway, went to India and trained for 3 years to be a teacher. Since then I have taught over 50,000 people to practice the Ziva Technique of mindfulness, meditation and manifesting to do on their own for life. I birthed a book and a baby at the same time which is something I am very proud of and never wish to do again. I also created the world's 1st online meditation training way before it was mainstream. In the last few years Nature has been fire-hosing me with a PhD in Sacred sexuality and how to use the most creative energy we have, our sexual energy to fuel our dream not only for our lives, but for the species. Once I found these powerful embodied manifesting tools I had the thought again.... \"Why Isn't Everyone Doing This?\" which prompted the name of my podcast launching so very soon. I live in NYC with my son, Regena Thomashauer (aka Mama Gena) and our dog, Mugsy. My podcast studio is in LA and my boyfriend is in Austin... so I spend a lot of time meditating on planes.
