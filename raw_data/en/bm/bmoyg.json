Don't be shy to experiment with different flavour combos by substituting any nuts and seeds with what you have on hand - a pinch of spirulina powder or a spoonful of tahini or nut butter wouldn't go astray either. If you have a dehydrator at home, then dried fruits such as plums or figs can be used in place of dates. Ingredients (makes 16 slices) - 1 cup raw nuts (almond, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia or Brazil) - \u00bc cup seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, chia or linseed) - 2 tbsp psyllium husks - \u00bd cup puffed cereal (rice, millet, quinoa or amaranth) - 400 g (3 cups) chopped pitted dates - \u00bc cup cacao powder, sifted - \u00bc cup coconut oil, melted - 2 tbsp liquid sweetener (maple, agave syrup or honey) - 1 tsp vanilla bean paste - Pinch cinnamon powder - Pinch fine sea salt - Pinch chilli powder (optional) - Extra cacao powder for dusting METHOD Line a 20 cm circle cake tin with baking paper and set aside. In a food processor, add nuts, seeds and psyllium husks and whiz until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl with puffed cereal and set aside. Add chopped dates and all other ingredients to food processor and whiz until a sticky paste-like mixture forms and add to large bowl. Using your hands, mix until evenly combined. Add mixture to lined baking tin and press mixture out evenly. Refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight until firm. To serve, dust with sifted cacao powder and slice.
