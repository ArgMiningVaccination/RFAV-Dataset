It's important that you use an organic, raw, unfiltered ACV that contains \"the mother\", which is made up of strains of proteins, enzymes, and good bacteria (a.k.a. probiotics!). Chef's Tips - Make sure all of your ingredients are fresh, especially the spices! Avoid bottled orange juices, since they're highly processed and full of added ingredients. Use raw ACV rather than filtered, and fresh garlic and ginger rather than jarred, dried, or paste. - Let the garlic rest a little. Cutting garlic cloves [releases enzymes](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275955/4-tips-for-how-to-cook-with-garlic/)that form antioxidants and healthy compounds like [allicin](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2007-06-26-0706220554-story.html#:~:text=That%27s%20how%20long%20it%20takes%20for%20the%20disturbed%20material%20to%20form%20the%20compound%20allicin%2C%20a%20powerful%20anti%2Dbacterial%20and%20anti%2Dfungal%20agent.%20Once%20that%20occurs%2C%20it%20begins%20the%20process%20of%20converting%20the%20allicin%20into%20anti%2Dcancer%20compounds%20such%20as%20diallyl%20sulfide%2C%20diallyl%20disulfide%20and%20diallyl%20trisulfide.). Just cutting it isn't enough, though - those enzymes need to react to oxygen in order to form those compounds, and the longer you can let the cut garlic sit and oxidize, the stronger those compounds will be. That's true whether you're making an immune system booster or just cooking dinner as usual, so let your garlic rest for extra benefits each and every time you use it! Can I Make This Recipe Ahead of Time? Technically, yes! The ingredients are most potent when they're fresh, so it's best to consume the mixture immediately for maximum immune boosting benefits. That being said, you can make it ahead of time if you need to. Simply prepare the mixture exactly as written, then refrigerate it in an airtight container until you're ready to drink it. Consume the refrigerated immunity shot within 2 days of preparing it! Does This Immunity Shot Really Work? Look, I'm not a doctor, and I don't pretend to play one on the internet. I won't make you any promises that this immune booster shot will rid you of a fever or eliminate your sinus issues or anything like that. What I can tell you, though, is this: whenever I start to feel like I'm coming down with that infamous crud, I down one of these bad boys and get a little rest. Sure enough, every time I've done it, I've never gotten fully sick. When I haven't done it? UGH. So, I'll let you decide for yourself if it \"works\" for you or not. For me, I figure there's no harm in consuming any of the ingredients (for me personally at least), so why not take all the precautions I can?

Ingredients - 1-2 cloves garlic - 1 tablespoon [honey](http://l.thrv.me/40aprons-thrive-market-organic-raw-unstr) - \u00bc teaspoon turmeric - 1 tablespoon hot water - 2-3 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice juice of 1 medium lemon - 4-5 tablespoons freshly-squeezed orange juice juice of 1 medium navel orange - 1 dash [cinnamon](http://l.thrv.me/40aprons-thrive-market-ground-cinnamon) - 1 dash [cayenne pepper](http://amzn.to/2vGDyCZ) - 1 dash [sea salt](http://amzn.to/2tZWRru) - 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper - 1 tablespoon organic, unfiltered apple cider vinegar see Notes - 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger Equipment - garlic press or sharp knife; press preferred - Small bowl - juicer optional - glass or cup - Whisk - cheese grate Instructions - Press garlic cloves through garlic press and into small bowl. Set aside 10 minutes (see Notes). Alternately, finely mince and mash garlic cloves with knife, then set aside. - Once garlic has rested close to 10 minutes, add 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon hot water, and \u00bc teaspoon turmeric to glass or cup. Whisk until ingredients are fully combined. - Add fresh lemon juice, fresh orange juice, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, sea salt, and black pepper to glass with honey. Whisk until ingredients are fully incorporated. - Add apple cider vinegar, ginger, and garlic to glass. Whisk until ingredients are fully incorporated. Consume mixture immediately for maximum benefits. Notes - Apple Cider Vinegar: Use a raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar that includes [the mother](https://enzymedica.com/blogs/ingredient-science/what-is-the-mother-in-apple-cider-vinegar). Pasteurized apple cider vinegar won't have the same health benefits since it doesn't contain the mother. - Garlic: Pressed or crushed garlic releases enzymes that react with oxygen, triggering the formation of healthy compounds. The longer it sits in open air, the more time the enzymes have to form these compounds. Before making your immune booster shot, let the cut garlic oxidize 10-15 minutes, for maximum health benefits. - Make Ahead: For maximum benefits, this booster shot should be consumed immediately after making. It can be made ahead of time, though, if needed. Simply prepare the mixture as written, then refrigerate it in an airtight container. Consume within 2 days of making.
