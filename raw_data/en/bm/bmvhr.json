It is divided into two sections. The first section includes taking a medical his - tory with a family seen for the first time, taking an interval history, newborn rounding, and breastfeeding. Well-child visits are included, along with information about nutri - tion, elimination, sleep patterns, growth and development, and injury prevention. The second section is organized by body system and is written in outline format, making it easy to read and find information quickly. Common medical conditions are presented with information about etiology, occurrence, clinical manifestations, physical findings, diagnostic tests, differential diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, complications, and patient/ family education. \u2014B eth RichaRdson xviiAcknowledgments I would like to thank my children, Jason, Sarah, and Walker; my grandchildren, Caroline and Darren; Sadie, Sam, and my friends; and all the students I have had the privilege of knowing.

Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott; 2016. Duderstadt KG. Pediatric Physical Examination: An Illustrated Handbook. 2nd ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby; 2014. 8 CHAPTER 1 Obtaining an Initial HistoryObtaining an Interval History Donna Hallas I. THE INTERVAL HISTORY A. Definition. 1. Interval history: Data collection that occurs at subsequent visits to one in which comprehensive history and physical examination were completed. 2. Amount of information reviewed and collected for interval history depends on age of pediatric, adolescent, or young adult (up to age 21 years) and length of time since comprehensive history was obtained and/or prior appointments in which interval history was updated. 3. General guideline for obtaining interval history: Review and update data (e.g., emergency department and urgent care visits; changes in personal or family history every 6 months for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, and every year for school-age children, adolescents, and young adults). B. Significance of interval history. 1. Although comprehensive history is used to establish initial health promo - tion plans, analysis of data collected during interval history is often to: a. Continue established health promotion plan. b. Identify new healthcare problems and establish new health promotion. c. Plan health promotion strategies based on new data obtained in the interval history. d. Identify treatment plan to resolve presenting problems. e. Change health promotion plan to meet immediate and future needs of child and family (e.g., child has new diagnosis of chronic illness). C. Preparation for obtaining interval history. 1. Prior to beginning data collection for interval history, review comprehen - sive history and any prior interval histories available on medical record. a. Helps nurse practitioner focus questions that will elicit data needed to complete interval history. b. Sample data contained in comprehensive history that may need further exploration during interval history is listed in Table 2-1. 9CHAPTER 210 CHAPTER 2 Obtaining an Interval History T able 2-1 Focusing the Interval History from Details in the Comprehensive History Comprehensive History Interval History Past medical history (PMH) Any data in past medical history that are significant and require further clarification. Consider previous acute illnesses including emergency department (ED) and urgent care, infectious diseases, hospitalizations, injuries, accidents, surgeries, and chronic illnesses. Consider how PMH relates to current presenting symptoms or problems. Review problem list, including prior diagnosesIf all prior problems are listed as resolved, then no further data needs to be elicited at this visit. If problems still exist, then ask questions specific to previously identified problem and current status of that problem. Allergies Always obtain update on allergies to all foods; medications, including over the counter (OTC); seasonal and environmental pollutants. Identify specific reaction (e.g., type and location of rash). Developmental history: 6 years and younger 7 to 12 years old Older than 12 yearsReview results of prior developmental screenings, including Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) or the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, and socioemotional screenings. Note achievement of developmental milestones at each interval visit. If delays are noted, question status of intervention services (early intervention for children up to 6 years old; occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), speech, special education services, behavioral therapies for all children). Screenings based on presenting problem: Pediatric symptom checklist SCARED for anxiety Screenings based on presenting problem: Tobacco use or substance use HEEADSSS or SHADESS screen PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, if needed CRAFFT or Audit-C Social history Exercise and activity, wellness behaviors, behavioral issues at home or at school. Use of media and Internet, friendships, bullying (either being bullied or bullies others), aggressive behaviors, violent behaviors, gender identity, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or queer (LGBTQ) + status.D. Elements of an interval history. 1. Elements included in interval history should be age related. 2. Major focus for interval history for each pediatric, adolescent, and young adult should include questions concerning eating, sleeping, bladder and bowel patterns, and any unusual behaviors or changes in behaviors. Additional questions are then age related. 3. Infant, toddler, and preschool-age children. a. Ask questions related to achievement of developmental milestones. b. Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) or the Ages and Stages Questionnaire may be used as guide for questioning patterns I. The Interval History 11 Comprehensive History Interval History Family history Review family structure and family support systems. If data contained in comprehensive history suggest dysfunctional family, ask about present family structure and function. Review genogram and significant family history prior to interview. Pay particular attention to strong family history of conditions in which family lifestyle modifications can have significant impact (e.g., cardiovascular conditions, hypertension; close relative's sudden death at younger than 50 years; diabetes; obesity; behaviors including anger, depression, self-injury, or suicide ideation). Implementing lifestyle modifications in early childhood years may significantly affect health throughout lifetime. Medication history Prescription, OTC, homeopathic remedies, herbs, vitamins, minerals, other supplements. Nutritional history Timing and frequency of meals, including food choices if malnourished or obese; ethnic and cultural considerations in food choices. Immunization history Review immunization records at each visit. Review immunization catch-up schedule. Mental health Assess mental health status for children and adolescents at each interval visit. Fears, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems may occur at any age.T able 2-1 Focusing the Interval History from Details in the Comprehensive History ( continued )concerning achievement of developmental milestones. (Note: DDST no longer needs to be purchased for use. It is available free online.) c. Toddlers and preschoolers: Assess information regarding speech and language development and development of socioemotional skills. d. Use the Surveillance and Screening Algorithm: Autistic Spectrum Disorders for toddlers at 16-, 21-, and/or 24-month-old episodic visit if it has not been completed at a maintenance health visit. 4. School-age children. a. Should also include questions related to sociobehavioral development with peers and progress in school. b. If female school-age child has secondary sex characteristics, ask about menstrual cycle: Age of onset, frequency, length of cycle, any discomfort prior to or during menstruation. c. Children older than 10 years of age should be asked: Have they or their friends tried alcohol or drugs? Use brief alcohol/drug-screening tool at each episodic visit. What is their diet? Happy with appearance/weight? Thought about harming themselves or others? Sexually active? Pediatric symptom checklist. 5. Adolescents. a. HEADSSS assessment (home, education/employment, activity, drugs/ alcohol, sexuality, suicide/depression, safety and exposure to violence). b. SSHADESSS assessment (strength of interests, school, home, activities, drugs/substance use, emotions/depression, sexuality, safety) c. Adolescent female: Ask questions related to menstrual cycle. d. Ask about high-risk social behaviors: Smoking; alcohol/drug use; sexual activity, including diagnosis and treatment of sexually trans - mitted infections (STIs); driving motor vehicle in reckless manner; use of guns; etc. Many of these questions are included in HEEADSSS or SHADESS assessments. e. Audit-C or CRAFFT Tool: The CRAFFT tool is preferred for adoles - cent population. E. Review of systems (ROS). 1. Age-appropriate ROS: Conduct in head-to-toe manner as identified in comprehensive physical examination ( Table 2-2).12 CHAPTER 2 Obtaining an Interval History I.

Interval history is integral part of assessment. 1. Question parent and child about significant family history changes (e.g., sudden death of relative who was younger than 50 years old from car - diovascular condition). Include questions that elicit information about significant episodes (red flags) of chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, loss of consciousness, history of concussions ( Table 2-3). III. FOCUSED HISTORY A. Focused history: Used to collect data about a specific problem, usually chief complaint identified by parent/child ( Table 2-4 and Table 2-5). B. Focus all questions on eliciting data about chief complaint. C. Focused history usually limited to one or two systems.14 CHAPTER 2 Obtaining an Interval History System ROS\u2014Gathering the Interval Historya Moles Darkened or discolored areas Abnormal hair growth Clubbing of nails (also seen in cardiovascular disorders) Bruising easily Range of motion Sexual historyHistory of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Number/gender of partners Use of protection and/or birth control a This information is gathered in addition to the details related to eating, sleeping, bladder, and bowel patterns.T able 2-2 Review of System (ROS) in an Interval History ( continued ) III.

After completing interval history and physical examination, compare findings in comprehensive history to data obtained in interval history. 1. If no significant changes found in interval history, advise parent, infant/ child to continue to follow established health promotion plan. 2. If significant changes are found in interval history, revise health promo - tion plan. a. Example: If interval family history reveals family members have diabetes mellitus, evaluate and make recommendations for family/child exercise and dietary patterns. 3. If significant changes are found in interval history in relation to child's health, establish new health promotion plan with parent and child/adolescent as active participants. a. Example: If interval history reveals significant change in frequency of coughing and upper respiratory symptoms, complete a detailed focused history, provide new diagnosis, and establish new health promotion plan. V. WHEN TO REFER A. Referral to specialists are made when child's or adolescent's presenting problem results in differential diagnosis or diagnosis that is either acute illness, such as acute surgical abdomen or systemic infection for which child needs hospi - talization, or new-presenting chronic illness, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, in which child and family would benefit from receiving care from specialists (endocrinologist and nurse practitioner who specializes in endocrinology) and interprofessional team (nutritionist, exercise physiologist, pharmacist, social worker).

MAKING NEWBORN ROUNDS A. Determine number of newborns delivered in last 24 hours. B. Prioritize assessments by birth time and concerns of nurses. C. Evaluate each infant within 12-24 hours of birth and daily until discharge. II. REVIEW OF THE INDIVIDUAL RECORDS A. Mother. 1. Past obstetric history: Infertility, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths/peri - natal deaths, parity, gravity, length of pregnancy, congenital anomalies in other infants, assistive reproductive technology (ART) used, isoimmune disease (Rh, ABO), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), cesarean births, vaginal birth after cesarean, gestational diabetes. Current preg - nancy history: Maternal age, overall health (asthma, sickle cell disease), estimated date of confinement (EDC), prenatal care, number of previous pregnancies, multiple or single fetus, presentation/position of fetus, amount of amniotic fluid, fetal growth/size (small, appropriate, or large for gestational age), nationality, public assistance. 2. Be sure to ask about mother's drug use (heroin, codeine, oxycodone, co - caine) during pregnancy. The closer to delivery that drugs were used, the more likely baby will suffer withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur with alcohol, SSRIs, nicotine/cigarette smoking, marijuana, benzodiazepines. If mother has taken illicit drugs just prior to delivery, consider consult with healthcare provider who has experience with helping infants through withdrawal. For specific symptoms and when neonatal withdrawal may occur, see Lee's 2015 article \"Neonatal abstinence syn - drome. \" To quantify severity of withdrawal, utilize the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System found in the article. 3. Query mother about possible exposure to Zika virus. Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can also be acquired through sexual contact with infected person. It is closely related to Dengue fever, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, and has been found episodically in Miami/Dade County, Florida. Testing for virus or antibodies is not routinely done. If the infant was exposed to Zika in utero, it could present with smaller than normal occipital frontal circumference (OFC), feeding problems (especially swallowing), hearing and vision problems, joint contractures, stiff muscles, and seizures. 4. Results of prenatal lab work: Blood type; rubella IgG gonorrhea and 28 CHAPTER Making Newborn Roundschlamydia cultures; maternal alpha fetal protein; urinalysis (bacteria, blood, to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or teratogenic medications (valproate, tetracycline). If history positive for recent illicit drug use, consider screening mother's urine for drugs. B. Newborn. 1. Prenatal history: Vaginal or cesarean delivery; length of labor and delivery; tocolytics used fluid Apgar scores (heart rate, respirations, muscle tone, reflex irritability, color) with 5-minute Apgar > 7. 2. At birth: Gender, type of delivery, weight/length/OFC, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respirations, feeding/nursing with breast or bottle, voiding spontaneously, passage of meconium, infant contact with mother/parents. If mother took drugs just before delivery (within 48 hours), infant may have symptoms of withdrawal and symptoms may vary depending upon drug taken: Observe for excessive crying, high-pitched cry, diarrhea, hyperactive reflexes, sleep problems, feeding problems, mottling of skin. Rule out hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, or other metabolic condition before diagnosing withdrawal. Primary treatment for drug-exposed infants who are symptomatic is supportive care; pharmacologic care can prolong hospitalization and expose infant to additional medications. If needed, opi - oids are currently considered first-line therapy, with phenobarbital second. III. PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE NEWBORN A. General appearance. 1. Gender, current weight, length, OFC, color, heart rate, respirations, tem - perature, blood glucose at birth, response to stimuli, posture, determina - tion of gestational age from the New Ballard Score (physical maturity and neuromuscular maturity). a. Full-term infant: > 37 weeks but < 42 weeks. b. Premature infant: < 37 weeks; late-preterm infant 34 weeks to 36 weeks, 6 days. c. Post-term infant: > 42 weeks. B. Late-preterm infants at greater risk for: 1. Persistent, severe, or progressive tachypnea: Retractions, nasal flaring, grunting. Monitor with pulse oximeter and blood gases, chest X-ray, frequent reexamination. III. Physical Assessment of the Newborn 292. Reduced ability to regulate body temperature due to immature epidermis, large body surface area, inability to regulate temperature. Goal is axillary temperature of 97.7-99.3\u00b0F (36.5-37.4\u00b0C). 3. Hypoglycemia due to low glycogen stores, decreased enzymes, depressed hormone responses, slower than average increase in newborn's blood glucose level. Assess for maternal risks (gestational diabetes, PIH, ma - ternal obesity, tocolytics, difficult or prolonged delivery, late antepartum IV glucose or fetal decelerations) and neonatal risks (preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation [IUGR], multiple fetuses, Apgar < 7 at 5 minutes, temperature instability, respiratory distress, polycythemia). Infants whose mothers had diet-controlled or insulin-controlled gesta - tional diabetes have significant fetal hyperinsulinism and slow adaptation of neonatal pancreas. 4. Sepsis due to transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from mother. Monitor for maternal risk factors for sepsis (prolonged rupture of membranes, intra-amniotic infection, intrapartum fever of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), young maternal age, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, prior history of group B streptococcal disease, low antibody levels) and for neonatal risk factors (preterm delivery, male gender, multiple fetuses, birth weight under 2500 grams, congenital anomalies, difficult delivery, black race). Repeat physical assessment frequently, looking for signs of sepsis. 5. Hyperbilirubinemia due to deficient UDP glucuronyl transferase in most newborns during first few days of life, decreased gastrointestinal motility, greater resorption of bilirubin, insufficient lactation, poor serum total bilirubin and utilize the Bhutani nomogram to assess levels by hour of age. Assess total bilirubin prior to discharge and repeat physical assessment and history. 6. Feeding difficulties due to oromotor sucking and swallowing incoor - dination, neurobehavioral disorganization, immature gastric system (coordination for infants is achieved at 36-38 weeks of gestational age). Preterm infants are sleepier, tire easily, and have difficulty latching on and sucking vigorously. Monitor for weight loss > 3% per day or > 7% of birth weight prior to discharge. 7. Readmission to the hospital after discharge due to any or all of the above. Infants born after 40 weeks' gestation are at risk for hypoglycemia; failure to grow proportionally; and dry, flaky skin because placenta starts to atrophy after 40 weeks, (resulting in slower fetal growth, difficulty with hypoxia, increased fetal swallowing). Fetus may try to breathe and is at risk for aspiration of meconium. Plan to monitor blood sugar, quality of nursing/eating, total intake, quality/rate of respirations.30 CHAPTER 4 Making Newborn RoundsIV. ABNORMAL PHYSICAL FINDINGS (CONSULT WITH STAFF PHYSICIAN AND/OR REFER FOR EVALUATION, AS INDICATED) A. Dysmorphic facies hyper- or hypotelorism, epicanthal folds, symmetrical facies and 1. Skin and scalp with plethora, pallor, jaundice, cyanosis, bruising, abrasions, petechiae, hemangioma, port wine stain, caf\u00e9 au lait spots. 2. Shape of skull, molding. 3. Bruising, hematoma/caput succedaneum. 4. Size and tone of anterior and posterior fontanels. B. Pupils without red reflex and unequal pupillary sizes, nares patent (choanal atresia), mouth with teeth, hypoglossia/macroglossia, palate high arched or missing, external ears with tags or pinhole openings, neck short/masses (cystic hygroma) or webbing. C. More/fewer than five fingers/toes on each hand/foot. D. Check clavicles for fractures/dislocations/pain. Chest shape with pectus excavatum/carinatum and supernumerary nipples. Breath sounds that are moist and grunting/retractions after 4 hours of age, apnea/respirations < 30 or > 60 per minute. E. Heart rate with murmur (soft III/IV systolic murmur normal for first 12-24 hours because patent ductus may not be closed) or an irregular rate/rhythm < 100 or > 180 bpm, a cuff blood pressure < 65 or > 95 mm Hg systolic pressure and diastolic < 30 or > 60 mm Hg. Absent or decreased femoral pulses (coarctation of aorta), slow capillary refill are poor perfusion. F. Temperature instability < 97.7\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C) after 4 hours of age. G. Abdominal skin thin or missing, asymmetrical, distended, umbilicus with hernia, discharge, redness, odor. Missing or overactive bowel sounds. Lower liver edge 3 cm below costal margin (heart disease), infection, hemolysis, palpable spleen (infection or hemopoiesis), enlarged bladder (1-4 cm above symphysis pubis). H. vesicles), labial placed abnormally (hypospadias or epispadius), absence of testes hydrocele, bifid scrotum, discoloration, bruising. J. Anus absent or not patent. K. Absent or missing extremities, bands, masses, imperforate anus, dimples or asym - metry of the buttocks, abnormal Ortolani or Barlow sign, bowing of extremities, abnormal foot positions, flaccid upper extremity, lesions or dimpling of lower spine. IV. Abnormal Physical Findings 31L. Abnormal posturing, floppy or very jittery, abnormal cry. Exaggerated tonic neck, Moro reflex, poor sucking, or poor rooting. M. If infant has severe microcephaly with partially collapsed skull, scarring and pigment changes to the back of the eye, limited flexibility of joints with clubfeet, decreased brain tissue with specific areas of the brain affected (as seen on MRI), or increased muscle tone, consider Zika virus as etiology. V. LABORATORY ASSESSMENT OF NEWBORN A. Glucose screening (normal 40-90 mg/dL), venous hematocrit (normal 45-65%), cord blood (ABO, Rh). baby is Rh-, maternal RhoGAM status should be Rh +. B. Bilirubin: Determine etiology of any jaundice (i.e., physiologic or pathologic). Obtain baseline total serum bilirubin, plus a direct and indirect level. 1. In first week of life, 60% of all term newborns and 80% of preterm infants will have some jaundice. 2. Any jaundice within the first 24 hours after birth is considered patho - logic. If total serum bilirubin (TSB) rises more than 5 mg/dL/day or is higher than 12 mg/dL in full-term infants or 10-14 mg/dL for preterm, further evaluation and treatment is indicated. If the infant has signs of sepsis, irritability, or lethargy, this needs further evaluation. In infants 25-48 hours old, a TSB level above 15 mg/dL is indicative of rapid rise, and infant needs further evaluation. Infants 49-72 hours old with a TSB above 18 mg/dL or any infants more than 72 hours old with a TSB of 20 mg/dL need further evaluation and treatment. 3. When obtaining serial bilirubin, utilize noninvasive transcutaneous bilirubinometer (TcB) and nomogram. C. Newborn hearing screening: To be done no later than 1 month of age. Most hospitals offer this screening for newborns prior to discharge. Risk factors for infants include family history of sensorineural hearing loss, in utero infections (TORCH), craniofacial anomalies, hyperbilirubinemia, postnatal bacterial meningitis, findings indicative of a syndrome with hearing loss, neurodegenera - tive disorders, sensorimotor neuropathies, parental concerns for hearing, head trauma, and recurrent/persistent otitis media. If infant fails the hearing screen - ing, an audiologic evaluation needs to be done as follow-up by 3 months of age. VI. MEETING WITH THE PARENT A. Introduce self, sit by bedside. Describe your role. Answer parents' questions, describe the general process of how you will be working with them over the next day or so. B. Praise parents, compliment baby.32 CHAPTER 4 Making Newborn RoundsC. Call baby by name. D. Determine mother's health/wellness/contact with infant so far. E. Review your findings, briefly. F. If male, determine if baby is to be circumcised. Discuss pros and cons. G. Ask about method of feeding, car seat, help when home, concerns. VII. NUTRITION A. Breastfeeding is encouraged for all newborns (see Chapter 5). Late-preterm infants may not be vigorous eaters and may need close monitoring of weight. Obtain a breastfeeding consult and encourage nursing every 2 hours until infant is nursing at least 20 minutes during feedings. 1. No breastfeeding if mother is HIV-positive; has active herpes of breast, untreated tuberculosis, debilitating disease (cancer), history of illicit drug use; or if infant has galactosemia. B. If bottle-feeding, reassure that baby will grow and thrive on formula. 1. Only commercially prepared, iron-fortified formulas should be used: Powder, concentrate, ready to feed. Do not dilute ready to feed; do not reuse formula if > 4 hours since opened. 2. Mix formulas with bottled water for first month; continue if on well or unsure of water quality. Store in refrigerator if open no longer than 24 hours. 3. Specialized formulas have similar preparation directions. Goat's milk, whole cow's milk, rice milk have inadequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. 4. Serve formula at room temperature. Do not microwave to heat. Do not let formula sit out at room temperature to warm for more than 15-20 minutes. C. Clean technique is sufficient for mixing formulas. Clean off cans with soap and water before opening. Use hot soapy water and bottlebrush to clean nipples and bottles or clean in dishwasher. D. Hold in upright, semi-reclined position during feedings; burp every 1-2 ounces. No bottle propping. E. Newborn will suckle 0.5-1 ounces of formula/feeding every 2-3 hours for first 24 hours (60-100 mL/kg/day). Volume increases to 12-24 ounces/day and interval between feedings > 3-4 hours in first month. Some days baby will take more or less, depending on sleep pattern. Baby should take in 90% of feeding in first 20 minutes. VIII. ELIMINATION A. Meconium stools in first 48 hours, transition stools green-brown, change to yellow pasty after 2-3 days of oral feeding. B. Infant should have 1-6 yellow pasty stools for 24 hours. VIII. Elimination 33C. Breastfed baby may have upper range of frequency, bottle-fed may have less. D. Void every 1-3 hours or with each feeding and diaper change. IX. SLEEP A. Awake for feedings; feed every 2-4 hours. Should be alert, nurse vigorously for 15-20 minutes, then fall back to sleep. Respirations may be slightly irregular. B. Babies should sleep on their back on firm, flat surface in crib for up to 1 year of age. No pillows/toys/blankets in crib that baby could get their face against and be smothered. Side-sleeping is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) until infant is able to roll over on their own. C. Infant sleep clothing, such as wearable blankets, is preferable to swaddling or blankets. No head coverings should be attached to sleep clothing. Avoid overheating the infant when preparing for sleep. D. Babies should sleep in own cribs, not with parents, to minimize potential for rollovers, suffocation, and falls. Having baby sleep in same room with parent is encouraged up to 1 year of age, but at least until 6 months of age. E. Preterm infants should sleep supine and follow the same guidelines as term infants. Parents should be counseled on the increased risk of SIDS on preterm infants. F. Avoid use of commercial devices that claim to reduce SIDS risk, such as wedges and positioners. Information on specific products can be found at the Consumer Product Safety Commission website (www.cpsc.gov). X. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A. Newborn can lose up to 10% of body weight in first 10 days of life. Should regain birth weight by 2 weeks of age. B. Infant grows 1 inch, on average, per month for first 6 months. C. Head circumference increases 9 cm in first year. D. Has minimal head control. E. Looks at person during feeding. F. Tracks 45\u00b0. XI. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT A. Babies have different cries, will fuss/cry 1 to 2 hours/day. As long as baby is not distressed, a little crying is safe and appropriate. 1. Similar time/pattern daily. 2. Provide for infant's needs and crying should cease. 3. Cry gradually decreases by 3 months of age.34 CHAPTER 4 Making Newborn RoundsB. Refer all high-risk infants/mothers to social worker before release. High-risk situations include: 1. Adolescent pregnancy. 2. No prenatal care. 3. Consideration about giving up the baby for adoption. 4. Unwanted pregnancy. 5. Insufficient support from those at home. 6. Physical limitations of parent. 7. Inadequate housing/finances. 8. Domestic violence. 9. Positive toxicology. 10. Incarcerated parent. 11. Emotional disorders. 12. Parent with mental disability. 13. Multiple small children in home. 14. If mother has been exposed to illicit drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, recommendation is that close follow-up after discharge is initiated. XII. IMMUNIZATIONS A. Monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 24 hours of birth for all infants considered medically stable weighing over 2000 grams and whose mothers are hepatitis B surface antigen negative (HBsAG-). If mother is hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg +), administer hepa - titis B vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth and determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible. If she is positive, newborn should receive HBIG within 1 week of life. Monovalent hepatitis B should be given if second dose is given younger than 6 weeks of age. Monovalent or combination vaccine can be used to complete series. B. Preterm infants weighing less than 2000 grams: HBsAG- infant should receive first dose of vaccine 1 month after birth or at hospital discharge. Check ACIP hepatitis recommendations for any concerns. XIII. SAFETY/ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE A. Sleep position \"back to sleep. \" B. Discuss American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for safe infant sleep with parents. (See Guidelines above under \"Sleep. \") XIII. Safety/Anticipatory Guidance 35C. Use Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)-tested and -approved car seat; install properly in backseat, facing backward in automobile. Contact local hospital, fire department, or March of Dimes chapter for car seat rental program. Infants should ride in the rear-facing position in either an infant seat or a convertible car seat until they are at least 2 years of age or they reach highest weight and height mandated by car seat manufacturer. Place the harness of the car seat for a rear-facing seat in slots that are at or below the level of the baby's shoulders. Check to see that the harness is snug and that the harness chest clip is placed at the center of the chest. Never place a rear-facing car seat in front seat that has active front passenger air bag. Infant should ride in back seat to - ward the center of car and not next to door. Never leave an infant in a hot car. D. No smoking around infant. E. One-piece pacifiers only. F. No corn syrup (Karo) for constipation, but may give 1 ounce of sterile water/24 hours. G. No solids, only breast milk or formula fed to infant. H. When to call healthcare provider: 1. Breathing difficulties: Too fast or too slow or color changes; seizures; ir - ritability; poor feeding; vomiting; no urine in 12 hours; black or decreased bowel movements; reddened, draining umbilical site; jaundice; rash or pustules not present on discharge; concerns. I. Give office phone number, explain how to use system. J. Discuss with mother plans for contraception/birth control and ask her to discuss this with her delivering physician prior to discharge. XIV. DISCHARGE TO HOME A. Review all records/progress. B. Repeat complete physical examination. C. Identify abnormal findings that require ongoing monitoring. D. Review hearing screening results and if not done, schedule before discharge. E. Collect newborn blood screen. F. Administer hepatitis B immunization. G. Complete all consults. H. Staff nurses will have covered discharge instructions of bathing, cord care, bulb syringe, diapering, dressing, fingernail care, holding, feeding. I. If concerns, infants should be scheduled for office visit within 2 days, otherwise parents need a 2-week follow-up appointment assigned before discharge. Make them comfortable knowing they can call with any concerns.36 CHAPTER 4 Making Newborn RoundsBIBLIOGRAPHY American Academy of Pediatrics.

Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by numerous public health, professional, and governmental organizations for the first 6 months of life, with continued breastfeeding throughout first year and beyond with the ad - dition of appropriate complementary foods. If there is a contraindication to breastfeeding or for certain preterm infants, using pasteurized donor human milk with fortification as needed is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). II. PHYSIOLOGY OF LACTATION A. Mammary glands are complex organs that function independently in response to an intricate combination of hormones and stimulation to produce milk. After expulsion of the placenta following delivery, a significant drop in progesterone readies the body for milk production (Figure 5-1). B. Oxytocin and prolactin are two of many important hormones in controlling lactation. 39CHAPTER 5C. Optimal milk production depends on several factors, including release of lactation hormones, frequent and effective milk removal, and adequate breast stimulation. D. Full lactation can be produced by breasts beginning from 16 weeks of pregnancy. E. Important to understand balance of supply and demand to optimize success - ful lactation. F. Lactation begins as a result of hormonal control (endocrine) but changes to autocrine (frequent emptying of breasts) over time. III. HUMAN MILK A. Human milk is exceptional in its ability to sustain appropriate growth and development for infants.40 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeeding Figure 5-1 pathway Nerve stimulation B. \"Liquid gold, \" as human milk is often called, is living tissue, which encompasses fats, proteins, carbohydrates, antibodies, and hundreds of other important components. C. Composition of human milk changes to provide optimal nutrition as infant grows. 1. Colostrum, or first milk, is produced during pregnancy and is considered infant's first immunization; it is rich in antibodies and provides protection to newborn from many viruses and bacteria. Volume is small in first 3 days. Colostrum has fewer calories than mature milk but is rich in im - munoglobulins, especially slgA. Proteins in colostrum helps to stabilize infant's blood glucose levels. 2. Transitional milk is produced after colostrum and has less total protein and immunoglobulins; however, it has an increase in fat, lactose, and calories. 3. Mature milk is produced as lactogenesis stage II begins. By day 5, mother produces approximately 500 mL/day. IV. CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR BREASTFEEDING A. Occasionally there are circumstances that preclude mothers from breastfeeding. 1. Maternal contraindications include: a. HIV-positive mother (if living in the United States or otherwise has access to sanitary water). b. Maternal drug abuse. c. Maternal chemotherapy. d. Herpetic lesions on mother's nipple, areola. Expressed milk can be used from the unaffected side. Do not allow infant to come into direct contact with herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions. Cover active lesions. Encourage excellent handwashing technique by mother and those helping mother breastfeed. e. Untreated, active tuberculosis. Expressed breastmilk can be used. Breastfeeding may resume once mother is treated appropriately with anti-tuberculosis medication. f. Varicella in mother developed 5 days prior to delivery to 2 days after delivery requires mother and baby to be separated, but expressed breastmilk can be used. g. Certain radioactive compounds (such as iodine-131) and a few medica - tions may require temporary cessation of breastfeeding. It is unusual for the amount of medication transferred into breastmilk to cause a problem in the infant. Drugs that are problematic for breastfeeding can frequently be substituted with drugs that are compatible with breastfeeding. h. Positive HTLV-I and HTLV-II (human T-cell a. Classic galactosemia (ingesting any quantity of galactose can cause dysfunction of multiple organs). V. MATERNAL ASSESSMENT A. Assess both mother and baby for all factors that may affect the ability to suc - cessfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding. 1. Breastfeeding goals and family support. 2. Previous breastfeeding experience. 3. General health and nutritional status. 4. History of breast, nipple, or thoracic surgery, including piercings. 5. Medications, prescriptions, supplements, including over the counter (OTC). 6. Pregnancy, labor, birth history. 7. Inverted or flat nipples. 8. Breast assessment. VI. INFANT ASSESSMENT A. General health, including gestational age. B. Congenital anomalies. C. Birth history, including breastfeeding within the first hour of life and immedi - ate skin-to-skin contact D. Medications received and procedures experienced. E. Initial feeding attempts, frequency of feedings, ability to latch onto breast. F. Has infant roomed in with the mother 24/7 to successfully breastfeed in re - sponse to hunger cues? G. Oral facial assessment. VII. BREASTFEEDING IN THE EARLY DAYS A. Initial feedings. 1. Facilitate skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth and as often as possible. 2. Encourage breastfeeding within first hour after birth during quiet alert phase. Do not restrict length or frequency of feedings. 3. Promote rooming in 24 hours a day. 4. Encourage exclusive breastfeeding; this helps to establish and maintain sufficient milk supply.42 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeeding5. Instruct parents and support persons in correct latch-on techniques. 6. Educate parents and support persons regarding initial feedings of colos - trum: Quantity is very small, but sufficient nutrition as baby is learning to breastfeed. 7. Discourage use of any supplements unless medically indicated. 8. Avoid use of bottles and pacifiers until breastfeeding is well established. 9. Teach parents and support persons how to breastfeed in response to infant feeding cues (rooting, increased alertness, fists in mouth) at least 8-12 times/day. Recognize crying as late sign of hunger. 10. Baby should finish feeding on first breast, then be offered second if he/ she will take more. Fat content of milk is higher at end of feeding than at beginning. Forcing baby to switch breasts too soon may decrease amount of higher calorie milk consumed. 11. Babies who sleep for long periods of time without eating or feed only for few minutes should be awakened and encouraged to nurse (i.e., unwrap, rub feet). B. Positioning and latch. 1. Mother and infant should be comfortable with infant at nipple height, supported by pillows or blankets. 2. Support infant's head so he/she can easily reach areola without turning neck. 3. Infant's ear, shoulder, hips should be in alignment. 4. Mother can align her nipple with infant's nose, quickly bringing infant to breast only when his/her mouth opens widely, getting more of the areola on the bottom than top into his/her mouth, creating an asymmetrical latch (see Figur e 5-2). 5. Infant's lips should be flanged outward with chin touching breast. When latched properly, the tongue is drawn back to junction of the hard and soft palate (see Figure 5-3). 6. Infant's tongue will protrude over gum ridge and \"cup\" breast. 7. If baby latches incorrectly, the mother should insert her clean finger to break the suction and repeat latch-on attempts until baby is latched correctly. Mother's nails should be clean and short to avoid injuring the baby's mouth. 8. Common breastfeeding positions are cradle position (see Figure 5-4), cross cradle and football holds (see Figure 5-5), and side-lying position (see Figure 5-6). For an example of breastfeeding two babies simultane - ously, see Figure 5-7. 9. Trained practitioners should observe latch-on, milk transfer, and feed - ing at least once every 8 hours throughout postpartum hospitalization. Observations should be documented in medical record. 10. The mother's nipple should not be pinched, bruised, or creased at the end of a feeding or show any signs of damage (see Figure 5-8). VII.

Signs of milk transfer in infant. 1. Observe sustained, rhythmic suck/swallow pattern with intermittent pauses. 2. Listen for audible swallowing. 3. Baby's arms and hands should be relaxed at the end of the feeding. 4. Baby's oral mucous membranes should be moist after feedings. 5. Baby should appear satisfied after feedings. D. Signs of milk transfer in mother. 1. Mother feels strong tugging sensation when baby is sucking, which should not be painful. 2. Mother feels uterine contractions and increased lochia flow during initial days postpartum. 3. Milk may leak from opposite breast during feedings. 4. Mother may feel relaxed or drowsy during feedings. 5. Breast softens after feeding (after milk supply is established). 6. Nipples are elongated but not pinched or bruised after release of latch. E. Assessing infant weight gain. 1. Parents should be aware of baby's birth and discharge weights. 2. Encourage parents to keep a daily journal of first week to track feedings and output. Babies may feed 8-14 times a day in early weeks. A sleepy baby should be aroused every 3-4 hours and encouraged to feed. 3. Healthy, breastfeeding infants may lose 3-7% of birth weight in initial days; reassure parents this is common. 4. After mother's milk is in, infant should gain 0.5-1 ounce/day (4-7 ounces/week). 5. Babies often regain birth weight by 10 days of age, double birth weight by 6 months, triple birth weight by 1 year. 6. Exclusively breastfed infants tend to be leaner than bottle-fed infants in second 6 months of life. F. Assessing infant output. 1. Colostrum acts as laxative, encouraging expulsion of meconium in first days. 2. Effective and regular breastfeeding helps to prevent jaundice in early days. 3. Infants showing signs of jaundice should be assessed carefully for inef - fective breastfeeding. 4. Babies who are breastfeeding well should have 3 or more stools/day by day 3. Frequency will decrease by age 4-6 weeks. 5. Bowel movements become lighter in color, then turn to a mustard color and are seedy in consistency by day 4 or 5. 6. Inadequate stools are a red flag for ineffective breastfeeding. 7. Stool output may decrease to one stool every few days after first few weeks. 8. Urine output is less helpful than stool output in assessing adequate milk intake.50 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeeding9. Exclusively breastfed baby should produce 1 wet diaper on day 1; 2 on day 2; 3 on day 3; and so on, for first week. 10. By end of first week, baby should have 6 soaking wet, pale-yellow diapers/day. 11. Mother and baby should be scheduled to see a skilled healthcare provider within 48-72 hours of birthing facility discharge. VIII. SEPARATION OF MOTHER AND INFANT A. Pumping. 1. All mothers should be taught how to hand express their milk after birth. 2. If a small number of feedings must be missed, the mother can hand express or, if she prefers, use a battery-operated pump to express milk from both breasts every few hours. 3. Lengthy separation warrants use of hospital-grade, piston-style pump with double hookup system to establish, maintain, or increase mother's milk supply. Mothers should be instructed to pump at least 8 times/24 hours for approximately 15 minutes each session. 4. Pumping should begin within 6 hours of birth if the infant is not able to go to breast or if there is a contraindication to breastfeeding. Hand expression is often preferred during the first 24 hours when the quantity of colostrum is small. 5. Even the smallest quantity of expressed colostrum or milk can be fed to infant via eyedropper, syringe, or cup. 6. The first few drops of expressed milk do not need to be discarded. B. Milk collection and storage. 1. Recommendations for collection and storage of mother's milk for hospi - talized infant differ from those of the following instructions for the well child at home. 2. Mothers should wash hands thoroughly prior to pumping and keep nails short and clean. 3. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning of pump parts. Breastmilk storage containers must be thoroughly washed with hot, soapy water or put in dishwasher and be thoroughly dried. Sterilization is not needed. 4. Glass containers or BPA-free, food-grade, hard plastic containers with well-fitting lids are a good choice for storing milk. See Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) Clinical Protocol #8 for review of effect of storage container on milk cells. 5. Mother can encourage milk let down by looking at picture of baby, smell - ing piece of baby's clothing. VIII. Separation of Mother and Infant 516. Warm, wet washcloths on breast combined with breast massage prior to pumping may be helpful in starting milk flow. 7. Breastfeeding on one breast while pumping from other breast is an option. 8. All pumps are different. Encourage mother to find one that creates a comfort - able seal that provides appropriate suction. Pumping should not be painful. 9. For specific information on storing milk for home use for full-term infants, see the ABM Revised Protocol #8 (2017). IX. SUPPORTING BREASTFEEDING PAST THE EARLY DAYS A. Follow-up. 1. Breastfeeding infants should be seen by an appropriate healthcare pro - fessional within 48-72 hours after discharge and again at 2 weeks of age for successful feeding and appropriate weight gain assessment. Infants should always be evaluated in between scheduled visits for any concerns. 2. Breastfeeding mothers should be referred to a breastfeeding support group and local breastfeeding resources following hospital or birthing facility discharge. B. Maternal diet. 1. Encourage mother to eat a wide variety of healthy foods, eating when hungry and drinking to quench her thirst. Breastfeeding mothers should consume an additional 450-500 calories/day. a. Forcing large quantities of fluids will not increase milk production. b. No specific foods must be avoided by all breastfeeding mothers. c. Most foods do not bother most babies. d. If a particular food seems to bother baby, decrease/eliminate food for a week to 10 days and reassess situation. e. Many healthcare providers recommend continuing prenatal vitamins during breastfeeding. 2. It is recommended that all breastfed babies be supplemented with vitamin D 400 IU starting soon after birth. All infants, children, and adolescents should be receiving 400 IU/day of vitamin D. 3. Families with significant allergies should receive knowledgeable dietary counseling regarding possible need to eliminate certain foods while breastfeeding. C. Growth spurts. 1. Regardless of culture, women frequently worry about ability to provide enough milk for their baby.52 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeeding2. Teach parents that growth spurts (periods when babies want to nurse more frequently to meet rapid growth) usually occur around 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months. 3. Feed as often as baby wants to nurse to increase, then maintain, adequate milk supply. 4. Reinforce concept of supply and demand. 5. Supplementing with formula is strongly discouraged; mother's milk sup - ply will not increase without adequate stimulation to meet baby's growing demand for more milk. a. Breastfed infants have a more acidic intestinal environment than formula-fed babies early in life, which is beneficial. Bifidobacterium is the predominant intestinal bacteria in breastfed infants that has significant health benefits on infant's immune and digestive systems. Supplementing infant in early days with even small amounts of formula changes the gut environment. D. Medications and breastfeeding. 1. It is imperative that healthcare providers give information to mothers who breastfeed on the safety of medications based on appropriate, cur - rent research, citing the source. Each infant's individual situation must be assessed prior to determining appropriate use of any medication during breastfeeding. An excellent reference guide such as Hale and Rowe (2017) should be available in every clinical setting that deals with breastfeeding mothers. LactMed, published by the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health, is available online as a comprehensive source of infor - mation on medications and their risks when used by breastfeeding mothers. 2. Many medications likely to be prescribed to breastfeeding mothers should not affect maternal milk supply or infant's safety. Ibuprofen is a commonly used analgesic postpartum and is considered compatible with breastfeed - ing. Penicillins and cephalosporins, along with several of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) often used for depression, are also generally considered compatible. 3. Dose of medication transferred through breastmilk is almost always too low to be clinically significant or is poorly bioavailable to infant. 4. It is preferable for mothers to avoid using medication whenever possible. 5. Extensive benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh any potential risks in majority of cases. a. Medications should be safe for infants to consume. b. Choose drugs with breastfeeding information whenever possible. c. Choose shortest acting form of medication. d. Encourage feeding when maternal drug level is lowest. IX. Supporting Breastfeeding Past the Early Days 53e. Educate parents as to potential side effects to observe in infant, and effect on milk supply. f. Be extra cautious with preterm, low-birth-weight, or sick infants. g. Certain herbal substances may be harmful to infants. h. Drugs of abuse are contraindicated in breastfeeding. i. Temporary cessation of breastfeeding is necessary with certain radioactive compounds. Consult appropriate resources for detailed information. E. Maternal employment. 1. Returning to the workplace while continuing to provide breastmilk for baby may initially seem overwhelming to some mothers. Strong encour - agement, praise, and continuous support can make the difference between a mother being successful and giving up. 2. Women need private, clean place to pump every few hours while separated from their infant. Encourage mothers to rent or purchase a pump that is comfortable and that is efficient for their particular needs. 3. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, requires employers with greater than 50 employees to provide break times for nursing mothers. Lactation supplies and counseling are also covered by private insurance companies, but not Medicaid. Encourage patients to check with their individual policy for their specific benefits. 4. Refrigerate or chill expressed milk as soon as possible. For specific infor - mation on storing milk for home use for full-term infants, see the ABM Revised Protocol #8 (2017). 5. Provide information on how to introduce a bottle to the infant, as well as suggestions for the caregiver that will promote extended breastfeeding (i.e., not bottle feeding immediately before mother will pick up infant, proper handling and storage of breastmilk). 6. Encourage mother to return to work midweek or part time initially, if possible, to help ease transition of returning to work. X. COMMON PROBLEMS A. Mothers can complain about pain even when damage is not visible on the breast or nipple. Determine that baby is positioned properly at breast height with adequate support and is latching on correctly. Mothers often describe the feeling of their baby feeding as a strong tugging sensation. Breastfeeding should not be painful. Nipples do not \"toughen up\" as breastfeeding proceeds. Assess for other causes of sore nipples such as trauma, improper latch and release, thrush, milk plugs on nipple, incorrect use of breastfeeding devices, or 54 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeedinga tight frenulum in the infant (see Figure 5-9). Paget's disease, an uncommon type of breast cancer, must also be ruled out. Breastfeeding issues that do not resolve quickly should promptly be referred to pediatric or maternal experts for further management. B. Sore nipple management includes: 1. Assess for correct positioning and latch-on. 2. Teach mothers how to express colostrum/hindmilk to apply to nipples after each feeding. 3. Allow nipples to dry before putting bra back on. 4. Offer use of breast shells to prevent clothing from rubbing against sore nipples. Instruct in proper cleaning of shells. 5. Breastfeed from least sore side first. 6. Change positions at each feeding to decrease pressure on sore area. 7. Suggest moist wound-healing methods (i.e., modified lanolin or hydrogel dressings). 8. Analgesics as needed. C. Flat or inverted nipples. 1. Can initially make breastfeeding more of a challenge. May be difficult for baby to latch on and breastfeed well. Provide adequate support to ensure successful feedings. X. Common Problems 55 Figure 5-9 Tight frenulum. Courtesy of Dr. Greg Notestine.2. \"Pinch test\": Determines if nipple is flat or inverted upon compression. With thumb behind nipple and first two fingers underneath, grasp about 1 inch back from base of nipple and compress skin. a. Normal nipple will evert. b. Flat nipple remains flat with compression. c. Inverted nipple looks sunken in. d. Nipples can look flat or inverted, but evert on compression. 3. Flat or inverted management: a. Encourage deepest possible latch onto breast. b. Make sure infant is at breast height and well supported to prevent sliding to base of nipple. c. Release latch and repeat attempts until proper latch is obtained. Al - lowing baby to suck at base of nipple prevents stimulating milk supply and will cause sore nipples. d. Encourage offering flat/inverted breast first when baby is hungriest and sucking is strongest. e. Teach mother to evert nipple with gentle pulling/rolling immediately prior to latch. f. Hand express a few drops of colostrum to entice baby to latch on. g. Use hand/electric pump for a few minutes immediately prior to latch. h. If supplement is medically indicated, use expressed milk first using an eyedropper, syringe, cup, or feeding tube at the breast. i. Avoid pacifiers and bottle nipples until breastfeeding is well established. D. Severe engorgement. 1. Milk stasis caused by inefficient, infrequent removal of milk results in extremely full, swollen, lumpy, painful breasts. 2. Result is different from transient breast fullness associated with milk \"coming in\" 2-4 days after birth. 3. Breastfeeding emergency: Milk stasis can cause damage to tissue, decrease milk supply, and make it difficult to impossible for infant to compress areola and remove milk. 4. Severe engorgement management includes: a. Analgesics as necessary. b. Warm, wet compresses to breast prior to feedings to help increase milk flow. c. Reverse pressure softening; soften areola using hand expression so baby can latch properly. d. Use breast compression during feedings to improve milk flow. Using thumb on top of breast and fingers underneath, the mother brings her fingers together, which compresses breast.56 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeedinge. Use of cold compresses may help to decrease engorgement after feed - ing. Some mothers like to use this prior to feeding as well. f. Use of clean, chilled green cabbage leaves left on breast for a short period several times/day can be helpful to some mothers. Stop using this as soon as engorgement decreases. g. Express milk after feeding as needed for comfort. Any expressed milk can be fed to baby using alternative feeding methods. E. Mastitis. 1. Infection of breast, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus . 2. Frequently occurs in upper outer quadrant of breast, often by 2-3 weeks postpartum. 3. Symptoms commonly include hard, swollen, reddened area on breast accompanied by flulike symptoms. 4. Important to differentiate among engorgement, plugged duct, mastitis (Table 5-1). 5. Mastitis management includes: a. Rest (decrease stress and fatigue by enlisting support from spouse/ partner, friends, family). b. Antibiotics; encourage completing full course as prescribed. c. Increase maternal fluid intake. X. Common Problems 57 T able 5-1 Comparison of Findings of Engorgement, Plugged Duct, and Mastitis Characteristics Engorgement Plugged Duct Mastitis Onset Gradual, immediately postpartumGradual, after feedingsSudden, after 10 days Site Bilateral Unilateral Unusually unilateral Swelling and heat Generalized May shift; little or no heatLocalized, red, hot, and swollen Pain Generalized Mild but localized Intense but localized Body temperature < 38.4\u00b0C (101\u00baF) < 38.4\u00b0C (101\u00baF) > 38.4\u00b0C (101\u00b0F) Systemic symptoms Feels well Feels well Flulike symptoms Reproduced from Lawrence RA, Lawrence RM. Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession . 8th ed. St Louis, MO: Mosby; 2015, with permission from Elsevier.d. Frequent, effective emptying of breasts (important to continue breast - feeding; milk is not infected, fine for baby). e. Abrupt weaning can predispose to an abscess. f. Analgesics as needed. g. Correct latch to prevent further nipple trauma (cracked, bleeding nipples allow bacteria to enter milk ducts). h. Mother's preference of warm or cool packs for comfort. F. Jaundice. 1. Rarely requires cessation of breastfeeding. 2. Pathologic jaundice, with onset in first 24 hours of life, warrants medical evaluation in addition to lactation support. 3. Encourage early initiation of breastfeeding, then frequent, effective, un - restricted feedings to minimize jaundice. 4. Colostrum acts as laxative, eliminating bilirubin through meconium expulsion. 5. Physiologic jaundice, which begins 48-72 hours after birth and peaks on day 3-5, is seen in thriving infants with normal weight gain and output. 6. Observe for effective breastfeeding and continue assessment for normal weight gain and output. Onset and peak of breastfeeding associated with jaundice is similar to physiologic jaundice, but infant is fussy/sleepy with poor feeding and inadequate weight gain, output. 7. Assist with frequent, unrestricted, effective breastfeeding. 8. Teach parents to watch for signs of milk transfer during feedings. If neces - sary, express milk in addition to feedings; use alternate feeding methods to give baby milk. G. Thrush. 1. Often described as burning, itching, stinging lasting throughout feeding and beyond, radiating from nipple and breast to shoulder and back. 2. Nipple or areolar skin is often red and shiny. 3. May have period of pain-free nursing, then have sudden onset of pain. 4. Pain from poor latch is often described as feeling like a knife or being stabbed, dissipates as feeding progresses, frequently limited to nipple and areola. 5. Regardless of nipple pain, poor latch must be corrected immediately. 6. Broken skin is perfect environment for organisms to invade. 7. Signs in infant may range from nothing to white patches on buccal mucosa, tongue, and palate, which may bleed when scraped with tongue blade. Fiery red diaper rash with shiny red patches and pustules may also be present. 8. Both mother and baby should be treated simultaneously with appropri - ate antifungal medications to prevent reinfection from one to the other. 9. All objects (pumping supplies, pacifiers, bottles) coming in contact with baby's mouth should be boiled daily.58 CHAPTER 5 Guidelines for Breastfeeding10. Mothers should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding while treating infection. 11. Candida albicans thrives in warm, moist, dark areas, and thrives on sugar. Nipples can be rinsed with clear water or vinegar solution of 1 tablespoon vinegar in 1 cup of water after each feeding, exposing to air after each feeding. 12. Bed linens, sheets, bras can be rinsed in vinegar solution after hot wash cycle. Breast pads should be disposable and changed as soon as wet. 13. Sexual contact between mother and partner can spread infection. Partner should be treated appropriately. H. Weight-gain concerns. 1. Breastfed infants gaining less than appropriate amount for age should be carefully evaluated. Often, correcting latch and positioning are enough to facilitate efficient breastfeeding and improve weight gain. 2. Do not recommend formula supplementation without evaluating breast - feeding. If extra calories are needed, have mother hand express or pump in addition to breastfeeding and use alternative feeding methods to give baby breastmilk. 3. Allowing baby to finish feeding on one breast before feeding on second allows sufficient amounts of higher calorie breastmilk. 4. Review with parents appropriate signs of infant hunger, encourage frequent (8-12 or more/24 hours), unrestricted feedings. 5. Keeping written log of feedings and output is also helpful. Imperative that infant has adequate caloric intake. 6. If after evaluation and management with skilled breastfeeding consul - tant breastfeeding is not going well, formula supplementation may be appropriate. Plan for maintaining/increasing mother's milk supply must be implemented. 7. Return office visit within 24-48 hours to monitor situation should be scheduled. Frequent phone follow-up, support are necessary. 8. Global growth charts updated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010 reflect standards on how children should grow based on breast - feeding as the norm. XI. HELPFUL BREASTFEEDING RESOURCES A.

Zickler Constipation, K59.0 unspecified R17Neonatal jaundice, unspecified, P59.9 Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen, R19.8 Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption, R21 Retention of urine, unspecified, R33.9 Vomiting, unspecified, R11.10 I. GENERAL IMPRESSION A. Parents are settling in with 2-week-old infant, each getting acquainted with other. If infant was still losing weight at discharge, bilirubin was above 10 mg/ dL, or infant had a heart murmur at discharge, he/she needs to be seen in the office within 2 days. B. Infant should have a naked weight, length on length board, and head circum - ference performed at each visit. Compare birth weight and discharge weight with weight obtained at visit. Determine daily weight gain since discharge. Be sure to review mother's history during pregnancy. If history of drug or alcohol abuse, assess infant behavior in light of findings. C. A brief exam noting muscle tone, symmetry, and heart sounds and murmurs should be performed. Check for hip clicks by doing Orolani and Barlow tests. D. At 2 weeks of age, infant's cord should have fallen off or be dry or looking like it will likely fall off soon, but not moist and smelly. E. Jaundice should be resolved except in some breastfed infants. If unresolved, do a transcutaneous bilirubin. F. Newborn screen results should be reviewed and be negative. Share report with parents. 75CHAPTER 7G. Review the newborn hearing screen. If hearing is within normal limits, share with parents. If abnormal, schedule baby for an auditory brainstem response (ABR) or an otoacoustic emissions test (OAE) before leaving the office. All infants should be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age. H. Reflexes present should be rooting, Galant (trunk incurvation), placing and stepping, Landau (infant lifts head when suspended in prone position), asym - metric tonic neck. I. Ask parents what kind of concerns they have. Call infant by name. Acknowledge challenge of adapting to life with a newborn. II. NUTRITION A. Breastfeeding is encouraged for all newborns. If mother is breastfeeding, ask specific questions: 1. Does the baby latch on well? 2. How long will baby nurse at one time? 3. How frequently are you nursing? 4. How many wet diapers? 5. How many stools? 6. Are you having any irritation or pain from your nipples? B. Review all medications that mother may be taking. If mother expresses concern about nursing, observe a nursing session, give suggestions, and obtain lactation consult from hospital lactation resource. (See Chapter 5.) C. If baby is bottle fed, review preparation and number of feedings, how much baby is taking each time, number of wet diapers, and number of stools per day. Commercially prepared, iron-fortified formulas come in powder, concentrate, and ready-to-feed options. Remind parent to not dilute ready-to-feed formula. Follow directions for mixing concentrate and powder. 1. Do not reuse bottle/formula if more than 4 hours since opened. 2. Mix formulas with bottled water for first month; continue to use bottled water if house is on well/unsure of water quality. Store mixed and open formula in refrigerator; do not feed formula that has been premixed and in the refrigerator longer than 24 hours. Specialized formulas have similar preparation directions; read labels. Goat's milk, whole cow's milk, and rice milk have inadequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. 3. Serve formula at room temperature. Do not microwave to heat. Do not let formula sit out to warm for more than 15-20 minutes. 4. Clean technique is sufficient for mixing formulas. Clean off cans with soap and water before opening. Use hot soapy water and bottlebrush to clean nipples and bottles or clean in dishwasher.76 CHAPTER 7 Two-Week Visit5. Hold infant in upright, semi-reclined position; burp every 1-2 ounces. No bottle propping. Babies will suck and then rest during the entire feeding. Encourage mother to let her partner feed the baby at least once during the day. 6. No smoking or drinking hot beverages while holding baby. Limit noise in the immediate area when doing feeding, and focus on baby. Talk or sing to baby. 7. Infant should take in 90 cc of feeding in first 20 minutes. A 2-week-old infant takes 3-5 ounces/feeding, 5-6 feedings/24 hours (90-120 cal/kg/day). Remind parents that they should not be feeding the baby for more than 20-25 minutes at a time, as this tires baby out and baby has no time to rest between feedings. III. ELIMINATION A. Bowel movements should be formed or soft with no green color. Infant should have 1-6 yellow pasty stools/24 hours. B. Breastfed infant may have upper range of frequency with less formed texture. C. Infant voids every 1-3 hours or with each feeding and diaper change. IV. SLEEP A. Awake and alert for feedings, every 2-4 hours. Should nurse vigorously for 15-20 minutes, then fall back to sleep. B. Babies should sleep in own cribs to decrease smothering or injury. Babies should sleep on their back in cribs to decrease incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). V. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A. Growth. 1. Should regain birth weight by 2 weeks. Should gain 0.5-1 ounces/day or approximately 2 pounds/month for next 5 months. 2. Infant grows, on average, 1 inch/month for first 6 months. 3. Head circumference increases 0.5 cm/month in first year. B. Development. 1. Moves all four extremities, keep hands fisted, and has flexed posture. 2. Has startle response to noises. V. Growth and Development 773. May have a smile. May begin to look for \"who is talking. \" 4. May have \"fussy\" time of 1-2 hours/day, often in evening. 5. Should have some supervised, \"tummy\" play time (15-20 minutes/session). 6. Ask about behavior after feedings to determine any colic or reflux. VI. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT A. Babies have specific sounds/cries for specific needs. They will fuss/cry 1-2 hours/ day. Providing for infant's needs should stop the crying. Crying gradually decreases by 3 months of age. B. Infant needs holding; touching; feeding; dry, clean diaper; warm, yet comfort - able environment. C. Discourage taking baby to public places or visiting relatives because infant has not been immunized. Sick adults should stay away from infant. D. Encourage mother to rest when baby rests/sleeps. Determine if night times are \"awake times for the pair\" and the mother is not getting her sleep. E. Encourage parents to share caretaking responsibilities. VII. IMMUNIZATIONS A. If mother is HBsAg negative, infant may not have received first hepatitis B vaccine in newborn nursery and will need to get it at 2-week visit or before 2 months of age. If infant received hepatitis B immunization in the nursery, he/she will need to get four hepatitis B immunizations. B. Infant should not have fever or fussiness from the immunization. C. Discuss importance of getting immunizations. Many parents are concerned about risks. One in eight parents in the United States refused at least one recommended vaccine for their child. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has resources on the importance of vaccines that can be shared with parents. VIII. SAFETY/ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE A. Sleep position \"back to sleep. \" Infants should be placed in supine position for every sleep until age of 1 year. Side sleeping is not safe and not recommended. Supine position does not increase the risk of choking and aspiration. Elevating head of bed is ineffective in reducing esophageal reflux. Preterm infants (at least 32 weeks' gestation) should be placed in the supine position for sleeping. 78 CHAPTER 7 Two-Week VisitProne position is only used when infant is observed and awake, and then for only brief periods of time. 1. Not safe for baby to sleep in adult bed. Room sharing without bed shar - ing is recommended. Keep soft objects and loose bedding out of the crib. 2. Room temperature should be comfortable, and clothing should not present a health hazard (no loose-fitting sleepers with hoods). 3. No pillows/toys in the crib that could potentially smother child. Infant should sleep on a firm, flat surface in a safety-approved crib covered by a fitted sheet and no blankets or pillows in the bed. Infants younger than 4 months should not be put to bed in their car seat, but rather sleep in crib in parent's room. 4. All childcare providers should be taught safe sleep guidelines prior to caring for infant. B. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards-tested and -approved car seat: Installed properly in backseat, facing backward in automobile. Contact local hospital, fire department, or March of Dimes for car seat rental programs. C. No smoking around infant. D. Reassure parents they cannot spoil infant at this age. Encourage responding to infant's needs and learning infant's temperament. Encourage parents to learn different cries that infants use when communicating. E. Discuss sibling jealousy and possible regression of toddler. Encourage parent to spend \"special time\" with older sibling. F. Discuss pet safety: Do not leave infant unattended near pet. G. Discuss toys. Specific information on products can be found at the Consumer Product Safety Commission's website (www.cpsc.gov). H. Discuss what to look for when choosing babysitter or daycare (e.g., handwashing, number of children per caretaker, sick policy, feeding techniques, licensing). I. May consider using a pacifier to try and soothe the baby. One-piece pacifiers only, discuss appropriate use of pacifiers. Should not pin them on a string to baby's clothing; wash with soap and water if they fall out of the baby's mouth, do not lick or moisten it prior to giving to baby. J. May give 1 ounce of sterile water in 24 hours if stools are very hard. No corn syrup (Karo) for constipation. K. No solids. L. Remind parents of when and how to call healthcare provider. Review call-in phone policy and explain hours that are best to call office. 1. Breathing difficulties. 2. Seizures. 3. Irritability. 4. Poor feeding, vomiting. VIII. Safety/Anticipatory Guidance 795. No urine in 12 hours, black or decreased bowel movements. 6. Reddened, draining umbilical site. 7. Jaundice. 8. Rash or pustules not present on discharge. 9. Concerns. BIBLIOGRAPHY Adler LC.

Parents and infant should be settling into routine and more comfortable with each other. Parent should be very attentive to the infant and have lots of ques - tions. There should also be a sense that parent is comfortable with the infant. Parent is able to describe characteristics of infant's temperament. Mother should have someone identified with whom she can leave baby for brief periods of time. Ask how baby's father participates and interacts with the infant. B. If mother has history of drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy or is currently using drugs, assess infant for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Look for jit - teriness, high-pitched cry, inconsolable, voracious appetite with little weight gain. Some neonatal drug withdrawal presents as late as 1 month after birth. Infant may require increased caloric feedings and comfort measures for par - ent to utilize. Mother should be referred for counseling and therapy to assist with the problem. II. NUTRITION A. Breastfeeding is to be encouraged. Determine if baby is satisfied after feedings, how frequently baby is nursing, how long a feeding takes, and any concerns mom has about continuing nursing.

Two-month-old infant will take 6-8 ounces/feeding, 4-6 feedings/24 hours (94-130 kcal/kg/day). Feedings should be more predictable, and infant should have periods when he/she sleeps for 3-4 hours at a time. B. Baby should take in 90 cc of feeding in first 20 minutes of the feeding. Prolong - ing feedings for more than half an hour at a time tires baby and mother and tends to make feedings stressful. C. Hold infant in semi-reclined position; burp every 1-2 ounces. D. Specialized formulas have similar preparation directions; read labels. Goat's milk, whole cow's milk, and rice milk have inadequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. E.

Clean technique is sufficient for mixing formulas. 1. Clean off cans with soap and water before opening. 2. Use hot soapy water and bottlebrush to clean nipples and bottles or clean in dishwasher. G. No bottle propping. Pacifiers are used for nonnutritive sucking. Breastfeeding should be well established before starting infant on a pacifier, but babies who suck pacifiers are at decreased incidence of sudden infant death. H. No smoking or drinking hot beverages while holding baby. III. ELIMINATION A. Should have 1-5 yellow, pasty, but formed stools/24 hours. B. Breastfed babies may have more stools than bottle-fed babies. C. Should void every 1-3 hours or with each feeding and diaper change. IV. SLEEP A. Babies sleep 16-18 hours/24 hours. Infant is developing sleep pattern. May sleep through night. May have longer awake periods during day. B. Sleep cycles have both active and quiet sleep periods in equal proportions. Each sleep cycle lasts 50-60 minutes. Infants are less efficient with sleep and easily interrupted with noise. Should be alert for feedings, nurse vigorously for 15-20 minutes, and fall back to sleep/stay awake for short periods. C. Babies should sleep in own cribs, not with parents, to decrease smothering injury to infant. 1. Babies should sleep on back in their cribs and not in parents' bed. 2. No pillows/toys that baby could get face against and be smothered. V. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A.

Encourage mother to take breaks away from baby to do self-nurturing (needs designated sitter). E. Take baby on selective, limited outings because infant is not fully immunized; will only receive first set today. F. Ask about plans for returning to work. Discuss guidelines for selecting sitter/daycare. G. May have \"fussy\" time of 1-2 hours/day, often in evening. Use \"fussy\" time as interaction time, not extra feeding. Cry gradually decreases by 3 months of age. Baby may have symptoms of \"colic\" (starts 2-3 weeks of age, ceases by 12 weeks). Infant cries for prolonged periods, no specific cause or etiology identified. Infant continues to grow well. Infant is alert and playful at other times. Infant may require additional comfort measures to quiet and settle and should be accepted as expected for age. H. Should have some supervised \"tummy\" play time while awake during each day. This helps infant develop strength and coordination and minimizes flat - tening of the skull. I. Encourage parent to actively talk, play with infant. Select age-appropriate toys. VII. IMMUNIZATIONS A. Infant will receive first set of immunizations today. Combinations are available that decrease number of injections and provide as good an immunity as single VII. Immunizations 89doses. Parents trust providers to guide them in their decision to immunize their children. Need to discuss risks and benefits of immunizations and have parent sign consent. The following immunizations are best practice for 2-month-old infants: hepatitis after immunizations may decrease the response to the vaccine. Only a few infants tend to have fevers after immunizations. C. Parents may be reluctant to let baby receive immunizations due to inaccurate information.

The world is forever changed by the new ability to move , explore, and control the environment. I. NUTRITION A. Requirements: Growth slows in toddlerhood, decreasing energy needs to 102 kcal/kg/day (approximately 1000-1300 kcal/day), 1.23 g of protein/kg/ day, fluids to 115 mL/kg/day; growth averages about 4.4 pounds (2 kg) and 4.5 inches (11 cm)/year. 1. Servings should be 1-2 tablespoons of each food for each year of life, or about \u00bc- of adult servings. 2. Milk (whole until age 2 years) should be limited to < 24 ounces/day (16 ounces is adequate) due to lack of iron and interference with intake of other nutrients. Calcium requirements are 700 mg/day and vitamin D 600 IU/day. 3. Specific nutritional needs: Fat 30% of diet ( < 10% of total daily caloric intake should come from saturated fats); protein 5-20%, carbohydrates to 45-65% (very little from high-sugar carbs). 4. Screen for anemia risk factors: Large amounts of cow's milk/day, if still on the bottle, diet deficient in other iron-rich foods. (Nutritional requirement for iron intake is 7 mg/day.) 117CHAPTER 14B. Eating habits. 1. Understanding toddlers. a. Lifelong eating habits, food preferences, activity level have roots in the early self-feeding experiences of toddlers. b. They are able to recognize themselves as separate from others and need to explore independence by testing limits, including feeding limits. c. They recognize the newness and difference of foods and also crave the comfort of rituals. d. Toddlers often have appetite slumps or are sporadic eaters. If at daycare, they may only eat well at midday with other children, so parent rarely sees them eat. Or they may need 2 days to get all of the food groups in. 2. Promoting good habits: Now is the time to help your child develop healthy eating habits and make good choices. As he or she becomes more independent: a. Be a good role model. Eat meals as a family, without TV , at regularly scheduled times. b. Provide nutritious snacks 2-3 times/day in between meals, not as a reward; limit sugar. Ideas for healthy snacks including amounts: low-sugar cup soft cheeses; 3-4 whole grain crackers. c. Allow choices and experimentation; do not force. Offer new foods several times in order to give the child an opportunity to learn to accept and like it. d. Allow toddler to self-feed with hands or utensils. Use cup, not bottle. e. Limit fruit juice to 4-6 ounces/day. f. Serve appropriately sized portions; examples: \u00bd piece of fresh or \u00bc cup canned (preferably in its own juice) fruit. 2 tablespoons cooked vegetables. 1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter (thinly spread on cracker or bread). \u00bd egg, 2 tablespoons ground meat. cup yogurt, \u00bd cup milk. 1-2 crackers, \u00bc-\u00bd slice of bread. 3. Safe eating. a. Sit when eating; avoid eating in the car. b. Avoid screaming, fighting, tickling while eating. c. Avoid foods that can cause choking: Popcorn. Hot dogs, chunks of meat, hunks of cheese. Globs of peanut butter with or without bread.118 CHAPTER 14 Fifteen- to Eighteen-Month Visit Large seeds; nuts, especially peanuts (or foods containing nuts). Hard or sticky candy, jelly beans. Large chunks of raw vegetables or fruits. Whole grapes (must be cut in quarters). Chewing gum. 4. Preventing obesity. a. Obesity rates in children aged 2-5 years have actually gone down from 13.9% in 2004 to 9.4% in 2014, though the overall rate of obesity in children and adolescents is at an all-time high. b. Develop healthy eating habits at an early age, such as not overfeeding, limiting sugary foods, encouraging healthful snacks, limiting amounts, and cultivating toddler's natural tendency to eat only when hungry. Do not allow child to fill up on fluids and snacks all day or eat in the car, while playing, or while watching TV . II. ELIMINATION: TOILET TRAINING A. Attempting to toilet train a child younger than 24 months of age is often inadvisable; however, developmental readiness and success rates are somewhat dependent on gender, ethnicity, and even childcare settings. Most children do begin to show some interest in elimination, though perhaps not in training, between the ages of 18 and 24 months. 1. Parents are encouraged to watch the child for signs of readiness: a. Child is dry at least 2 hours at a time during the day or is dry after naps. b. Bowel movements become regular and predictable. c. Facial expressions, posture, or words reveal that the child is about to urinate or have a bowel movement. This is one of the most crucial signs\u2014to be able to tell prior to the incident , not just after the event, which is an earlier skill. d. Child asks to wear grown-up underwear. e. Child asks to use the potty chair or toilet. f. Child seems uncomfortable with soiled diapers and wants to be changed. g. Child is able to follow simple directions. h. Child is able to walk to and from the bathroom and help undress. 2. Parents are encouraged to introduce children to the \"business\" of toileting by allowing children to observe older children/parents when appropriate, obtain a potty chair and sit on it, and flush the toilet. 3. Discourage parents from considering toilet training if the child is under stress; they should not suppress the desire to use the potty, but should not II. Elimination: Toilet Training 119pressure the child in any way to train, nor be surprised if he/she regresses. Stress factors can include: a. New sibling arriving. b. Moving houses. c. Family crisis such as death, major illness. 4. Encourage use of proper names for body parts and for products of elimi - nation. Without making bowel movements sound \"dirty\" or \"nasty, \" teach children that we do not play with feces. 5. Pick a potty chair that offers foot support either in the chair itself or because it is low to the floor. Some children may prefer to use the adult toilet with a \"ring, \" making it an appropriate fit. 6. Read books about pottying together with the child. 7. Try to make pottying routine. Everyone generally goes first thing in the morning, before bed, before bath, after meals. Try for a few minutes, but do not fight about it as that undoubtedly will hinder the process. 8. Be sensitive to the child's fears concerning toileting such as \"loud\" toilets, spilling potties, using public restrooms, differences over having bowel movements and urinating. 9. Positive reinforcement and sensing the child's readiness and pace of learn - ing are essential for success. III. SLEEP A. Requirements. 1. Averages 12 hours total/day. 2. One to two naps/day; may have difficulty combining morning and after - noon naps. B. Difficulty with sleep. 1. Common, especially going to sleep and falling asleep. 2. May be due to separation anxiety and independence issues. C. Strategies to assist sleep. 1. Bedtime rituals: Standard sleep time, snack, quiet activity. 2. Utilizing transitional objects such as special toy, blanket. 3. Place child in bed while awake. 4. Check on child at progressively longer intervals. 5. Comfort, but do not feed, rock, or place child in bed with parent. 6. Ideally, institute above strategies prior to child being able to climb out of crib.120 CHAPTER 14 Fifteen- to Eighteen-Month Visit IV. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A. Physical growth slows. 1. Average increases in second year of life: 4.5 pounds, height 4 inches, occipital frontal circumference (OFC) 1\". a. If weight increases < 1 kg/year (2.2 pounds/year), monitor closely, consider referral. 2. Anterior fontanel closes by 18 months. 3. Head is in smaller proportion to the body. 4. Physique ducklike: Lordotic, pot-bellied, bow-legged. 5. Vision binocular (true strabismus should be referred). 6. 14 teeth averaged by 18 months. 7. Immune system much better developed, but passive immunities from mother gone (especially if not breastfed), and just beginning increased exposure to antigens in environment. B. Development. 1. Physical: Utilizing newly developed locomotion skills and wanting to control the environment. Toddlers push and carry large objects; put themselves into spaces such as boxes, cabinets, and under tables; delight in repetitive throwing and retrieving; scribbling. Handedness is established. 2. Speech: By 18 months, understands much of language spoken but commands relatively few words (has good receptive skills). Largest jump in language is in second half of second year. The \"big talkers\" tend to be first-born girls. 3. Emotional/social: Toddlers strive for independence, autonomy, and are looking for admiration and positive reinforcement of newly found skills. They still experience dependency needs (separation anxiety) during this quest. Beginning body image development. Negativism is a part of indi - vidualization. May be becoming aware of gender. 4. Cognitive (intellectual): Toddlers are beginning to work on causality with an increase in physical abilities and memory development. Starting to see objects symbolically. Imagination begins. Note: Early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including atypical development in socialization and communication, are now detected by pediatric providers in children as young as toddlerhood. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine screening of all children for ASD at ages 18 and 24 months using a standardized questionnaire such as such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ; www.agesandstages .com), Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status (Pedtest; www.pedtest .com). Most pediatric practices use the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised (M-CHAT-R [www.MCHATscreen.com]; valid ages IV. Growth and Development 12116-30 months; www.patienttools.com). Broadly, early signs of autism behaviors include decreases in frequency of gaze to the examiner's face, social smiles, and vocalizations to others. C. Developmental milestones. 1. By 15 months: Uses 3-6 words; can point to a body part; understands simple commands; walks well; stoops and recovers; creeps up stairs; stacks 3-4 blocks; puts 10 blocks in cup; feeds self with fingers and uses spoon with some spilling; drinks from a cup; turns pages in book; tells what he/ she wants by pulling, pointing, or grunting; hugs back. 2. By 18 months: Walks backward; runs well; throws ball; uses 10-20 words; understands \"mine\"; pulls a toy along the ground; listens to a story, looks at pictures and names objects; shows affection; kisses; follows simple directions; points to some body parts; scribbles; engages in pretend play. D. Developmental delay: Possible referral if not present by 18 months: 1. Walks upstairs with assistance. 2. Sits, stands, and walks independently. 3. Self-feeds, with spoon at times. 4. Grasps and manipulates small objects. 5. Mimics actions of others. 6. Uses at least 8 words. 7. Shows signs of sensitivity to others' emotions V. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT A. Growth, development, and socialization of the child are demonstrated in play activities. The toddler progresses from the sensorimotor play of infancy to parallel play, incorporating imitation, fine and gross motor skills, and new language. B. Appropriate toys for the toddler are: Swing sets, sandboxes, play kitchens, play tools, musical and \"talking\" toys (especially interactive ones), riding toys (especially without pedals), push toys, balls, containers, telephones, mirrors, dolls and puppets, large crayons, and books. (Contact Reach Out and Read for information in setting up a literacy promotion program in clinics and offices: www.reachoutandread.org.) C. The toddler's new mobility and drive for autonomy make discipline a new challenge for the parent and caregiver. Appropriate discipline guidelines for the toddler include offering choices when available, including following a \"no\" with a \"yes, \" keeping rules simple and few, removing objects about which there is constant disagreement, \"catching the child being good, \" and rewarding 122 CHAPTER 14 Fifteen- to Eighteen-Month Visit positive behaviors with verbal praise and physical affection. Time out is not appropriate until 2.5-3 years. D. Parents should be encouraged to help the child learn to express emotions such as joy, fear, anger, sadness, frustration. E. Dealing with temper tantrums. 1. Tantrums are a frequent occurrence in toddlers as the young child begins to establish independence and easily becomes frustrated in doing so. Tod - dler also often does not have every need met immediately (hunger and fatigue) and is even told \"no\" on occasion. 2. Parents should: Attend to hunger and sleep needs if possible to help allay underlying causes; stay calm, firm, and consistent; help allay frustrations by helping the child do/learn whatever it is that is frustrating him/her; distract the child by offering an alternate activity; quietly walk away. 3. Time out can be used with a toddler. One minute per year of age is recom - mended for time out. This may be too long for a toddler, however, and the adult may need to help the child physically (and calmly) stay in time out, again, keeping all conversation to a minimum, to avoid reinforcing negative behavior by giving it attention. Many children quickly learn that they are able to acquire a parent's one-on-one attention with negative behavior and often do not care if it is negative attention. 4. Praise and give reinforcement for positive behaviors such as tantrums ceasing. Give choices if possible. 5. Spanking has no place in the discipline (which means teaching) of children. When spanking and hitting are used by parents, children often learn to use physical force to express anger and deal with conflict. 6. Signs of abnormal behaviors may include: Self-injurious behavior during a tantrum, consistent aggressive behavior toward others or destructive behavior toward objects > 50% of the time during a tantrum, high frequency of tantrums ( > 5/day or > 10-20/month), tantrums lasting longer than 25 minutes. VI. SAFETY A. Toddlers are at increased risk for injury due to increased locomotion and primitive cognition. Leading causes of death and injury and prevention strategies follow. B. Motor vehicles. 1. Use federally approved car seat in backseat of vehicle. Previous guide - lines said that the child could face forward if older than 1 year and VI. Safety 123 > 20 pounds, but now it is recommended that a child be rear facing until 2 years of age. Use 1-866-SEAT-CHECK or www.seatcheck.org for child safety seat inspection. 2. Use bike helmet. 3. Teach children pedestrian/vehicle safety. 4. Never allow toddlers to play alone outside. C. Poisoning. 1. Use child-proof caps on medications; keep medications and household poisons (including plants) out of reach or better locked. 2. Have poison control telephone number readily available for all care - givers, 1-800-222-1222. Do not make your child vomit if poisonous substance is consuming. Never tell children medication is candy. 3. Screen for lead risk. See screening guidelines. D. Burns. 1. Use caution in kitchen with young children present. 2. Turn handles of cooking utensils away from outer edge of stove. 3. Adjust hot water to 120\u00b0F (48.88\u00b0C) or lower. 4. Keep matches/candles out of reach. 5. Use sunscreen when children are exposed to sunlight. 6. Keep sockets covered and cords out of sight. 7. Have working smoke detector on every floor of the house. E. Drowning. 1. Supervise closely near any water, including buckets. A child can drown in 2 inches of water. 2. Fence swimming pools on all four sides with fence that is at least 4-feet high, with self-latching gates. 3. Close bathroom doors and put lid down on toilet. 4. Utilize life preservers in addition to above. F. Choking and suffocation. 1. Do not give danger foods listed in nutrition section (including nuts, hot dogs, gum, hard candy). 2. Only allow play with age-appropriate items (no small pieces). 3. Discard old appliances/furniture or remove doors. 4. Keep automatic garage door opener inaccessible. 5. Select safe toy chests without heavy, hinged lid. G. Falls. 1. Confine play in fenced areas. 2. Supervise all climbing play. 3. Place gates at top and bottom of stairs. 4.

Keep bumper pads and large stuffed animals out of crib or playpen (child may climb on top). 7. Dress in safe clothing that will not catch or drag. H. Other injuries. 1. Never leave children alone in a car or at home. 2. Do not allow play near any machinery. 3. Do not allow running with sharp objects or with anything in the mouth. 4. Teach children to avoid strange animals, especially ones that are eating. 5. Avoid personalized clothing in a public place. 6. Use safety glass and decals on large windows/doors. 7. Remove guns from house. VII. IMMUNIZATIONS A. HIB #4 if not previously given. B. PCV #4. C. IPV #3. D. DTaP #4. E. #3 if not previously given. F. MMR #1 if not previously given. G. Varivax if not previously given. H. Hepatitis A if not previously given. Often given at 12 months and again at least 6 months later. I. Influenza seasonally; review Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) immunization schedule (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp /child-adolescent.html). VIII. OTHER SCREENINGS IF RISK ASSESSMENT INDICATES A. Dental. 1. If child does not have first tooth eruption by age 17 months, consider referral. B. Blood pressure: If high-risk history. C. Vision: Prematurity < 32 weeks, family history of ophthalmologic problems (other than acuity). D. Hearing: Caregiver concern, postnatal infection, head trauma, family history, certain syndromes associated with hearing loss, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) protocol. VIII. Other Screenings if Risk Assessment Indicates 125E. Tuberculosis (TB): Exposure, born outside United States, HIV associated. F. Lead screening: Recommendations vary by state as incidence has decreased in young children due to surveillance efforts. States are charged with iden - tifying geographic areas at risk and children at risk due to exposure. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) centers generally facilitate lead screening. Children should be screened at 9-12 months and again at about 2 years by a questionnaire and/or lab if found to be at risk. IX. ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE A. Primary responsibility of the pediatric primary care nurse practitioner (PNP) is to assist the parent in understanding and parenting this emerging person\u2014the toddler\u2014and the toddler's thoughts, behaviors, and needs, as well as attending to the parent's needs. B. Social competence. 1. Give individual attention, create opportunities for exploration and physi - cal action. 2. Encourage self-care, self-expression, choices. 3. Limit number of rules but consistently enforce them. 4. Suggest acceptable alternatives. 5. Keep discipline brief. 6. Allow assertiveness within limits, but no hitting, biting, or aggressive behavior. 7. Reassure once negative behavior has stopped. 8. Assess individually for toilet training readiness. 9. Expect genital curiosity. C. Family relationships. 1. Parent needs to take time for himself or herself and with partner. 2. Pick up toddler, hold, cuddle, show affection. 3. Listen, show respect for and interest in activities. 4. Encourage all family members to spend time playing with toddler. 5. Help child express emotions. 6. Keep family outings short. 7. Do not expect child to share all toys. 8. Help siblings resolve conflicts. Allow older children own space/things. 9. Serve as role model for healthy habits and care. D. Health promotion. 1.

GENERAL IMPRESSION A. Preadolescence is time of rapid change and emotional vulnerability. B. Preteens need support, understanding, and caring from adults to effectively deal with the psychological changes of this period. II. NUTRITION A. Nutritional requirements. 1. Increased energy and protein requirement due to rapid growth. 2. Require 2200-3000 calories/day. 3. To meet increased need, increase milk and dairy products to 4 servings/day, bread group servings to 9 servings/day. 4. One-fourth of daily calories is typically consumed in snacks; encourage fruit, cheese, milk beverages, raw vegetables, nuts. 5. Diet should consist of 10-15% protein, 25-30% fat, 50-60% carbohydrates. 165CHAPTER 196. Needs of iron is most commonly deficient nutrient. 7. A well-balanced diet does not require supplementation; irregular eating patterns and/or high-calorie/low-nutrient snacking may lead to deficien - cies requiring multivitamin. B. Nutritional assessment. 1. Calculate and plot body mass index (BMI). 2. Evaluate 24-hour recall. 3. Examine intake, eating patterns; ask about special diets or supplements. 4. Assess for eating disorders. 5. Monitor athletes' increased need for calories; advise on appropriate di - etary changes. 6. Provide guidance about nutrition annually. 7. Refer to nutritionist if indicated. III. ELIMINATION A. Expect consistent pattern of elimination. B. Changes may occur with irregular eating patterns, illness, diets, stress, eating disorders. C. Check understanding of normal elimination and methods employed to deal with problems. IV. SLEEP A. Question about amount of sleep; aim for at least 8 hours/night. B. Monitor for any difficulties, ability to cope. C. Advise on sleep hygiene if necessary. V. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT A. Physical. 1. Early adolescence is marked by rapid physical change. Tempo of adoles - cent development is variable and may be influenced by gender, health, socioeconomic status, genetics. Predictable sequence of events occurs over 2-6 years from onset, which on average is age 9-11 for girls and age 10-12 for boys. The preadolescent may prefer to be examined with parent out of the room.166 CHAPTER 19 Eleven- to Thirteen-Year Visit (Preadolescent)2. Perform complete physical exam with attention to the following: a. Document height, weight, BMI annually. b. Assess and document Tanner stage of pubertal development annually. c. Monitor blood pressure annually. d. Screen cholesterol once in this age group if following risk factors exist: Parent with serum cholesterol > 240. Family history unknown. Parent/grandparent with stroke, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death younger than age 55 years. e. Palpate thyroid gland; goiter may present in this age group. f. Examine spine for development/progression of scoliosis during rapid growth. g. Assess for presence/severity of acne. h. Ask about sexual activity; screen sexually active teens for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), evaluate risk for acquiring HIV . B. Emotional. 1. Rapid physical changes of early adolescence lead to increased self-consciousness and focus on external characteristics. 2. Adolescent feels everyone is looking at him/her and questions if he/she is normal. 3. Reassure about normal findings in the physical exam. 4. Explain that each individual progresses through physical changes of pu - berty in same sequence but at his/her own pace. 5. Ask about friends, family, school. Is there a best friend? A supportive adult? Monitor self-esteem. 6. Ask about moods. Emotional lability is normal. Assess for excessive stress or depression. 7. Ask about physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. 8. Discuss safe use of Internet and online social networks. Remind to use caution when sharing personal information, photos, and videos by In - ternet and phone. C. Intellectual. 1. Adolescent begins to transition from concrete to abstract thinking; tim - ing is variable. Some develop higher-level thinking in early adolescence, some later or not at all. Abstract thinking gives adolescent better ability to reason and see other points of view. Individual may be able to think abstractly about algebra but not about decision making regarding risky behaviors. Most young teens have limited ability to consider long-range health risks. Evaluate each preteen through conversation to tailor antici - patory guidance. V. Growth and Development 1672. How is school performance? Ask about academic, athletic, personal goals.

Remind parents that this is normal and healthy. B. Establishment of reliable relationships with peers, other adults is important developmental task. C. New peer group, which is usually same sex, provides opportunity to test, evaluate values/behaviors. It allows for sense of belonging and self-worth, and affords opportunity to build social competence. D. Recognize that hairstyles, clothing, music preferences, piercings are expressions of individuality; often mirror others in peer group. E. Preoccupation with own appearance is typical.

Encourage families to clearly establish and enforce guidelines for appropriate behavior. Identify consistent caring adult with whom adolescent is comfortable communicating. H. Question about friends, peer groups, adult role models. Social isolation is not normal. I. As with other areas of development, individuals progress at variable rates and often oscillate between dependence/independence. J. Parents have an important role in minimizing negative peer influences; know who your child's friends are.168 CHAPTER 19 Eleven- to Thirteen-Year Visit (Preadolescent)VII. IMMUNIZATIONS A.

Consider location, duration, distribution, secondary changes, associated symp - toms (e.g., pruritus, scale), color. B. Consider history such as age of the patient, other medical conditions, medica - tions, recent illness or travel, other family members with similar symptoms. C. Obtain a history of treatment of the rash/lesion, as it may change its morphology. D. Description of actual lesion: 1. Macule: Flat lesion < 1 cm. 2. Patch: Flat lesion > 1 cm. 3. Papule: Solid elevated lesion < 1 cm. 4. Plaque: Solid elevated lesion > 1 cm. 5. Nodule: Palpable well-circumscribed lesion > 1 cm. 6. Tumor: Solid palpable lesion > 1 cm. 7. Wheals: Caused by edema, so variation in size is often associated with pruritus. Characteristic is the individual lesions may disappear or change location over 24 hours. 8. Vesicle: Lesion filled with fluid < 1 cm. 9. Bulla: Lesion filled with fluid > 1 cm. 10. Pustule: A fairly well-circumscribed lesion of upper layers of skin filled with pus. E. Secondary findings, including crusts, erosions, scars, excoriations, and scale, often accompany many dermatological conditions. Determination of the ap - pearance of the primary lesion, associated symptoms, and characteristics, along with secondary findings, are helpful in determination of cause of dermatitis. II. ACNE A. Definition. 1. An inflammatory disease of the sebaceous glands, characterized by com - edones and pimples ( Color Plate 1 and 2 ). B. Etiology. 1. Interaction of the following: a. An alteration in the shedding process of the keratinocytes that line the pilosebaceous unit. b. An increase in sebum production. c. Proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes . d. The release of inflammatory mediators. Open and closed comedones occur when there is an occlusion caused by the abnormal cornification 192 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problemsand desquamation of the pilsebaceous duct and trapping of sebum. The presence of P . acnes on the skin causes the upregulation of many cytokines. C. Occurrence. 1. Affects 85% of adolescents age 12-24. 2. Neonatal acne, which occurs in infants starting from birth to 4 weeks of age, affects up to 20% of newborns. 3. Infantile acne, which occurs from roughly 4 weeks of age to 1 year of age, affects boys more often than girls. 4. Mid-childhood acne (age 1-7) is never considered normal due to the fact that the adrenal secretion effectively ends after the first year of life until about age 7. Preadolescent acne affects children between the ages of 7 and 11 and adolescent acne begins about age 11. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Lesions often precede puberty. 2. Types of lesions direct treatment. 3. Comedones (both open and closed) are made when there is an increase in activity and production of sebaceous gland with abnormal follicular differentiation with increased keratinization, microbial hypercolonization of follicular canal, and increased inflammation, which occurs primar - ily through activation of adaptive immune system. Inflammatory acne generally consists of erythematous papules, nodules, or cystlike nodular lesions, which are colonized by P . acnes , with inflammation occurring via production of inflammatory mediators. Mixed acne comprises both inflammatory and comedonal components. E. Physical findings. 1. Acne appears in locations with increased sebum production, including face, back, and shoulders. Comedonal acne usually occurs in \"T-zone, \" which is across forehead, on nose, and on chin. Inflammatory acne and mixed variations of acne occur on face, back, neck, and shoulders. 2. Clinical classification of acne generally is referred to as mild, moderate, or severe. There are no current agreed-upon standards of classifying acne. Current evidence suggests that presence of acne can also contribute to anxiety, low self-esteem, embarrassment, social withdrawal, and depression. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Generally, acne is clinical diagnosis. 2. Suspicion of possible adrenal or gonadal involvement for mid-childhood acne should include Tanner staging and the following laboratory Serum-free adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A bone age assessment is the most useful tool for screening androgenicity. II. Acne 1933. Isotretinoin therapy requires enrollment into iPledge system, monthly pregnancy tests for childbearing females, complete blood count (CBC), triglycerides, and liver function tests. Providers need to register in system to order this therapy. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Perioral dermatitis. 2. Gram-negative Papular sarcoid. H. Treatment. 1. Depends on lesion type, severity, and patient tolerance. 2. Acne patients should follow up with a provider 3 months after treatment initiation. 3. Refer to the treatments in Table 21-1. 4. Table 21-2, Table 21-3, and Table 21-4 provide detailed lists of common medications used for acne treatment. I. Follow-up. 1.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common dermatologic chronic skin condition of childhood characterized by pruritic, inflammatory patches, papules, and/ or plaques with varying severities of involvement ( Color Plate 3 and 4 ). B. Etiology. 1. Etiology and triggers of eczema are multifactorial. Family history of atopy increases risk of patient developing AD. Environmental triggers highly influence development and locations of AD. It is hypothesized for a subset of patients with AD that a deficiency in fillagrin gene may contribute to weakened skin barrier, leading to increased risk of allergen sensitization and poorer barrier repair. 2. Complications such as herpes simplex virus and secondary bacterial infections are more prone to develop in patients with AD. 3. Treating patient as well as adjusting to needs of family are imperative to address medical and psychological distress this condition may cause. C. Occurrence. 1. Atopic dermatitis has been reported to affect up to 25% of children worldwide. It is one of the most widely treated dermatologic conditions of childhood and requires regular follow-up for medication and symptom management. 2. Cost of care has been reported to be as high as 5.3 million dollars to treat ambulatory patients between ages 2 and 18 years. 3. Approximately 70-80% of children will outgrow AD. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. AD typically presents before age 5 years and as early as infancy. AD is commonly associated with family history of atopic conditions such as asthma, seasonal allergies, eczema. 2. Symptoms and patient/family burden. a. Pruritus. b. Inflammation with associated papulation, excoriation, exudation, and bleeding. c. Poor sleep. d. Decreased quality of life for patient and family. 3. Distribution of affected areas will vary with age. a. Infants and toddlers < 2 years old: Face, scalp, neck, extensor sur - faces of arms and legs. Typically spares midface due to use of bottles and pacifiers and groin due to the moist environment under diapers (Color Plate 5 and 6 ). b. Children > 2 years old: Flexural involvement (antecubital and pop - liteal fossa) Plate 7 neck, around ears, wrists/hands/fingers, ankles/feet/toes.200 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problemsc. Hands, ankles, and feet are also common locations for AD in school-age children and adolescents. E. Physical findings. 1. Erythema. 2. Edema. 3. Xerosis. 4. Erosions/excoriations. 5. Oozing and crusting. 6. Hypo- or hyperpigmentation. 7. Lichenification (thickening of the skin). F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Presence of clinical features. 2. Thorough medical and family history. 3. Formal testing is often not necessary or beneficial to diagnosis. 4. Lab evaluation: Commonly elevated serum IgE. 5. Biopsy: Pathology will show spongiotic dermatitis that is inclusive of all inflammatory skin conditions and not specific to atopic dermatitis. 6. Food and allergy testing: Typically not recommended until at least 1 year of age. a. Elimination diets are not recommended unless signs of anaphylaxis are evident. b. Patch testing: Patch testing should be considered in setting of suspicion of contact allergy with or without concurrent atopic dermatitis. Top five contact allergies are nickel, cobalt, neomycin, balsam of Peru, and lanolin alcohol. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Atopic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis often determined after collecting thorough history and physical exam. If presentation is not typical, consider differential diagnoses shown in Box 21-1 . Box 21 WL, Chamlin SL, et al. Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis part 1: diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2014;70(2);338-351, with permission from Elsevier. III. Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema 201H. Treatment. 1. Moisturizing and proper skin hygiene: First-line treatment for AD includes using thick creams and/or petrolatum jelly. Treatment more effective if patient soaks in warm water for 5-10 minutes daily and immediately applies topical prescriptions and emollients on a daily basis. Treatments to prevent staph colonization on a routine basis are essential for flare prevention and resolution of AD. Consider using moisturizing creams that are thick and free of fragrance and preservatives. Avoid additives and botanicals due to risk of allergy sensitization and development. 2. Topical prescriptions: a. Recommend application for topical medications twice a day on face and body until clear. Once daily at night following showers for application to scalp ( Table 21-5). b. Topical corticosteroids (TCs) remain the gold standard for treatment of AD. Prescribing ointments instead creams can prevent associated sting - ing and burning with application due to the alcohol preservative 202 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problems T able 21-5 Topical Treatment Dependent on Location of Atopic Dermatitis Location of AD Topical Treatment Face, axilla, or 2.5% Protopic (0.03% for < 12 years old) Elidel 1% Body Triamcinolone 0.1% (maintenance therapy) Fluocinonide 0.05% (moderate short Clobetasol 0.05% Scalp . 4th ed.

Potential side effects of TCs: Skin atrophy, prominent veins, striae, enlarged blood vessels (telangiectasia), easy bruising, localized in - hair thickness (hypertrichosis), dyspigmentation, periorificial dermatitis, adrenal suppression, glaucoma applied Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs; e.g., tacrolimus, pimicrolimus) and PDE4 inhibitors (e.g., crisaborole) are nonsteroidal alternatives indicated for treatment of AD and are applied twice a day to affected areas. TCIs and crisaborole are safely utilized on the eyelids where topical steroids are contraindicated due to risk of glaucoma development. TCIs have a black box warning issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This warning should be discussed with patients and families, although evidence does not support development of lymphoma for topical forms. PDE4 inhibitors are FDA approved for patients 2 years of age and older for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. However, this is not indicated treatment for mucous membranes. Potential side effects: Burning and stinging with site application that resolves with repeated application. d. Dilute bleach baths: Evidence suggests skin microbiome of patients with AD is more prone to staph infections. Presence of staph colonization is a known trigger that also prevents AD from achieving resolution with standard treatments. Routine therapy is key in preventing colonization and should be done 1-3 times a week. Soak for 5-10 minutes and rinse with clean water afterwards. Emphasize moisturizing immediately to prevent dryness. Standard concentration household bleach without fragrance should be utilized. 1 teaspoon/5 mL per gallon of water. \u00bc cup bleach in half-full bathtub. \u00bd cup bleach in full bathtub. 3. Wet wrap therapy (WWT): Plays important role as acute therapeutic intervention for management of moderate to severe AD used with undiluted topical corticosteroids of appropriate potency. WWT should not be used for mild AD or as chronic or maintenance therapy and should be considered as a treatment option ahead of the systemic therapies for patients failing conventional topical therapy. Additionally, WWT helps increase hydration to easily wrapped areas of the body (e.g., wrists/hands, flexural surfaces of arms and legs, and ankles/feet). Instruct with caution the use of topical steroids, as this will increase potency of steroid under occlusion and increased risk of side effects. III. Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema 2034. Treatment for recalcitrant/severe AD. a. Light Methotrexate, cyclosporine, acetretin, mycophenalate of atopic dermatitis in adults). 5. Itch and sleep. The urge to itch associated with AD is not well understood. A stepwise approach to management of itch should be implemented for each patient. Children with AD have been found to have poor sleep habits due to pruritus throughout night. Using topical prescriptions help alleviate the itch and additional treatment strategies can be implemented as listed below: a. Physical barriers: Mittens, wet wraps. b. Cooling techniques (e.g., cool water baths) c. Sleep aids: Antihistamines such as cetirizine or hydroxyzine or melatonin. I. Follow-up. 1. Depends on the severity of symptoms, age of the child, parent understand - ing, and type/strength of medication and response to therapy. 2. Generally moderate to severe cases of AD should be re-evaluated in 1 month, use of topical corticosteroids in category 1 or 2 (low-strength steroids) should be monitored every 3-6 months and every 6-12 months for well-controlled patients. Infants and younger children often require more close monitoring. Children on systemic therapy may need periodic laboratory evaluations, which should be monitored depending on the therapy used and usually are referred to dermatology. 3. Monitor for topical steroid side effects on a routine basis, timing is dependent upon the strength of steroid prescribed. Typical timing for follow-up may range from as soon as 1-2 months for mid to high potency topical steroid use to as little as 6-12 months for low to mid potency topical steroid use in the setting of mild AD. 4. Patients receiving systemic treatment should be seen closely after initiation for re-evaluation and laboratory monitoring and typically subsequent appointments are spaced farther apart. Timing is at the provider's discretion and typically aligns with timing of laboratory evaluation. 5. In many cases, patients with atopic dermatitis can be managed with their primary care provider (PCP). J. Complications. 1. Secondary infection. a. Staphylococcus aureus or group A beta-hemolytic streptococci are common.204 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problemsb. MRSA is not as common as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). c. Side effects from topical steroids such as skin thinning, stretch marks, telangiectasia, adrenal suppression. 2. Increased risk for viral infections. a. Herpes simplex virus (HSV; Color Plate 8 ) causing eczema herpeti - cum, enterovirus (hand, Hyper- or hypopigmentation resolves within several months of rash resolution. 5. Lichenification (thickening of the skin). K. Education. 1. Evidence suggests that nurse-led programs to support AD teaching in clinic improve AD severity and quality of life. 2. Proper assessment of patient's and family's needs for patient education should be evaluated by provider to promote family-centered care and patient satisfaction. 3. A combination of tools to promote patient education can include one-on-one counseling, educational videos, pamphlets/handouts, and web-based learning. 4. Promotion of patient and family knowledge of condition and manage - ment at home should improve disease severity and decrease secondary infections and need for unnecessary clinic visits. L. When to refer. 1. For patients not responding to treatment, when the diagnosis is in ques - tion, or for patients who have severe or extensive disease or chronic infections. IV. IMPETIGO/MRSA A. Definition. 1. A superficial bacterial skin infection ( Color Plate 10 ). B. Etiology. 1. The infection may be classified as bullous\u2014 S. aureus \u2014or nonbullous\u2014 S. pyogene s, S. aureus , group A streptococcus. 2. Concern is development of glomerulonephritis, which occurs in up to 5% of cases. IV. Impetigo/MRSA 205C. Occurrence. 1. Common in younger children and marginalized populations in developed nations. 2. Infection occurs from bacteria colonizing the skin after minor trauma. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Two major forms. a. Nonbullous form: Superficial vesicle that it easily ruptured, resulting in honey-colored crusts. b. Bullous form: Superficial fragile bullae filled with serous fluid or pus. Recently erupted bullae leave a round, erythematous erosion, sometimes with a surrounding collarette of scale. c. May be associated with regional adenopathy. 2. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; Color Plate 11 and 12 ). a. May be community acquired (CA-MRSA) or nosocomial and may present in skin as skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). b. There is no standard treatment to prevent CA-MRSA or its recur - rence, and recent evidence suggests that while decolonization may be effective using topical therapies, it does not necessarily prevent SSTIs. c. Cutaneous abscesses should be treated with incision and drainage. Systemic treatment is reserved for patients with progressing cellulitis, comorbidities, immunosuppression., lack of response to treatment, areas difficult to drain, septic phlebitis. Culture results should guide therapy for antibiotic selection. d. Minor skin infections in children can be treated with topical mupirocin 2%. For recurring infections consider decolonization. e. Suggested regimen for decolonization: Topical mupirocin twice a day for 5-10 days. May add topical body decolonization with an antiseptic solution for 5-14 days or a dilute bleach bath twice weekly for 3 months. E. Physical findings. 1. Honey-colored crusting on exposed areas. If bullous, may appear as round, erythematous erosion with collarette of scale. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Gram stain and bacterial culture for identification of causative organism. 2. Diagnosis usually made by clinical presentation. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Herpes simplex. 2. Varicella zoster. Color Plate 13 ). 7. Ecthyma. H. Treatment. 1. Topical antibiotics compared to systemic antibiotics have been shown to have better efficacy in treating impetigo with better cure rates, specifically mupirocin, fusidic acid, and retapamulin. 2. Crusts may be removed by soaking with warm compresses. 3. Current evidence does not suggest topical disinfectants are of value in treating impetigo. a. Current evidence suggests that systemic antibiotics are not superior to topical antibiotics. Additionally, concern for increased risk of side effects and bacterial resistance should be evaluated if systemic therapy is considered. I. Follow-up. 1. Failure to respond to treatment within 48 hours or increasing symptoms should be reevaluated by provider, as causitive organism may indicate need to change therapy. J. Complications. 1. Acute glomerulonephritis is a possible complication. Parents should notify provider for dark-colored urine or edema. K. Education. 1. Stress handwashing technique: Use separate towels and wash linens in hot water. 2. Continue application of antibiotics until area is no longer tender or crusted, and erosions have healed. L. When to refer. 1. For extensive disease or if not responding to treatment (refer to dermatology). 2. For symptoms of glomerulonephritis (refer to nephrology). V. CONTACT DERMATITIS A. Definition. 1. Contact dermatitis is a spectrum of eczematous eruptions. B. Etiology. 1. Contact dermatitis results from either irritation to skin from irritating substance (irritant contact dermatitis), or delayed hypersensitive reaction to allergen resulting in nonspecific intracellular edema and inflammation (allergic contact dermatitis). V. Contact Dermatitis 207C. Occurrence. 1. Irritant contact dermatitis may occur at any age, though it is more common in young infants due to skin sensitivity and exposure to primary irritants such as diaper products, urine, and feces. The inflammatory reaction re - quires no prior sensitization. This type of exogenous dermatitis accounts for about 80% of the contact dermatitis cases in children and adults. 2. Allergic contact dermatitis, such as associated with nickel exposure from metals in jewelry and snaps, topical products, and plants: Reaction is due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to contact with the allergen (T-cell mediated\u2014Type IV immune response). This contact dermatitis accounts for about 20% of the contact dermatitis cases in children and adults. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Allergic contact dermatitis. a. Localized rash with discrete borders and shapes. b. Usually is pruritic. c. Skin lesions are usually in distribution of the contacting allergen and may appear as erythematous papular lesions, blisters, vesicles, or just erythematous linear rash. d. Lesions may appear sometime between 1 day to 1 week after exposure to allergen and may last for weeks without further exposure. 2. Irritant contact dermatitis. a. Rash appears almost immediately after contact. b. Rash more diffuse and located in the area of irritation. c. Rash is inflammatory and is time dependent to skin response to irritant. E. Physical findings. 1. Localized erythematous rash usually presents with discrete border and shapes. 2. Rash matches the contact site of the irritant. 3. The irritant rash is characterized by burning, not itching. 4. Skin folds usually spared. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Patch testing has become a more standard practice in children and is gold standard for diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. 2. Patch testing requires experienced practitioners to avoid common limitations (correct allergen selection, reading of test, and assignment of relevance). A standard screening series such as T.R.U.E. Test can theoretically only capture 60% of relevant contact allergens (meaning 40% failure to detect) in children. 3. Top 10 allergens causing allergic contact dermatitis in 2016: Nickel sulfate (24.2%), cobalt chloride (10.4%), fragrance mix (8.3%), balsam of (4.4%), and methyl (4.3%). G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Infection (impetigo, Candida [Color deficiencies. 5. Psoriasis. 6. Seborrheic dermatitis. H. Treatment. 1. Identify and eliminate future exposure to irritant or allergen. 2. Cool compresses to irritant contact dermatitis area for comfort. 3. Barrier ointments, thickly applied, such as petrolatum jelly or zinc oxide to reduce friction and protect skin from irritant and allergen contact. 4. Low-potency topical corticosteroids with dermatitis to the groin or diaper area or moderate to high potency for limited use for 2-3 weeks as needed if affected areas are not face, groin, or folds. 5. In severe cases of allergic contact dermatitis in older children, systemic corticosteroids may be used with caution and require a tapering course to avoid rebound flaring of dermatitis. 6. May use sedating oral antihistamines for severe cases of itching. Generally, sedation associated with these products makes them effective for nighttime use. Topical antihistamines should not be used as they are frequent cause of local allergic contact dermatitis or other burning and stinging reactions. 7. Suggest cotton or blended nonirritating clothing and avoidance of perfumed and dye-containing products and cleansers (fragrance free and dye free). I. Follow-up. 1. Depends on the response. If not improving once the offending agent is removed the rash should be re-evaluated or further testing performed. J. Complications. 1. Secondary bacterial infection. 2. Generalized nonspecific spreading of dermatitis. K. Education. 1. Identify offending substance and avoid. Limited exposure may exacerbate symptoms. 2. Protect skin by wearing protective clothing or skin barrier creams. 3. Prevention is best approach to reducing incidence of contact dermatitis. 4. Wash clothing in hot, soapy water using dye-free and fragrance-free de - tergent after exposure to remove allergen and rinse well. V. Contact Dermatitis 2095. Use oral sedating antihistamines for sleep and assistance with relaxation at night, when necessary. Recognize that sedating antihistamines can interfere with playing, attendance, and participation in events such as school and sports, driving, and other activities. 6. Use topical steroids as directed. If symptoms escalate, may need to be re-evaluated for consideration of further evaluation or treatment. 7. As nickel continues to be the number one identified allergen in allergic contact dermatitis in children, regulation of the use of nickel in jewelry and other products that come in contact with the skin could further reduce the exposure and incidence of allergic contact dermatitis in children. 8. Additional education needs to occur to avoid exposure to other top 10 allergens causing allergic contact dermatitis listed above. Particularly, practice of unnecessary use of topical antibiotics such as neomycin and bacitracin needs to be avoided. Methylisothiazolinone is a preservative found in personal care products such as baby wipes, which also should be avoided for contact dermatitis in the diaper area. L. When to refer. 1. Patch testing should be performed by an experienced provider. 2. If patient is not improving on standard therapy. 3. For parental anxiety. VI. URTICARIA A. Definition. 1. Urticaria is an erythematous rash resulting from vasodilatation ( Color Plate 15 and 16 ). B. Etiology. 1. Urticaria is a common mast cell-driven skin disease. Patients generally present with wheals, angioedema, or both. A wheal is characterized by central swelling, usually surrounded by erythema, and may be associated with pruritus or a burning sensation. Lesions generally resolve in 24 hours. Angioedema is a swelling in the lower dermis and subcutis and may involve mucus membranes, with resolution in up to 72 hours. C. Occurrence. 1. Lifetime prevalence of 20%. a. Urticaria is classified according to duration of symptoms. Spontane - ous acute urticaria refers to lesions lasting less than 6 weeks; chronic is classified with multiple subtypes associated with other conditions or idiopathic. These include infections; autoimmune conditions; hypersensitivity to foods, additives, or drugs; malignancy; physical 210 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problemsurticaria; and others, including cholinergic, contact, exercise induced, and aquagenic). There is currently a scoring system suggested for as - sessing disease activity and effects of chronic spontaneous urticara. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Abrupt onset of pruritic, pink to red raised wheals. 2. Wheals are transient and resolve in one area followed by reappearance in a different area. Each individual wheal lasts 30 minutes to 3 hours and may change shape. E. Physical findings. 1. Erythematous wheals that change shape over time, usually pruritic. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Routine diagnostic measures are not recommended for acute urticaria, with focused diagnostic measures depending on suspected subtype for chronic urticaria. Cause may be drug induced, allergic, infectious, autoimmune, insect stings, or physical trigger induced. In suspected food-induced acute urticaria, cause should be identified as ingestion may be a cause of anaphylaxis. Testing should reflect the suspected underlying cause of the symptoms. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. 2. Serum 5. Urticarial vasculitis. H. Treatment. 1. The aim of treatment is complete symptom control. If trigger can be identified, then it is recommended that trigger be avoided if at all possible. Pharmacologic therapies are aimed at symptomatic relief to reduce effects of mast cell mediators on target organs. 2. Current recommendations advise against first-generation antihistamines, both for reasons of safety and efficacy, in favor of second-generation, non-sedating antihistamines, which are also free of anticholinergic effects. 3. For patients who are unresponsive to standard dosing, guidelines suggest a trial of up to four-fold dose of second-generation H1 antihistamines as second-line treatment for symptoms persisting beyond 2 weeks in adults, but this recommendation has not been validated in children. 4. If not effective, third-line treatment to include omalizumab, cyclosporin A, or montelukast in addition to the antihistamines; however, there is paucity of data to support this recommendation for children. 5. A short course of corticosteroids may be used for an acute exacerba - tion as third-line therapy, but is not recommended for long-term use. VI. Urticaria 2116. There are currently no licensed second-generation antihistamines ap - proved for children younger than 6 months of age. I. Follow-up. 1. Depends on the response to treatment and causative agent. 2. Acute urticaria resolves in 1-2 weeks once the offending agent is removed and does not require routine follow-up. 3. Chronic urticaria should be evaluated more frequently depending on patient symptoms. J. Complications. 1. Angioedema with or without respiratory compromise. 2. Anaphylaxis, which may be a medical emergency. K. Education. 1. Keep a diary to try and identify triggers or recent or recurrent exposures, as identification and avoidance may be curative. 2. Give antihistamines daily to stabilize response of mast cells. 3. If associated with respiratory compromise, consider education on emer - gency treatment and dispense Epi-Pen with instructions appropriate for size of child. L. When to refer. 1. Chronic urticaria, respiratory compromise, and anaphylaxis should be referred for further evaluation to allergy and immunology. VII. TINEA VERSICOLOR (PITYRAISIS VERSICOLOR) A. Definition. 1. is a common superficial fungal skin infection ( Color Plate 17 ). B. Tinea versicolor is caused by Malassezia furfur , found on healthy skin, especially if lipophilic, and thrives in hot, humid environments. 2. Infection localizes to the stratum corneum and is characterized by hypopigmented or hyperpigmented thin plaques with scale on the chest, back, and proximal arms. C. Occurrence. 1. Tinea versicolor most often affects adolescents and young adults age 15-24. 2. Seen worldwide, however more common in the tropics and summer months among 10- to 19-year-olds. 3. Occasionally affects infants. 212 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological ProblemsD. Clinical manifestations. 1. Patient presents with hypopigmented patches of various sizes that gener - ally do not itch. 2. Present more often in summer, as lesions do not tan. E. Physical findings. 1. Characteristic macule covered with fine scale that coalesces to form confluent patches. 2. Localized on neck, upper chest, back, and upper arms. 3. Lesions are tan or reddish brown; color varies depending on darkness or lightness of skin. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Diagnosis may be made through potassium hydroxide (KOH) scraping with direct microscope examination. 2. The hyphae are short with a grape-like clusters of spores and have a \"spaghetti and meatball\" appearance. 3. Wood lamp: Fluoresce pale yellow. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Seborrheic dermatitis. 2. Pityriasis alba ( Color Vitiligo. Pityriasis and 20 corporis. H. Treatment. 1. Apply selenium sulfide 2.5% (Selsun lotion) daily for 1 week. Bathe, dry with coarse bath towel, apply Selsun to lesions, lather with small amount of water, and leave on for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and dry with rough towel. May use monthly after initial treatment to prevent recurrence. 2. Ketoconazole 2% shampoo is not FDA approved in children, but is effec - tive when applied for 5 days to adults. 3. Systemic treatments are reserved for patients who do not respond to topical therapy. 4. Repigmentation occurs over months. I. Follow-up. 1. Recheck in 2-4 weeks. 2. If lesions do not improve, consider oral treatment with ketoconazole or fluconazole. J. Complications. 1. None. VII. Tinea Versicolor (Pityraisis Versicolor) 213K. Education. 1. Recurrence is common. 2. Pigment changes are gradual over a period of 4-6 months and may take years to resolve completely. 3. Selenium sulfide 2.5% shampoo or lotion can cause drying of the skin. L. When to refer. 1. Referral to dermatology if no improvement. VIII. TINEA CAPITIS A. Definition. 1. Tinea capitis is a common dermatophyte infection of the scalp Color Plate 21 ). B. Etiology. 1. Tinea capitis is caused by a common dermatophyte/fungi capable of infecting or colonizing hair follicles. 2. Must be treated systemically as topical agents are not effective. 3. The infection is often transmitted after a break in skin. 4. Trichophyton tonsurans is the main cause of 90% infec tions. However, Microsporum canis and may also be isolated. C. Occurrence. 1. Tinea capitis is spread by person-to-person contact, fomites, and, in some cases, from contact with infected animals. 2. 70% of cases seen between the ages of 3 and 8 years. 3. It is more common in black children. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Two major forms: a. Noninflammatory form: Areas of alopecia with characteristic black dots caused by breaking of hairs shaft at base of hair follicle. Lesions are round with patchy hair loss, and the lesions are usually pruritic. Lesions may have erythematous plaques with follicular papules and crusting. b. Inflammatory form known as a kerion: Contains swollen hairless lesions with suppurative folliculitis. The area is boggy with tender plaques and pustules and is associated with local lymphadenopathy. E. Physical findings. 1. One or more scaly patches of alopecia with hairs broken at the skin line and crusting.214 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problems2. Area of hair loss has black dots and broken hairs surrounding the oval patch of hair loss. 3. Cervical and suboccipital lymphadenopathy. 4. Kerions present with scaling pustules or indurated, purulent, pruritic, raised plaque with localized lymphadenopathy. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Gold standard is scrapings from the lesion and KOH preparation. 2. Fungal culture. 3. Wood's lamp and fluorescencing the lesion; if Microsporum is the offending species, a green fluorescence will be noted. 4. The most common offending species, Trichophyton , does not fluoresce. G. Differential diagnosis. 7. Trichotillomania. 8. Traction alopecia. H. Treatment. 1. First line of treatment is with griseofulvin. Dosing depends on prepa - ration of the medication (microsize or ultramicrosize). It is given for 6-8 weeks. 2. Griseofulvin is to be taken with high-fat foods such as whole milk, ice cream, or bacon. 3. Adjunctive therapy: Selenium sulfide shampoo 2.5% to suppress viable spores and decrease the spread of infection. 4. Terbinafine is generally more effective for treatment of T. tonsurans . 5. If kerion is present, treat as tinea capitis; may need oral steroids if exten - sive inflammation present to prevent scarring. This should be used in conjunction with antifungal medication. 6. If kerion is present, may need to treat for secondary bacterial infection. I. Follow-up. 1. Recheck in 4-6 weeks to evaluate progress. 2. Laboratory monitoring is generally not indicated in asymptomatic and otherwise healthy children. J. Complications. 1. Permanent hair loss and scarring of infected area of skin. 2. Antifungal oral medications have many drug interactions. VIII. Tinea Capitis 2153. Tinea incognito can occur if treated with topical corticosteroids, which masks classic physical signs and complicates proper identification of infection. a. Id reaction (a delayed-type hypersensitivity) may occur, typically around the ears, and may present 1-2 weeks after initial infection or start of treatment. b. Treatment failure is not uncommon. K. Education. 1. Children should be discouraged from sharing clothing, especially hats and scarves. 2. Watch pets for similar changes to fur. 3. At onset of therapy, wash all hats and hair utensils. 4. Stress importance of completing therapy. 5. Family members should use selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo for several weeks following diagnosis of one member in family. 6. Attendance at school and daycare is appropriate. L. When to refer. 1. In children who do not respond to therapy. IX. TINEA CORPORIS A. Definition. 1.

Annular configuration with scaling and concentric rings. 4. Vary in size from 1-5 cm. 216 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological ProblemsF. Diagnostic tests. 1. KOH preparation. 2. Culture of scale from border. 3. Skin biopsy with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain may rarely be indicated for atypical or persistent lesions. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Urticaria. Topical antifungals creams (tervinafine, butenafine). 3. Topical corticosteroids (reduce itch). 4. Important to use combination of topical and oral antifungals with severe infection. I. Follow-up. 1. Patients should follow up in 6-8 weeks for further evaluation. J. Complications. 1. Tinea incognito: Found when tinea has been treated with topical corticosteroids. K. Education. 1. Patients being treated who are involved in close contact sports (e.g., wrestling) should be treated with topical creams for 72 hours prior to returning to the sport. L. When to refer. 1. Patients who do not respond to therapy. X. TINEA PEDIS A. Definition. 1. Common dermatophyte infection of the foot/feet. B. Etiology. 1. Most often caused by T. rubrum , and T. mentagrophytes . 2.

Fungal culture. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Contact dermatitis. 2. Dyshidrotic eczema. 3. Foot dermatitis. 4. Juvenile (JPD). Psoriasis. H. Treatment. 1. Topical antifungal cream twice daily; should be continued for at least 1 week after clinical symptoms have resolved. 2. If no response to topical medications, oral terbinafine may be effective and indicated. I. Follow-up. 1. 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. J. Complications. 1. Onychomycosis: Requires 3-6 months of oral antifungal therapy. K. Education. 1. Important to keep feet dry. 2. May need regular application of antifungal cream if prone to tinea infections. L. When to refer. 1. If the patient is not responding to therapy. 2. If there is question about the diagnosis. XI. HEAD LICE ( PEDICULOSIS HUMANUS CAPITIS ) A. Definition. 1. Infestation scalp/eyebrows/eyelashes by the head louse Pediculosis humanus capitus (Color Plate 25 ). ( P. humanus capitis ) are ectoparasites that grasp hair shaft and lay their eggs (nits).218 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problems2. Eggs need warmth to hatch, therefore, most nits are found close to scalp. They hatch within 7-10 days. Once hatched, lice rely on human hosts for survival. C. Occurrence. 1. Estimates vary from country to country and from urban to rural locations. 2. Infection is more common in school-age children as they are more likely to have head-to-head contact. 3. Contact may be also from fomites such as combs and brushes. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Pruritus is common; however, initially patient is often asymptomatic. 2. Nits (egg casings) are adherent to the hair shaft and often noted postau - ricular and nape of neck. 3. Live lice may be noted throughout scalp. 4. Secondary infection. E. Physical findings. 1. Adherent nits to shaft of hair. 2. Presence of live louse. 3. Secondary excoriations or infections to scalp. 4. Lymphadenopathy may be present. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Clinical examination. 2. Microscopic exam of nits or lice is possible to confirm diagnosis but usually not needed. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Pseudonits (hair casts). 2. Hair products that leave residue in hair. 3. Seborrheic dermatitis. H. Treatment. 1. Important to establish diagnosis prior to treatment. 2. Lindane is no longer recommended for treatment of lice in children by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 3. The safety and efficacy of natural and herbal remedies are not regulated by FDA and therefore cannot be recommended. Only anecdotal information is available on occlusive agents and therefore they are also not recom - mended. See Table 21-6 for treatment options for lice. a. Nits should be removed if possible to prevent hatching and for cos - metic reasons; however, \"no nit\" policies in schools are not warranted. b. Topical corticosteroids may be indicated for pruritus or associated dermatitis related to infestation. c. Secondary infections should be treated with antibiotics. d. Severe pruritus or sleep disturbance may warrant systemic antihis - Pediculides Medication Category Availability Administration Side Effects Ivermectin 0.5% Lotion Prescription Apply to dry hair and scalp; leave on 10 minutes and rinse.

Risk factors for scabies: Y oung age, presence of many children in house, low income, poor housing, illiteracy, sharing of clothes and towels, inconsistent showering. 2. Transmission of scabies occurs through close contact. 3. May take 2-6 weeks for symptoms to clear even after successful treatment. 4. Clothing, bed linens, and towels should be machine washed in hot water and dried on a high heat cycle. L. When to refer. 1. For infections that do not respond to treatment. XIII. SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS A. Definition. 1. Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin condition most prominent on sebum-rich skin of the scalp and face. It presents as flaking, itchy skin in the seborrheic areas occurring in infants, adolescents, and into adulthood ( Color Plate 27 and 28 ). B. Etiology. 1. Etiology remains poorly understood, but variety of environmental and intrinsic factors have been identified as predisposing factors. 2. In vast majority of SD patients, it is likely that a combination of individual (e.g., sebaceous gland activity, neurogenic factors and emotional stress, nutritional factors) and environmental (e.g., seasonal changes, Malassezia colonization) factors, alongside epidermal integrity and host immunity, cause or are associated with flare-ups. 3. Gene mutations and protein deficiencies also play role in etiology. C. Occurrence. 1. SD affects females and males equally. 2. Onset is related to hormone-driven sebum production during early infancy, which wanes along with prevalence in childhood and increases again in adolescence and adulthood. 3. Both SD and atopic dermatitis are common in infants and are confused as they frequently occur together. SD usually resolves before 1-2 years of age (uncommon after infancy), unlike atopic dermatitis, and does not reappear again until after puberty. 4. In adolescents and adults, may improve with age, tends to wax and wane. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Minimal to no pruritus in infancy. Adolescents into adulthood may complain of pruritus. XIII. Seborrheic Dermatitis 223E. Physical findings. 1. Lesions are symmetric and typically red with greasy yellow to salmon- colored scale. 2. SD typically involves the face, scalp, and posterior auricular, nuchal, axillary, and/or inguinal folds in infants. SD typically involves the scalp and na - solabial folds in adolescents and into adulthood. 3. Varies from minimal to widespread involvement. 4. Primary lesions: Erythematous papules/patches, poorly marginated. 5. Secondary lesions: Greasy scale, excoriations if pruritic. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Frequently diagnosed with physical examination, blood work with sus - pected severe underlying disease. 2. Fungal, bacterial, or viral cultures, as appropriate. 3. Skin biopsy may be required in dermatitis that is unresponsive to therapy to rule out other associated problems. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Atopic dermatitis. 2. Infection ( psoriasiform-id reaction. 5. Nutritional deficiencies: acids, histidine, protein. 6. Immunodeficiency disorders: Histiocytois X. H. Treatment. 1. Shampoo regularly. a. Frequently in infants, tear-free shampoos are adequate to loosen the scales when allowed to remain on the scalp for several minutes and lightly scrubbed with a soft cloth or soft \"baby\" brush to remove the scale. In more difficult cases, scale may be loosened with mineral oil prior to shampooing. More resistant cases need to move to mild keratolytic/anti-seborrheic shampoos even in infancy. b. pyri - thione, selenium sulfide, or tar) may be helpful for adolescents and adults to control scalp scaling and to avoid hair shaft damage and dryness. For more stubborn cases, use ketoconazole shampoo; however, note pos - sibility of increased hair fragility. Be sure shampoo is applied directly to scalp versus hair shaft alone. No particular contact time seems needed. 2. Low-potency topical corticosteroid creams (hydrocortisone 1% or 2.5% to desonide 0.05%) applied to the scalp twice daily for several days will usually clear dermatitis in infants; occasional use after successful treat - ment will control recurrences.224 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problems3. Higher potency topical corticosteroid creams or oils are often required to treat the scalp of adolescents into adulthood. 4. Hairline and facial involvement of SD often co-occurs, and low-potency topical steroids (hydrocortisone 1% or 2.5% with step up to desonide 0.05%) may be applied to the affected areas twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks, which may be repeated for flares. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) or antifungal creams (ketoconazole or econazole) may then provide effective control. I. Follow-up. 1. Every 6-12 months if well controlled, but sooner if not responsive. J. Complications. 1. Secondary bacterial infection. 2. Secondary fungal infection. K. Education. 1. Review the expected course of the disorder. 2. It is important to understand the intrinsic characteristics of facial and scalp hair, as well as hair care practices, in this patient popula - tion that differ from those of white and Asian populations, such as frequency of shampooing, products, and styling. Familiarity with these differences may aid in effective diagnosis, treatment, and hair care recommendations. 3. Encourage patients to increase shampooing to once weekly or every 2 weeks with braided or specially styled hair; recommend discontinuing use of scalp pomades, oils, and hairsprays. L. When to refer. 1. If patient is not improving on standard therapy. 2. For parental anxiety. XIV. VERRUCA VULGARIS A. Definition. 1. Verruca vulgaris (common warts) are epithelial growths found on the skin (Color Plate 29 ). which are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). B. Etiology. 1. Verruca are caused by HPV . Verrucae can take several years to self-resolve and are typically not associated with an underlying immune dysfunction, but can cause emotional distress. 2. Classification is dependent upon the site affected (e.g., common warts, flat warts, genital warts). XIV. Verruca vulgaris 2253. Verruca regression is hypothesized to be dependent on cell-mediated immunity inducing an immune response against HPV . Treatment is aimed at inciting immune response on routine basis to elicit recognition of virus and promote resolution. In most cases, these will resolve spontaneously. Treatment modalities have varying efficacy and must be tailored to the tolerance and age of the patient. C. Occurrence. 1. Common in children. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Nonpainful verruca papules on skin surfaces, usually not pruritic but may be emotionally upsetting to patient. E. Physical findings. 1. Hyperkeratotic papules. 2. Thrombosed capillaries (i.e., black dots within the papule). 3. Filiform projections (i.e., flowering-like projections). 4. Disruption of natural skin lines. 5. Favor the fingers/hands, knees, elbows, feet. Any cutaneous or mucous surface can develop verrucae. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Not typically indicated. Identifying the type of HPV strain is not necessary for successful resolution. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Molluscum contagiosum. 2. Lichen planus. 3. Lichen reactions. 5. Prurigo nodularis. 6. Squamous cell carcinoma. H. Treatment. 1. Genital warts. a. Imiquimod: Evidence suggests imiquimod is superior to placebo in achieving complete and partial regression. b. 5-FU: A meta-analysis cites monotherapy with 5-FU showed benefit compared to placebo or no treatment. However, benefits and risks have not been determined clearly and further studies are needed. 2. Salicylic acid (SA). a. SA is recommended as a process. Soak lesion in bath or shower, file with an abrasive object (e.g., nail file or pumice stone) to remove scaling, and topical application of SA with or without an occlusive 226 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problemsagent such as duct tape. Over-the-counter formulations vary from 17% to 40% SA. Hands and feet may respond more effectively with SA compared to other body parts. 3. Cryotherapy. a. Found to be superior to SA and placebo for hand warts. No differ - ence seen in clearance when cryotherapy was performed at 2-, 3-, and 4-week intervals. Cryotherapy in partnership with SA appeared to be more effective than SA alone. 4. Intralesional (IL) immunotherapies. a. IL candida antigen is one of the most widely utilized immunotherapies in dermatology practices. Multiple injections at 2- to 4-week intervals offer best chance of success. Treatment should not surpass 4-5 injec - tions if there is no clinical response. b. IL bleomycin has shown inconsistent evidence supporting effectiveness. Several other immunotherapies have been trialed, such as measles, mumps, and rubella and tuberculin dibutylester (SADBE): Randomized, found significant reduction in wart number and size in 8 weeks with a clearance rate of 41% vs. 12% for the vehicle. b. Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and diphencyprone (DPC) have been studied, but these formulations are not available in the United States. 6. Surgical and laser destruction of verrucae may result in scarring and carry a high risk of recurrence. In pediatric patient, this treatment modality is not widely practiced due to pain, patient anxiety, and scarring without promise of resolution. I. Follow-up. 1. Follow-up is dependent upon the treatment plan for verrucae. Procedures are typically performed once a month as needed. 2. Particular medications, such as imiquimod, may require follow-up every few months to evaluate treatment response and contact sensitizers require frequent follow-up until the appropriate strength is prescribed. J. Complications. 1. Side effects of procedure and prescription treatments may traumatize the skin, which may result in scarring. In the case of blistering, there is a risk of secondary infection. 2. Verrucae may spread, which further worsens the condition both physically and, in some cases, psychologically. XIV. Verruca vulgaris 227K. Education. 1. Patient education to include etiology, expected clinical course, complica - tions, and expectations for treatment duration should be emphasized to caregivers and patients. 2. Providing thorough patient education may alleviate caregiver concern and improve the patient-provider trust. L. When to refer. 1. Unless procedures are warranted, patients with verrucae can be managed with their PCP . The PCP must take into consideration the age and location of the treatment area in question. In general, procedures are not utilized on the face due to risk of permanent scarring. 2. When considering the cost of health care, these treatments may be con - sidered cosmetic and the referring provider should discuss this potential denial and high cost of destruction charges. XV. MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM A. Definition. 1. Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common viral skin ( Color Plate 30 and 31 ). B. Etiology. 1. Infection is caused by MC pox virus and can take months to even years to completely resolve. Upon resolution, MC may leave postinflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmented macules, pitted scars, or skin tag-like lesions. C. Occurrence. 1. Common skin infection in childhood. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Nonpainful papules that may or may not be pruritic. Size varies and papules may be skin-colored, pearly, pink, or erythematous. Papules that often appear translucent. Umbilication (central depression) may or may not be present. E. Physical findings. 1. Single or clustered papules: May appear in a linear distribution due to koebnerization. Common in areas of skin rubbing or moist regions such as the axillae, popliteal fossae, and groin. May be in genital and perianal locations due to autoinoculation (benign, nonsexual transmission). 2. Initially appear as small, pearly papules that may enlarge and become inflamed. Inflammation represents host immune response and often precedes spontaneous resolution.228 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological Problems3. Common complications include surrounding eczematous-like plaques that are pruritic (molluscum dermatitis). Trauma can induce a furuncle, which leads to concern for secondary infection. If present near the eyelid, chronic conjunctivitis or keratitis may develop. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Not indicated. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. Herpes simplex. 2. Flat warts. 3. Varicella. 4. Milia. 5. 6. Sebaceous hyperplasia. Folliculitis. 10. Pyogenic granuloma. H. Treatment. 1. Molluscum is not a pathogen, so treatment is elective. Lesions may resolve spontaneously 6 months to 2 years from lesion appearance. Treatment for MC can be performed in the clinic setting or at home by caregivers. Regardless of treatment selection at home, advise caregivers to apply petrolatum jelly around MC and use scant amount of treatment directly to MC and allow to dry. Discourage rubbing treatment on surrounding skin, as many of the treatment modalities cause redness and inflamma - tion that may worsen postinflammatory residua. Treatment at home is recommended daily at bedtime. 2. In-office and prescription treatments: a. Cantharidin: Blistering agent. Recommend no more than 20 treated lesions at a time to avoid severe blistering, id reaction, or larger vesicles in clustered treatment area. Do not occlude. Wash off in 6-8 hours. b. Cryotherapy: Few studies showing efficacy with poor side effect profile. c. Curretage: High rate of recurrence with poor side effect profile. Will leave scarring. d. Pulsed dye laser: High cost and poor side effect profile. Studies have shown promising results. e. Intralesional candida: Induces immune response. Requires injection to each molluscum. Poor side effect profile. f. Topical retinoid Evidence suggests imiquimod shows lack of effect with increased risk of site irritation. 3. Available without prescription: a. Salycylic acid. b. Hydrogen peroxide. c. Benzoyl peroxide 10% topically. Reported as more efficacious compared to tretinoin 0.05%. d. Several homeopathic and OTC topical treatment options are available for MC. There are no studies supporting the use of these options, but can be considered by providers to offer caregivers alternative treatments. Zymaderm. Dilute apple cider vinegar. Tea tree oil. I. Follow-up. 1. Unless in office procedures are warranted, molluscum treatment is typically managed in the clinic as needed. J. Complications. 1. Secondary infection from scratching. 2. Scarring from healed papules. K. Education. 1. Patient education to include etiology, expected clinical course, complica - tions, and expectations for treatment duration should be emphasized to caregivers and patients. Providing thorough patient education may alleviate caregiver concern and improve the patient-provider trust. L. When to refer. 1. Unless procedures are warranted, patients with molluscum can be man - aged with their PCP . The PCP must take into consideration the age and location of the treatment area in question. In general, procedures are not utilized on the face due to risk of permanent scarring. When using cantharidin, typically only 20 or less lesions are treated at one time due to risk of severe reaction or id reaction. Additionally, patients who will not sit still for cantharidin application should not be considered for this treatment due to risk of performing the procedure safely. When consider - ing the cost of health care, these treatments may be considered cosmetic and the referring provider should discuss this potential denial and high cost of destruction charges. 2. Referral to ophthalmology may be indicated if molluscum are causing conjunctivitis. 230 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological ProblemsXVI. CUTANEOUS DRUG REACTIONS A. Definition. 1. An adverse cutaneous drug reaction is caused by a drug producing an undesirable change in the structure or function of skin, its appendages, or mucous membranes. The drug can be ingested, injected, inhaled, or topically applied to skin or mucous membranes. B. Etiology. 1. Adverse reactions may result from accumulation, pharmacologic effect, drug-drug interactions, idiosyncrasy, microbiologic imbal or overt disease, hypersensitivity, autoimmune-like reaction, teratogenic effect, interaction of the drug and sunlight or other light sources, or other unknown mechanisms. 2. True drug allergy refers to immunologically mediated drug hypersensi - tivity reactions. These are divided into a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (immediate rapidly evolving IgE mediated) or Type 2, 3, or 4 hypersensi - tivity reactions, which are nonimmediate (non-IgE mediated). Immediate reactions usually occur within 1 hour of last drug administration but may occur up to 6 hours later. C. Occurrence. 1. Adverse drug reactions are common in children and data on incidence differ. It can be difficult to determine if signs and symptoms are due to underlying illness, such as viral illness, or medications prescribed. 2. True drug allergy is rare and there is overlabeling and overdiagnosis of drug allergy in children. Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported allergy, with prevalence rate of 5-10% in adults and children (Color Plate 32 ). Amoxicillin has now replaced benzyl penicillin as the most frequently reported drug allergy in children. Non-beta-lactam (BL) allergy is rare in children, estimated at 1-3% of this population. Most commonly reported reactions to non-BL drugs are for sulfon - amides followed by anaphylaxis. 3. Cutaneous drug eruptions/rashes are among the most common complica - tions of drug therapy. Any cutaneous reaction that occurs within 2 weeks of starting a medication should be considered possibly drug induced. 4. Potential increased risk of more severe reactions in patients and family with history of previous severe reactions and other atopic diseases, such as asthma, requires close evaluation. 5. Occurrence seems to be more prevalent in females versus males and in older patients versus infants. XVI. Cutaneous Drug Reactions 231D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Can occur in many forms and can mimic many other dermatoses. E. Physical findings. 1. Urticaria: Hives can be induced by most drugs; aspirin, NSAIDS, penicil - lin, and blood products are most frequent causes. 2. Exanthem: Maculopapular eruptions ( Color Plate 33 ) are most frequent of all cutaneous reactions and are often indistinguishable from viral exan - them. Onset occurs 7-10 days after starting drug and may present after drug is stopped. Usually fades in 7-10 days, on occasion even if the drug continues. Maculopapular eruption, red macules, and papules coalesce in generalized distribution, often sparing face. Pruritus is common. Palms, soles, and mucous membranes may be involved. 3. Fixed drug eruptions: Single or multiple, round, sharply demarcated, dusky red papules or plaques appear soon after drug exposure and reap - pear in same site each time drug is taken. An area may blister then erode, brown pigmentation forms with healing, itching or burning may precede or occur with the lesions. 4. Drug-induced hyperpigmentation: Brown and red pigmentation forms. 5. Lichenoid drug eruptions: Clinically and histologically with multiple, flat-topped, violaceous, pruritic papules, and oral lesions may be present. Lesions heal with brown pigmentation. 6. Photosensitivity drug eruptions: Can occur within a few hours of drug exposure, resembles an exaggerated sunburn, usually confined to sun-exposed areas. 7. Severe drug reactions with systemic involvement such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous, vasculitis, and DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) are complex presentations requiring referral to dermatology. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Thorough clinical history is essential to determine severity of reaction and potential causative agent. 2. Drug levels may be helpful for comatose patient or overdose. 3. Referral for allergy testing, if indicated. a. Drug allergy skin testing (prick and intradermal) in young children should be done under specialist supervision in controlled testing arenas. b. Graded challenges are the gold standard in diagnosis of true drug allergy and have been proven to be safe in children. 4. Patch test if considering contact dermatitis. 5. Skin biopsy has nonspecific histology but may be required to rule out other associated problems. 232 CHAPTER 21 Dermatological ProblemsG. Differential diagnosis. 1. Viral exanthem. 2. Infections: Viral, bacterial, fungal. 3. Collagen-vascular disease. 4. Other primary skin conditions. 5. Neoplasia. H. Treatment. 1. Accurate diagnosis is important for patient safety and optimal treatment. 2. Stop offending drug. 3. Provide symptomatic relief from emergency life support to cool com - presses for comfort. 4. Topical corticosteroid creams are helpful for rash and itching. 5. Oral sedating antihistamines may be helpful to promote sleep and decrease itching. 6. Oral tapering prednisone course may be indicated with extensive eruption; however, in some cases this is controversial. 7. Drug desensitization with specialist consultation should only be pursued if there are no alternatives and is contraindicated in drug reactions with severe skin disease. I. Follow-up. 1. Depends on the severity and location of the reaction. May necessitate referral to emergency services for angioedema or respiratory distress, ophthalmology for mucosal involvement, allergy referral for testing. 2. Mild reactions that respond to elimination of the offending antigen may not require follow-up if completely resolved. 3. Severe reactions or those with systemic involvement may require referral to specialty, laboratory evaluations, skin biopsy, and may necessitate admission to the hospital. J. Complications. 1. Post-inflammatory pigment changes. 2. Scarring. 3. Angioedema/respiratory distress. K. Education. 1. Stress importance of stopping offending drugs under supervision of provider. 2. Discuss possible cross-reacting drugs with providers, such as cephalospo - rins possibly cross-reacting with penicillin. 3. Review risks for patient and families with history of severe reactions. L. When to refer. 1. Refer to specialist drug allergy provider when clinical history suggestive of severe reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, or to multiple drugs and/or for drug skin allergy or patch testing . XVI. Cutaneous Drug Reactions 2332. Refer to specialist drug allergy provider if suspected drug is required for ongoing clinical care without equally effective option or suspect possible accidental exposure. 3. For parental anxiety.

Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa : Common in chronic serous OM, especially if perforation of TM present. a. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, S. aureus : More common in neonates.3. Malignant otitis externa (uncommon) seen in chronically ill or immu - nosuppressed children. 4. Stenosis of auditory canal. 5. Transient conductive hearing loss. J. Education. 1. Explain cause and treatment plan. a. Keep ear(s) dry: No swimming during acute phase, can use cotton coated with petroleum jelly or lamb's wool when showering or sham - pooing to occlude canal; remove immediately when finished. b. Side effects of eardrops: Local stinging or burning sensation and rash where drops have come in contact with skin. c. Avoid earplugs and use of cotton swabs. d. Acute pain should subside within 48 hours. 2. Keep foreign objects out of ears. 3. Prevention of recurrence (common): Instill 2-3 drops of isopropyl alcohol in ear canals after swimming or showering or during hot, humid weather; shake excess water out of ears but not too often. IV. ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA Acute pharyngitis, unspecified, J02.9 Acute serous otitis media, Acute infection, unspecified, J06.9 Chronic serous otitis media, H65.2 Fever of other and unknown origin, R50Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus with other respiratory manifestations, J11.1 Perforation of tympanic membrane, H72 Otitis media, unspecified, H66.9 Respiratory syncytial virus as cause of diseases classified elsewhere, B97.4 IV. Acute Otitis Media 2716. Viruses, particularly respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus (types A and B), and adenovirus, increase the risk, possibly by impairing Eustachian tube function. Infants have increased susceptibility to OM, possibly due to short horizontal position of Eustachian tube. 7. Viruses may be involved in about 40% of cases of AOM. 8. Bacterial resistance is increasing problem: Certain strains of H. influenzae and most strains of M. catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin because of beta- lactamase production. Another concern is drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP). 9. The groups most at risk for DRSP are: a. Children younger than 24 months of age. b. Those who have recently received beta-lactam drugs, were recently treated with antibiotics, and/or had a recent ear infection. c. Children exposed to large numbers of other children (e.g., daycare attendance in children 2 months to younger than 5 years of age, or household crowding in children older than 2 years of age). d. Those with immune deficiencies (e.g., sickle cell disease, HIV , malig - nancy). The proportion of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains may be 40-50%, and half of these may be highly resistant. B. Occurrence. 1. After upper respiratory infection (URI), OM most common disease of childhood; peak prevalence from 6 to 36 months of age. Incidence declines at about 6 years of age. 2. Incidence has dramatically increased since 1985; greatest in children younger than 2 years of age. 3. By 3 years of age, most have had at least 1 acute infection; 33% have had 3. 4. Those with first episode early in life have increased risk for developing chronic ear disease. 5. More common in boys than in girls. 6. Whites, Native Alaskans, Native Americans have higher incidence than blacks. 7. More frequent in low-income and large families and those children in group daycare settings. 8. Those immunocompromised, including those with AIDS, have higher incidence. 9. Smoking in household increases incidence. 10. Bottle-fed infants have higher incidence than breastfed infants. 11. Incidence, prevalence of otorrhea: Tympanostomy tubes in place longer.272 CHAPTER 23 Ear DisordersC. Clinical manifestations. 1. Diagnosis of AOM requires (diagnosis certainty imperative): a. History of acute onset of signs and symptoms ( < 48 hours) and fever; pulling, tugging, rubbing at affected ear. b. Presence of middle ear effusion. c. Signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. d. Distinct erythema of TM or distinct otalgia (discomfort clearly related to the ear[s] that causes sleep disturbances and/or interferes with normal activity). 2. Most common younger than 2 years of age. 3. Neonate may present with irritability or feeding difficulty. This may be the indication of a septic focus. 4. Occasionally asymptomatic. 5. Fever in 50% of cases. 6. Other associated symptoms: Irritability, disturbed sleep, restlessness, rhi - norrhea or URI, cough, malaise, sore throat, stiff neck, refusal of bottle, change in eating habits, vomiting, diarrhea. 7. May report recent URI, previous ear infections, allergies, taking bottle to bed, infant supine when feeding from bottle, attending daycare, other siblings sick. 8. Hearing loss. 9. New onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa. D. Physical findings. 1. Fever is common (50% of cases). 2. Signs of URI or allergies. 3. Possible red, enlarged tonsils (pharyngitis). 4. Cervical nodes often enlarged. 5. Otoscopic findings (stringent otoscopic diagnostic criteria endorsed for management decisions): Middle ear effusion must be present as evidenced by any of the following: Bulging TM, decreased or absent mobility of the TM as noted with pneumatic otoscopy, air fluid level behind the TM, otorrhea, acoustic reflectometry. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Pneumatic otoscopy to assess mobility of TM. 2. Tympanometry: To supplement but not replace pneumatic otoscopy, for children older than 6 months of age. 3. Acoustic reflectometry. 4. Tympanocentesis with culture and sensitivity testing is diagnostic of organism. IV. Acute Otitis Media 273F. Differential diagnosis. Acute tonsillitis, J03 Chronic sinusitis, unspecified, J32.9 Foreign body in left ear, initial encounter, T16.2XXA Foreign body in right ear, initial encounter, T16.1XXA Furuncle, unspecified, L02.92 Immunodeficiency, unspecified, I88.9 otitis media, unspecified, H65.9 (OME), Mastoiditis, 3. Foreign body, trauma. 4. Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). 5. Lymphadenitis. 6. Dental abscess, tonsillitis, impacted teeth. 7. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. 8. Immune deficiency. G. Treatment ( Table 23-1 and Table 23-2). 1. Pain management, especially during the first 24 hours, is priority regardless of whether antimicrobial agents prescribed. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are mainstays. Adequate dosage important. Warm compresses may help. Immediate treatment for pain very important. 2. Topical benzocaine products have been withdrawn from the market. Eardrops with benzocaine and antipyrine (Auralgan) no longer being manufactured in United States. 3. Observation involves deferring treatment for 48-72 hours in otherwise healthy children 6 months to 2 years of age with nonsevere illness at pre - sentation and uncertain diagnosis and in children ages 2 years and older who present without severe symptoms or an uncertain diagnosis. There should also be a reliable parent or caregiver able to obtain medication if needed and adequate facilities for follow-up and reevaluation. 4. Prescribe antibiotics with caution. More than 80% of cases resolve spon - taneously. Antibiotic therapy is recommended for AOM (bilateral or unilateral) as follows: a. All children age 6 months and older with severe signs or symptoms (i.e., moderate or severe otaglia, otaglia for at least 48 hours, or tem - perature 102.2\u00b0F [39\u00b0C] or higher).274 CHAPTER 23 Ear DisordersT able 23-2 Recommendations for Initial Management for Uncomplicated Acute Otitis Mediaa AgeOtorrhea With AOMaUnilateral or Without Otorrhea AOMa Without 6 months to 2 yearsAntibiotic therapyAntibiotic therapy Antibiotic therapyAntibiotic therapy or additional observation 2 years Antibiotic therapyAntibiotic therapy Antibiotic therapy or additional observationAntibiotic therapy or additional observationc Abbreviation: AOM, acute otitis media. a Applies only to children with well-documented AOM with high certainty of diagnosis. b A toxic-appearing child, persistent otalgia more than 48 hours, temperature 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C) in the past 48 hours, or if there is uncertain access to follow-up after the visit. c This plan of initial management provides an opportunity for shared decision making with the child's family for those categories appropriate for additional observation. If observation is offered, a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48 to 72 hours of AOM onset.

Copyright \u00a9 2013, American Academy of Pediatrics. Reproduced with permission by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). b. Children with bilateral AOM younger than 24 months of age without severe signs or symptoms (i.e., mild otaglia for less than 48 hours, temperature less than 102.2\u00b0F [39\u00b0C]). 5. Duration of antibiotic therapy: Children with severe symptoms or younger than 2 years of age: 10-day course of treatment; children age 2 to 5 years with mild or moderate AOM: 7-day course of oral antibiotics; children age 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms: 5-7 days of an - tibiotics adequate. 6. Prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer observation with close follow-up based on joint decision making with the parents or caregivers for the following: a. Unilateral AOM in children 6 months to 23 months of age without severe signs or symptoms. b. Bilateral or unilateral AOM in children age 24 months or older without severe signs or symptoms (i.e., mild otaglia for less than 48 hours, temperature less than 102.2\u00b0F [39\u00b0C]). IV. Acute Otitis Media 275c. If observation is used, must have mechanism in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotic therapy if child worsens or fails to improve within 48-72 hours of onset of symptoms. 7. For children age 2 years and older who appear well, discuss treatment options with parents, which include: a. Wait and see prescription (W ASP) or safety-net antibiotic prescription (SNAP). These are prescription for appropriate antibiotic written to be filled within 5 days of office visit. Parents are instructed not to fill prescription unless symptoms worsen at any time or symptoms do not improve during waiting period of 48-72 hours. Instruct parents that child's condition may quickly progress to more severe case and to call, make a return visit if this occurs. b. Five-day course of high-dose amoxicillin (if no history of allergy). 8. Prescribe amoxicillin (drug of choice) if causative organism unknown (most cases), if the child has not received amoxicillin in the past 30 days, if the child does not have concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or if the child is not allergic to penicillin. Because of cost and adverse effects, amoxicillin is the initial antibiotic of choice. 9. High-dose amoxicillin is recommended as the first-line treatment in most patients. 10. If child attends daycare, has received amoxicillin in the past 30 days, has concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or has a history of AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin (suspect beta-lacatamase-positive H. influenzae or M. catar - rahalis ), prescribe an antibiotic with additional beta lactamase coverage. Initiate therapy with high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin, with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, ratio of 14:1, given in two divided doses; this is less likely to cause diarrhea). 11. If allergic to penicillin, treatment with a cephalosporin is recommended. Recent data suggest cross-reactivity among penicillin and cephalosporins is lower than reported. The American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and Joint Council of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology recommend a cephalosporin in cases without severe and/or recent peni - cillin allergy reaction history when skin test is not available. 12. Macrolides (erythromycin and azithromycin) have limited efficacy against H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae . 13. Palatability of oral suspensions has been studied and may lead to active rejection such as spitting out suspension. Cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and clindamycin may benefit from adding taste-favoring products such as chocolate or strawberry to mask bitter taste and unpleasant aftertaste. 14. If child is vomiting or is unable to tolerate oral medication, prescribe ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, intramuscular [IM] in 1 or 2 sites in the anterior 276 CHAPTER 23 Ear Disordersthigh, or intravenously [IV]). This has been demonstrated to be effective for the initial or repeat antibiotic treatment of AOM. 15. Clinical improvement should be noted within 48-72 hours after antibiotics have been initiated. If patient has persistent symptoms of AOM and unim - proved otologic findings (persistent fever; ear pain; irritability; TM findings of redness, bulging, otorrhea) after initial treatment, consider changing the antibiotic (see Table 23-3). If initially treated with amoxicillin, prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanate. If initially prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral third-generation cephalosporin, IM ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), a 3-day course has been shown to be more effective than a 1-day regimen. 16. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole have been used successfully in the past to treat AOM, pneumococcal surveillance studies have shown that resistance to these two combination agents is substantial. If amoxicillin is not initially effective, these two agents are not appropriate therapy. 17. Children with frequent AOM: Evaluate for anemia. If iron deficiency is diagnosed (hemoglobin 10 g/dL), begin iron supplementation to achieve at least a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. 18. Recurrent AOM: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest placement of tympa - nostomy tubes rather than antibiotic prophylaxis. Tympanostomy tubes (performed by an ENT surgeon) are options in children with chronic middle ear fluid (3 months or 4 persistent episodes) who fail to respond to antimicrobial therapy; children with recurrent AOM; those with suppura - tive complications; and those with Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). 19. Tympanocentesis (performed by an ENT specialist) and culture of exudate: If diagnosis is uncertain, child is seriously ill or toxic, response to anti - biotic therapy is unsatisfactory, suppurative complications develop, OM in newborn or in immunologically deficient patients, or AOM develops despite receiving antibiotic therapy. 20. If tympanocentesis is not available, obtain nasopharyngeal specimen. Most middle ear pathogens derive from pathogens colonizing the nasopharynx. Not all nasopharnyx pathogens enter the middle ear and cause AOM. Therefore, if nasopharyngeal culture is negative for specific bacteria, those bacteria are likely not AOM pathogen(s). 21. Recommend pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to all children according to schedule of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), AAP , and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). 22. Recommend annual influenza vaccine for all children 6 months of age and older. 23. Encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months of life and to continue for at least the first year and beyond as long as mutually desired by mother and baby. IV.

If the tympanocentesis reveals multidrug-resistant bacteria, seek an infectious disease specialist consultation. c Cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy on the basis of their distinct chemical structures.

Encourage avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke. 25. Lifestyle changes: Avoid supine bottle-feeding (bottle propping) and reduce or eliminate pacifier use in the second 6 months of life. Reducing the incidence of URIs during infancy and early childhood by altering childhood daycare attendance patterns may significantly decrease the incidence of AOM. 26. Refer for audiologic testing if fail hearing screen. 27. Consult/refer to physician: Infant younger than 2 months of age, signs of meningitis. 28. ENT referral: Hearing loss or delayed speech, 3 infections in 6 months or 4 in 12 months. H. Follow-up. 1. Y ounger than 3 months of age: Revisit 1-2 days (higher incidence of treatment failure). 2. Children 3 months of age and older: Revisit in 48-72 hours if no improve - ment or condition worsens (need to change antibiotics). 3. Return visit if caregiver reports child's symptoms have worsened or failed to respond to initial antibiotic therapy within 48-72 hours to determine if change in therapy is indicated. 4. Return visit 4-8 weeks to evaluate for OME and reinforce teaching. 5. Persistent AOM: Prescribe second-line antibiotic (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or ceftriaxone IM); recheck every 2-4 weeks until resolved. 6.

Refer for hearing evaluation when OME persists for 3 months or longer, at any time there is language delay or learning problems, or if significant hearing loss is suspected in child with OME. 5. Not recommended for treatment of OME in an otherwise healthy child 2 months through 12 years: Antibiotics, nasal steroids, antihis - tamines, and decongestants are not indicated for OME and should not be prescribed. 6. Myringotomy and tympanostomy tubes: Consider for children 6 months to 12 years of age who have had bilateral effusion for a total of 3 months or longer with documented hearing deficiency (defined as a 20-dB hear - ing threshold level or worse in the better hearing ear) or for children with recurrent AOM who have evidence of middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of assessment for tubes.

ALLERGIC RHINITIS Allergic rhinitis, unspecified, J30.4 Cough, R05Dyspnea, H10.45Other R06.7Wheezing, R06.2 A. Etiology. 1. Atopic predilection. a. Very common atopic disease of childhood second only to asthma. b. Often same mediators that produce asthma. c. Genetic factors: Increased IgE production in response to allergens. 2. Environmental factors. a. Common allergens. Seasonal (rare in children younger than 3 years of age). Nonflowering, wind-pollinated plants. Tree pollens: Early spring. Grasses: Late spring and early summer. Weeds: Fall. Acute: Sudden-onset hypersensitivity reaction caused by environ - mental exposure to an allergen. Symptoms generally occur within 30 minutes, and once exposure to the offending allergen ceases, they generally resolve within 24 hours. Perennial: Animal dander, dust (mites), molds (spores), mildew, feathers, cockroaches. Early use of antibiotics may predispose. 287CHAPTER 24B. Occurrence. 1. Affects about 40% of children and 30% of adolescents. 2. If one parent affected, child has 30% chance of developing allergies; both parents, 70% chance. 3. The incidence in males is slightly higher. 4. The incidence in children < 2 years of age is rare as it requires repeated exposure to offending, inhaled allergens. A child in this age group with persistent nasal symptoms may more likely be a case of adenoidal hyper - trophy or chronic sinusitis. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, runny nose, noisy breathing/snoring, cough, halitosis, frequent clearing of throat, plugged ears, wheezing. 2.

Passing a thin, lubricated, 5-6 Fr balloon-tipped catheter past the foreign body, inflating balloon and pulling forward. VI. Foreign Body, Nasal 307g. Batteries should be removed within 1 hour of insertion as they are quite damaging. h. Saline nose drops after removal to soothe mucosa. Possibly antibacte - rial ointment applied sparingly. Saline will sting if foreign body is a battery. Use sterile water for irrigation. i. Care must be taken to not push foreign body into trachea and cause aspiration. H. Follow-up. 1. None, if successful removal and signs of infection clear within 1-2 days. 2. Referral to ENT if unable or unlikely to remove easily (e.g., failed removal attempt, posterior foreign body, not able to visualize easily, chronic inflam - mation, penetrating foreign body). 3. Consider behavioral/emotional assessment if it is recurrent problem or developmentally inappropriate behavior. I. Complications. 1. Chronic infection if undetected and/or not removed. 2. Trauma to nares from removal procedure. J. Education. 1. Close observation of children by caregivers. 2. Limit access by small children to small objects. 3. Note: If child swallows foreign body, especially coin, radiographic survey must be done to ensure object is in stomach. Child must be observed closely for hoarseness, dysphagia, drooling, gagging, vomiting, coughing, choking, and airway compromise, including inspiratory stridor. VII.

Viral vs. bacterial entity. a. Infectious mononucleosis. b. Group C or G streptococcus (may warrant treatment if patient still symptomatic when culture returns). c. Other bacteria: Fusobacterium necrophorum . May be important pathogen in cause of pharyngitis in adolescents and young adults. 2. Allergic rhinitis. G. Treatment. 1. Nonpharmacologic. a. Encourage fluids: May prefer hot or cold for pain relief. 2. Pharmacologic. a. Topical and oral analgesics and antipyretics. b. Antimicrobials: In general, 10 days of treatment is recommended duration of therapy to achieve maximal eradication of GAS in the pharynx. Penicillin V recommended: Children < 27 kg: 250 mg bid or tid for 10 days. Children 27 kg: 500 mg bid or tid for 10 days. Intramuscular ( IM) benzathine penicillin G: If compliance, vomit - ing issues. Children < 27 kg: 600,000 units (Bicillin C-R 900/300). Children 27 kg: 1.2 million units (Bicillin L-A). Amoxicillin: Substituted for taste issues (may benefit 40% of children with adenotonsillar disease, who yield beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, and is effective for otitis media, which is often associated with pharyngitis). 50 mg/kg/day PO (max 1 g/day) for 10 days daily or divided bid. Adolescents > age 12 years: 775 mg daily for 10 days. Penicillin ( PCN)-allergic options: Clindamycin (use if IgE-mediated macrolide resistance): < 70 kg: 7 mg/kg/dose tid for 10 days; 70 kg: 600 mg tid \u00d7 10 days (max 300 mg tid \u00d7 10 10 days. Azithromycin: 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days (max 500 mg/day). Note that macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) should only be used for severe PCN allergy. First-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin: Also appropriate if retreatment necessary. Note: As many as 5% of PCN-allergic people are also allergic to cephalosporins. People with severe, IgE-mediated PCN allergy should not be treated with a cephalosporin. Due to increased treatment failure with PCN, some clinicians are using first-generation cephalosporin in all nonallergic patients. Cephalexin (25-40 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 10 days). Other cephalosporins also have indication for GAS treatment: Cef - podoxime, cefdinir, cefuroxime. Ceftriaxone must be administered for 3 consecutive days for effective treatment. If illness recurs shortly after treatment: May be retreated with same drug. IM penicillin if compliance an issue. Also has excellent rates of eradication of GAS from nasopharynx. Narrow-spectrum cephalosporin (cephalexin). Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium. H. Follow-up. 1. Routine reculturing is not necessary, though test of cure recommended for patients with history of rheumatic fever, during outbreaks of rheu - matic fever and/or poststrep glomerulonephritis, and if recurrence in close-contact settings. 2. Encourage patients to call if: a. Unable to complete course of medication or retain medication. b. Siblings complain of sore throat within 2-5 days: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/6.4 mg per kg/day. If allergic: 6 months to 12 years of age, cefdinir 7 mg/kg bid or 14 mg/kg daily; age 13 years, 300 mg bid 10 days. c. No improvement in patient in 48 hours, reevaluate for other causes, complications. d. Signs and symptoms of renal complications. e. Drug reaction. 3. Possible assessment of carrier state, which is common, and patients are low risk to transmit and develop invasive disease. Most common scenario is a carrier who is experiencing repeated intercurrent episodes of viral pharyngitis. (In true GAS, pharyngitis response to antimicrobial therapy is 316 CHAPTER 24 Sinus, Mouth, Throat, and Neck Disordersrapid.) Treatment of carriers is indicated only in very specific cases such as those involving rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis outbreaks or recur - rent, symptomatic GAS pharyngitis in a family after appropriate therapy. a. Ten-day course of either: Clindamycin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate. b. ENT referral for possible tonsillectomy. Multiple bouts of GAS (6 episodes in 1 year or 3-4 in 2 consecutive years) despite adequate treatment. Significant upper airway obstruction. Peritonsillar abscess. I. Complications. Acute lymphadenitis, unspecified, diffuse fever. c. Poststrep glomerulonephritis. Children younger than age 7 years most at risk. Role of antibiotics for prevention uncertain. d. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci (PANDAS). Symptoms include sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) be - haviors, tics, or rapid worsening of existing behaviors and evidence of recent or active streptococcal infection. J. Education. 1. Transmission is person to person via respiratory tract secretions. 2. Medication compliance is essential. 3. May return to school/daycare 24 hours after beginning antibiotic therapy. 4. After beginning therapy, change toothbrush and toothpaste; use paper cups; do not share towels, washcloths, cups. VIII. Pharyngitis 317IX. RHINOSINUSITIS Acute combined immunodeficiencies, D81.89 Other fatigue, R53.83Other specified disorders of nose and nasal sinuses, J34.8 Toxic effect of smoke, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter, T59.811A A. Etiology. 1. Each case of viral rhinitis is also rhinosinusitis because mucous membranes of nasal passages, sinus cavities are is inflammation of mucous membranes lining, paranasal sinuses, commonly used to describe bacterial rhinosinusitis. 3. Factors that increase risk of sinusitis are: a. Smoke exposure. b. Cold and dry inspired air. c. Preceding or concurrent URI. d. Allergic rhinitis. e. Swimming. f. Gastroesophageal reflux. g. Cystic fibrosis. h. Immunodeficiency. i. Ciliary dyskinesia. j. Factors associated with nasal obstruction. k. Daycare attendance. 4. Stagnation of secretions occurs within sinus cavities, becoming culture medium for bacteria.318 CHAPTER 24 Sinus, Mouth, Throat, and Neck Disorders5. Occurrence. 1. Complication of 5-10% of viral upper respiratory illnesses in children. 2. In young children, occurs primarily in maxillary sinuses, ethmoids secondly. 3. Frontal sinusitis is rare prior to age 10 years. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Acute bacterial sinusitis. a. A child or adolescent has URI and presents with: Persistent illness that includes any quality or color of nasal discharge or daytime cough or both lasting > 10 days without improving. Worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or after initially improving development of fever). Severe onset: Fever of 102.2 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) or higher with purulent nasal discharge for 3 consecutive days or longer. D. Physical findings. 1. Nasal discharge of any quality. 2. Erythema and edema of the turbinates are nonspecific findings. 3. Percussion of the sinuses is not useful. 4. Transillumination in children is very difficult and unreliable. a. History of symptoms is much more important than physical exam as bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators of sinusitis. b. Assessment of nasal discharge is important, primarily in a temporal context (i.e., purulent nasal discharge is significant initially and with fever, and if it persists for at least 3 days). c. Most physical findings without history of symptoms cannot be dis - tinguished from those of a viral URI. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. X-rays: Findings on plain radiographs correlate poorly with disease and should not be used. 2. CT scan with contrast or MRI of paranasal sinuses when suspicion of orbital or central nervous system complications. IX. Rhinosinusitis 319F. Differential diagnosis. Acute upper respiratory infection, URI. 2. Allergic (rhinitis medicamentosa). 4. Tumors: Polyps, Septal deviation, choanal atresia. G. Treatment. 1. Indication: a. Antibiotic therapy initiated for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) with severe onset or worsening course. b. Option of 3-day observation of children with persistent illness (nasal discharge of any quality, daytime cough that may be worse at night or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement). 2. ABRS in children. a. Children aged 2 years or older with uncomplicated ABRS that is mild to moderate, who do not attend daycare, and who have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent in the last 4 weeks and in communities with a high (or unknown) prevalence of nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae : Low-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 45 mg/kg/day (based on the amoxicillin component) divided BID, max 1.75 g/day b. Children with moderate to severe illness or who are younger than 2 years of age, attending child care , or have been recently treated with an antimicrobial agent in the past 4 weeks: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin component in 2 divided doses, max 4 g/day. c. Allergy to PCN: Cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime. Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg 3 1 IM dose may be used for vomiting patients, observing for response and following with PO course of therapy. Serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cepha - losporins with history of nonsevere PCN allergy is now thought to be negligible.320 CHAPTER 24 Sinus, Mouth, Throat, and Neck Disorders Microbial resistance precludes current use of sulfamethoxazole- trimethoprim or azithromycin for the treatment of ABRS. d. Length of treatment: At least 10 days. Some recommendations for therapy to be continued for 7 days after resolution of symptoms. e. If no response or worsening of symptoms within 72 hours of begin - ning treatment, change antibiotic or initiate antibiotic if initially observing for 3 days. 3. Normal saline nasal irrigation or lavage assists drainage and ventilation. 4. Topical nasal steroids: May decrease swelling of turbinates and aid ostia to drain. 5. Mucolytics: May help mucous clearance. 6. Antihistamines: Nonsedating helpful if allergic component. 7. Decongestants: Controversial benefit. 8. Humidified air. 9. Encourage fluids. 10. Ensure yearly influenza vaccination. 11. Administration of pneumococcal vaccine on appropriate schedule and update as newer vaccines with additional strains are developed. 12. Treat reflux if present. H. Follow-up. 1. Patient to call if no response to medications in 72 hours, sooner if worsens. 2. Recheck in 2 weeks. 3. Referral to ENT or allergist if indicated or refractory. I. Complications. Asthma with (acute) exacerbation, unspecified, J45.901 Cellulitis 1. Periorbital and intraorbital inflammation and infection. 2. Intracranial complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema, brain abscess (most common in previously healthy male ado - lescents subsequent to frontal sinusitis). IX. Rhinosinusitis 3213. Exacerbation of asthma. 4. Optic neuritis. 5. Osteomyelitis of maxilla or frontal bone. 6. Meningitis. J. Education. 1. Prevention: Avoid allergens and treat allergies when appropriate. 2. Encourage humidified air at home unless it exacerbates mildew, mold allergies. 3. Emphasize that most rhinitis and sinusitis are viral in etiology, and anti - biotics are not indicated. 4. Encourage compliance with prescribed antimicrobial agents. 5. Advise patient against diving (including scuba). BIBLIOGRAPHY Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infant deaths associated with cough and cold medications\u2014two states, 2005.

Etiology. 1. Acute upper airway obstruction in children, most often caused by viral infection. a. Most common form of viral croup is laryngotracheitis resulting from inflammation and edema of larynx, subglottic area. The most common viral etiology is due to parainfluenza, enterovirus, adenovirus, or rhinovirus; influenza and B, respiratory croup is similar to viral croup but is not associated with fever and symptoms; lasts only hours, not days. Onset typically occurs during night in a child who has been well. May represent allergic reaction to viral antigen. c. Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB) and laryngotracheobronchopneumo - nia (LTBP) involve upper airway; also affect lower airway, specifically bronchi. Same viral agents are common to LTB and LTBP . Bacterial superinfection occurs more commonly are infrequent causes but tend to cause more severe illness. B. Occurrence. 1. Viral croup occurs at 6 months to 5 years of age, with peak in second year of life. 2. Affects boys more than girls. 3. Occurs in late fall, early winter; correlates with the activity of viral agents causing the syndrome. 4. Symptoms typically last 3-7 days. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Gradual onset with rhinorrhea, sore throat, mild fever. 2. Disease has wide spectrum, from very mild illness to severe illness. 3. Harsh, \"seal-like\" barking cough. 4. Hoarseness. 5. Inspiratory stridor. 6. Increasing obstruction. a. Tachycardia, b. Suprasternal, supraclavicular, substernal, intercostal retractions. c. Paradoxical abdominal and chest wall movement. d. Progressive restlessness and anxiety correlates with hypoxemia. D. Physical findings. 1. Normal or mildly elevated temperature. 2. Mild erythema and edema of nasal mucosa. 3. Inspiratory stridor. 4. Hoarseness. 5. Harsh, barky cough. 6. Nontoxic appearing. 7. On auscultation, normal breath sounds except transmission of stridor. 8. With increased obstruction: Wheezing, prolonged expiration, decreased breath sounds.326 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory DisordersE. Diagnostic tests. 1. Diagnosis made on basis of history and clinical presentation. 2. Imaging is not usually necessary in the ambulatory setting; posteroante - rior neck X-ray. a. Classic \"steeple sign\": Narrowed air column consistent with narrowing of subglottic space seen in an anteroposterior (AP) film. b. Lateral view is useful in ruling out epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, radiopaque foreign body. 3. A complete blood count (CBC) is usually nonspecific but may suggest viral lymphocytosis. 4. Clinical croup score can classify severity of illness and aid in decision making regarding hospitalization. F. Differential diagnosis. Acute epiglottitis without obstruction, J05.10 Diphtheria, unspecified, A36.9 J39.0 appearing, drooling, high fever, lack of croupy cough, growing anxiety, acute onset, age range typically 3-7 years. 2. Laryngeal foreign body: History, age (usually 6 months to 2 years), abrupt onset, lack of preceding respiratory symptoms. 3. Retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess: Severe throat pain, refusal to swallow or speak, fever to 105\u00baF (40.6\u00baC). 4. Bacterial tracheitis: Affects children of any age, acute onset with respira - tory stridor, high fever, copious and purulent secretions. This is a rare but life-threatening upper airway disease. 5. Diphtheria: Characteristic thin, gray membrane (pseudomembrane) that extends from tonsil to associated soft/hard palate. Caused by toxin produced from the bacteria. G. Treatment. 1. Mainstay of treatment is airway management. 2. Most children have mild airway obstruction that resolves without specific treatment. 3. Supportive care at home includes making the child comfortable, avoiding fatigue and anxiety; encourage fluids and antipyretics for fever. 4. Cool mist vaporizer may be used. 5. Nebulized epinephrine has been beneficial for children with more severe croup in the emergency department or hospital setting. 6. Corticosteroids. I. Croup 327a.

Etiology. 1. Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection primarily affecting the small airways. It is a common viral illness characterized by edema, inflammation, increased mucus production, and necrosis of the epithelial cells lining the small airways. a. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in first 2 years of life. b. Bronchiolitis is also caused by parainfluenza 1 and 3, adenovirus, rhinoviruses, influenza, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus. 2. Transmission. a. Highly contagious. Virus shed in 3-8 days and up to 30 days with underlying disease. Virus spreads by large droplet aerosols generated by coughing, sneezing. Transmitted by direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions from infected person. Virus survives on skin approximately 20 minutes. Virus survives on gowns/tissues approximately 30-60 minutes. Virus survives on hard, nonporous surfaces approximately 6 hours. High-risk factors for more severe disease: Prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, immunosuppression. b. Reinfection occurs throughout life. B. Occurrence. 1. Seasonal prevalence. a. Peak incidence is between 2 and 6 months of age. b. Y early epidemics in early winter/spring. c.

Etiology. 1. Pertussis: Highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, less commonly by B. parapertussis (gram-negative coccobacillus). 2. Transmission: Airborne, occurs by contact with respiratory droplets of infected person or by indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. 3. Disease is endemic in United States, with all 50 states reporting cases annually. 4. Most cases in United States occur between June and October. B. Occurrence. 1. Pertussis causes disease in every age group. a. Significantly impacts nonimmunized or partially immunized young children; can cause severe disease. Highest mortality in infants younger than 6 months of age. 2. Incubation period is 7-10 days, with a range of 6-21 days. 3. Persons with pertussis are considered infectious from 7 days after exposure to 3 weeks after person enters paroxysmal stage. a. Pertussis is most contagious from catarrhal stage until 2 weeks after onset of cough without appropriate therapy. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Pertussis is lengthy disease lasting 6-10 weeks, divided into 3 stages. a. Catarrhal stage lasts 1-2 weeks; may not be recognized in infants younger than 3 months. Characterized by URI symptoms such as rhinorrhea, sneezing, mild cough, low-grade fever. b. The paroxysmal stage lasts 2-6 weeks or longer. Characterized by paroxysmal cough/bouts of rapid cough, sudden coughing, followed by \"whoop. \" Have color change, bulging eyes, tearing, tongue protrusion. May be triggered by feeding, crying, excitement, activity. May have multiple episodes each hour during peak but appear well between episodes. May have characteristic whoop during forceful inspiration. Post-tussive vomiting, exhaustion are common following episode. Infants < 6 months of age may have less-typical presentation. The characteristic whoop may be absent, but apnea, choking, gagging may occur. c. Convalescent stage lasts 1-2 weeks, but cough can persist for several months. During this stage, cough and post-tussive vomiting decrease. V. Pertussis 341D. Physical findings. 1. Cough. a. Catarrhal stage: Mild. b. Paroxysmal cough: Associated with post-tussive vomiting. c. Subconjunctival hemorrhages and petechiae on head and neck. 2. Breath sounds are normal, unless significant atelectasis or pneumonia. E. Diagnostic tests. 1.

Most likely to be positive during catarrhal stage to peak of paroxys - mal stage. b. Use calcium alginate or Dacron swab of posterior nasopharynx for 15-30 seconds or by nasal wash and plate on specialized media, incubate for 7 days. 3. PCR is replacing culture as the diagnostic test of choice at many hospitals. a. PCR is a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for B. pertussis even late in the course of illness. b. Do not use calcium alginate swabs for PCR as it is inhibitory to PCR. 4. Serology. a. Enzyme immunoassay detects antibody to B. pertussis in acute and convalescent samples: Not helpful during acute illness and difficult to interpret in immunized persons. 5. CBC: Leukocytosis with lymphocytosis in catarrhal and early paroxysmal stages. a. Present in infants and young children but not in adolescents. F. Differential diagnosis.

Azithromycin (Zithromax) , erythromycin, or clarithromycin (Biaxin) are first-line treatment and prophylaxis. a. Do not use erythromycin in infants < 1 month of age because of association with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IFPS). 4. Dosing. a. days of age: Azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day as single daily dose for 5 days. All infants < 30 days of age who receive macrolides should be moni - tored for IFPS during and for 1 month following completion of course. b. 1-5 months of age. Azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day as single daily dose for 5 days. Erythromycin 40-50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 14 days. Clarithromycin 15 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 7 days. c. Infants 6 months of age or older and children. Azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day as single daily dose on day 1 (maximum dose 500 mg), then 5 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 250 mg) on days 2-5.

Death: Infants younger than 1 year of age are at highest risk ( > 80% of deaths related to pertussis occur in infants younger than age 1 year). J. Education. 1. B. pertussis is preventable with appropriate immunizations. AAP recommends 3 DTaP doses (to be given at age 2, 4, 6 months) followed by boosters at age 15-18 months and 4-6 years. 2. Pertussis is very contagious and spread by direct or indirect contact with respiratory droplets. 3. Good handwashing and containment of coughs/sneezes prevent spread of illness. 4. Guidelines about adequate hydration and nutrition. 5. Children may continue to have cough for several months.344 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory Disorders6. Provide adequate rest and avoid activity that triggers cough. 7. Need for antibiotic treatment of all household and close contacts. 8.

Irritants: Active/passive tobacco smoke exposure, indoor and outdoor air pollution, strong odors, chemical cleaning products. c. Viral illness. URI, sinusitis, rhinitis, otitis, LRI. Viral illness is primary trigger for asthma in young children. d. Weather: Rapid change in weather; hot, humid weather; cold air. e. Exercise. f. Emotions or stress. g. Occupational exposures: Farm and barn exposures, formaldehydes, paint fumes, smoke, strong odors. h. Aspirin sensitivity (more common in adults): Includes other nonste - roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). i. Sulfite sensitivity: In many processed foods, dried fruit, salad bars, beer, wine. j. Risk factors: Atopy: Family history or eczema. Gender: Preadolescent boys are at higher risk. Smoking: History of mother smoking perinatally. Respiratory viral disease. k. Aggravating factors: Smoking, GER, sinusitis. B. Occurrence. 1. Most common serious chronic illness among children. 2. Onset at any age from infancy to old age; 50-80% of children with asthma develop symptoms before 5 years of age. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Recurrent wheezing. 2. Dry, persistent cough, nocturnal cough.346 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory Disorders3. Recurrent chest tightness or shortness of breath, chest pain. 4. Sputum production. 5. Exercise-induced cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tight ness. 6. In younger children, difficulty keeping up with peers. 7. Atopic profile. a. Eczema. b. Seasonal or perennial allergy symptoms. c. Rhinitis, sneezing, itching and rubbing of nose, throat clearing. d. Conjunctivitis. 8. Fatigue secondary to sleep disturbance. 9. Poor school performance secondary to sleep disturbance. D. Physical findings. 1. Upper respiratory tract. a. Allergic shiners, \"allergic salute\" (characteristic crease at bridge of nose due rhinitis). b. Conjunctivitis. c. Boggy, flaring. d. Grunting. 2. Skin conditions. a. Eczema. 3. Chest exam. a. Normal chest examination does not rule out asthma. b. Bilateral wheezing, end-expiratory wheezing on forced expiration. c. Prolonged expiratory phase; rapid, shallow respirations. d. Hyperresonance to percussion. e. Hyperexpansion of chest, increased anterior-posterior diameter. f. Intercostal, suprasternal, and/or subcostal retractions. g. In infants, paradoxical breathing. h. In young children, pushing with abdominal musculature on expiration. i. Dry, tight-sounding cough. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Detailed medical history. a. Family history of allergy, asthma, eczema, dermatitis. b. Identify symptoms consistent with asthma. c. Identify pattern of symptoms that occur or worsen in presence of specific triggers. Consider diagnosis after three episodes of cough and/or wheezing, once alternative diagnoses are excluded. VI. Asthma 3472. Focused physical examination with special attention on the upper re - spiratory tract, chest, and skin. 3. Laboratory procedures. a. Spirometry. Age limited; difficult to accurately test children younger than 5-7 years of age in most settings. Pre- and postbronchodilator to validate reversibility. May be normal. Essential for diagnosis. Test annually to establish baseline pulmonary function. b. Peak flow is monitoring tool, not diagnostic tool. 4. CXR: Important in newly diagnosed asthmatic, rules out alternative diagnoses. 5. Special studies. a. Sinus X-rays or computed tomography ( CT) to evaluate sinusitis. b. pH probe or barium swallow to evaluate GER. c. Allergy testing. Referral to board-certified allergist to administer skin tests and interpret. Radioallergosorbent test ( RAST): Not as sensitive as skin testing, results not immediate. Allergic bronchitis, wheezy bronchitis. Recurrent bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Even children with mild persistent asthma have significant airway inflammation. Without adequate anti-inflammatory therapy, there may be airway remodeling or irreversible changes in asthma airway. 6. Asthma classification. a. Severity: Intrinsic to the disease process. First step in initiating therapy for patient who has not been taking long-term controller medication. b. Control: Fluctuates over time. c. Impairment: Assessment component for severity and control; effect of asthma on quality of life and functional capacity. d. Risk: Assessment component for severity and control; refers to future impact on quality of life and functional capacity. e. Four categories: Intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. See Figure 25 -1 through Figure 25 -3. Intermittent asthma. Symptoms > 2 times per week, nighttime symptoms > 2 times a month.348 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory DisordersFigure 25-1 Classifying asthma severity and initiating treatment in children 0-4 years of age.

Vocal cord dysfunction: Paradoxical adduction of vocal cords during inspira - tion (often in adolescent girls). Symptoms of distress, including inspiratory wheezing, and are out of proportion to clinical exam, including normal oxygen saturations. Diagnosis established by direct visualization of vocal cords using flexible rhinolaryngoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy. 2. Congenital pulmonary malformations: Tracheoesophageal fistula. b. Vascular ring, sling, or extrinsic mass. 3. Foreign body aspiration: Focal findings on auscultation; medical history key. 4. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: History of prematurity, treatment with oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation during neonatal period. 5. Viral bronchiolitis: Virus may be identified by antigen testing or culture; may be trigger for asthma. Asthma differentiated by pattern of symptoms over time.352 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory Disorders6. GER: Reflux of barium into esophagus by barium swallow or esophageal pH monitoring. Can be aggravating factor in asthma control. 7. Cystic fibrosis: Genetic disease characterized by excessive production of thick, tenacious respiratory secretions, chronic pulmonary infection, malabsorption, subsequent poor growth. G. Treatment. 1. Goals of treatment. a. No coughing, shortness of breath/rapid breathing, wheezing, chest tightness. b. No nighttime awakenings because of asthma symptoms. c. Normal activities, including play, sports, exercise. d. No absences from school or activities or work (for parent or caregiver). e. Normal lung function. 2. Key principles. a. Prevent airway inflammation by eliminating or avoiding triggers. b. Asthma can be controlled, not cured. c. Reverse and suppress inflammation. 3. Nonpharmacologic therapy. a. Patient education. Asthma action plan: Individual plan for daily medications and emergency plan. b. Objective measures of lung function using peak flow monitoring and follow-up spirometry. c. Control or avoid aggravating factors. 4. Pharmacologic therapy. a. Simplify treatment plan whenever possible. b. Classification of severity guides choice and frequency of therapy. c. Persistent asthma is most effectively controlled with daily anti-inflammatory medications. d. National Asthma Education and Prevention guidelines support ag - gressive therapy to achieve rapid control of symptoms and then step down to lowest level of therapy to maintain control. e. Goals in treatment of acute episode are: Rapid reversal of acute airway obstruction. Identify causes of asthma episode. Adjust chronic maintenance to prevent recurrence of asthma flare. Inhaled beta 2-agonist is quick-relief medication for all levels of severity and treatment of choice for prevention of exercise-induced asthma. Short \"burst\" of oral glucocorticoids is used to reduce inflamma - tion during acute episode. VI. Asthma 353f. For estimated comparative daily dosages for inhaled corticosteroids, see Figure 25 -4. 5. Build child/family and healthcare provider partnership. a. Understand and address reasons for adherence problems in asthma. b. Explore patient/family misconceptions about asthma. c. Agree on goals and expectations of treatment. d. Jointly develop treatment plan. H. Follow-up. 1. Before increasing medications, investigate reasons for poor asthma control. a. Improper inhaler technique. b. Adherence issues, knowledge deficit. c. Environmental exposures. d. Exacerbation of aggravating conditions (e.g., GER, sinusitis). 2. Many children have multiple caretakers. a. Each caretaker must have access to medications, appropriate devices, asthma action plan. b. Provide information to all caregivers, including daycare providers, teachers, coaches, school nurses. c. Ensure reliable, immediate access to medications in all settings, including school. 3. Regular use of quick-relief medicine indicates deterioration in control of asthma and need to assess maintenance therapy. 4. Regular follow-up visits are encouraged to achieve and maintain control with appropriate intensity of therapy. 5. Monitor child for side effects of medications. 6. Refer to asthma specialist for difficult-to-control asthma (see Figure 25-1 through Figure 25-3 and Figure 25 -5 through Figure 25 -10). a. For children younger than 5 years of age: Consider referral at step 2; refer at steps 3 and 4. b. For children older than 5 years of age: Consider referral at step 3; refer at step 4. 7. Peak-flow monitoring to establish personal best: More specific than predicted value. 8. At each encounter, reassess concerns and correct misconceptions. 9. Monitor quality of life on regular basis. 10. Recognize and address barriers to asthma self-management. 11. Assess source of social support for child and family. 12. Assess child and family satisfaction with asthma care. 13. Y early influenza vaccine for child and household contacts.354 CHAPTER 25 Respiratory DisordersFigure 25-4 Estimated comparative daily dosages for inhaled corticosteroids in children. Key: HFA, hydrofluoroalkane; NA, not approved and no data available for this age group. Notes: The most important determinant of appropriate dosing is the clinician's judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The clinician must monitor th e patient's response on several clinical parameters and adjust the dose accordingly. The stepwise approach to therapy emphasizes that once control of asthma is achieved, the dose of medication should be carefully titrated to the minimum dose required to maintain control, thus reducing thepotential for adverse effect. Some doses may be outside package labeling, especially in the high-dose range. Budesonide nebulizer suspension is the only ICS with FDAapproved labeling for children < 4 years of age. Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) dosages are expressed as the actuator dose (the amount of the drug leaving the actuator and delivered to thepatient), which is the labeling required in the United States. This is different from the dosage expressed as the valve dose (the amount of theleaving the valve, not all of which is available to the patient), which is used in many European countries and in some scientific literature. Drypowder inhaler (DPI) doses are expressed as the amount of drug in the inhaler following activation.Low Daily Dose Child 0 -4 Beclomethasone HFADrugMedian Daily Dose 40 or 80 mcg/puff NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NANANA80-160 mcg > 160 -320 mcg > 320 > 1250 > 352 mcg > 400 mcg > 900 mcg 640 mcg> 1.0 > 352 mcg2.0 mg> mcg 90, 180, or 200 mcg/inhalation or 250 mcg/inhalation250 mcg/puff 80 mcg/puffChild 5 -11 High Daily Dose Child 0 -4C hild 5 -11 Child 0-4 Child 5-11 For children < 4 years of age: The safety and efficacy of ICS in children < 1 year has not been established. Children < 4 years of age generally require delivery of ICS (budesonide and fluticasone HFA) through a face mask that should fit snugly over nose and avoid nebulizing in the eyes. Wash face after each treatment to prevent local corticosteroid side effects. For budesonide, the dose may be administered 1 -3 times daily. Budesonide suspension is compatible with albuterol, ipratropium, and levalbuterol nebulizer solutions in the same nebulizer. Use only jet nebuilizers, as ultrasonic nebulizers are ineffective for suspensions. For fluticasone HFA, the dose should be divided 2 times daily: the low dose for children < 4 years is higher than for children 5 -11 years of age due to lower dose delivered with face mask and data on efficacy in young children.

Zileuton is a less desirable alternative due to limited studies as adjunctive therapy and the preferred treatment before function. Theophylline requires monitoring of serum concentration levels. In step 6, before oral systemic cortcosteroids are introduced, a trail of high-dose ICS + LABA + either LTRA, theophylline, or zileuton may be considered, although this approach has not been studied in clinical trials.Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within either preferred or alternative therapy. EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm; step: education, environmental management of comorbidities Steps 2-4: Consider subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy for patients who have allergic asthma (see notes) . Quick-Relief Medication for All Patients SABA as needed for symptoms. Intensity of treatment depends on severity of symptoms: Up to 3 treat- ments at 20-minute Intervals as needed. Short course of oral systemic corticosteroids may be needed. Use of SABA > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generallly indicates inadequate control and the need to step up treatment .Low-dose ICS + LABA OR Medium-dose ICSPreferred:Medium-dose ICS + LABAPreferred:High-dose IC S + LABAPreferred:Step up if needed Step down if possibleHigh-dose IC S + LABA + oral corticosteroi d AND Consider omalizumab fo r patients who have allergies.AND Consider omalizumab fo r patients who have allergies.Preferred: Consult with asthma specialist if step 4 care or higher is required. Consider consultation at step 3. (first, check adherence, environmental control, and comordid conditions) (and asthma is well controlled at least 3 months) Steps 1, 2, and 3 preferred therapies are based on Evidence A; step 3 alternative therapy is based on Evidence A for LTRA, Evidence B for theophylline, and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 4 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B, and alternative therapy is based on Evidence B for LTRA and theophylline and Evidence D forzileuton. Step 5 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B. Step 6 preferred therapy is based on (EPR\u20142 1997) and Evidence B for omalizumab. Immunotherapy for steps 2-4 is based on Evidence B for house-dust mites, animal danders, and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults. Clinicians who administer immunotherapy or omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.Medium-dose ICS + either LTRA or theophylline, or zileutonAlternative: Low-dose ICS + either LTRA or theophylline, or zileutonAlternative: Reproduced from National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Pneumonia 363 Pneumonia results from spread of infection along airways. Causes direct injury to respiratory epithelium, resulting in airway obstruction, abnormal secretion, and necrotic debris in airway lumen and lymphocytic infiltrations of interstitium and lung parenchyma. Small airways are obstructed, resulting in poor oxygenation and air trapping, which leads to ventilation and perfusion mismatch. 6. Common bacterial pathogens. Transmission: Contagious. Bacterial pathogens may be aspirated or inhaled, rarely by hema - togenous spread. Transmitted via person-to-person contact by large droplet aero - solization during coughing/sneezing. Viral infection damages host's normal airway defense mechanisms, facilitating secondary bacterial infection. c. S. pneumoniae . Many have S. pneumoniae colonization in upper respiratory tract. Gram-positive encapsulated diplococci produce local edema. Organism is distributed into adjacent areas of lung, resulting in typical focal lobar consolidation. More than 90 serotypes exist. d. S. aureus . Gram-positive organism; beta-lactamase producer. exoproducts, enzymes, toxins, which viru - lence of this organism. Causes confluent bronchopneumonia; often unilateral with areas of hemorrhagic necrosis, cavitation of lung parenchyma, resulting in formation M. pneumoniae . Smallest self-replicating bacterium; lacks cell wall, dependent on host. Binds to ciliated respiratory epithelium and inhibits ciliary action.

Etiology. 1. Classes of chest pain. a. Severe, acute, unremitting chest pain: Refer immediately to pediatrician or urgent/emergent care facility. Rare and most often due to cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal causes. b. Chronic or recurrent chest pain: More likely. Typically patient has had several episodes of chest pain before medical attention is sought. Many times, physical exam may be normal. Patient history is crucial in elucidating etiology of chest pain, al - though large percentage of chest pain in children will never have etiology determined. Chest pain is distressing to patients, families: Chest pain in adult friends, relatives typically signifies cardiac event. Most chest pain in childhood is noncardiac in origin. Thorough history and physical can rule out serious causes for chest pain. 2. Chest pain, cardiac in origin. a. Coronary artery disease. b. Congenital heart disease. c. Typically have murmur. d. Acquired heart disease. e. Infectious etiologies. f. Cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, Kawasaki disease, rheumatic fever. g. Myocardial Cardiomyopathies. i. Dysrhythmias. j.

C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Chronic or recurrent intermittent chest pain. a. Most often occurs in adolescent population. b. May or may not limit activities.374 CHAPTER 26 Cardiovascular Disordersc. Usually chest pain has been long standing before treatment is sought. d. Important to elucidate inciting factors and relieving factors. Relationship of pain to activity varies. e. Associated symptoms. Syncope, presyncope, dizziness, palpitations. f. Congenital heart disease or previous cardiac surgery is important factor in determining cardiac origin of chest pain; also increases likelihood of dysrhythmia as origin for chest pain. D. Physical findings. 1. Most commonly patients will have no significant physical exam findings. Physical exam findings may be clues to origin of chest pain. 2. Stigmata of certain syndromes: Marfan, Turner. 3. Cardiac murmur. 4. Evidence of congestive heart failure. a. Tachypnea, increased work of breathing, retractions, flaring, tachycar - dia, weak peripheral pulses, cool extremities, delayed capillary refill, rales, enlarged liver, easily fatigued, edema. 5. Obesity: Increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). 6. Reproducible pain with palpation. 7. Signs of trauma to chest wall. 8. Decreased breath sounds. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Refer to pediatrician/specialist if chest pain of cardiac origin is suspected; may conduct the following tests as part of evaluation. 2. Chest X-ray (CXR). a. Evaluate for cardiomegaly. May also reveal rib fractures or pneumonia. 3. Electrocardiogram. a. Clue to cardiac origins: Hypertrophied atria or ventricles, infarcts, dysrhythmias. 4. Echocardiography. a. Structural abnormalities. b. Coronary artery anatomy. c. Cardiac function. 5. Exercise testing. a. ST segment response to exercise. b. May provoke dysrhythmias. c.

Consideration of medical or surgical therapy. f. Dysrhythmias. Identification of dysrhythmia. Antidysrhythmic agents. Ablation of accessory pathways. H. Follow-up. 1. Follow up with pediatrician or specialist as indicated. 2. Support for chronic pain. 3. Assess for missed diagnosis if pain persists or worsens. 4. No cause of chest pain may have been identified. Patient, family may require ongoing support, education, particularly if pain continues. I. Complications. 1. Misdiagnosis. 2. Sudden cardiac death rare. J. Education. 1. Most often require assurance and education as to noncardiac nature of chest pain and resumption of normal activities. 2. If cause of chest pain found, education regarding cause and treatment plan.

HYPERTENSION Acute myocardial infarction, I21 Anorexia, R63.0 Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of unspecified cerebral artery, I63.50 Convulsions, Diabetes mellitus, E10-E14Disorder of adrenal gland, unspecified, E27.9 Disorder of circulatory system, unspecified, I99.9 Disorder of kidney and ureter, unspecified, N28.9 Epistaxis, R04.0378 CHAPTER 26 Cardiovascular DisordersA. Etiology. 1. May be early onset of primary hypertension. 2. Etiology of adult-onset primary hypertension is unclear and thought to be multifactorial with genetic, familial, environmental factors. Becoming more clear that elevations of blood pressure (BP) in childhood are begin - nings of adult primary hypertension. 3. May be a sign of underlying pathology (secondary hypertension). a. Renal, cardiac, endocrine diseases. 4. Related to systemic disease, chronic illness, or medication. B. Occurrence. 1. By definition, about 3.5% of children will have hypertension. 2. Primary hypertension is more common in children. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure consistently above 90th per - centile for age, sex, height taken on three separate occasions using the proper-sized cuff. a. Stage 1 hypertension is 90th to 95th percentile + 12 mm Hg and should be repeated on three or more separate occasions to confirm. b. Stage 2 hypertension is greater than the 95th percentile + 5 mm Hg. Prompt referral. Immediate referral if patient is symptomatic. c. Elevated blood pressure is now defined as readings between the 90th and 95th percentiles and/or 130/80 in those older than 13 years. In children younger than 13 years, blood pressure > 95th percentile based on new sex, age, and height tables. d.

Hypertension 379e. Children with primary hypertension are usually older than age 6 years, have family history in parent or grandparent of hypertension, are overweight or obese. 2. Secondary hypertension. a. Hypertension secondary to another cause. b. Typically more severe elevation of blood pressure. c. Y ounger age. d. Severe elevation of blood pressure at any age should trigger an ag - gressive evaluation to look for an underlying cause. 3. Primary hypertension. a. Typically milder elevation in blood pressure, but still > 90th percentile. b. Often associated with obesity. c. Typically, family history of essential hypertension. d. Elevated heart rate is common. e. Variable blood pressure measurements on repeated evaluation. f. Often no additional findings on history or physical. g. For mild elevation of blood pressure in asymptomatic adolescent, it is more likely to be primary hypertension, particularly if positive family history and/or presence of comorbid conditions. D. Physical findings. 1. Primary hypertension: May be few abnormal physical findings, but pa - tient history is important adjunct to determine whether hypertension is primary or secondary. a. Family history of hypertension in first- or second-degree relative; myocardial infarction, stroke, renal vascular diseases, diabetes, obesity. b. Obesity in patient. 2. Secondary hypertension: May be physical findings or important clues in patient's history as to possible cause of secondary hypertension. a. Neonatal history of invasive umbilical lines. b.

INNOCENT HEART MURMURS Cardiac murmur, unspecified, R01.1 Clubbing of fingers, classified, Heart Murmurs 383A. Etiology. 1. Innocent murmur is abnormal heart sound caused by turbulent blood flow not associated with structural heart disease, also called functional or nonorganic murmur. B. Occurrence. 1. Cardiac murmurs are noted in 50-70% of children who are asymptomatic. 2. Vast majority of murmurs heard in infants and children are innocent in nature. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Innocent murmur is typically found on routine physical exam. 2. Presence of other clinical manifestations: Concern for congenital, acquired heart disease. 3. Any murmur, innocent or organic, is typically louder with fever, anemia, other high cardiac output states. D. Physical findings. 1. Absence of physical findings other than murmur should be expected if innocent murmur is suspected. Innocent murmurs often more prominent during high cardiac output states such as fever, anemia, pregnancy. 2. Physical exam findings of congenital or acquired heart disease that follow should specifically be evaluated. a. Known or suspected syndrome or genetic or chromosomal abnormality. b. Failure to grow. c. Easily fatigued. d. Tachypnea, increased work of breathing, retractions, flaring, grunting. e. Diaphoresis, particularly with exertion, feeding in the infant. f. Cyanosis, central or peripheral. g. Clubbing of digits. h. Tachycardia. i. Edema, particularly periorbital and facial in infant. j. Active precordium.Hypotension, unspecified, I95.9 Localized swelling, mass and lump, unspecified, R22.9 Other fatigue, R53.83 Other nonrheumatic pulmonary valve disorders, I37.8 Other specified chromosome abnormalities, Q99.8Other specified symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems, R09.89 Shock, unspecified, R57.9 Splenomegaly, not elsewhere classified, R16.1 Tachycardia, unspecified, R00.0384 CHAPTER 26 Cardiovascular Disordersk. Palpable thrill. l. Weak pulses, delayed capillary refill, hypotension, or other signs of shock. m. Differential between upper and lower extremity pulses or blood pressures. n. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. o. Murmur of grade IV (see Box 26-1 ) or higher in intensity. p. Diastolic murmur. 3. Careful consideration of murmur description. a. Location. Where murmur is heard best, described by location over cardiac structures or location on chest. Most common areas to auscultate innocent murmurs are left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. b. Radiation. Descriptor of where else murmur can be heard. Innocent murmurs rarely radiate to distant parts of chest. c. Timing: Where in the cardiac cycle the murmur is heard. Systole: Between S1 and Starts in systole, continues into diastole, does not need to continue throughout cardiac cycle but has same sound for duration of murmur. Innocent murmurs are typically systolic; venous hum is continuous murmur. Solely diastolic murmur is never innocent and should be referred. Children with innocent murmurs typically have normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) that are audible in addition to murmur. Rapid heart rates of infants, particularly febrile infants, may make it difficult to distinguish between systole and diastole. Box 26 -1 Grading of Cardiac Murmurs Grade I/VI: Soft, difficult to hear unless room quiet and child cooperative. Grade II/VI: Soft but heard immediately. Grade III/VI: Easily heard, moderately loud, no thrill associated. Grade IV/VI: Loud, can palpate the thrill of turbulent flow on chest wall. Grade V/VI: Loud, has thrill, able to hear murmur with stethoscope barely off chest wall. Grade VI/VI: Loud, has thrill, able to hear murmur with stethoscope off chest wall. III. Innocent Heart Murmurs 385d. Pitch: Sound frequency of murmur. Innocent murmurs typically low to medium in pitch. e. Quality: Musical or vibratory in quality. f. Intensity: Loudness of the murmur (Box 26-1). Innocent murmurs, typically Grade I-II, VI. Often change in in - tensity with change in position: Sitting to lying, standing to sitting. May change in intensity from one visit to the next. No clicks or extra sounds if murmur is innocent. 4. Types of innocent murmurs. a. Still's murmur. Most common innocent murmur in children; occurs typically in 2- to 6-year-old children. Low to medium in pitch, buzzing or vibratory in nature. Short murmur occurring in early systole. Grade I-III, VI. Loudest in supine position, diminished by standing. Heard best at left lower sternal border. b. Pulmonary flow murmur. Heard in children/adolescents. Harsh murmur, blowing, nonmusical. Systolic ejection murmur. Grade II-III, VI. Loudest in supine position, loudest on exhalation. Heard best in second to third intercostal space at left sternal border. c. Peripheral pulmonary arterial stenosis murmur. Heard frequently in newborns and infants. Medium in pitch. Short systolic ejection murmur. Grade I-II, VI. Often heard best in axillae and over back. Turbulence is due to relative smallness of peripheral pulmonary arteries in newborn and angulation of takeoff of right- and left-branch pulmonary arteries from main pulmonary artery. d. Supraclavicular or brachiocephalic systolic murmur or bruit. Heard in children, young adults. Low to medium in pitch, harsh. Is short, systolic murmur. Grade I-III, VI. Heard best above clavicles, radiates to neck. Heard best in supine, sitting positions; changes with change in neck position.386 CHAPTER 26 Cardiovascular Disorderse. Venous hum. Also known as cervical venous hum. Continuous murmur. Heard over neck, immediately below clavicles. Intensity varies, loudness varies with position, activity; best heard in sitting position. May disappear when head is turned toward side of murmur. Murmur results from turbulence of flow as large veins converge. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. When murmur is detected, refer to pediatrician or cardiologist to deter - mine significance. 2. Many innocent murmurs do not require further diagnostic tests after thorough history, physical, auscultatory exam. 3. CXR, electrocardiogram, cardiac echocardiography may determine whether murmur is truly innocent. 4. Murmurs associated with structural abnormalities (organic murmurs) may require additional diagnostic evaluation. F. Differential diagnosis. Cardiomyopathy, unspecified, I42.9 Congenital malformation of heart, unspecified, Q24.9Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki), M30.3 Rheumatic heart disease, unspecified, I09.9 1. Congenital heart disease. 2. Cyanotic or acyanotic disease. 3. Acquired heart disease. 4. Cardiomyopathy. 5. Kawasaki disease. 6. Rheumatic heart disease. G. Treatment. 1. Innocent heart murmurs have no organic cause, no structural abnormal - ity; therefore, no treatment required. 2. Education of patient, family is most important treatment modality. H. Follow-up. 1. If innocent murmur confirmed, patients may return to usual health maintenance schedule for follow-up visits. 2. If innocent murmur suspected but not yet confirmed as innocent, should return for reevaluation to physician. I. Complications. 1. None, as no abnormality is present. III. Innocent Heart Murmurs 387J. Education. 1. Crucial for patient, family. 2. Explain murmur as noise. 3. Noise is result of blood flow, no structural problem. 4. No heart disease or abnormality is present. 5. Murmur may change or disappear with time but if persists, still no prob - lem with heart. 6. No activity restrictions required. 7. No treatment required. IV. SYNCOPE A. Definition. 1.

ABDOMINAL PAIN, ACUTE Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Abdominal hernia with obstruction, without N94.0Other unspecified, N23Torsion of testis, unspecified, N44.00Urinary tract infection, site not specified, N39.0 Viral pneumonia, not otherwise classified, J12 A. Etiology. 1. Pain located in abdomen lasting up to several days. Symptom can originate from within or outside gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 2. Pain from visceral (stomach, intestine), parietal (peritoneum), or referred areas. 3. Frequently caused by viral gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), constipation. 4. Other possible causes vary by age: a. Infant: Colic, gastroenteritis, viral illness, dietary protein intussusception, disease (PID), dysmenorrhea, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst. B. Occurrence. 1. Gastroenteritis is the most common medical cause, appendicitis is the most common surgical cause. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Must take child's age, developmental level into consideration regarding location, duration of pain. Y ounger children often indicate periumbilical region. 2. Associated symptoms: Fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, anorexia depend - ing on etiology. 3. Important subjective data should include: a. Location, duration, frequency of pain. b. Stool frequency, consistency; history of hematochezia or melena. c. Vomiting: Frequency, presence of bile or hematemesis. d. Symptoms outside GI tract (cough, congestion, dysuria, sore throat, fever, headache). e. Medication and diet history. f. Sexual activity, vaginal discharge. g. Alleviating and aggravating factors. D. Physical findings. 1. Weight, temperature, vital signs. 2. General appearance: Assess degree of discomfort and hydration. 3. Complete physical exam with attention to following: a. Abdominal exam: Ask child to indicate location of pain. Observe for peristaltic waves, distention, guarding. Palpate for masses, stool, hepatosplenomegaly, tenderness. Percuss for rebound tenderness. Have child stand, jump to assess for signs of peritoneal irritation. b. Rectal exam: Assess for fissures, erythema. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. May include complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), amylase, lipase, and urinalysis. Consider pregnancy test in postmenarchal girls. 2. Test stool for occult blood if history dictates. 3. Chest X-ray (CXR) if pneumonia suspected. 4. Abdominal X-ray if intestinal obstruction or perforation suspected. Useful to rule out fecal impaction. 5. Abdominal ultrasound if appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy periumbilical pain, migrating localized to right lower/middle quadrant. b. Often associated with fever, vomiting, anorexia; may see elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. c. Involuntary muscle guarding, rebound, signs of peritoneal irritation on abdominal exam. Rovsing sign: Pain in right lower quadrant with palpation of the left side. d. Typical signs and symptoms are often not present in children. 2. Constipation, gastroenteritis, intussusception, incarcerated hernia, colic, peptic ulcer. 3. Pancreatitis. a. Inflammation of pancreas from infection, medications, trauma, genetic defect, or structural abnormality. b. Epigastric pain, often with nausea, vomiting. c. Elevated amylase, lipase. 4. Cholelithiasis. a. Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, often radiates to back. b. Ultrasound shows stones in gallbladder or bile duct and/or gallblad - der wall thickening. G. Treatment. 1. Appendicitis, cholelithiasis: Surgical consult. 2. Pancreatitis: Possible hospital admission for intravenous (IV) hydration, pain control. Consult GI. 3. Intussusception: Admission for diagnosis and barium enema; incarcerated hernia: Admission for surgical consultation. H. Follow-up. 1. Telephone contact for any changes/increase in symptoms. 2. Ensure follow-through with any consults that have been requested. I. Complications. 1. School absence. J. Education. 1. Reassure if physical exam consistent with nonsurgical abdomen. Parents most often concerned about appendicitis. 2. Review hydration/nutrition needs. I. Abdominal Pain, Acute 4033. Treat fever as needed. 4. Monitor for any changes in symptoms or worrisome signs such as hema - tochezia, hematemesis, increased or newly localized pain. 5. Education otherwise depends on final diagnosis. II. ABDOMINAL PAIN, CHRONIC: FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN-NOS, CHILD/ADOLESCENT A. Diagnostic criteria. 1. Must be fulfilled at least four times per month, for at least 2 months prior to diagnosis, and include all of the following: a. Episodic or continuous abdominal pain that does not occur solely during physiologic events (e.g. eating, menses). b. Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine. c. After appropriate evaluation, abdominal pain cannot be fully explained by another medical condition. B. Functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS) may coexist with other medical conditions. 1. Vast majority of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain, especially in primary care, have functional disorder. 2. Children with FAP-NOS often report nonspecific and extraintestinal somatic symptoms. C. Etiology. 1. A functional disorder is classically defined as the absence of specific structural, infectious, inflammatory, or biochemical abnormalities as cause of pain. Using the \"biopsychosocial model, \" it is thought to be due to an interaction of psychological factors and altered gut physiology via the brain-gut axis. 2. Genetics and environment may play role in early life. Psychological factors such as coping skills, social support, and stress, along with physiology, including postinfectious states, can influence enteric nervous system (ENS) and central nervous systems (CNS), which can lead to functional GI disorders in susceptible individuals. In general, these children are not at increased risk for food allergies or celiac disease.Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10404 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersD. Occurrence. 1. Equal incidence among males and females until age 10 years; then female-to-male ratio is 1.5:1.0. Most common between 8 and 15 years of age. E. Clinical manifestations. 1. Periumbilical or generalized abdominal pain. 2. Occurs daily or intermittently (at least once per week) over at least 8-week period. 3. May be associated with nausea, fatigue, headache, pallor. 4. Patient may assume fetal position, grimace/cry during episode. 5. Pain does not wake child from sleep. 6. Patient may have school absence, withdraw from social/extracurricular activities. 7. No weight loss or growth delay. 8. Not associated with fever, vomiting, melena, or hematochezia. 9. Important subjective data to obtain: a. Description of normal elimination pattern; alleviating or aggravating factors. b. Dietary history, medications. c. Psychosocial stressors, parent/caregiver usual reaction to the pain. d. Sleep habits. F. Physical findings. 1. Weight/height: Plot on growth curve and compare with previous. 2. Perform thorough physical exam at first visit with attention to following: a. Abdominal exam: Ask patient to indicate location of pain. Assess for tenderness, masses, hepatosplenomegaly. b. Rectal exam: Inspect for erythema, fissures, skin tags. Perform digital exam if constipation suspected. 3. Tanner staging. G. Diagnostic tests. 1. No diagnostic test to make diagnosis of FAP . It is not diagnosis of exclusion. 2. Consider screening laboratories: a. Urinalysis, urine culture. b. CBC, Screen celiac disease with tissue and total serum IgA. c. Stool for occult blood; if indicated stool for ova and parasite, giardia antigen. d. Routine testing for Helicobacter pylori is not recommended. II. Abdominal Pain, Chronic: Functional Abdominal PAIN-NOS 405H. Differential diagnosis. Abdominal tenderness, unspecified site, R10.819 Abnormal weight loss, R63.4 Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified, J06.9 Constipation, K59.0 Crohn's disease, unspecified, without complications, K50.90 Diarrhea, unspecified, R19.7 Intestinal parasitism, unspecified, K92.1 Noninfective enteritis and colitis, K50-K52 Other disorders carbohydrate absorption, E74.39 Residual hemorrhoidal skin tags, K64.4 Ulcerative colitis, unspecified, without complications, K51.90 1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 2. Infection: UTI, intestinal parasite. 3. Lactose intolerance: Positive lactose breath test or okay after no lactose in diet after 2-week trial. 4. Constipation. 5. IBD with melena, hema - tochezia, and/or diarrhea. Possible weight loss, growth delay. Physical exam may reveal abdominal tenderness, multiple anal fissures/skin tags, possible joint symptoms. Refer to pediatric gastroenterologist. I. Treatment. 1. Most valuable treatment is establishment of therapeutic relationship with patient and family. Discuss possibility of FAP-NOS at first visit. 2. Can do trial of lactose-reduced diet, but is rarely helpful. Eliminate caffeine. There are no data to support elimination of gluten or other components of FODMAP diet (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosac - charides, and polyols). Increase fiber in the diet: May regulate intestinal motility. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends: Child's age + 5 = grams of fiber/day minimum. Currently, no data supports use of probiotics. 4. Counseling: Self-hypnosis, diaphragmatic breathing. 5. Symptom diary. 6. Sleep hygiene: Poor-quality sleep may contribute to FAP-NOS. 7. Exercise.406 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersJ. Follow-up. 1. Arrange for clinic visit about 1 month after diagnosis of FAP-NOS. 2. Telephone contact for any changes in symptoms. K. Complications. 1. School absence or avoidance, decreased participation in extracurricular activities. 2. Interference with peer relationships. L. Education. 1. If physical exam normal, reassure family that it is unlikely any specific cause will be found. Discuss the biopsychosocial model. 2. Acknowledge pain is real, not fabricated. 3. Insist on return to normal daily activities, school participation. 4. Educate family about reaction to the pain: May be altered reaction to pain or secondary gain if too much attention is given to symptom. 5. Discuss prognosis: Pain may persist for months or years. III. COLIC Renal colic, unspecified, N23 A. Diagnostic criteria. 1. For clinical purposes, must include all of the following: a. An infant who is younger than age 5 months old when symptoms start and stop. b. Recurrent and prolonged periods of infant crying, fussing, or irritability reported by caregivers that occur without obvious cause and cannot be prevented or resolved by caregivers. c. No evidence of infant failure to thrive, fever, illness. B. Etiology. 1. Unknown, probably multifactorial. Evidence suggests that colic originates in CNS rather than gut. 2. There is no proof that it is caused by pain in the abdomen or other body part. 3. Recent research has identified a difference in the intestinal microbiota in infant colic compared with controls. C. Occurrence. 1. Most studies estimate incidence rates of up to 25% of infants. Equal incidence among males and females, all socioeconomic levels, breastfed versus bottle fed. III. Colic 407D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Inconsolable bouts of crying, which occur without obvious cause, often clustering in afternoon or evening. 2. Associated symptoms may include pain facies/grimacing, clenched fists, taut/distended abdomen, drawing legs up to abdomen, flatus. 3. Crying often described as more intense than normal crying. 4. Ask parents to describe quality, frequency, duration, timing of crying. 5. Ask about any other symptoms such as vomiting, regurgitation. 6. Detailed diet history, including mother if breastfeeding. 7. Frequency, consistency of stool, hematochezia. 8. Alleviating or aggravating factors. 9. Medications given to baby or that breastfeeding mother is taking. 10. Ask about coping skills of caregivers and opportunity for respite. 11. Red flags suggesting organic pathology include extreme or high-pitched cry, lack of diurnal rhythm, symptoms after age 4 months, weight loss, history of maternal drug ingestion. E. Physical findings. 1. Weight/length/head circumference, temperature, vital signs. 2. Complete physical exam. 3. Check baby for evidence of incarcerated hernia, testicular torsion, hair tourniquet. 4. Observe caregiver and infant: Assess caregiver's anxiety, coping skills. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. No test to diagnose colic: Made by history and physical exam. G. Differential diagnosis. Abdominal hernia with obstruction, without gangrene, unspecified, K46.0 Constipation, R63.3Gastroesophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, Malabsorption due to intolerance, not elsewhere classified, K90.4 of testis, unspecified, N44.00 1. Inappropriate feeding: Assess infant's intake by history. 2. Milk protein intolerance or allergy: Usually associated with vomiting/ diarrhea. May have history of hematochezia. 3. Constipation: Hard or dry stools regardless of frequency. 4. Incarcerated hernia.408 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disorders5. Parental stress tension, poor coping. 6. Testicular torsion: Testis tender, cord thickened/shortened. 7. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER). H. Treatment. 1. Consider 2-week trial of hypoallergenic formula or removing cow's milk protein from breastfeeding mother's diet. Avoid sorbitol-containing fruit juices. 2. Encourage continued breastfeeding; trial of caffeine elimination from mother's diet. 3. Swaddling of infant, rhythmic movement, gentle massage, warm baths. 4. \"White noise\" such as soft music. 5. Avoid overstimulation. Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke. 6. Counsel parents: Alleviate guilt about cause of colic, need for respite. Reassure them that infant is not in pain. Acknowledge importance of problem, discuss prognosis. 7. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics. No evidence to support use of medications used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. I. Follow-up. 1. Frequent clinic and/or telephone follow-up may be necessary to assess any formula changes, parental coping skills. 2. Plan to see baby 2 weeks after initial diagnosis. J. Complications. 1. Poor parental coping skills. 2. Disruption of maternal-infant relationship. 3. Child abuse. K. Education. 1. Discuss normal crying patterns. Infants cry more in first 3 months of life than at any other time. Crying peaks at about 4-6 weeks then steadily decreases by 12 weeks. Pattern of crying different in all babies. 2. Explain that taut/distended abdomen and flatus are probably result of, not cause of, crying. Reassure them that infant is not in pain. 3. Alleviate parental guilt and discuss range of emotions may be experiencing. 4. Stress need for respite: Suggest parents leave baby with reliable caregiver for a few hours. Infant may sense tension in parents if do not allow them - selves a break. 5. Trial of hypoallergenic formula may be indicated, but multiple formula changes are not warranted and should be discouraged. There is minimal, if any, evidence that lactose intolerance plays a role. III. Colic 409IV. CONSTIPATION Child sexual abuse, intolerance, not classified, K90.4 Nutritional deficiency, unspecified, E63.9 Obesity, E66 rectum, K62.4 A. Definition. 1. Constipation is delayed or difficult defecation, passage of hard and/or dry stools. B. Etiology. 1. Functional: Most common (> 95%), no underlying organic pathology. Diagnosis based on Rome IV Criteria: Functional gastrointestinal disor - ders (FGIDs) diagnosed and classified by Rome IV Criteria, released May 2016. FGIDs are most common GI disorders in general population. The term \"functional\" refers to real symptoms that are not due to structural, inflammatory, or biochemical disorders. A disorder of brain-gut interac - tion, FGIDs may be due to sensitivity of the ENS or way brain controls gut function. GI symptoms may be related to any combination of visceral hypersensitivity, altered motility, CNS processing, altered mucosal and immune function, and/or gut microbiota. a. Diet low in fiber/fluids; sudden change in diet (e.g., formula/breast milk to cow's milk). b. Lack of exercise, obesity. c. Stool withholding secondary to painful defecation (\"pain-retention cycle\"). d. Family history. 2. Outlet dysfunction: Hirschsprung's disease, anterior ectopic anus, tethered spinal malnutrition, sexual abuse, cow's milk protein intolerance (infants), medications (e.g., narcotics). C. Occurrence. 1. Accounts for about 3-5% of visits to general pediatrics, 25% to pediatric gastroenterology. 2. Peak incidence at time of toilet training; no gender differences.410 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersD. Clinical manifestations. 1. Hard bowel movements (BMs), usually infrequent. May be dry, small (incomplete evacuation). a. Size, consistency, frequency of BMs: Ask when change in stool be - came apparent. Use the Bristol stool chart to help patient or caregiver identify stool consistency. b. Stool-withholding symptoms (hides for BM, crosses legs, dances around). c. Blood associated with stool. d. Fecal soiling in underwear of previously toilet-trained child. e. Did child pass meconium within first 48 hours of life? 2. Associated symptoms: Abdominal pain/distention, poor appetite, nausea, irritability. Common cause of urinary incontinence and UTI. 3. Other important questions: Diet history, any changes? Child on any medications? Child toilet trained? Any possibility of sexual abuse? What treatments have been instituted thus far? 4. Red-flag symptoms suggesting organic pathology include fever, vomit - ing, severe abdominal distention, history of delayed meconium passage. E. Physical findings. 1. Height/weight: Plot on growth curve. 2. Complete physical exam with attention to: a. Abdomen: Assess for fecal masses, particularly in lower quadrants. Assess for distention, tenderness. b. Anus: Assess for placement, fissures, erythema. Consider digital exam to assess anal tone, quality of stool present. Observe for soiling at anal opening. c. Lower back: Assess for tuft of hair over lumbar sacral area or deep sacral dimple above gluteal crease. Assess for deviated gluteal crease. d. Assess muscle tone throughout, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Testing not usually necessary. 2. Abdominal flat-plate X-ray to assess fecal load only if diagnosis is in question or to tailor disimpaction. Avoid X-rays when possible. 3. X-ray of lumbar/sacral (L/S) spine: Assess for occult spinal dysraphism if abnormality on L/S spine area and/or history of lower extremity weakness. If abnormal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 4. Labs only if red flags in history/physical exam: Serum electrolytes, calcium, lead level, thyroid function (TSH, T4). Celiac screen (total serum IgA and tissue transglutaminase IgA) and sweat test if poor growth. 5. Unprepped barium enema: If history of delayed passage of meconium, to assess for transition zone associated with Hirschsprung's disease. This can IV. Constipation 411miss short-segment Hirschsprung's in older infants and children. Rectal biopsy is gold standard for diagnosis. G. Differential diagnosis. Child sexual abuse, suspected, initial encounter, T76.22XA Constipation, K59.0 Ectopic anus, Q43.5 1. Vast majority have functional constipation, diagnosis by history and physical exam. 2. Infant dyschezia (functional): At least 10 minutes of crying and straining before passage of soft stools in healthy infant younger than 6 months of age. Reassure, self-limited. 3. Encopresis: Constipation with fecal soiling. 4. Hirschsprung's disease: Absence of ganglion nerve cells in colon to varying degrees. Usually have history of delayed passage of meconium ( > 48 hours after birth). May have thin caliber stools, abdominal distention, failure to thrive. No stool in rectal vault on digital exam. 5. Structural: Anterior ectopic anus, anal stenosis. 6. Sexual abuse. 7. Side effect of drugs such as narcotics. 8. Cow's milk protein intolerance: Anal irritation/fissures, subsequent stool retention, mainly seen in infants. H. Treatment. 1. Stool softeners: Most children will benefit from stool softener as first-line treatment. May be needed for longer than 2 weeks. a. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (Miralax, Glycolax): Starting dose of 0.2-0.84 g/kg/day for children 10-30 kg. Children > 30 kg use 17 g/day. Adjust dose according to clinical response. Stir powder well to dissolve; excellent palatability and acceptance. Titrate dose to achieve soft stools. b. Milk of magnesia: 1-3 mL/kg/day (400 mg/5 mL). Avoid in bid, maximum 30 mL bid. Must be ingested quickly. May mix in beverage. Good choice for infants who do not respond to dietary management. May cause gassiness.412 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disordersd. Mineral oil: Never give to infants younger than age 1 year or patients at risk for aspiration (e.g., neurologically impaired). Difficult to regulate dose, start with 1-3 mL/kg/day, totaling no more than 90 mL/day. Rarely used. 2. Laxatives/cathartics: Mainly used for disimpaction, usually over period of 1-3 days. a. Magnesium citrate: Older than age 2 over 1-3 days. a. Glycerin suppository: For children younger than age 2 years. b. Bisacodyl suppository: Older than age 2 years: 0.5-1 suppository/day. c. enema: Older than age 2 years: 1-2 times/day 1-3 days. 4. A normal fiber diet is recommended in children with constipation: AAP recommends age + 5 g fiber/day. Infants: Prune or pear juice good choice for stool softening. Evidence does not support the use of fiber supplements and extra fluid intake in functional constipation. 5. Toilet training, not yet trained: Delay until constipation resolved. Trained: Encourage scheduled time on toilet 2-3 times/day, following meals, for 5-10 minutes. Provide footstool. 6. Positive reinforcement for toilet sitting and cooperation. I. Follow-up. 1. Close telephone contact after disimpaction, to monitor response to stool softeners. 2. Refer to pediatric gastroenterology if patient unresponsive to treatment, red flags in history, or abnormal test results. 3. Refer to pediatric surgery if Hirschsprung's disease/anal abnormalities concerns. 4. Talk with school as needed to provide easy access to the bathroom and/or supervision with toilet routine. J. Complications. Anal fissure, unspecified, K60.2 Nonorganic encopresis, F98.1 1. Encopresis. 2. stool-softening agents, diet, topical cream [e.g., Anusol]). 3. Delayed toilet training. IV. Constipation 413K. Education. 1. Reassure family if history and physical consistent with functional consti - pation. Explain pain-retention cycle. 2. Reassure that stool softeners are not habit forming and are necessary part of breaking pain-retention cycle. Stool softeners are often given daily for a minimum of several weeks. In general, stool softeners are continued for at least 2 months and all symptoms should be resolved for 1 month prior to weaning. 3. Parents may report child unable to have BM despite effort; explain that what appears to be straining may be child's attempt to withhold stool to avoid pain. 4. School-age children frequently avoid using bathroom at school for BM. 5. Explain normal defecation patterns: Not necessary to have BM every day; goal is passage of soft, comfortable stools in good quantities. 6. Instruct family to call if soiling occurs or if child not responding to treatment. V. DIARRHEA, ACUTE Diarrhea, unspecified, R19.7 A. Definition. 1. Acute diarrhea is noticeable or sudden increase in frequency and fluid content of stools; usually infectious, self-limited lasting less than 3 weeks. Diarrhea is a symptom, can result from disorders involving digestive, absorptive, secretory, motility, inflammatory functions of Outside GI tract: May be concurrent symptom of systemic illness. 3. Dietary, medications, toxic ingestion. 4. Other: Intussusception, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), appendicitis, UTI. C. Occurrence. 1. Common symptom in children. 2. Most commonly caused by infection, particularly viral, in older infants/children. 3. Dietary changes or indiscretions common in early infancy.414 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersD.

E. coli 0157:H7 is the toxin-producing strain and the cause of most cases of HUS; bloody diarrhea. d. C. difficile : Found frequently in stool of healthy infants, role as etiologic agent in these cases controversial. Avoid testing in infants younger than age 1 year unless clinically indicated. In pathologic cases, diar - rhea can occur within days or up to 8 weeks after antibiotic use or any drugs that alter GI flora. Watery diarrhea with or without blood. Fecal-oral route. Common in hospitals. 3. Parasitic. a. Giardia: Waterborne, foodborne. Diarrhea, bloating, abdominal cramping, nausea. lactase deficiency. Often self-limited. Outbreaks can occur in daycare and long-term care facilities. b. Cryptosporidium: Mild diarrhea, usually self-limited. 4. Dietary. a. Increase in fluids with high osmotic load: Fruit juices, sports drinks, or any sugared beverages can cause temporary osmotic diarrhea in otherwise healthy infant/child. b. Introduction of new food: Possible allergic response, lactase A04.7 Escherichia coli as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, B96.2Rotaviral enteritis, A08.0 Salmonella infection, unspecified, A02.9 Shigellosis, unspecified, gastroenteritis and colitis, K52.1 V.

C. difficile : Metronidazole (20-30 mg/kg/day divided tid for a. Giardia: Metronidazole (5-10 mg/kg/dose tid for 7-10 days) for children age 1-11 years; age 12-47 months: 5 mL (100 mg) bid for 3 days; age 4-11 years: 10 mL bid for 3 days; age 12 years: 500 mg (1 tab) bid for 3 days, oral. b. Cryptosporidium: Supportive in immunocompetent patients; if therapy required: Nitazoxanide. 4. Rehydration. a. Mild dehydration: Oral replacement solution (ORS) 50 mL/kg (5 teaspoons/pound) over 4 hours. Once repletion completed, ORS continued for ongoing diarrhea losses. b. Moderate dehydration: ORS 100 mL/kg + replacement of stool losses over 4 hours, reassess hourly. c. Severe dehydration: IV fluid: Normal saline (0.9% saline); consult MD; transfer to tertiary care facility. d. No dehydration: Continue to feed age-appropriate diet, including milk. 5. Dietary. a. Remove possible offending/allergenic foods. b. No fruit juice, sports drinks, other sugared beverages. c. Feed full diet: Restricting food deprives gut of nutrients needed for healing.418 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disordersd. Continue to breast/formula feed, can alternate with ORS. e. Eliminate dairy only if known giardia infection or if symptoms severe. f. With dehydrated patient: Refeed age-appropriate diet as soon as rehydrated. 6. Antidiarrheal not advised for children. I. Follow-up. 1. Telephone: Instruct parent to call and arrange for immediate clinic visit if not improving, new symptoms develop, signs of dehydration. 2. Return to clinic next day with mild-moderate dehydration. 3. Referral to MD or local emergency department (ED) for moderate-severe dehydration or lack of response to treatment. 4. Repeat stool studies after treatment for C. difficile , giardia only if symptoms persist. Stool will remain positive for C. difficle toxin PCR for weeks or longer after treatment, this is not indicative of ongoing infection. 5. Refer child with dehydration, severe symptoms, HUS to MD, emergency services. J. Complications.

Review dehydration signs/symptoms: Instruct parent when to call. 4. Review dietary instructions: Explain that restricting diet may prolong diarrhea. Appropriate beverage selection essential. 5. Skin care: Prevent diaper rash with effective barrier ointment. V. Diarrhea, Acute 419VI. ENCOPRESIS Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Abdominal distension (gaseous), sexual abuse, suspected, T76.22XA encopresis, F98.1 A. Definition. 1. Encopresis is fecal incontinence in clothing usually after toilet training completed. Vast majority caused by chronic, functional constipation (retentive encopresis). Diagnostic based on Rome IV Criteria. B. Etiology. 1. Chronic, functional constipation. Stool accumulates in rectum, which subsequently leaks out through anus. Soiling is not volitional/intentional. 2. Underlying pathology is rare: Tethered spinal cord (secondary to occult spinal dysraphism), prior anal-rectal surgery, Hirschsprung's disease, ectopic anus. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Stool incontinence, usually during day, of varying quantities. 2. Soiling often has soft consistency, and parents misinterpret this as diar - rhea, child \"can't make it to the bathroom in time. \" 3. Parents commonly believe this is volitional or result of laziness. 4. Important questions to ask: a. Age of toilet training? Was process difficult? b. Frequency, consistency, size/amount of BM on toilet. Any blood? What time of day does it usually occur? c. Does child hide soiled clothing? d. How has family dealt with problem? 5. Associated symptoms may include abdominal pain, abdominal distention, poor appetite, school avoidance. 6. Ask about history of UTI and enuresis. 7. Any possibility of sexual abuse? D. Occurrence. 1. Common pediatric problem: Boys with constipation have higher rates of fecal incontinence than girls. E. Physical findings. 1. Abdomen may appear distended or full. Dull on percussion. Stool may be palpable in lower quadrants (smooth, movable mass). 2. Anus may appear erythematous with stool around exterior. Observe for fissures. Digital exam may reveal decreased tone, copious stool in vault of varying consistency. Check for position of anus, anal wink.420 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disorders3. Assess back for of occult spinal dysraphism: or hair tuft above gluteal deviated gluteal crease. 4. Assess muscle tone throughout, DTRs. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Rarely necessary. 2. Abdominal flat-plate X-ray can be useful to assess fecal load, tailor di - simpaction. However, good physical exam and history often eliminates need for X-ray. 3. MRI of lumbosacral spine if concern for tethered spinal cord. G. Differential cases are from functional constipation. 2. Tethered spinal cord: Can result in both fecal and urinary incontinence. H. Treatment. 1. All children with encopresis must first start with disimpaction (\"clean out\"). Soiling will not resolve without this. Clean out regimens vary but most use the oral route, which is accepted by more children. Common regimens include PEG 3350 (Miralax) 1-1.5 g/kg/day for maximum of 6 days. 2. After clean out, child immediately starts daily stool softening. 3. Keep track of BMs, soiling episodes on calendar. 4. Normal fiber diet. AAP recommends child's age + 5 g/day 5. Toilet retraining: Child to sit on toilet after meals 2-3 times/day, work up to 5-10 minutes. Provide footstool. Ask child to \"try\" to have BM, to \"practice, \" not expected to produce BM each time. 6. Positive reinforcement only. No punishment for soiling. Soiling should be cleaned up swiftly with child's assistance and little attention paid to it. 7. Education of the underlying pathophysiology is essential for treatment. I. Follow-up. 1. Encourage telephone contact. If continues to soil, may need further clean out. 2. Follow up in clinic about 1 month after diagnosis. 3. May need abdominal X-ray if results of clean out are in doubt. 4. Referral if patient not responding to treatment once compliance has been assured. J. Complications. Nonorganic enuresis, F98.0 Urinary tract infection, site not specified, N39.0 VI. Encopresis 4211. Low self-esteem/shame. 2. Child abuse. 3. School avoidance. 4. UTI (due to proximity of stool in clothing to urinary tract). 5. Enuresis. K. Education. 1. Stress to parents that child has not had control over soiling episodes. 2. Relieve parental guilt over prior negative reinforcement. 3. Explain to parent and child why soiling occurs, discuss normal defecation. 4. Treatment will take at least 6 months. Parents are advised to be diligent about daily stool softening, toilet training during this time. 5. Reassure about functional nature of chronic constipation. 6. Advise parent to speak with school about problem so child will have better access to restroom at school, may need to provide written request. VII. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE Gastroesophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, K21.9 A. Definition. 1. Passive passage of stomach contents into esophagus. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a normal physiologic process that occurs in healthy in - dividuals. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to pathologic degree of GER, causing symptoms. B. Etiology. 1. Infants (up to age 18 months). a. Very common in infants, may be result of immaturity of lower esopha - geal sphincter (LES). b. Position of LES and feeding techniques may induce GER. c. GERD probably multifactorial. 2. Children/adolescents. a. Probably multifactorial, exact cause not known. b. May be malfunctioning LES: Inappropriate relaxation. c. Environmental/dietary influences may induce GER. C. Occurrence. 1. About 50% of infants have recurrent vomiting in first 3 months, 67% of 4-month-olds, 5% of 10- to 12-month-olds. 2. Increased incidence among premature babies, neurologically impaired children.422 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersD. Clinical manifestations. 1. Infants: Recurrent vomiting, regurgitation (\"spit up\"); usually effortless. 2. Important questions to ask for affected infants: a. Type, quantity, frequency of feedings? How positioned during, after feeding? b. Quality, quantity, timing of emesis? Does baby cry/grimace with emesis? c. History of apnea? 3. Children: Regurgitation (reswallowed/spit up), possible vomiting, nausea, epigastric abdominal pain. Pain may be poorly localized. Can have any/all of these symptoms. 4. Important questions to ask for affected children: a. Frequency, timing of symptoms, including regurgitation with/without emesis. b. Abdominal pain: Location, timing, frequency, quality. c. Any specific foods that provoke symptoms? d. Complete diet history, including type and amount of beverages. e. Any dysphagia, food lodging, chronic throat clearing, dental decay? 5. For all age groups: a. History of hematemesis, melena, asthma, recurrent pneumonia? b. Any decrease in appetite, poor weight gain, weight loss? E. Physical findings. 1. Height, weight: Plot on growth curve. 2. Full physical exam with attention to following: a. Abdomen: Assess for tenderness, particularly over epigastrium. b. Rectal exam: Obtain stool to test for occult blood. c. Mouth: Assess for dental caries, enamel erosion. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Upper GI series: Only to rule out anatomic abnormalities. Not used to make diagnosis of GERD. Presence of GER on upper GI is common in all people. Must order in infants if forceful vomiting; in older children with frank vomiting, dysphagia. 2. Stool for occult blood: If positive, may indicate esophagitis. 3. Other tests by pediatric GI specialist if referral necessary (endoscopy, pH probe). G. Differential diagnosis. Adult hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, K31.1 Gastritis, event. Infants with regurgitation who are oth - erwise well, growing normally, without pain. 2. GERD: Infants who, in addition to emesis, have irritability during feeds, poor feeding/growth, recurrent lung problems. May be related to apnea. May have one or all of these symptoms. Recurrent GER symptoms in children older than 18 months is almost always considered pathologic (GERD). 3. Overfeeding; cow's milk protein allergy. 4. Pyloric stenosis. 5. Gastritis. H. Treatment. 1. Conservative management, infants: For GER, as adjunct to medical therapy in GERD: a. Smaller, more frequent feedings. Increase burping opportunities. b. Hold upright after feeds; do not place infant in car seat after feedings. c. Consider change to commercially available prethickened formula (Enfamil AR). Consider 2-week trial of extensively hydrolyzed infant formula (hypoallergenic). d. Can add 1 teaspoon/ounce of cereal to bottle. Cross-cut nipple for easier flow. e. Elevate head of crib mattress. No extra bedding in crib. No prone positioning. 2. Conservative management, children: Essential component along with medications. a. Smaller, more frequent meals. No skipping meals. b. Avoid caffeine, carbonated drinks; fatty, fried foods; citrus; chocolate; peppermint. c. Avoid or correct obesity. d. Avoid tobacco and alcohol. e. Elevate head of bed; no eating within 2 hours of bedtime. 3. Medical management, if conservative management alone is not helpful after 2 weeks. a. Histamine-2 blockers (H2 blockers): Ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid). Best for intermittent or infrequent symptoms as needed. b. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI): Can try after 2-week trial of H2 blockers if no response. Must give about 30 minutes before breakfast, do not skip meal. If symptoms improve, continue for 8-12 weeks before weaning. Lansoprazole (Prevacid): Approved for use in children. Omeprazole (Prilosec). OTC antacids: Not for long-term use. Only for temporary relief.424 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disorders4. Surgery: Fundoplication. Reserved for severe GERD that failed medical management. I. Follow-up. 1. Telephone contact after 2 weeks on H2 blocker or PPI. 2. Return to clinic for increased symptoms, new symptoms. 3. Refer to pediatric GI specialist if symptoms severe/no response to initial treatments, lifestyle changes. J. Complications.

Esophagitis, stricture formation. 2. Failure to thrive, nutritional deficits. 3. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia. K. Education. 1. In otherwise healthy infant with normal growth, reassure parent: GER is common, most outgrow by first birthday. 2. Children: Prognosis usually very good but unlikely to \"outgrow. \" 3. Take medication exactly as prescribed. If helpful, medicate minimum of 2 months before discontinuing or stepping down therapy from PPI to H2 blocker. 4. Nutritional guidance: Avoid overfeeding, review all dietary restrictions/ history at each visit. 5. Nonmedical management is essential to continue even if using medication. VIII. HERNIA, INGUINAL Abdominal distension (gaseous), R14.0 Abdominal tenderness, unspecified site, R10.819 Intra-abdominal and pelvic swelling, mass and lump, unspecified site, R19.00Unilateral inguinal hernia, without obstruction or gangrene, not hernia protrusion of abdominal organ, usually bowel, into inguinal canal. B. Etiology. 1. Indirect: Bowel and/or mesenteric fat protrudes through deep inguinal ring through inguinal canal lateral to inferior epigastric artery. 2. Direct: Bowel protrudes between interior epigastric artery and edge of rectus muscle. Generally acquired, increasing incidence with age, espe - cially elderly adults. 3. Incarcerated: Hernia that cannot be returned or reduced by manipulation. Can become strangulated. C. Occurrence. 1. Most common surgical condition in children. 2. 60% are on right side; left 30%; bilateral 10%. 3. Most common type is indirect (approximately 99%). 4. Approximately 50% present before 1 year of age, most seen in first 6 months. 5. Ratio of boys to girls, 4:1. Incidence approximately 10-20 in every 1000 live births. 6. Higher incidence in premature babies, positive family history, cystic fibrosis, undescended testes, hypospadias, congenital dislocation of hip, congenital abdominal wall defects. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Bulge in inguinal region may extend to scrotum. Especially noticeable during crying/straining. 2. History of intermittent groin, labial/scrotal swelling. 3. Parents are usually first to notice. 4. Hernia reduces spontaneously when relaxed/sleeping. 5. Important questions to ask: a. When was swelling/bulge first noticed? How often/when does it occur? b. Does infant/child appear uncomfortable with it? c. Any signs of intestinal obstruction such as vomiting, abdominal distention? E. Physical findings. 1. Bulge at level of internal/external ring. 2. Scrotal/labial swelling. 3. Do not place finger in inguinal canal, done only for adult hernia exam. 4. In supine position, with legs and arms extended over head: Wait for cry, which will increase intra-abdominal pressure. Should demonstrate bulge over external ring/scrotal swelling. 5. Have older children stand.426 CHAPTER 27 (retractile testes are common in infants and young children, can be mistaken for hernia). 7. Abdominal exam: Assess for distention, masses, tenderness. 8. In boys: If swelling not apparent during exam, check for thickening of spermatic cord (silk-glove sign) by palpating spermatic cord over pubic tubercle. Rubbing together area feels like silk. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. All girls with inguinal hernia should have rectal exam by experienced examiner; may need to order pelvic ultrasound. 2. Diagnosis otherwise made by history and physical exam. G. Differential diagnosis. Hydrocele, unspecified, N43.3 Torsion of testis, unspecified, N44.00 Unilateral inguinal with without gangrene, not specified as recurrent, K40.30 Abdominal hernia with obstruction, without gangrene, unspecified, K46.0 Other noninflammatory disorders ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, N83.8Unilateral inguinal hernia, with obstruction, without gangrene, not specified as recurrent, K40.30 Vascular disorders of male genital organs, N50.11. Inguinal hernia in boys: Scrotal swelling varies during day, increase in size with crying/straining. 2. Incarcerated inguinal hernia: Usually associated with discomfort, positive/negative abdominal distention. Bulge persists. 3. Hydrocele in boys: Circumscribed fluid collection in scrotum; swelling does not change in size throughout day, gradually disappears over first year of life. Transillumination of scrotum cannot distinguish between hydrocele, inguinal hernia. H. Treatment. 1. Surgery: Inguinal hernia does not resolve spontaneously, surgery usually elective shortly after diagnosis. 2. Supports/trusses are not indicated, may be hazardous. I. Follow-up. 1. Referral to pediatric surgeon when diagnosis of inguinal hernia made. J. Complications. VIII. Hernia, Inguinal 4271. Incarcerated hernia: Immediate referral for reduction under sedation. Incidence could be as high as 30% for infants younger than 2 months. 2. Strangulated incarcerated hernia: Blood supply compromised: Surgical emergency. 3. Ischemia/infarction of testis: Can occur in boys with undescended tes - ticles, inguinal hernia. 4. Ovary/fallopian tube infarction in girls. K. Education. 1. Uncomplicated indirect inguinal hernia: Review signs, symptoms of incarcerated/strangulated hernia with family: Abdominal distention, vomiting, pain, persistent bulge that does not reduce. 2. Family understands importance of following through with surgical appointments. 3. Operative repair necessary within first year of life due to increased inci - dence of incarceration after that time. IX. HERNIA, UMBILICAL Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Abdominal distension (gaseous), R14.0Umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene, K42.9 A. Definition. 1. Umbilical hernia is protrusion of part of intestine at umbilicus; defect is at abdominal wall, protruding bowel covered with skin, subcutane - ous tissue. B. Etiology. 1. Due to weakness/incomplete closure of umbilical ring. C. Occurrence. 1. Increased incidence among black infants, low-birthweight infants, females. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Soft mass covered by skin that protrudes from umbilicus, usually with increased intra-abdominal pressure (crying/straining) or may be more persistent (ask parent about fluctuations in mass size/presence). 2. Size of defect varies from 1 cm in diameter to 5 cm. 3. Usually disappears spontaneously by 1 year of age. Larger hernias may resolve spontaneously by 5-6 years of age unless defect 2 cm.428 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersE. Physical findings. 1. Examine infant in supine position. 2. Abdomen will reveal soft protrusion through umbilicus, usually easy to reduce through fibrous umbilical ring. Assess for abdominal distention. 3. Increased size may be visible with crying. Observe for signs of pain. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. None. G. Differential diagnosis. Umbilical hernia with obstruction, without gangrene, K42.0 Umbilical hernia gangrene, K42.01. Strangulated umbilical hernia (very rare): May show signs of intestinal obstruction such as pain, vomiting, persistent umbilical bulge that will not reduce. H. Treatment. 1. Most resolve spontaneously by 5 years of age. 2. Surgery reserved for hernias after 3-4 years of age, those causing symptoms (becomes incarcerated or strangulated), those becoming progressively larger after 1-2 years of age. I. Follow-up. 1. Assess hernia routinely at all visits. Immediate return if signs of incarceration. J. Complications. 1. Incarceration: Very rare. K. Education. 1. Instruct parent not to tape or bind umbilicus and on signs, symptoms of incarceration. 2. Reassure most resolve spontaneously. X. INTUSSUSCEPTION Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Intussusception, 1. Intussusception is prolapse or \"telescoping\" of one part of intestine into lumen of adjoining intestine. B. Etiology. 1. Can follow infections such as gastroenteritis, otitis media, URI, adenovirus. Approximately 75% are Meckel's polyp, duplication. 3. May be alteration in intestinal peristalsis that provokes condition. C. Occurrence. 1. Most common cause of intestinal obstruction for age 6-36 months. 2. 90% occur in children younger than age 2 years; about 10% occur in children older than 5 years. Rare in neonates. 3. Incidence 1-4 in every 1000 live births. 4. Male-to-female ratio is 4:1. 5. Peaks in spring and fall. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Sudden onset severe abdominal pain, usually periumbilical/lower abdo - men, in previously well child. 2. Pain colicky, paroxysmal occurring at frequent intervals. 3. Child may appear well between episodes of pain at first. 4. During pain, child flexes legs, pulls knees toward abdomen, cries. 5. Vomiting common. 6. Stools may appear normal in first few hours, after which little or no stool. 7. Blood per rectum can occur within first 12 hours or up to 2 days after symptoms start. May be mixed with mucus described as \"currant jelly stool. \" 8. If symptoms unrecognized, may progress to lethargy, bilious vomiting, shock. E. Physical findings. 1. Weight, temperature, vital signs. 2. Assess overall affect and activity level, observe during pain episode. 3. Abdomen may be distended. Guarding during exam if having pain. About 70% may have palpable, ill-defined (\"sausage-shaped\") mass, may be mildly tender. 4. Rectal exam may reveal bloody mucus. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Diagnosis usually made by history and physical exam. 2. Barium enema: May show filling defect. 3. Abdominal ultrasound can also detect intussusception.430 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal DisordersG. Meckel's diverticulum: Painless, rectal bleeding from congenital append - age of ileum. 3. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura: Associated with joint symptoms, purpura rash. H. Treatment. 1. Barium enema: Hydrostatic/\"air contrast\" used to diagnose, treat intussusception. 2. Untreated, condition almost always fatal. 3. 10% recurrence rate after reduction by barium enema. 4. to \"lead or polyp requires surgery. I. Follow-up. 1. Immediate referral to tertiary care facility. 2. Telephone or clinic follow-up after reduction. J. Complications. Volume depletion, E86 1. Dehydration, bowel necrosis, death. K. Education. 1. Reassure parent that vast majority of cases have no specific lead point and are successfully treated with barium enema. 2. Counsel family to call immediately if any signs of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding following reduction. XI. IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Abdominal distension (gaseous), R14.0 Anal fissure, unspecified, K60.2Constipation, R19.7Irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea, K58.9 specified diseases liver, K76.89Rectal fistula, skin tags, K64.4 XI. Irritable Bowel Syndrome 431A. Definition. 1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and changes in bowel function. Rome IV diagnostic criteria (fulfilled for at least 2 months prior to diagnosis): Must include all of the following: a. Abdominal pain at least 4 days per month associated with 1 or more of the following: A change in frequency of stool. A change in form (appearance) of stool. b. In children with constipation, pain does not resolve with resolution of the constipation (children in whom pain resolves have functional constipation rather than IBS). 2. After appropriate evaluation, symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition. 3. Three subgroups associated with predominant stool pattern: IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation and diarrhea. B. Etiology. 1. Thought to be combination of visceral hypersensitivity and possibly altered gut motility. May be due to alterations in ENS and relationship to CNS. 2. Stress/anxiety may induce/worsen symptoms but probably not root cause. 3. May be preceded by episode of viral gastroenteritis or past history of constipation. C. Occurrence. 1. Common cause of chronic abdominal pain and change in bowel function in older children and adolescents. 2. Estimated that about 6% of middle school students and 14% of high school students may fit criteria. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Abdominal pain/discomfort, usually lower abdomen or periumbilical; relieved by defecation/onset associated with change in frequency/appearance of stool. 2. Otherwise well, without evidence of underlying structural/metabolic abnormalities. 3. BMs may be predominantly loose, constipated, or fluctuate between the two. 4. May pass mucus with stool. 5. Stool urgency, especially in morning; occasional feeling of incomplete defecation. 6. Abdominal bloating/distention, especially later in day. 7. Important questions to ask: a. Location, timing, frequency, duration, quality of pain. b. BM frequency, consistency, size. Straining? Mucus relieve abdominal pain? Anything that helps or aggravates symptoms? d. Is patient on medications? Any OTC remedies? e. Sensation of abdominal bloating? What time of day? 8. Complete diet history including beverages. Any weight loss? 9. May have functional dyspepsia symptoms such as nausea. No vomiting. 10. Red flags in history indicating diagnosis other than IBS include growth failure, weight loss, joint symptoms, vomiting, blood in stool, fever, family history of IBD (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis), dysphagia. E. Physical findings. 1. Height, weight, temperature, vital signs. 2. Complete physical exam with attention to: a. Abdomen: Assess for tenderness, masses, stool, hepatosplenomegaly. b. Rectal: Assess for fissures, skin tags, fistula. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. No test to diagnose IBS. 2. Screening studies usually necessary to be sure no underlying pathology. a. Stool for occult blood, ova and parasite, giardia antigen. b. CBC, ESR. Consider celiac disease serology. c. Consider 2-week trial of lactose-free diet to rule out lactose intolerance. G. Differential diagnosis. Abdominal pain, unspecified, R10.9 Constipation, K59.0 Crohn's disease, unspecified, esophagitis, K21.9Noninfective enteritis and Ulcerative colitis, unspecified, without 1. Constipation, GER. 2. Lactose intolerance: Decreased lactase enzyme in small intestine causes malabsorption, subsequent diarrhea, abdominal pain, gas if excessive lactose ingested. 3. IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis: Usually associated with growth delay/weight loss, anemia, diarrhea with/without blood, possibly joint pain, mouth ulcerations. Physical exam may reveal abnormal appearance to anus, abdominal tenderness. H. Treatment. 1. There is currently a lack of high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of dietary interventions. XI. Irritable Bowel Syndrome 4332. Trial of high-fiber diet, consider starting fiber supplement (OTC). AAP recommends child's age + 5 g fiber/day. 3. Regular meals, avoid caffeine. 4. Ensure adequate rest and exercise. Discuss sleep hygiene. 5. Bloating/loose stools: Reduce sorbitol and fructose in diet. 6. Predominantly constipation: Add stool softener such as Miralax, milk of magnesia. 7. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, such as relaxation and biofeedback. 8. Pharmacologic treatment reserved for continuing symptoms usually monitored by MD. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants used with some success, probably due to effect on ENS. Antispasmodics used, but little data at this time to support their use. Studies using probiotics inconclusive and ongoing at this time. I. Follow-up. 1. Return to clinic for any change/worsening of symptoms. 2. Refer to counselor as needed for relaxation therapy or biofeedback. 3. Refer to pediatric GI specialist if red flags or if treatment not successful. J. Complications. 1. School absence/avoidance. K. Education. 1. Discuss IBS at first visit. Explain that this is real diagnosis, not diagnosis of exclusion. 2. Reassure if history consistent with IBS and physical exam and screening studies are negative, further testing not necessary. 3. Discuss ENS and possible reasons for symptoms of IBS. 4. Explain importance of regular meals and exercise; both can help control symptoms. 5. Identify psychologic triggers such as family upset/school difficulties. 6. Insist on regular school attendance. XII. PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE Abdominal anger, R45.4Melena, K92.1Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation, K27.9 Personal history of peptic 1. of B. Etiology. 1. Imbalance between cytotoxic and cytoprotective factors. a. Cytotoxic: Acid, pepsin, medications, infection. b. Cytoprotective: Gastric mucous layer provides mechanical barrier. 2. Primary PUD: Mainly caused by H. pylori infection in adults. a. Route of transmission unknown, may be fecal-oral, acquired early in life. b. Can cause gastritis positive/negative peptic ulcer, usually in children older than 10 years of age. 3. Secondary PUD: Physiologic stress (burns, trauma), medications (NSAIDs, aspirin, corticosteroids), caustic ingestion (including alcohol), viral infec - tions, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, eosinophilic gastroenteritis (allergic inflammation), Crohn's disease. C. Occurrence. 1. H. pylori . a. Increased risk for acquiring infection in developing countries, poor socioeconomic conditions, overcrowding. b. Possible ethnic/genetic predisposition: Higher rate among Asians, blacks, Hispanics. c. Less common in children, but may acquire infection in childhood that is asymptomatic until later. d. Among most common bacterial infections in humans. Debate ongoing as to whether it may be normal flora in some individuals. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Neonates (up to age 1 month): Usually present with GI hemorrhage/ perforation (rare). 2. Infants to age 2 years: Vomiting, irritability, poor growth, GI hemorrhage. 3. Preschool: Periumbilical pain, often postprandial, vomiting, GI hemorrhage. 4. School age and older: Epigastric abdominal pain that may awaken child from sleep. Acute/chronic GI blood loss (hematemesis, hematochezia, melena) may occur along with iron-deficiency anemia. 5. Family history of PUD. 6. Difficult to distinguish from other GI disorders such as GERD. 7. Obtain full diet and medication history. 8. Location, frequency, quality, duration, timing of pain. Does it wake child from sleep? 9. Any regurgitation or vomiting? Hematemesis, coffee ground-like emesis? or hematochezia? XII. Peptic Ulcer Disease 435E. Physical findings. 1. Height, weight: Plot on growth curve and compare with previous. 2. Temperature, vital signs. 3. Full physical exam with attention to following: a. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT): Assess for dental caries, enamel erosion. b. Abdomen: Assess for tenderness, masses, hepatosplenomegaly. c. Rectal: Perform digital exam. Assess for fissures. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Physical exam: CBC (anemia); CMP , amylase, Test stool for occult blood. 3. Upper GI series: To assess anatomy in child with vomiting. Little value in diagnosing ulcers or gastritis in children. 4. H. pylori serology: Unreliable in children, not recommended. H. pylori stool antigen: Fairly reliable for diagnosis of current infection but should not be used for initial decision for treatment. 5. Endoscopy with biopsies (test of choice) to diagnose H. pylori and PUD. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. H. pylori infections: Reliable diagnosis in children by upper endoscopy. 2. Secondary PUD: a. Medication: History of NSAID, aspirin, corticosteroid use, and others. b. Trauma/stress PUD: History of burns, trauma, surgery. c. Caustic ingestion/ethanol (ETOH). d. Crohn's disease: History may include growth problems, diarrhea, blood in stool. H. Treatment. 1. H. pylori : 14 days of amoxicillin (Augmentin) and clarithromycin (Biaxin) and at least 1 month of PPI (e.g., lansoprazole [Prevacid]). 2. Secondary PUD. a. Discontinue offending medication/caustic substance. If on cortico - steroids to treat another disease, may wean or give acid-reducing medicine until therapy complete.Crohn's disease, unspecified, without complications, K50.90 Helicobacter pylori as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, B96.81 Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, unspecified as acute or chronic, hemorrhage or perforation, K27.9436 CHAPTER 27 Gastrointestinal Disordersb. Gastritis/PUD with H2 blocker (ranitidine [Zantac], farnotidine [Pepcid]). If no response in 7-14 days, can increase therapy to PPI. c. History of upper GI bleed, melena, hematochezia requires referral to tertiary care facility/consultation of MD before therapy. d. Treat iron-deficiency anemia. I. Follow-up. 1. H. pylori : Follow-up testing (repeat endoscopy) for patients symptom - atic after treatment. Other methods can be unreliable or not approved for children. Stool antigen test can be offered to determine if infection eradicated but must be done after patient off PPIs and antibiotics for at least 2-4 weeks. 2. Return to clinic 1 month after treatment started for nonspecific/suspected PUD. 3. Immediate return for any worsening symptoms. J. Complications. Chronic or unspecified gastric ulcer with both diseases classified elsewhere, B96.81Iron-deficiency anemia, unspecified, D50.9 Malignant neoplasm of stomach, unspecified, C16.9 1. H. pylori (chronic colonization carries theoretical risk of developing gastric cancer). 2. Massive GI bleed/perforation. 3. Chronic iron-deficiency anemia. K. Education. 1. H. pylori not common in children, communicability low. Increased risk among household contacts of others with this infection. 2. Explain that because differentiating between GERD and PUD is difficult, if no response to treatment with acid-reducing medication, endoscopy may be necessary. 3. Employ conservative management for symptoms, such as dietary restrictions. anus and rectum, K62.89 A. Etiology. 1. Humans only known hosts for this obligate parasite; ingest embryonated eggs, which hatch in stomach. Larvae migrate to cecum area where mature into adult worms. 2. Adult worms are about 1 cm in length. Females migrate by night to peri - anal region to deposit eggs. 3. Ova mature after approximately 6 hours. Larvae viable for about 20 days. 4. Eggs carried under fingernails, transmitted directly to another human or deposited in environment (dust, bed clothes) where others come in contact. Autoinfection/reinfection common; highly communicable. B. Occurrence. 1. Highest prevalence in children 5-14 years of age. 2.

Rectal exam: Observe for any abnormalities, digital exam may be necessary to check for occult blood. d. CNS: Assess fontanel. Assess for irritability, nuchal rigidity, Brudzinski and Kernig's signs, funduscopic exam. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. If child appears ill, dehydrated: Serum electrolytes, CBC. 2. If bilious vomiting, consider upper GI series to rule out mechanical obstruction. 3. Projectile vomiting in infant younger than age 5 months: Abdominal ultrasound to rule out pyloric stenosis. 4. Abdominal X-ray: If ingested radiopaque foreign body/bezoar suspected. 5. Urinalysis with specific gravity. 6. Other tests to be determined by history, physical exam. G. Differential diagnosis. Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified, J06.9 Adult hypertrophic G43.909 and colitis, K50-K52 Other specified intestinal infections, A08.8Poisoning by unspecified drugs, medicaments and biological substances, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter, T50.901A Polyphagia, R63.2 Urinary tract infection, site not specified, N39.0 Viral pneumonia, not otherwise classified, J12 Vomiting of pregnancy, unspecified, O21.9 1.

Mild dehydration: Goal 50 mL/kg + losses over 4 hours. Moderate: 100 mL/kg + losses over 4 hours, reassess hourly. b. Severe dehydration: ED or admission for IV fluids. Start with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution at 10-20 mL/kg over 1 hour. 2. As vomiting decreases, offer larger amounts of ORS at less frequent intervals. 3. After rehydration, other fluids including milk, food may be reintroduced. 4. Antiemetic medications are generally not warranted/recommended. I. Follow-up. 1. No/mild dehydration: Telephone next day. 2. Moderate dehydration: See patient next day. 3. Immediate return if increased symptoms, signs of dehydration. 4. Severe dehydration requires visit following discharge from emergency department/hospital. J. Complications. Gastroesophageal laceration-hemorrhage syndrome, K22.6 Volume depletion, E86 1. Dehydration. 2. Mallory-Weiss tear (linear tear at gastroesophageal junction from repeated vomiting): Fresh red blood in emesis after multiple episodes of vomiting. 3. Other complications depend on etiology. K. Education. 1. Most cases of acute vomiting are from viral gastroenteritis. 2. Can be successfully treated at home if no signs of or mild dehydration. 3. Review dehydration signs/symptoms with family, reassure most cases self-limited. 4. Repeated vomiting can induce reflux of bile into stomach, resulting in bile staining.446 BF, St. J, Schor N, eds.

CRYPTORCHIDISM of male genital organs, unspecified, N50.9 ectopic. 2. Can be result of chromosomal, hormonal, anatomic factors. 3. Majority (about 80%): Palpable, are undescended or ectopic testes. can be intra-abdominal, inguinal, absent testes. B. 1. Most common male congenital anomaly; affects nearly 3-5% of term infants, approximately 30% of premature males. Right is more common than left (70% versus 30%). In 10% of cases, it is bilateral. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Risk of cryptorchidism increases in premature infant. 2. Bilateral nonpalpable testes or cryptorchid testes associated with hypospa - dias should be evaluated at birth for life-threatening intersex conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 3. Parents may note retractile testicles in scrotum intermittently, especially after warm bath. Retractile testes are associated with an overactive crem - asteric reflex. When examined, they can be placed in the scrotum and will remain there for a short time after released. If they retract immediately, they should be considered undescended. 449CHAPTER 284. In case of absent testicle, contralateral testicle may be larger than expected. D. Physical findings. 1. Often helpful to have child in cross-legged sitting position for exam. 2. Retractile testes can be placed into scrotum, remain there for short period. 3. Nonpalpable testes may be ectopic, found in femoral or perineal regions. 4. Scrotum may be flat/underdeveloped on affected side. 5. Larger-than-expected testicle may represent absent or nonfunctioning testicle on contralateral side. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Unilateral or bilateral palpable testes: No diagnostic testing indicated. 2. Bilateral nonpalpable testes or unilateral nonpalpable testes associated with phallic abnormality: Refer to pediatric urology for evaluation of risk for a disorder of sex differentiation. Evaluate with karyotype, endocrine testing, and appropriate radiographic studies. Imaging not usually neces - sary, but ultrasound can be used to evaluate the very obese child or when adequate exam cannot be performed. a. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test differentiates between anorchia and undescended testicles. b. hCG can stimulate testosterone production in functioning testes and can also result in testicular descent. F. Differential diagnosis. Indeterminate sex, unspecified, Q56.4 Retractile testis, Q55.22 1. Retractile testes. 2. Intersex conditions. G. Treatment. 1. If at 6 months of age testes remain undescended, intervention is necessary. a. Type of treatment depends on testes' location, patient's age, associa - tion with other anomalies. b. Reasons for treatment: Reduced fertility, risk of tumor formation, trauma, torsion, repair of commonly associated defects such as inguinal hernia, psychological factors related to body image. 2. Placing testes into scrotum does not decrease risk of testicular cancer but does provide easy exam for early detection. Risk of testes cancer in cryptorchid male is 1 in 2000; highest risk between ages 17 and 25 years. 3. Orchiopexy or open surgery fixes testicle in scrotum and repairs her - nia if needed. Laparoscopy can be used to locate nonpalpable testes or blind-ending vessels. There is also laparoscopic approach to orchiopexy. 4. Hormone administration is not as successful as surgical approach (ap - proximately 10% success rate) but a good option in high-risk patients 450 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disordersand/or patients who have testes found in high scrotum or at external inguinal ring. H. Follow-up. 1. After surgery, examine incisions at 2-4 weeks, 4-6 months postop. 2. Hormonal therapy: Examine at 1 month, 6 months posttreatment (higher risk of reascension). 3. Y early exam important; patient should be taught self-exam at puberty. Can be performed by local medical provider or pediatric urologist. a. Asymmetry of testes needs further evaluation. 4. Retractile testes are rarely problematic, should be evaluated annually for possible ascension; increased risk in patients with anomalies of the central nervous system. I. Complications. Atrophy of testis, N50.0 1. Testicular atrophy is rated most serious complication of orchiopexy. J. Education. 1. All males need to be taught self-scrotal exam at puberty. Especially important with history of undescended testicle due to 40% increased risk of cancer. Most common tumor is seminoma. 2. Prior to puberty, annual exam should be done. Scrotal pain needs to be evaluated immediately to rule out risk of testicular torsion, trauma, epididy - mitis, torsed be taught to perform testicular self-exam monthly and report any changes immediately. II. HYDROCELE Abdominal hernia, unspecified, without obstruction or gangrene, K46.9 Hydrocele, unspecified, N43.3Indeterminate sex, unspecified, Q56.4 Other specified disorders of male genital organs, N50.8 A. Etiology. 1. Occurs when processus vaginalis (channel that allows testicle to move from abdomen to scrotum during development) remains patent. 2. Difference between hernia and hydrocele is size of patent processus vagi - nalis and its contents. a. Narrow channel only allows fluid from peritoneal cavity to pass, resulting in hydrocele. b. Inguinal hernia: Much wider, can allow both fluid and intestinal contents to pass. II. Hydrocele 451B. Occurrence. 1. About 80% of infants are born with patent processus vaginalis; by end of first month of life, decreases to about 60%. 2. By 18-24 months of age, only 20-30% remain. 3. Rare in females: 6 males to 1 female. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Females: Rare, usually presents with soft bulge in labia or inguinal canal. a. Bulge can represent ovary or hernia. b. Intersex conditions (especially testicular feminization): Evaluate in female. 2. Males: Parents complain of scrotal swelling in one or both sides. Can be continuous or intermittent; size can fluctuate. a. Parent may describe bluish hue to scrotum, often small in size in morning and growing larger during day as fluid accumulates. b. History is very important because may not be present at time of exam. D. Physical findings. 1. Hydroceles typically transilluminate with penlight be can be seen by transillumina - tion. If testes not seen or palpated, need scrotal ultrasound to differentiate. 3. Classified as communicating (patent processus vaginalis) or noncommu - nicating. communicating. Noncom - municating hydroceles do not fluctuate in size. 4. Condition rarely painful unless associated with hernia that becomes incarcerated. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. If any concern regarding testes, ultrasound imaging is indicated. F. Differential diagnosis. specified testes.452 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary DisordersG. Treatment. 1. Generally safe to watch hydroceles until age 18-24 months. After that age, spontaneous resolution is uncommon. 2. Earlier surgical intervention is indicated if hydrocele is large or associated with hernia secondary to increased risk of incarceration. Any abnormal - ity of testes requires evaluation by scrotal ultrasound and could lead to earlier surgical intervention. H. Follow-up. 1. Child younger than 18 months of age should be examined every 6 months. If no change, no intervention indicated until age 18-24 months. 2. If hydrocelectomy is performed, see patient 4 weeks postop to evaluate incision and scrotum. If exam is normal, can return to routine annual exam with healthcare provider. I. Complications. Abdominal hernia, unspecified, with obstruction, without gangrene, K46.0 Atrophy of testis, N50.0Hydrocele, unspecified, N43.3 1. Complications from hydroceles are rare. 2. Risk of incarcerated hernia in patients with wide patent processus vaginalis. 3. are lysis vas deferens. J. Education. 1. Although hydroceles and hernias are not really associated with increased risk of testicular cancer, discuss importance of self-scrotal exam. 2. Teach parents importance of regular exam during observation period. 3. If any scrotal pain, child needs to be seen immediately. III. EPIDIDYMITIS Chlamydial infection, unspecified, A74.9Congenital absence, atresia and stenosis of large intestine, part unspecified, Q42.9 Disorder of male genital organs, unspecified, N50.9 Dysuria, of urinary bladder, bladder, N31.9 Epididymitis to edema, irritation of epididymis or lining of testicle. 2. Can occur from infectious/inflammatory cause. 3. Can be difficult to distinguish epididymitis from testicular torsion because both can be quite painful. 4. Can be sexually acquired; Neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia are com - mon pathogens. 5. Can be related to genitourinary abnormalities or urethra manipulation. 6. Rarely associated with heavy lifting or straining that results in efflux of urine into vas deferens. Urinalysis should be obtained; if infectious, then bacterial epididymitis can occur; if not, chemical inflammation develops. B. Occurrence. 1. Rare in children before puberty unless child has genitourinary abnormal - ity. Most common cause of the acute scrotum. Incidence ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 cases for every 1000 persons per year. 2. More commonly occurs in sexually active adolescents. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Most likely to occur in postpubertal male and very young males. 2. Those with imperforate anus, exstrophy, neurogenic bladder, any condi - tions requiring intermittent catheterization are more prone to this type of infection. D. Physical findings. 1. Include sexual history in postpubertal male. 2. Urethral discharge may be present. 3. Often slow onset of pain that continues to become more severe. 4. May have dysuria and see blood or discharge in urine. 5. Physical exam yields swollen and inflamed scrotum. 6. May complain of tenderness along epididymis. 7. If testicle is tender and swollen, may also have orchitis. 8. Up to 33% may be febrile. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Urine culture and urinalysis may be positive or negative for bacteria. If positive (2-6% of cases), then X-ray evaluation by voiding cystourethro - gram (VCUG) and renal-bladder ultrasound is indicated. 2. Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler flow is useful in differentiating epididymitis from testicular torsion. Ultrasound will show enlarged epididymis with increased blood flow unless edema is so severe it results in ischemia. May also show enlarged testicle with increased low flow in orchitis.454 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Differential N45.1Torsion specified, N39.0 1. Testicular torsion. 2. Chemical epididymitis. Torsion of testicular appendage. 5. Urinary tract infection (UTI). G. Treatment. 1. If urinalysis is positive, start 2 weeks of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic while cultures are pending. If necessary, change appropriately when cultures are final. a. Children not sexually active: Cephalexin: 40 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Can also use: Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg bid. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX): Older than 2 of age: 4 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg bid. Ciprofloxacin: 15 mg/kg bid postpuberty. The safety of quinolone antimicrobial use in children remains a concern and must be considered. Some clinical situations (such as complicated UTI or pyelonephritis) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); others may warrant off-label use. 2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen) for several days will help decrease inflammation, pain. 3. Scrotal support and elevating scrotum will help resolve edema. 4. Limited activity for 2-3 days. 5. Application of heat/cold compresses helps reduce pain and edema. 6. If pain and edema are severe or not responding to treatment, consider intrave - nous (IV) antibiotics. Prolonged infection can result in damage to epididymis. 7. Identified sexually transmitted infection (STI) should be treated with appropriate antibiotic regimen. H. Follow-up. 1. If pain increases, see patient immediately. 2. If condition is resolving, follow up in 2 weeks; consider repeat ultrasonography. 3. If positive urine cultures, a VCUG and renal-bladder ultrasound should be done. Increased likelihood of genitourinary abnormalities in males with positive urine cultures. Prophylactic antibiotics could be given until radiographic evaluation is complete but evaluation should be completed within 4-6 weeks to avoid prolonged use of prophylaxis (see UTI section). III. Epididymitis 455I. Complications. 1. Possible damage to vas deferens, epididymis with recurrent or untreated infection. J. Education. 1. Preventive education especially when epididymitis is associated with STIs. 2. Signs/symptoms of testicular torsion and acute scrotum indicate need for immediate attention by medical professional. 3. Genitourinary abnormalities can be associated with urinary infections, so follow up with necessary testing. IV. HYPOSPADIAS/CHORDEE Disorder of male genital organs, unspecified, N50.9 Hypospadias, unspecified, Q54.9Other specified disorders of penis, N48.89 A. Etiology. 1. Cause of hypospadias is unknown; genetic link is suspected (many families with multiple occurrences). 2. Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly in which urethral meatus is ectopic; it is located on the undersurface of the penis any place between the glans and the scrotum. 3. Spectrum defect ranging from mild to severe, depending on degree of chor - dee (bend of penis), location of urethral opening. Mild forms can be found during newborn circumcision; if discovered, stop circumcision\u2014foreskin used to repair defect. B. Occurrence. 1. Occurs in 1 of every 250 males in United States; incidence increased to 1 of every 100 if immediate family history. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Difficult for older child to stand to urinate. 2. If associated with chordee, future intercourse may be difficult. 3. Parental anxiety/guilt common with genital malformation. D. Physical findings. 1. Urethral opening lies on undersurface of penis. 2. Degrees of hypospadias: Distal shaft refers to opening being closest to natural location. a. As opening gets closer to scrotum, condition becomes more severe. b. Referred to as midshaft, penoscrotal (located at penoscrotal junction), and perineal (located just beneath scrotum). 3. Chordee or bend of penis is present in 35% of cases.456 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disorders4. Foreskin typically seen only on side gives \"hooded\" appearance. 5. Penile glans has spade-like appearance and cleft/blind-ending pit may be seen at location where meatus would normally reside. 6. Cryptorchidism associated 7-9% of cases. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Rarely necessary with hypospadias. 2. Early referral to experienced pediatric urologist important: Allay fears about child's masculinity, opportunity to assess for intersex disorders (uncommon but considered with severe hypospadias and hypospadias associated with cryptorchidism). 3. Karyotype and endocrine evaluation to rule out disorders of sex differ - entiation may be indicated with severe hypospadias and cryptorchidism. 4. In some of the more extensive cases, urinary tract will need to be evaluated. F. Differential diagnosis. Indeterminate sex, unspecified, Q56.4 1. Intersex disorders. G. Treatment. 1. Referral to pediatric urologist as soon after birth as possible (reassure parents after surgical intervention child's potency/fertility no longer af - fected; makes it easier to discuss problem with other family members). 2. More than 200 surgical techniques described for hypospadias repair. a. Goals same in each repair; cosmetically normal-appearing penis, straight with urethral meatus at tip. Repairs are performed in healthy males as early as 6 months of age. b. Patient should be able to stand to void. c. Selected cases may require preadministration of testosterone to en - hance blood supply to genitalia. d. Most surgery is done on outpatient basis. e. Many approaches to postoperative dressing. Absorbable sutures are used in repairs, will not need to be removed. f. Stent may be left through urethra to drain bladder while urethra heals. Nonabsorbable suture may be used to hold stent in place; will need to be removed about 1 week postop. H. Follow-up. 1. See in 1 week to inspect incision, remove any dressings, stent if necessary. 2. See again 2-3 months later, after majority of edema is resolved, to ensure penis is straight, meatus is widely open. IV. Hypospadias/Chordee 4573. Some surgeons schedule visit after toilet training to visualize normal voiding stream; others see child after puberty to discuss surgery, alleviate fears, and rare late complications. 4. If ever difficulty voiding or UTI, patient should be seen immediately by pediatric urologist. I. Complications. Injury of unspecified intra- abdominal organ, S36.9 Other specified hypospadiac surgeon is important to minimize complications. 2. Rate of complication varies according to severity of defect. a. Early postoperative complications: Uncommon but include wound dee, urethral diverticulum. c. If secondary procedure necessary, not performed until tissues well healed\u2014approximately 6 months after initial repair. J. Education. 1. Important to educate newborn-care providers not to circumcise if any penile defects: Foreskin is used for repair. 2. Understanding defect and its correction can alleviate parental fears; this is a structural problem that can be corrected surgically. 3. Patient must understand potential for complications. Any difficulty void - ing or UTI need follow-up with pediatric urologist. V. PHIMOSIS A. Etiology. 1. Inability to retract the prepuce to expose the glans penis. 2. 10% uncircumcised males have physiologic phimosis up to age 3 years, only 0.6% persist to age 17 years. 3. Risk factors: Poor hygiene, recurrent balanitis, ballooning of foreskin, posturination dribbling. B. Clinical manifestations. 1. Inability to to retract foreskin. 2. Ballooning of foreskin with urination.458 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disorders3. Pathologic findings include pain, skin irritation, infection, dysuria, he - maturia, bleeding of glans penis, painful erections, possible deviation and weakness of urinary stream. C. Physical findings. 1. Physical exam reveals phimosis. 2. Culture purulent drainage if present. Urine culture if UTI suspected. D. Treatment. 1. Prevention: Gentle retraction of foreskin as natural (never forced) during voiding and bathing. Avoid strong soaps, creams that can cause irritation. 2. Risk factors: Paraphimosis is a medical emergency where foreskin has been forced back and entraps the glans, causing blood flow restriction to the glans. a. Treatment of paraphimosis: Decompress and replace foreskin; may need to wrap tightly and place ice pack to quickly reduce edema. If not successful, may require surgical intervention (emergent dorsal slit procedure or circumcision). 3. Recurrent balanitis (glans infection) may result in a planned circumcision. 4. Monitor for chronic infection. E. Education. 1. Teach proper hygiene techniques. 2. Teach parents to avoid retraction of the foreskin and risk of paraphimosis. VI. MEATAL STENOSIS A. Definition. 1. Small or narrow opening of urinary meatus, may alter or obstruct the flow of urine. B. Etiology. 1. Meatal irritation due to contact or chemical irritation from diapers, creams, underwear. 2. Postcircumcision meatal ischemia. 3. Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic, often progressive disease, which can lead to phimosis and urethral stenosis, affecting both urinary and sexual function. Steroid creams are usually the first-line treatment but have a limited role and surgical intervention is frequently necessary. C. Occurrence. 1. Most common in males between ages of 3 and 7 years. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Strong, thin stream that is deflected (most commonly upward). 2. Straining to urinate. VI. Meatal Stenosis 4593. Terminal hematuria. 4. Urinary incontinence. E. Treatment. 1. Prevention: After circumcision, avoid irritation to penis, change frequently, treat irritation promptly with gentle topical barrier cream. 2. Meatotomy: Incision of the urethral meatus, typically done in the urology office with topical anesthetic (EMLA OR LMX). F. Follow-up. 1. Visualize stream to ensure normal. G. Education. 1. Visualize stream to document straining or abnormality. 2. Educate family/patient to observe for reoccurrence after treatment. 3. Encourage good voiding habits; do not delay voiding until urgent. FEMALE GENITALIA DISORDERS VII. LABIAL ADHESION Condition, unspecified, associated with female genital organs and menstrual cycle, N94.9 Dysuria, R30.0Fusion occur result of vulvar ir - ritation, lack of estrogen. 2. Possible causes: Chronic inflammation, irritation secondary to infection, trauma, incontinence. B. Occurrence. 1. Primarily in girls 3 months to 6 years of age. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Dysuria and incontinence are common complaints when efflux of urine is blocked and urine is trapped behind adhesions. 2. Toilet-trained girls may complain of postvoid dribbling. Maternal estrogens seem to prevent adhesions in newborns. D. Physical findings. 1. Labial adhesions appear as thin film that begins posteriorly and advances anteriorly. 2. In more severe cases, cannot see vaginal introitus or urethral meatus.460 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disorders3. Presence that deviates from midline or more dense adhesions should raise question of repeat trauma/sexual abuse. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. None. F. Differential diagnosis. Child sexual abuse, suspected, initial encounter, T76.22XA Indeterminate sex, unspecified, Q56.4 1. Intersex conditions. 2. Sexual abuse. G. Treatment. 1. Majority requires no treatment, resolves spontaneously. a. Keep child clean and dry to prevent irritation and superficial infection. 2. More significant adhesions that present with dysuria and postvoid drib - bling can be treated topically or with take down of the adhesion. a. Premarin cream: 0.625 mg applied with gentle pressure to the trans - lucent midline twice a day for 10-14 days. b. Betamethasone cream 0.05% bid or 0.1% daily at bedtime can be used up to 4 weeks. 3. Lysis of thinned adhesions can be done in office after EMLA (lidocaine/ priolocaine) cream application. Some patients may not be able to tolerate this and brief anesthetic may be needed. 4. More dense-appearing adhesions or those that have been broken down previously may be done more effectively and with less trauma in operat - ing room. Critical to prevent readherence by applying barrier cream to previously attached tissues twice a day for 8-12 weeks. H. Follow-up. 1. No treatment: Follow up with each well-child check; may become more severe with time (best obtained by urethral catheterization). 2. If complaints of dysuria: Careful collection of urine specimen is impor - tant; it is difficult to collect valid specimen by voiding when adhesions are present (catheterization preferred). 3. Posttreatment: See patient 4-6 weeks later to ensure no reoccurrence. I. Complications. Urinary tract infection, site not specified, N39.0 1. Biggest risk is reoccurrence due to poor parental compliance with barrier cream placement after adhesions have been lysed. VII. Labial Adhesion 4612. If painful voiding, child may delay voiding, empty more poorly, resulting in true UTIs. 3. Prolonged use of estrogen can result in development of secondary sex characteristics. J. Education. 1. Importance of posttreatment management must be stressed to parents; most important in preventing further problems with adhesions. Sometimes difficult for parents, especially if child complains of discomfort when medication is applied. 2. Child should learn to void with legs widely separated to facilitate good bladder emptying and to keep labia separated during voiding. 3. If urine specimen necessary, take care to avoid contamination; done best by catheterization. 4. Parents understand length of Premarin treatment; possible side effects of prolonged or repeated use. MALE AND FEMALE DISORDERS VIII. PEDIATRIC URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS Abdominal pain, unspecified, R10.9 Constipation, K59.0Diarrhea, unspecified, R19.7Dysuria, R30.0Feeding difficulties, R35.0Irritability and anger, R45.4Nausea, R11.0Urge incontinence, specified, N39.0 Vomiting, unspecified, R11.10 A. Etiology. 1. Periurethral bacteria infect bladder, ureter, kidney. Escherichia coli most frequently identified pathogen. B. Occurrence. 1. Fairly common: 2.4% of children yearly, majority are ascending. 2. Up to 6 months of age, more common in males than females, incidence of 2 cases per 100 live births. Uncircumcised males less than 6 months old have a 10-fold increased risk for UTI development. 3. After 1 year of age, much more common in females. 4. Approximately 3% of toilet-trained females will develop infection.462 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disordersa. Of children who develop infection, 15% will develop infection-related renal scarring. b. Of those, 10-20% will have hypertension. c. 8% reoccurrence in neonatal males and 26% in females older than 1 year of age. d. Increased risk (10- to 12-fold) in uncircumcised males during first 6 months of life, but decreases thereafter. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Symptoms of UTI in infants often difficult to recognize. 2. Usually generalized illness with fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea. Suspect when no other source for fever or illness. 3. Older children complain of dysuria, suprapubic/urethral pain, urinary frequency, incontinence. Can also have fever, flank pain, nausea, vomit - ing if kidney is involved. 4. Foul-smelling urine, constipation (commonly associated, obtain stool history). D. Physical findings. 1. Perform thorough exam. 2. May detect renal mass in infants with gross anatomic abnormalities such as obstruction or mass. 3. Costovertebral angle (CV A) tenderness seen while palpating flank of older children. 4. If dysuria is primary concern, perineal exam may show external irritation related to incontinence, vaginal voiding, labial adhesions. 5. Sometimes treated as UTIs: Vaginitis and pinworms sometimes mistaken (because often present with dysuria). 6. Vaginal discharge: Culture if present; may have suprapubic tenderness. 7. Males: Evaluate foreskin, especially in first 6 months of life; scrotal exam to rule out epididymitis, especially in older males who may be sexually active. a. Look for urethral discharge; culture if present. b. UTIs in younger than 6 months of age are very uncommon; need evaluation. c. Abdominal exam may also yield large stool burden; constipation very common in children with UTIs. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Collecting urine specimen is very important in documenting infection. Four techniques for obtaining a specimen are listed in Table 28-1. 2. X-ray evaluation: Infants, febrile UTIs, males, recurrent UTIs, children who are not toilet trained. Important that true infection is documented by catheterized culture when deciding what additional evaluation is indicated. VIII. Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections 4633. Multiple guidelines for evaluation of UTI in children exist today; it is important that the provider consider evaluation carefully. a. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the American Urologic Association (AUA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have guidelines that are widely accepted by experts in pediatric urology. The seriousness of illness and atypical infection are important factors in determining evaluation. Renal ultrasound should be done promptly if child is not responding to therapy. If ultrasound abnor - mal, then VCUG or functional upper tract studies should be considered.T able 28-1 Techniques for Obtaining a Specimen Techniques Use for Specimen Drawbacks Bagged specimen (baggy attached to perineum)Helpful in ruling out UTI. If positive, catheter specimen needs to be obtained (false positives: 90%, especially if left on for 20 minutes). Clean-catch midstreamBetter collection; provides results of multiple organisms of small colony counts that are suggestive of contamination.Difficult for children (parents have a hard time cleaning, separating labia in girls); urine often hits perineum before reaching the cup. Catheterized specimenMost widely accepted technique for determining true UTIs.Some offices not set up to catheterize children. Urinalysis Provides information on leukocytes and nitrates (positive leukocytes and nitrites are highly predictive of infection), urine culture should be sent to assess colony count, pathogens present, appropriate antibiotic treatment. Suprapubic aspirateMost reliable. Rarely utilized because of anxiety associated with placing needle through abdominal wall and into bladder; can be threatening to child, parent/care provider. 464 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disordersb. Obstructions of urinary tract seen in 5-10%; 21-57% have vesico - ureteral reflux. If tests are negative, no additional evaluation necessary unless further problems arise (if continued febrile UTI, refer to pediatric urologist). If tests are positive, refer to pediatric urologist for evaluation, consultation, and treatment. 4. In case of significantly ill, febrile child, serum chemistries can identify elevation in creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), may implicate urinary tract. Complete blood count (CBC) with elevated white blood cell (WBC) count can indicate bacterial infection. F. Differential diagnosis (see Table 28-2). G. Treatment. 1. Goals: Prevent renal damage, urosepsis, recurrent infections. a. How goals are accomplished varies according to severity and age of patient. 2. Hospitalization should be considered for infants who appear systemically ill or are younger than 3 months of age. a. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin - rins and/or aminoglycosides can also used. If appropriate, oral therapy with cephalosporins, quinolones, TMP-SMX, or amoxicillin with clavulonic acid are also options. Therapy should last for 7-14 T able 28-2 Differential Diagnoses for Urinary Tract Infections UTIs Afebrile UTIs Obstructive and reflux uropathy, unspecified, and subcutaneous tissue, unspecified, N13.7Other specified inflammation of kidney and ureter, disorders of vulva and Urinary tract infection, site not specified, N39.0Enterobiasis, B80 Female pelvic inflammatory disease, unspecified, N73.9Hematuria, unspecified, R31.9 Sexually transmitted infections Disorder of calcium metabolism, unspecified, E83.50 Abbreviation: UTI, urinary tract infection. VIII. Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections 465days and is based on the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolated uropathogen. b. Some situations can be managed with outpatient therapy. Parenteral ceftriaxone if child is taking fluids well, parents are reli - able enough to contact provider if condition changes. Some older children can be managed as outpatients with cephalo - sporins, penicillins, sulfonamides. Antibiotic treatment is 7-14 days. Parent involvement is very important when managing patients outside hospital; provider must have confidence in family. c. Continue parenteral treatment until culture, sensitivity returns, and clinical picture is improving; then place child on appropriate oral antimicrobial. d. A successful empirical treatment protocol should be based on local epidemiology and susceptibility rates. e. Quinolones are approved for complicated pediatric UTI/pyelonephritis management, but there is still concern for the safety of use in children. Some clinical situations may warrant limited off-label use. f. Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) is not a good antimicrobial in a systemi - cally ill patient, does not attain high serum concentrations. 3. Lower tract or bladder infections are referred to as uncomplicated UTI. a. Children: 3- to 5-day course of oral antimicrobials. b. Nitrofurantoin: Good option, provides high urinary concentration (other agents used: Sulfonamides, cephalosporins, penicillins). c. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated when there is sufficient concern for recurrence of infection that may result in renal injury. Prophylaxis may be continued if vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract obstruction, immunosuppression, recurrent UTIs, or younger than 6 months of age. Nitrofurantoin: 1.2-2.4 mg/kg or TMP-SMX 2 mg/kg of trim - ethoprim daily are common choices. Cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) or ampicillin: 25% treatment dose daily. Nitrofurantoin: Do not use until older than 1 month of age. TMP-SMX: Do not use until older than 2 months of age. Both cephalexin (Keflex) and ampicillin can be used in newborns. d. Treatment must also include good oral intake of fluids, encouraging toilet-trained patient to void more frequently. e. If associated constipation, this must also be addressed. Alters normal voiding habits. Provides good medium for microbial growth. Bowel/bladder dysfunction (poor emptying of bowel and bladder) is hallmark of UTIs in toilet-trained patients.466 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disordersf. Educate parent in treatment of problem. Urination on timed schedule usually every 2 hours with techniques for relaxation of external urinary sphincter. Voiding to completion with each attempt is vital to preventing further infections. Have child sit comfortably on the toilet with legs widely separated and feet supported on a footstool if they do not reach the floor. Some children sit backward on the toilet. Stool softeners are often necessary while working on dietary mea - sures to prevent constipation. g. Perineal irritation. Scented soaps, bubble baths may irritate urethra, cause burning that results in disrupted urinary stream, poor emptying of bladder; discontinue in patients with recurrent UTIs. Covering perineum with barrier cream helps prevent burning caused from irritation, especially with incontinence associated with infection. Vulvovaginitis can be treated with baking soda sitz bath (3 table - spoons) in a shallow tub bath daily for 1 week. Educate to void with legs widely separated to prevent vaginal trapping of urine and associated perineal irritation. h. Circumcision may be considered if recurrent bacterial infection in infant males. H. Follow-up. 1. Follow-up culture to prove infection has resolved. 2. If X-ray evaluation is positive or if infections are recurrent: Urology con - sult, preferably with pediatric urology group. Specialist can do postvoid ultrasound/other treatments to help patient learn to empty more effectively, surgical correction of any structural abnormalities if necessary. 3. More thorough education of problems associated with infection will help family and provider. I. Complications. Disorder of kidney and ureter, unspecified, N28.9 Essential (primary) hypertension, I10 Other N30.20 Urge incontinence, N39.41 1. Serious risks, warrants effective management. a. Renal scarring, loss of renal function are most serious complications. VIII. Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections 467b. Hypertension can result from renal scaring. c. Chronic cystitis can result in poor functional use of bladder, some - times incontinence. J. Education. 1. Understand signs/symptoms of UTIs and need for treatment/evaluation. Early recognition of UTI may prevent sepsis. 2. Importance of daily antibiotic and/or stool softener (if prescribed); easy to forget to take medication. 3. Understand bowel/bladder dysfunction and its treatment, primarily need to empty bladder frequently to completion, to avoid constipation. 4. Follow-up critical in management of UTIs due to risk of renal sequelae. IX.

Microscopic hematuria found on health exam by dipstick urinalysis in 0.5-2% of school-age children. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. History important in determining diagnosis. a. Urinary frequency, fever, dysuria may indicate infection; most com - mon cause of blood in school-age child's urine. b. May describe recent trauma. c. Blood in other sites (i.e., sputum/stools) may indicate blood dyscrasia. 2. Family history: Familial diseases such as hypercalciuria, Alport syndrome, calculi, structural anomalies. 3. Hemolytic uremic syndrome, one of most common causes of acute renal failure in children: Preceded by gastroenteritis, bloody diarrhea. a.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis occurs 7-14 days after onset of strep infection. b. Winter months: Commonly associated with strep pharyngitis. c. Summer months: More likely to be skin infections. 5. When bleeding occurs, urine color is important. a. Brown/cola-colored urine: More likely from kidney. b. Red/pink urine: More likely from bladder. c. Red blood spotting at end of urinary stream/in underwear: Most likely from urethra. D. Physical findings. 1. Full-body exam to look for: a. Abdominal or renal mass. b. Presence of abdominal, CV A tenderness. 2. Check child's underwear for blood, perineum for signs of trauma. 3. Assess joints for edema, inflammation, tenderness. 4. Edema of face, hands, or feet. 5. Assess for signs of upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, or other illness. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Urinalysis may reveal infection or proteinuria. 2. Laboratory analysis: Formal urinalysis, culture if thought to be infection; ratio; urine protein/creatinine ratio. 3. bolic panel, anti-streptolysin enzyme (ASO) streptozyme, antinuclear antibody (ANA) and C3. IX. Hematuria 4694. Skin or throat cultures when appropriate. 5. Sickle cell screen in all African American patients. 6. Coagulation studies with history of bleeding from other sites. 7. Cystoscopy: Only if persistent gross hematuria. 8. Renal-bladder ultrasound. F. Differential diagnosis. Treatment. 1. Systemically ill child with gross hematuria: Admit while being evaluated. 2. If elevated ASO and low C3 (hypocomplementemia): Refer to nephrolo - gist to rule out/treat nephritis. 3. If abnormal ultrasound: Refer to urologist to determine presence of structural anomalies. 4. With UTIs: Refer to urologist and consider VCUG. 5. Abnormal ANA results, elevated ANA: Consult rheumatology, nephrol - ogy; commonly associated with positive crithidia/DNA (ds) antibody may indicate lupus erythematosus. 6. Other blood dyscrasias: Consult hematology. 7. hypertension, protein/creatinine ratio: Refer to nephrologist. Renal biopsy/cystoscopy may be necessary to diagnose. 8. Urethralgia: Hallmarked by blood at end of urinary stream or in underwear, can persist without negative consequence in child for years. Treatment is controversial: Some use antibiotics, but have not been proved effective. 9. If child develops hypertension or proteinuria: Refer to nephrologist. Renal biopsy may be indicated. 10. If chlamydia or gonorrhea is suspected: a. Y ounger than 9 of Erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day age: Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 250 mg intramuscular (IM) single dose followed by 7 days of doxycycline (Vibramycin, Periostat) 200 mg/day bid. c. Older than 15 years of age: Azithromycin (Zithromax) 1 g in 1 dose.470 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary DisordersH. Follow-up. 1. Determined by disease, usually done by appropriate specialist. 2. Urethralgia without significant symptoms and benign familial hematuria without proteinuria and hypertension: Monitor by checking urine and blood pressure every 6-12 months. I. Complications. Kidney failure, unspecified, N19 Other disorders of electrolyte and fluid balance, not elsewhere classified, E87.8 1. Renal failure. 2. Significant electrolyte imbalance. 3. Follow-up with specialist very important for children with these complications. J. Education. 1. Parents must understand importance of having studies done and follow up with specialists. 2. If medications prescribed, how and when to give and possible side effects. 3. Know signs/symptoms of progressive renal disease: Edema, hypertension, increasing blood in urine, proteinuria, UTI, lethargy, pallor. X.

Etiology. 1. Renal insufficiency often associated with proteinuria. 2. Diagnosed by random urinalysis on well-child checkup or associated with serious illness. 3. Common causes of proteinuria include chronic pyelonephritis, renal scarring, febrile illness, glomerulonephritis, exercise induced, idiopathic, orthostatic, polycystic kidney disease, acute tubular necrosis, cold exposure, X. Proteinuria 471congestive heart disease, obstructive uropathy, pregnancy, drug induced, trauma. B. Occurrence. 1. Positive screening by dipstick: Approximately 10% of 8- to 15-year-olds. a. Dipstick finding considered positive if it is 1 + (30 mg/dL). False posi - tives can occur with concentrated urine specimens; if specific gravity is 1.015, dipstick finding for protein needs to be higher than 2 +. 2. If in doubt, look for other symptoms: Hypertension, edema, hematuria. 3. Always best to confirm lower range and asymptomatic results by rechecking/confirming by protein-to-calcium ratio. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Varies with diagnosis. 2. Glomerulonephritis presents with hematuria and proteinuria. a. Decreased glomerular filtration rate can result in sodium and water retention, oliguria, circulatory overload, edema, hypertension. b. Chronic glomerulonephritis results in failure to thrive, slow growth, fatigue. 3. Postural or orthostatic proteinuria: Usually discovered on well-child check. a. Usually older than 8 years of age and totally asymptomatic. b. Exercise-induced proteinuria is seen after vigorous exercise, resolves with 48 hours rest. c. Febrile proteinuria resolves as temperature returns to normal. 4. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein nephritis (a systemic vasculitis) presents with abdominal cramping, purpuric rash, joint pain. a. Bloody diarrhea occurs in 50% of patients. b. Hemolytic uremic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus can also present with purpura, inflammatory bowel. c. Known history of renal disease or strong family history of renal compromise. D. Physical findings. 1. Urinalysis shows proteinuria ranging from trace to 4 +, microscopic/gross hematuria. 2.

Patient complains of joint pain, stiffness. Joints swollen, inflamed on exam. 6. Complaints of dysuria or frequency: Signs of infection, CV A tenderness, flank pain may indicate obstruction or pyelonephritis. E. Diagnostic tests. 1. In nonacute setting: Obtain protein-to-creatinine ratio. a. If > 0.2, repeat; if still elevated, obtain 12- or 24-hour urine.472 CHAPTER 28 Genitourinary Disordersb. Supine and upright collection to rule out orthostatic pro - teinuria. Nonpathologic proteinuria associated with posture, fever, or exercise usually yields results < 1 g/24 hours. c. Renal-bladder ultrasound (additional radiographic evaluation if ultrasound abnormal). 2. Pathologic proteinuria results from glomerular, tubular disorders of kidney. a. Protein-to-creatinine ratio is > 0.2; 24-hour urine results are = 3 g of protein in 24 hours. b. Renal ultrasound can show infectious or obstructive nephropathy. c. Complete metabolic panel, CBC with differential and platelets, ASO, C3, ANA help sort out the immunologic from the nephrologic causes. d. Throat and/or skin cultures can identify post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. F. Differential diagnosis. 1. See Etiology . G. Treatment. 1. Treatment is dependent on type and severity of proteinuria; obstructive uropathy can be repaired surgically. 2. Infectious uropathy: Treat with antibiotics. 3. Associated hypertension: May need short- or long-term treatment. 4. Urgent nephrology referral with edema and hypertension. 5. Systemically ill patients require hospitalization to determine cause. 6. If creatinine-to-protein ratio is > 0.2, refer to nephrology for further evaluation. H. Follow-up. 1. Follow-up may be lifelong depending on cause. 2. Recheck asymptomatic proteinuria annually by dipstick analysis and blood pressure: If either is abnormal, referral or additional evaluation needed. I. Complications.

Etiology. 1. Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses and include 100 types; 40 types can infect genital tract. 2. Types 16 and 18 are associated with cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, orpharyngeal cancers. Can be divided into high-risk and low-risk types based on risk of cancer. High-risk types include 16, 18, 52, 56. B. Occurrence. 1. CDC estimates that majority of STIs are caused by HPV . 2. HPV causes most types of cervical cancer, as well as some cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, and oropharynx. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. May have no symptoms. 2. When present, warts are epithelial tumors of skin/mucous membrane. Can appear on penis, groin, vulva, perineum, perinanal or suprapubic skin. 3. Immunocompromised individuals may have larger quantity of warts. 4. Incubation unknown; likely ranges from 3 months to several years. 5. May regress spontaneously or may persist for years. Estimated that one-third of anogenital warts regress without treatment in 4 months. D. Physical findings. 1. Skin-colored lesions with cauliflower-like surface may be several milli - meters to several centimeters wide; may be painless or itch, burn, bleed; can be found on vagina, cervix, vulva, penis, anus, perianal area, scrotum. May be one or more fleshy warts, papules, or plaques in anogenital area. V. Genital Warts 485E. Diagnostic tests. 1. In conjunction with a Pap test or for abnormal cervical cytology results, HPV tests are available to detect viral nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) or capsid protein. 2. Nononcogenic testing is not recommended by the CDC. Several tests are available for use in the United States: a. Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test (Qiagen). d. Cobas Aptima HR HPV (Gen Probe). f. Cervista HPV High-Risk DNA test (Hologics). a. acid prevention. Surgery. Cryoablation. Excision. H. Follow-up. 1. Females: Regular Pap smears to assess for cellular damage at cervix. 2. Males: Annual check-ups to assess genitalia. I. Complications. 1. Recurrences common due to reactivation of virus. May persist for life. Duration of contagiousness unknown. 2. Local treatment can damage normal surrounding skin.486 CHAPTER 29 Gynecologic DisordersJ. Education. 1. Females should have regular Pap smears. 2. Screen for STIs in both females and males. 3. Partners should be informed. 4. Teach safer sex and limit number of partners. K. Vaccinations. 1. Gardasil (quadrivalent) vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. 2. Gardasil 9 (9-valent) targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. 3. Cervarix (bivalent) vaccine targets HPV types 16 and 18. 4. These vaccines are prophylactic and designed to prevent initial HPV infection. These vaccines protect against 70% of cancers and Gardasil offers protection against 90% of genital warts. In United States, only the 9-valent vaccine is available. 5. Either vaccine can be administered to adolescents age 11-12 years and as young as age 9. They can also be administered to individuals age 12-26 who have not started or completed the vaccine. It is most beneficial if given before onset of sexual activity. Gardasil can be used in individuals aged 9-26 to prevent genital warts. Gardasil is given in a two-dose series 6 months apart for both males and females. Cervarix is administered in a 3-series injection schedule over a 6-month period. After injection 1 is given, the second is given 1-2 months later, the third at 6 months after the first injection. Women should still receive routine cervical cancer screening after receiving the vaccine. 6. Recommended immunization schedules: a. Individuals initiating vaccine before age of 15: 2 doses of HPV vaccine, should be given at 0 and at 6-12 months. b. Individuals initiating the vaccine series at age 15 or older: 3 doses of HPV vaccine should be given at 0, 1-2, and 6 months. VI. GONORRHEA Gonococcal Occurrence. 1.

Referral to endocrinologist. 2. Regulate menses with oral contraceptive. Oral contraceptives such ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate menses, help with hirsutism, reduce acne, increase bone density, reduce follicular activity, and reduce ovarian and endometrial cancer risk. Oral contraceptives act by suppressing plasma androgens and inhibit ovarian function. If the patient cannot tolerate oral contraceptives, the next therapy would be medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera) for irregular menses. 3. Stabilize or reduce body weight/manage lifestyle changes. 4. Spironolactone (Aldactone) in daily doses of 50-2000 mg orally. Acts by binding at sites of androgen receptors and inhibiting testosterone biosynthesis. 5. Cosmetic treatment for unwanted hair: Either laser or electrolysis. 6. Acne treated with clindamycin (Cleocin) or other antibacterial medica - tions as indicated. 7. Insulin resistance may be treated with metformin (Glucophage). 8.

Lifestyle modification such as diet and exercise for obesity. 3. Advise exercise for 60 minutes daily. I. Complications. Endometrial hyperplasia, N85.0 Essential (primary) syndrome, E88.81 A. Definition: Metabolic syndrome, also known as insulin resistance syndrome, Syndrome X, and dysmetabolic syndrome, represents a collection of risk factors that may lead to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. 1. The cardiometabolic risk factors include hyperglycemia, increased cen - tral adiposity, elevated triglycerides, decreased high density lipoprotein, elevated cholesterol, elevated blood pressure. 2. The clustering of these risk factors is seen in children, adolescents, and young adults as well as adults. B. Etiology. 1. Metabolic syndrome starts with obesity/BMI above the 95th percentile for age and sex with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means the body does not use insulin efficiently to lower glucose and triglyceride levels. Insulin resistance is a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. 2. The lifestyle factors include diet, physical activity, obesity; in some cases, interrupted sleep patterns such as sleep apnea may add to syndrome. 3. Growing evidence suggests metabolic syndrome originates from early lifestyles such as obesity in childhood; diet high in meats/processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, junk foods, low-fiber foods, refined cereals, sweets, processed and ultraprocessed foods, which have high amounts of saturated fatty acids, simple carbohydrates, fructose, sodium and low amounts of micronutrients; physical inactivity. 4. Excessive weight gain and physical inactivity are major contributors to the metabolic syndrome. 5. Consistently high levels of glucose and insulin over time are linked to multiple body changes: a. Damage to lining of coronary and other arteries leading to heart disease and stroke. b. Changes in kidney function/ability to remove salt, leading to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke with aging.520 CHAPTER 30 Endocrine Disordersc. Increase in triglyceride/lipid levels, which will result in increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. d. Increased risk of clot formation, which can result in blocked arteries and strokes. e. Slowing of insulin production leading to type 2 diabetes and resultant health problems. C. Occurrence. 1. Metabolic syndrome is more common in blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. 2. In one national health survey more than one in five Americans has meta - bolic syndrome. 3. Pediatric prevalence worldwide has been reported to be 3-4% and increas - ing in developing countries. D. Clinical manifeststions. 1. Obesity above 95th percentile for age and sex. 2. Elevated triglyceride levels. 3. High LDH (low-density hyperprotein). 4. Elevated blood pressure (BP) with resting BP 130/85 or higher. 5. Impaired fasting glucose 100 mg/dL or higher. 6. Increased waist circumference (accumulation of visceral fat). E. Physical findings. 1. Acanthosis nigricans. 2. Increased waist circumference (accumulation of visceral fat). 3. Obesity above 95th percentile for age and sex. 4. Elevated BP . 5. Hepatomegaly. F. Diagnostics tests. 1. Body mass index. 2. C-reactive protein, if elevated is recognized as a proinflammatory state. 3. Triglyceride levels. 4. Reduced high-density lipoprotein levels. 5. Fasting glucose concentration. G. Differential diagnosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome, E28.2 Type 2 diabetes mellitus, E11 syndrome. 2. Type 2 diabetes. VIII. Metabolic Syndrome 521H. Treatment. 1. Treatment and education involve lifestyle changes and behavioral modi - fication aimed at reducing obesity. a. Reduce weight: Even moderate amount of weight loss will help body recognize insulin. This can be done with diet and exercise; in some cases, consider weight-loss medications. b. Exercise: Aerobic exercise, such as a brisk 30-minute walk daily, can help with weight and improve blood pressure. c. Dietary changes: Carbohydrates should be no more than 50% of total calories. Increase fiber in diet by eating beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Use healthy fats such as canola oil, olive oil, flaxseed oil. d. Management of obesity in children is first-line approach to reducing cardiometabolic risks in adulthood. BIBLIOGRAPHY Akbarzadeh Z, Nouria M, Hovsepian S, Kelishadi R.

INJURIES: SPRAIN, STRAIN, OVERUSE Dislocation, sprain and strain of unspecified body region, T14.3 Injury, unspecified, T14.90 Other injury of unspecified body region, T14.8 Sprain and strain of ankle, S93.4Sprain and strain of wrist, S63.5Sprain of anterior cruciate ligament of knee, S83.51Sprain of lateral collateral ligament of knee, S83.42 Sprain of medial collateral ligament of knee, posterior cruciate ligament of knee, S83.52 Sprain of unspecified part of unspecified wrist and hand, initial encounter, S63.90XA A. Etiology. 1. Damage or disruption to tendon (attaches muscle to bone), ligament (attaches bone to bone) from overstretching, exertion, repetitive applica - tion of excessive forces. B. Occurrence. 1. Wrist, finger, ankle sprains are common among children. 2. Knee injuries are common in adolescents. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Limp or pain with extremity or joint use. 2. Patient felt tearing or heard a \"pop\" during activity or with trauma. D. Physical findings. 1. Pain, tenderness to palpation, swelling, discoloration (ecchymosis or erythema). E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Radiograph in two planes to ensure no fracture and to assess bony relation - ships. May need views of unaffected side to compare ossification centers and normal alignment. 525CHAPTER 312. Physical exam: Stress joints to varus, valgus, anterior, posterior (AP). If a \"give\" is felt (e.g., at a knee or ankle joint \"opening up\"), refer patient to orthopedist. Palpation over physis should be pain free. Check joints above and below injury. F. Differential diagnosis. Dislocation, sprain and strain of unspecified body region, T14.3 Injury, unspecified, T14.90Other injury of unspecified body region, T14.8 Other symptoms and signs involving the nervous system, R29.818 1. Fracture, dislocation, ligament tears, neurologic deficit, vascular condition. G. Treatment. 1. Protect, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation (PRICE) and medication for pain as needed: a. Protect: With splint/brace or relief of weight bearing with crutches. b. Rest: Do not use extremity. c. Ice: Apply ice immediately for 10-20 minutes, then every 3- 4 hours for the first 24- 48 hours. d. Compression: With ACE wrap; do not pull tightly when wrapping; compression will decrease amount of blood allowed to seep from injured tissues and decrease range of motion at joint. e. Elevation: Above level of heart will decrease swelling accumulating from gravity. f. Identify and alter factors that contributed to overuse. g. May continue to do activities that do not cause pain. h. Pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen; narcotics should not be needed. H. Follow-up. 1. Return in 1 week to ensure resolution of majority of pain, swelling, and return of function. Repeat exam including stressing the joints above and below injury in varus, valgus, anterior and posterior. 2. Pain and swelling after 2 weeks requires further workup. I. Complications. Multiple injuries, unspecified, T07 Other early complications of trauma, initial encounter, T79.8XXA 1. Missed fracture. 2. Caution : Salter fractures (through the growth plate) may not be visible on X-ray; if physis is tender, treat as fracture ( Figure 31-1).526 CHAPTER 31 Musculoskeletal Disorders3. Compartment syndrome. 4. Skin breakdown (presents as burning sensation under brace or splint; results from ischemia of tissue; pressure should be relieved immediately). J. Education. 1. Teach family to call immediately for any burning or worsening of pain, neurovascular changes such as paresthesias (numbness or tingling), pallor, paralysis, pulselessness\u2014these 5 Ps are signs of compartment syndrome. If cyanosis occurs, call healthcare provider immediately. a. Compartment syndrome is accumulation of pressure in tissues not relieved with elevation. b. Most important: Worsening pain and tightness. c. Considered a surgical emergency . d. Most common areas: Calves/shins, forearms, hands, feet.Figure 31-1 Salter I fracture.

INJURIES: FRACTURE, DISLOCATION Dislocation, sprain and strain of unspecified body region, T14.3 Erythematous condition, unspecified, L53.9Other disorder of circulatory system, I99.8 Other injury of unspecified body region, T14.8 A. Etiology. 1. Damage/disruption to bone or joint, respectively, from trauma, exertion, overuse. 2. Most common causes: Child abuse and neglect, sports, falls, motor vehicle or pedestrian/bicycle events. B. Occurrence. 1. All age groups can be affected. 2. Fractures are most common presentation of child abuse; 70% of fractures in children younger than age 6 months are inflicted. 3. Fractures suggestive of nonaccidental trauma in children: Metaphyseal, rib (seen (midshaft ulna), vertebral or nonambulat - ing child, humerus (except supracondylar) in those younger than 3 years of age, bilateral/multiple fractures in different stages of healing, as well as complex skull fractures. C. Clinical manifestations. 1. Patient felt tearing or heard \"pop\" or \"crack. \" 2. Most affect function. 3. Findings suspect for abuse: a. Fracture in child younger than 1 year of age. b. Unknown or unwitnessed injury. c. Delay in seeking medical attention. d. Changing story of how injury occurred. e. Fracture does not fit mechanism described (e.g., twisting an extremity will result in spiral fracture, whereas direct blow produces transverse fracture). D. Physical findings. 1. Pain, point tenderness, swelling, ecchymosis or erythema, loss of func - tion, obvious deformity.528 CHAPTER 31 Musculoskeletal DisordersE. Diagnostic tests. 1. Radiographs in two planes: AP and lateral or both obliques. 2. May require computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for complex injuries (i.e., pelvis or spine). 3. Skeletal series if child abuse is suspected. F. Differential diagnosis. Injury, unspecified, T14.90 Osteogenesis imperfecta, Q78.0Sprain, S03-93 G. Treatment. 1. Protect with immobilization/splinting, compression, ice, elevation. 2. Do not use extremity. 3. Pain medication (typically narcotic) such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) with codeine at 1 mg/kg of body weight every 4-6 hours for small children or hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (Percocet), or morphine by weight for those > 100 pounds. 4. Dislocation and displaced fractures refer immediately to orthopedist. Oral medication should not be used if surgical intervention is an imminent possibility. H. Follow-up. 1. Should be per orthopedist. Note that fracture healing is rapid in these patients; cannot wait for an appointment a week out. 2. Many will not allow use of extremity for a period of time while healing. 3. Muscles will spasm around fracture to try to pull bone ends together for healing. 4. Fractures without fixation move for 10-14 days after injury while granula - tion occurs (even in casts). This is painful. 5. Frequent X-rays may be needed to ensure alignment of fractures. 6. In 2-6 weeks: Callus develops, bone ends become \"sticky, \" pain is reduced. 7. Consolidation begins at 3 weeks in infants, may take 3-6 months in older children, adults. 8. Weight bearing, casting, splinting, bracing, or full use are all related to fracture configuration, healing, patient specifics. 9. Remodeling of bone that occurs in children younger than 8 years of age allows acceptance of angulated fractures. 10. Increased circulation to fractured bone causes some overgrowth (basis for 1-cm overlap of fractured femurs in young children). II. Injuries: Fracture, Dislocation 529I. Complications.

Exhibit 32-1 Ohio Department of Health Concussion Information Sheet Ohio Department of Health Concussion Information Sheet For Youth Sports Organizations Dear Parent/Guardian and Athletes, This information sheet is provided to assist you and your child in recognizing the signs and symptoms of a concussion. Every athlete is different and responds to a brain injury differently, so seek medical attention if you suspect your child has a concussion. Once a concussion occurs, it is very important your athlete return to normal activities slowly, so he/she does not do more damage to his/her brain. What is a Concussion? A concussion is an injury to the brain that may be caused by a blow, bump, or jolt to the head. Concussions may also happen after a fall or hit that jars the brain. A blow elsewhere on the body can cause a concussion even if an athlete does not hit his/ her head directly. Concussions can range from mild to severe, and athletes can get a concussion even if they are wearing a helmet. Signs and Symptoms of a Concussion Athletes do not have to be \"knocked out\" to have a concussion. In fact, less than 1 out of 10 concussions result in loss of consciousness. Concussion symptoms can develop right away or up to 48 hours after the injury. Ignoring any signs or symptoms of a concussion puts your child's health at risk! Signs Observed by Parents of Guardians Appears dazed or stunned. Is confused about assignment or position. Forgets plays. (continues ) IV. Concussion 575 Is unsure of game, score, or opponent. Moves clumsily. Answers questions slowly. Loses consciousness (even briefly). Shows behavior or personality changes (irritability, sadness, nervousness, feeling more emotional). Can't recall events before or after hit or fall. Symptoms Reported by Athlete Any headache or \"pressure\" in head. (How badly it hurts does not matter.) Nausea or vomiting. Balance problems or dizziness. Double or blurry vision. Sensitivity to light and/or noise Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy. Concentration or memory problems. Confusion. Does not \"feel right.\" Trouble falling asleep. Sleeping more or less than usual. Be Honest Encourage your athlete to be honest with you, his/her coach, and your healthcare provider about his/her symptoms. Many young athletes get caught up in the moment and/ or feel pressured to return to sports before they are ready. It is better to miss one game than the entire season... or risk permanent damage! Seek Medical Attention Right Away Seeking medical attention is an important first step if you suspect or are told your child has a concussion. A qualified healthcare professional will be able to determine how serious the concussion is and when it is safe for your child to return to sports and other daily activities. No athlete should return to activity on the same day he/she gets a concussion. Athletes should NEVER return to practices/games if they still have ANY symptoms. Parents and coaches should never pressure any athlete to return to play. The Dangers of Returning Too Soon Returning to play too early may cause Second Impact Syndrome (SIS) or Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). SIS occurs when a second blow to the head happens before an athlete has completely recovered from a concussion. This second impact causes the brain to swell, possibly resulting in brain damage, paralysis, and even death. PCS can occur after a second impact. PCS can result in permanent, long-term concussion symptoms. The risk of SIS and PCS is the reason why no athlete should be allowed to participate in any physical activity before they are cleared by a qualified healthcare professional.Exhibit 32-1 Ohio Department of Health Concussion Information Sheet ( continued )576 CHAPTER 32 Neurologic DisordersRecovery A concussion can affect school, work, and sports. Along with coaches and teachers, the school nurse, athletic trainer, employer, and other school administrators should be aware of the athlete's injury and their roles in helping the child recover. During the recovery time after a concussion, physical and mental rest are required. A concussion upsets the way the brain normally works and causes it to work longer and harder to complete even simple tasks. Activities that require concentration and focus may make symptoms worse and cause the brain to heal slower. Studies show that children's brains take several weeks to heal following a concussion. Returning to Daily Activities 1. Be sure your child gets plenty of rest and enough sleep at night\u2014no late nights. Keep the same bedtime weekdays and weekends. 2. Encourage daytime naps or rest breaks when your child feels tired or worn out. 3. Limit your child's activities that require a lot of thinking or concentration (including social activities, homework, video games, texting, computer, driving, job-related activities, movies, parties). These activities can slow the brain's recovery. 4. Limit your child's physical activity, especially those activities where another injury or blow to the head may occur. 5. Have your qualified healthcare professional check your child's symptoms at different times to help guide recovery. Returning to Learn (School) 1. Your athlete may need to initially return to school on a limited basis, for example for only half-days, at first. This should be done under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. 2. Inform teacher(s), school counselor, or administrator(s) about the injury and symptoms. School personnel should be instructed to watch for: a. Increased problems paying attention. b. Increased problems remembering or learning new information. c. Longer time needed to complete tasks or assignments. d. Greater irritability and decreased ability to cope with stress. e. Symptoms worsen (headache, tiredness) when doing schoolwork. 3. Be sure your child takes multiple breaks during study time and watch for worsening of symptoms. 4. If your child is still having concussion symptoms, he/she may need extra help with school-related activities. As the symptoms decrease during recovery, the extra help or supports can be removed gradually. 5. For more information, please refer to Return to Learn at http://www.healthy.ohio.gov /vipp/concussion.aspx Returning to Play 1. Returning to play is specific for each person, depending on the sport. Starting 4/26/13, Ohio law requires written permission from a healthcare provider before an athlete can return to play . Follow instructions and guidance provided by a healthcare professional. Exhibit 32-1 Ohio Department of Health Concussion Information Sheet ( continued ) (continues ) IV. Concussion 577It is important that you, your child, and your child's coach follow these instructions carefully. 2. Your child should NEVER return to play if he/she still has ANY symptoms. (Be sure that your child does not have any symptoms at rest and while doing any physical activity and/or activities that require a lot of thinking or concentration.) 3. Ohio law prohibits your child, from returning to a game or practice on the same day he/ she was removed. 4. Be sure that the athletic trainer, coach, and physical education teacher are aware of your child's injury and symptoms. 5. Your athlete should complete a step-by-step exercise-based progression, under the direction of a qualified healthcare professional. 6. A sample activity progression is listed below. Generally, each step should take no less than 24 hours so that your child's full recovery would take about one week once they have no symptoms at rest and with moderate exercise.* Sample Activity Progression* Step 1 : Low levels of noncontact physical activity, provided NO SYMPTOMS return during or after activity. (Examples: walking, light jogging, and easy stationary biking for 20-30 minutes). Step 2 : Moderate, noncontact physical activity, provided NO SYMPTOMS return during or after activity. (Examples: moderate jogging, brief sprint running, moderate stationary biking, light calisthenics, and sport-specific drills without contact or collisions for 30-45 minutes). Step 3 : Heavy, noncontact physical activity, provided NO SYMPTOMS return during or after activity. (Examples: extensive sprint running, high-intensity stationary biking, resistance exercise with machines and free weights, more intense noncontact sports- specific drills, agility training, and jumping drills for 45-60 minutes). Step 4 : Full contact in controlled practice or scrimmage. Step 5 : Full contact in game play.

Neurologists from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) are doctors who identify and treat diseases of the brain and nervous system. The following evidence-based information* is provided by experts who carefully reviewed all available scientific studies on the evaluation and management of sports concussion in athletes. This information updates the findings of the 1997 AAN guideline on this topic. Concussion is a serious health issue for all athletes, regardless of age, gender, and type or level of sport played. Injured athletes need clinical evaluation to make sure that they are not at risk for health problems. WHAT IS A CONCUSSION? A concussion is a type of brain injury. It can happen when the head hits an object or a moving object strikes the head. It also can happen when the head experiences a sudden force without being hit directly. Each year, 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions result from sports injuries in the United States. Almost nine percent of all U.S. high school sports injuries involve concussions. Most concussions result in full recovery. However, some can lead to more severe injuries. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CONCUSSION? Concussion signs are things you can observe about the athlete. These include: Behavior or personality changes Blank stare, dazed look Changes to balance, coordination, reaction time Delayed or slowed spoken or physical responses Disorientation (confused about time, date, location, game) Loss of consciousness/blackout (occurs in less than 10 percent of cases) Memory loss of event before, during, or after injury occured Slurred/unclear speech Trouble controlling emotions Vomiting Concussion symptoms are things the athlete tells you are happening. These include: Blurry vision/double vision Confusion Dizziness Feeling hazy, foggy, or groggy (continues ) IV. Concussion 579Exhibit 32-2 Recognizing and Managing a Sports Concussion ( continued ) Feeling very drowsy, having sleep problems Headache Inability to focus, concentrate Nausea (stomach upset) Not feeling right Sensitivity to light or sound WHO IS AT RISK FOR CONCUSSION? HOW CAN I KNOW IF MY TEAM MEMBERS ARE AT RISK? Concussions can occur in many sports. Concussions are common in high-speed contact sports. The studies examined here looked at concussion risk in several sports. Strong evidence shows: Football, rugby, hockey, and soccer pose the greatest risk Baseball, softball, volleyball, and gymnastics involve the lowest risk The studies also examined concussion risk by: Gender Equipment used Previous concussion(s) Age and level of sport Position played In terms of gender, the studies suggest that risk varies from sport to sport. Some studies compared concussion risks for males and females by sport. There is strong evidence that concussion risk in soccer and basketball is greater for females than for males. For other sports, there is not enough evidence to show any clear differences in risk by gender. For headgear, there is moderate evidence that its use in rugby can lower concussion risk. Headgear should be well fitted, well designed, and well maintained. Use of football helmets to protect against concussion has not been studied. But given the evidence for headgear use in other sports, one can assume football helmets also are helpful. Mouth guards often are used to prevent dental injuries. However, there is not enough evidence to show if mouth guards help prevent concussions. In addition, there is not enough evidence to show: That one type of football helmet gives more protection than another That headgear use in soccer or basketball protects against concussion For athletes who have had a concussion before, there is strong evidence of greater risk for another one. Moderate evidence shows the risk for another concussion may be greatest within 10 days after a first one. There is not enough evidence to show if risk varies by age, level of sport played, or position played.580 CHAPTER 32 Neurologic DisordersExhibit 32-2 Recognizing and Managing a Sports Concussion ( continued ) WHAT SHOULD I DO IF A TEAM MEMBER HAS A HEAD INJURY DURING A GAME? If you suspect an athlete may have a concussion, remove the athlete from play immediately. This will reduce risk of further injury. Moderate evidence shows that checklists and screening tests can help with diagnosing concussions. Where available, athletic trainers working with athletes should become familiar with such tests. These include: Balance assessment tests Brief mental status exams Symptom checklists The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) Training in proper use of these tests is important to obtain accurate information. Results should be shared with the athlete's licensed healthcare professional. Test results should not be the only information used to diagnose or rule out a concussion. A concussion diagnosis should be based on a clinical exam and health history. No single test score can be the basis of a concussion diagnosis. Note that some tools have not been standardized for use in preteen children or younger. The injured athlete should be evaluated by a licensed healthcare professional. This person should be trained in diagnosing and managing concussion. The person also should be skilled in recognizing more severe brain injury. A TEAM MEMBER HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A CONCUSSION. WHEN CAN THIS ATHLETE RETURN TO PLAY/PRACTICE? If an athlete is diagnosed with a concussion, two things are required before he or she returns to play: All symptoms should have cleared up. In addition, the athlete should not rely on medica - tion to treat lingering symptoms. These include symptoms such as headache, which might be masked by medication. The athlete should be free of symptoms even after stop - ping medication. The athlete should be approved for play by a licensed healthcare professional trained in diagnosing and managing concussion. The athlete should be returned to play slowly. Weak evidence suggests a step-by- step plan of return to activity might be helpful. The plan should exclude any activities that worsen symptoms or put the athlete at risk of another concussion. A licensed healthcare professional trained in concussion should design this to fit the athlete's needs. There is no set timeline for recovery or return to play. There also is no evidence for absolute rest after a concussion. However, high school athletes or younger should be managed more (continues ) IV.

Therefore, these younger athletes take longer to safely recover than older athletes. For injured athletes with continued symptoms, moderate to strong evidence shows ongoing thinking problems and slowed reaction times can persist. Weak evidence shows that athletes with ongoing symptoms may be risking further injury\u2014and longer recovery time\u2014 if they try to participate in sports before symptoms have completely cleared. All athletes might benefit from counseling on long-term health risks.

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common anemia of childhood. Anemia is defined as reduction in red blood cell (RBC) mass or in hemoglobin concentration to a level that is > 2 standard deviations below mean in healthy children. Can be deter - mined in primary care setting by physical examination, important aspects of history, and hemoglobin concentration. Screening should occur routinely around age 9 months to 1 year. High-risk infants: Screen earlier, more often. B. Etiology. 1. Microcytic anemia reflecting defect in production of hemoglobin during erythrocyte maturation, resulting from defect in heme synthesis due to inadequate quantities of iron: a. Inadequate supply of iron at birth, inadequate dietary iron. b. High demand for iron associated with growth. c. Blood loss without replacement. d. Impaired absorption associated with diagnoses such as inflammatory bowel disease. e. Menstruation, early onset, irregular or prolonged flow patterns. C. Occurrence. 1. Common between 1 and 3 years of age because of inadequate dietary iron due to cow's milk being major staple in most children's diets. 607CHAPTER 332. Lack of adequate iron stores to meet needs for growth. a. Affects 7% of children < 2 years of age. b. Affects 9-16% of adolescent females. 3. Lack of adequate iron to meet needs for RBC production. a. Affects 3% of children < 2 years of age. b. Affects up to 3% of adolescent females and < 1% of adolescent males. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Mild anemia (hemoglobin of 9.5-11): May be asymptomatic; sometimes only minimal symptoms when severe anemia (hemoglobin of 8-9.5) is present. May only be detected on routine screening or discovered when blood count ordered for another reason. 2. History of fatigue, irritability, excessive milk intake, headaches. E. Physical findings. 1. Mild anemia (normal physical exam). 2. More severe anemia. a. Poor weight gain. b. Sclera or palmar pallor. c. Splenomegaly: 15% of affected children. d. Tachycardia. e. Systolic flow murmurs: With progression of the iron deficit. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Hemoglobin concentration ( Table 33-1). 2. Complete blood count (CBC). a. RBC hypochromic, microcytic. b. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) decreased. c. Ratio of MCV/RBC > 13 (Mentzer index). > 13 = IDA. < 13 = thalassemia trait. 3. Iron studies if need further information. a. Serum iron: Decreased. b.

Do not give with milk or milk products such as pudding, yogurt, cheese (inhibits absorption of iron). c. Give with straw or brush teeth after giving (may stain teeth). d. May cause abdominal discomfort, constipation, black stools. e. Extremely poisonous if taken in excessive amounts. f. Keep out of reach of small children. I. Iron-Deficiency Anemia 611M. When to refer. 1. If no improvement within 1 month of confirmed administration of medi - cations, consider further testing at specialty center. 2. Refer if Hgb < 5 g/dL and there is clinical evidence of distress (heart rate > 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute, lethargy, and/or not feeding well). 3. When newborn screening (NBS) is abnormal. 4. If stool is positive for guiac on three separate occasions and iron has been withheld for at least 1 week, as iron can cause microscopic GI bleeds. II. THALASSEMIA Thalassemia, D56 A. An inherited anemia that can affect both males and females and can be mild or severe. Hemoglobin has two types of protein chains, alpha globin and beta globin, which are needed to properly form the RBC and allow it to then carry enough oxygen. Therefore, one can have either an alpha thalassemia or a beta thalassemia. It occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African descent. Severe form is diagnosed on NBS that is done in all states in the United States and is a lifelong condition. Referral from the National Newborn Screening and Global Resource Center will be to primary care provider on record. Primary care provider must then refer to thalassemia treatment center for family education and genetic counseling. B. Etiology. 1. Alpha thalassemia: Need four genes (two from each parent) to make enough alpha protein chains, located on chromosome 16. Alpha thalassemia is often seen as abnormal NBS with positive Bart's hemoglobin present. a. Mild anemia. One missing gene: Silent carrier, no symptoms but may be microcytic. Two missing genes: Carrier and mild anemia and microcytosis. b. Moderate to severe anemia. Three missing genes: Hemoglobin H disease. Four missing genes: Alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. 2. Beta thalassemia: Need two genes (one from each parent) to make enough beta globin protein\u2014located on chromosome 11. a. Mild anemia. One missing or altered gene: Carrier status with microcytosis.612 CHAPTER 33 Hematologic Disordersb. Moderate or severe anemia. Two missing or altered genes. Beta thalassemia intermedia: Moderate anemia. Beta thalassemia major: Cooley's anemia, severe, often blood product dependent. C. Occurrence. 1. Family history and ancestry are the two risk factors. a. Alpha thalassemias most often affect ancestry origin of Indian, Chinese, Filipino, or Southeast Asian. b. Beta thalassemias most often affect ancestry origin of Mediterranean (Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern), Asian, or African. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. No symptoms if a silent carrier, as in alpha thalassemia. 2. May or may not have symptoms with mild anemia: Usually fatigue\u2014most often mistaken for IDA. 3. More severe symptoms with moderate anemia that may include slowed growth and development, physical problems with bones, splenomegaly. 4. Symptoms of severe anemia due to thalassemias occur during the first 2 years of life and include other serious health problems besides the severe anemia. E. Physical findings. 1. Mild anemia: Normal physical exam. 2. More severe anemia: a. Pale and listless appearance. b. Poor appetite. c. Dark urine. d. Jaundice. e. Enlarged spleen, liver, and heart. f. Bone problems, especially the bones of the face. g. Delayed puberty. h. Slowed growth. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. CBC with differential. 2. Iron tests: To rule out IDA. 3. Hemoglobin electrophoresis testing. 4. Genetic studies: Alpha or beta globin gene analysis. G. Differential diagnosis. 1. IDA: May have both IDA and thalassemia, especially in toddlers, so you must correct the iron deficiency before further testing for thalassemia. 2. Other anemias. II. Thalassemia 613H. Treatment. 1. Mild forms need no treatment, but education and genetic counseling for family helps decrease unnecessary iron supplements throughout life. 2. Moderate to severe forms. a. Regular blood transfusions: Normal RBCs live 120 days, but transfused RBCs live only 30 or so days, so may need transfusions for severe anemia every 2 to 4 weeks. b. Iron chelation therapy: Transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the blood. Deferasirox (Jadenu): Pill taken once a day; side effects include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, fatigue. Deferoxamine (Desferal): Liquid given slowly under the skin with a pump; takes time and is often painful. Side effects include loss of vision and hearing. c. Folic acid supplements for reticulocyte count > 3%: B vitamin that helps build healthy RBCs. d. Bone marrow/stem cell transplant: Only cure for thalassemia. I. Follow-up. 1. Well-child physical as indicated. 2. Vaccines as scheduled. 3. Follow with hematology providers on routine basis. J. Complications. 1. Heart disease: Caused by iron overload from the transfusions. 2. Heart attack. 3. Arrhythmias. 4. Heart failure. 5. Liver disease: Also caused by iron overload and damage to the organ. 6. Infection: Risk of infection higher in persons whose spleen has been removed. 7. Osteoporosis. K. Education. 1. Follow the treatment plan as outlined by the hematology service. a. Blood transfusions as needed. b. Chelation medications to be taken as prescribed. c. Take folic acid supplements. 2. Routine maintenance. a. Y early well-child checks (WCC). Height and weight. Test for iron buildup in the liver, heart, and pancreas (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with T2* imaging). Vision and hearing tests annually if on chelation treatment.614 CHAPTER 33 Hematologic Disordersb. Monthly CBCs, or as recommended from treatment center. c. Quarterly tests for iron buildup in the blood (ferritin). 3. Measures to stay healthy. a. Healthy eating. b. Vaccinations as scheduled, including annual flu vaccine. c. Watch for signs of infection. d. Wash hands. e. Avoid crowds during cold and flu season. f. Call clinic/doctor if develop fever. 4. Support groups: Parents and children. III. LEAD POISONING Abdominal and pelvic pain, R10 Anorexia, R63.0Convulsions, unspecified, R56.9Disturbance of activity and attention, F90.0 Headache, R51Irritability, R45.4Lack of coordination, unspecified, R27.9Muscle weakness (generalized), M62.81Other fatigue, R53.83Other lack of expected normal physiological development, R62.8 Other malaise, R53.81Sleep disorders, G47Toxic effect of lead and its compounds, accidental, T56.0X1 A. Most common, widespread environmental health concern, especially for chil - dren < 6 years of age. Can cause decrease in gestational weight and age; may increase possibility of stillbirths and miscarriages. B. Etiology. 1. Increased lead levels in children occur by exposure to deteriorating paint, household dust, bare soil, air, drinking water, food, ceramics, home remedies, hair dyes, other cosmetics. Usually exposure is in child's own home. 2. Manufacture, use, disposal of modern products containing lead results in fine lead particles that release into environment. Lead particles enter air, water, food; also contaminate soil, dust. 3. Lead-containing toys, crayons, soft vinyl lunch boxes. III. Lead Poisoning 615C. Occurrence. 1. Estimated at least 400,000 children < 6 years of age have too much lead in their bodies. 2. Questions for assessing risk of lead poisoning: a. Live in, regularly visit, or have lived in a place with peeling or chipping paint built before 1960? Includes daycare, preschools, homes of babysitters, relatives. Houses with recent, ongoing, planned renovation or remodeling. b. Brother or sister, housemate, playmate being followed or treated for lead poisoning (blood level > 5 mcg/dL)? c. Live with adult whose job or hobby involves exposure to lead? Ceramics, furniture refinishing, stained glass work, construction workers. d. Taking home remedies such as azarcon and greta? e. Live near active smelter, battery-recycling plant, other industry likely to release lead into air? 3. Lead toxicity is decreasing in the United States, but approximately 25% of children still live in housing with deteriorating lead-based paint. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Many symptoms resemble common childhood complaints: Headache, stomach ache, irritability, tiredness, poor appetite. 2. Other subtle symptoms: Poor attention span and memory, sleep disorders. 3. All of these can lead to coma and death because not noticed until brain damage has already occurred. Once organ systems are damaged, damage often irreversible. E. Physical findings. 1. Weight loss, decreased growth. 2. Muscular weakness (diminished reflexes). 3. Seizures (signs of anemia). 4. Loss of visual motor coordination. 5. Irritability. 6. Constipation, abdominal pain. 7. Learning difficulties/cognitive impairment. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. CBC. 2. Lead blood levels: < 5 mcg/dL.

Group of inherited heme disorders characterized by sickle hemoglobin (HbS); several variants within sickle-cell disease. This section aimed at variant that results when one is homozygous for HbS, sometimes referred to as sickle-cell anemia (HbSS). B. Etiology. 1. Due to single defective hemoglobin module inherited as gene from both parents (autosomal-recessive disorder). 2. Abnormal HbS is produced instead of HbA, normal hemoglobin. 3. The abnormal hemoglobin S, when deoxygenated, deforms red cells into sickle shapes that occlude small vessels, slowing blood flow, creating vaso-occlusive crises in blood vessels and in organs such as spleen. C. Occurrence. 1. Predominantly in African Americans, with about 1 in 400 African Ameri - cans affected. 2. Mediterranean or Arabic descendants also found to have HbSS but in fewer numbers. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Chronic hemolytic anemia (aplastic crisis, hemolytic crisis, sequestration crisis). 2. Vaso-occlusion resulting in ischemia to tissues. a. Painful crisis: From infarcts of muscle, bone, bone marrow, lung, intestines. b. Cerebrovascular accident. c. Acute chest syndrome. d. Chronic lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis. e. Priapism. f. Ocular retinopathy. g. Gallbladder disease. h. Renal. i. Cardiomyopathy. j. Leg ulcerations. 3. Susceptibility to infection. 4. Growth failure, delayed puberty. 5. Psychologic problems (narcotic addiction, chronic illness, unusual dependence). IV. Sickle-Cell Disease 621E. Physical findings. 1. Depends on which clinical manifestation is presenting. 2. Chronic hemolytic anemia: Pallor/jaundiced skin, tachycardia, fatigue. 3. Susceptibility to infection: Fever, other symptoms related to causative organism or system infected: For example, meningitis; urinary tract infection (UTI); cytomegalovirus (CMV); A, B, C, D, E; pneumonia. 4. Vaso-occlusive crisis: Again depends on location of occlusion. 5. Splenomegaly. 6. Maxillary hyperplasia and dental malocclusion result from compensatory bone marrow expansion. F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies. Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate indicates type of hemoglobin: Fetal (F), normal adult (A), sickle (S), hemoglobin C (C). Referral to primary care provider of record when abnormal results occur. 2. Repeat testing with abnormal hemoglobin (FS) pattern on newborn screen. 3. CBC with hemoglobin MCV . G. Differential diagnosis. Other thalassemias, D56.8 Sickle-cell disorders, D57 1. Sickle-cell trait (benign), beta-thalassemia anemia. H. Treatment. 1. Preventive care. a.

Dehydration, strenuous physical exercise. d. Extreme hot/cold temperatures, high altitudes, unpressurized aircraft. V. BLEEDING DISORDERS A. Usually bruising and bleeding are a part of active childhood. Bruises on the knees and shins and nose bleeds can simply be a fact of life. They become a health problem when the bleeding is hard to control or the bruising is in areas of the body that one does not normally hit, for example, the back or stomach. Also, in adolescence, heavy menses could be the norm for many girls, or it could signal a bleeding problem. The provider needs to decide when further studies would differentiate pathologic or nonpathologic causes of the bleed - ing and bruising. Normal clotting involves some 20 clotting factors that work together along with some other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that leads to a clot. B. Etiology. 1. Platelets or clotting factors do not work in the right way. 2. Supply of specified clotting factors is deficient. 3. Physical abuse. 4. Vitamin K deficiency. V. Bleeding Disorders 625C. Occurrence. 1. Congenital. a. Hemophilia A or B: About 400 newborns a year are diagnosed in the United States. X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. Deficiencies in factor VIII (hemophilia A) and factor IX (hemo - philia B). Males exclusively affected; some very rare cases of females with hemophilia. b. von Willebrand: Affects 1:100 or 1% of the population. Autosomal inheritance with variable phenotypic expression. Common in both males and females. Deficiency in the von Willebrand clotting factor. Blood protein that affects platelet function. Is a critical link between platelets and exposed vascular subendothelium. Binds and stabilizes coagulation factor VIII. 2. Acquired issues. a. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized by thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 150,000/mcL) in the absence of other causes. Frequently noted with increased bruising, gum bleeding, or nose bleeding. Thought to be secondary to an autoimmune phenomenon. Treatment recommended only when platelet count is < 10,000 or active bleeding occurs. Multiple options for treatment such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), steroids (dexamethasone or prednisone), WinRho, tincture of time. Referral needed if more than platelet count affected to rule out leukemia or other bone marrow issue. Minimize activities when platelet count < 50,000 by removing all wheeled vehicles such as bikes, scooter, skateboard, etc. No physical education classes until platelet count > 100,000 on two consecutive occasions. b. Henoch- Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (IgA vasculitis). Results from autoimmune reaction where the body attacks its own tissues. Small, bluish purple spots on feet, legs, arms, buttocks.626 CHAPTER 33 Hematologic Disorders Usually develops after respiratory infection but can occur after immunization, insect bite, or allergic reaction to drugs or food. Rates at which disease develops and its duration vary, but is self-limited in vast majority of cases. There is no laboratory testing to confirm diagnosis. Referral for abdominal pain, kidney or renal changes, arthritis. Most commonly managed by immunology, not hematology. c. Acquired hemophilia. Rare condition with no genetic inheritance. Autoimmune etiology that results in development of autoantibodies to coagulation factors. d. Disseminated intravascular coagulation. Acquired syndrome that activates the coagulation pathway. Results in intravascular thrombi and depletion of platelets and coagulation factors. D. Clinical manifestations. 1. Excessive bruising or bleeding. 2. Bleeding history. a. Location, duration, frequency, precipitating factors. b. What does it take to stop the bleeding? c. Reactions to injections, lacerations, toothbrushing, menstruation (as applicable). d. Medications taken that may increase tendency to bleed. e. Family history of unexpected or severe bleeding (surgery, childbirth, dental procedures). f. Consideration of abuse. E. Physical findings: Dependent upon site of bleeding and age of the child. 1. Epistaxis: Unilateral or bilateral\u2014bleeding longer than 15 minutes. 2. Menorrhagia: Menses longer than 7 days, double pads, lightheadedness. 3. Ecchymosis: Where, clusters or not, especially in areas that are anatomi - cally protected. 4. Skin and mucous membrane sub - cutaneous submucosal hemorrhages of the mouth. 5. Spontaneous hemarthrosis: Joints affected, amount of swelling/pain, limited range of motion. 6. Intracranial bleeding in absence of elicited history of trauma: Headache, nausea. 7. Hepatosplenomegaly. 8. Hematuria. 9. GI cramping/pain. V. Bleeding Disorders 627F. Diagnostic tests. 1. Initial lab screening. a. CBC with differential and platelets. b. Prothrombin time (PT). c. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; see Table 33-4). 2. Secondary lab screening. a.

Medic alert bracelet: If hemophilia, von Willebrand, platelet dysfunction. 9. Factor is very expensive (approximately $1 per unit, usually give 24-50 units/kg for each dose), so rarely leave factor at school. Instead, have plan to contact family for injury or trauma and have family meet at emergency department with home factor dose. L. When to refer. 1. Refer all newly diagnosed hemophilia A, B; vonWillebrand; or other bleed - ing disorder patients to hemophilia treatment center for comprehensive management and plan. 2. Factor replacement needed with dental procedures, but rarely needed with routine immunizations. Apply ice and pressure following injections. VI. CLOTTING DISORDERS (THROMBOPHILIA) Other thrombophilia, D68.6 Primary thrombophilia, D68.5 A. Thrombophilia refers to the increased ability to form blood clots. There may be acquired or inherited risk factors. Thrombotic events are increasingly rec - ognized in tertiary centers. These events are extremely rare in healthy children, affecting 0.07 children in every 100,000 born. B. Testing for inherited thrombophilia: 1. Factor V leiden. 2. Prothrombin 20210 gene mutation.630 CHAPTER 33 Hematologic Disorders3. Antithrombin III deficiency. 4. Protein C deficiency. 5. Protein S deficiency. C. The most common risk factors for developing a clot include central indwelling venous catheters, trauma, use of oral contraceptives, immobilization, infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, structural venous anomalies, and cancer. D. Screening testing should be limited to those children with a strong family history of thrombophilia (first-degree relative with thrombotic event at < 40 years of age). Those children will benefit from counseling regarding use of oral hormone therapies, targeted thromboprophylaxis in high-risk situations, and education regarding signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. E. Counseling will also include direction to avoid smoking and a sedentary life - style, and to maintain a healthy weight to avoid obesity. BIBLIOGRAPHY Abelsohn AR, Sanborn M.

Bibliography 633Pediatric Obesity V . Julie LaMothe I. INTRODUCTION A. Childhood overweight is defined as body mass index (BMI) 85th percentile of age- and defined as BMI 95th percentile. B. Prevalence of pediatric obesity in the United States has seen a plateau at 17% in 2011-2014, affecting about 12.7 million children and adolescents. Obesity among preschool children (age 2-5 years) is 8.9%, children age 6-11 years is 17%, and adolescents age 12-19 years is 20.5% for males and females. Prevalence of obesity is lower among non-Hispanic Asian youth (8.6%) and is higher among non-Hispanic black (19.5%) and Hispanic youth (21.9%). Rates of severely obese children and adolescents are increasing, along with children with mobility limitations and learning disabilities. An obese child, especially one with an obese parent, has a high likelihood of being an obese adult. C. Factors that play a role in etiology of pediatric obesity include inappropriate caloric intake and sedentary lifestyle. Obesity is associated with higher blood pressure, abnormal lipid profile, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and subsequent increased risks for several chronic diseases of adulthood, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease complications, pseudotumor cerebri, and some cancers. In addition, obesity in childhood can have psychosocial implications, including low self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and depression. II. PEDIATRIC OBESITY ASSESSMENT A. BMI calculation and blood pressure measurement. 1. Obesity is a chronic condition involving an excess of body fat. BMI is a useful screening tool to identify possible weight issues and health risks for children and teens. Recommended BMI screening by the Centers for 635CHAPTER 34Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) should take place for children beginning at 2 years of age through 19 years of age. BMI is calculated from the child's weight and height and correlates with direct measures of body fat. BMI for children and teens is age and sex specific and plotted on the CDC BMI for age and sex growth charts to obtain a percentile ranking ( Table 34-1). The standard formula for BMI is weight in kg divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). a. Measure height accurately by having the child remove his or her shoes and stand straight with his or her feet together and looking straight ahead. Measure to nearest 1/8 inch or 0.1 cm. b. Measure weight accurately by having the child remove his/her shoes and heavy clothing. Record to nearest decimal fraction. c. Calculate the child's BMI and plot on sex-specific growth chart. d. BMI is tracked at each well-child visit beginning at age 2 years through age 19 years. The amount of body fat changes with age and differs between girls and boys. e. The CDC has a BMI calculator for children and teenagers, available on its website (https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx). f. Blood pressure measurement includes selecting a cuff that covers two-thirds of upper arm or thigh and is then documented and com - pared to norms based on age, sex, and height on at least three separate occasions ( Table 34-2). T able 34-1 Body Mass Index for Age-Weight Status Categories and Corresponding Percentiles Underweight Less than 5th percentile Healthy weight Between 5th percentile and 85th percentile to or greater than 95th percentile T able 34-2 Definitions of Normal Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure Less than 90th percentile High-normal blood pressure Between 90th and 95th percentiles Hypertension Greater than or equal to 95th percentile (on three separate occasions)636 CHAPTER 34 Pediatric ObesityB.

Select whole grain products, whole fruit rather than fruit juices. 6. Choose polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats found in nuts, fish, and vegetable oils; reduce saturated fat intake. 7. Avoid distractions during mealtime; eat as a family and not alone. This will promote good nutrition practices, increase awareness, and slow down mealtime. 8. Provide age-appropriate information on portion size. Encourage families to measure out single-snack portions and place in single-serving contain - ers. Promote mindfulness. 9. Decrease consumption of fast foods and high-fat, high-sodium, or pro - cessed foods. 10. Decrease consumption of added table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. 11. Discourage unhealthy weight loss methods such as fasting, eliminating food groups, or skipping meals. Identify maladaptive practices related to diet and activity. 12. Promote traditional foods of high nutritional quality. III. Treatment 64113. Children up to 10 years of age may need 15 exposures of a food before accepting a new food. 14. Advocate for nutritious school lunches and nutritious items in vending machines at schools. 15. Promote breastfeeding. 16. Eat more foods with fiber, vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. E. Physical activity goals. 1. Assess present activity level of both the individual and the family and assess the environment, social support, and barriers to physical activity. 2. Promote increasing activity on a daily basis, such as increased outside activity: Begin slowly, increasing activity as tolerated; goal is at least 20 minutes, optimally 60 minutes, 5 days per week. The National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) Expert Committee recommends that child increase amount of moderate physical activity (activity that breaks a sweat or is a 5-6 out of 10 in level of intensity). 3. Gradually increase vigorous aerobic activity as tolerated; offer a variety of activity choices that are realistic for child/adolescent and family, promote after-school activities. 4. Limit total recreational screen time to 2 hours or less per day (TV , com - puter, texting, video games). 5. Remove TV from the bedroom; keep sleeping area free of distractions. 6. Provide free pedometers or wristbands with age-appropriate goals for steps; parents may also enjoy walking with children to encourage family activity. 7. Provide information on community gyms, centers, after-school activity centers that promote increased physical activity. Locate scholarship op - portunities or discounts based on family income in these centers. Promote activities provided by schools, sports, clubs, and year-round athletic activities. 8. Collaboration with schools, communities, and businesses is essential for physical activity programs to be successful. 9. Promote peer group programs to collaborate with children and youth with special healthcare needs to increase physical activity like the TOPSoccer (The Outreach Program for Soccer) program and Special Olympics. 10. Report daily activity in a journal or on app. 11. Active video games may present an opportunity for increased physical activity, with more emphasis on lower extremities than upper extremities. F. Subspecialist referral for comorbidities. 1. Provide referrals to orthopedics, physical therapy, or podiatrist for hip/knee pain or flat feet. Consider appropriate X-rays for Blount's disease and slipped capital femoral epiphysis.642 CHAPTER 34 Pediatric Obesity2.

Cardiology if a family event before age 55 years, dizziness, chest pain, if patient has recorded three high blood pressure readings. Consider stress test. G. Follow-up. 1. Algorithm for the assessment and management of childhood obesity in patients age 2 years and older. 2. Appointments with medical provider and patient/family are annual for chil - dren at healthy weight. Children with BMI > 85th percentile: Recommend monthly follow-up visits. After 3-6 month visit, if the BMI weight status has not improved, recommend more structured weight management with more frequent visits. If no improvement in BMI, consider referral to comprehen - sive multidisciplinary team for management or tertiary care intervention. 3. Child/adolescents will develop individualized health plans to encourage increased activity and decreased caloric intake; plan will be revised and updated with each health visit. 4. Child/adolescent and families will participate in individual sessions, behavioral modification, and peer group activity sessions. 5. Child/adolescent will be responsible for keeping a food log, wearing pedometer, and keeping activity log. 6. Family members will be involved with child/adolescent goals so they can support the healthy lifestyle plan. 7. Incentives offered to encourage program compliance. 8. Participation in school activities, interaction with friends, parents, and families promoted and monitored. 9.

Various instruments are available for assessment of children with behavioral and socioemotional disorders in primary care settings. Based on the results of these assessments, referral to a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, psychologist, or social worker for completion of additional assessments and full evaluation may be indicated. Data from the primary care assessment tools will assist in planning behavioral interventions based on family dynamics and functioning. Selection of the best behavioral health assessment tools for primary care settings are based on the nurse practitioner's preference, ease of use and scoring, ease of inclusion in the electronic medical record, and the validity and reliability of the tool in the population of interest ( Box 35-1 , Box 35-2 , and Assessment Rating Scales Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist System (CBCL) Parent form (CBCL) Teacher report form (TRF) Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scales (ADDES) Home version School version Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition (BASC-3) Parent rating scale (PRS) Teacher rating scale (TRS) Connor's Parent/Teacher Rating Scale Personality Inventory for Children-Revised (PIC-R) Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS) Vanderbilt Teacher Assessment Scale Walker Problem Behavior Checklist System (CBCL) Youth Self-Report Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Connor's Adolescent Form (Adolescent rates own behavior) Self-Report of Personality Child Anxiety Scale Children's Personality Questionnaire (CPQ) Early School Personality Questionnaire (ESPQ) High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) Social Skills Rating System (SSRS)-Student Form Box 35 -3 Behavioral Assessment: Protective Measures Draw a Person: Screening Procedure for Emotional Disturbance (DAP: SPED) Inventory-A disorder, other Attention-deficit hyperactivity type, adolescent-onset F91.2Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type, F91.1 Conduct disorder, unspecified, F91.9 Disorder of adult personality and behavior, unspecified, F69 Expressive language disorder, F80.1 Mathematics disorder, F81.2 Other developmental disorders of scholastic skills, F81.89 Specific developmental disorder of motor function, F82 Specific reading disorder, F81.0650 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral DisordersA. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood and the most common neurobehavioral disor - der in child health. ADHD is characterized by the child presenting with three core behavioral symptoms: Impairing levels of inattention, disorganization, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Inattention and disorganization refers to the inability of the child to stay on task, appearing not to listen, and losing materials, while hyperactivity-impulsivity refers to overactivity, fidgeting, inability to remain seated, intruding into other individuals' activities, and the inability to wait. All of these symptoms are evaluated to be outside the normal parameters of the psychosocial development for the child's age. Symptoms are displayed by the child before 7 years of age, even though diagnosis may not be established until the child enters the school setting. Three presentations for ADHD are now recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM-V): (1) Combined presentation (behaviors specified in Diagnostic Criterion A1 [inattention] and Criterion A2 [hypersensitivity-impulsivity] for 6 months), (2) predominantly inattentive presentation (behaviors specified in Criterion A1 but not A2 for 6 months), and (3) predominantly hyperactive/ impulsive presentation (Criterion A2 is met but not Criterion A1 for the past 6 months). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has formulated guide - lines for children with ADHD from 4 to 6 years old and from 7 years and older. B. In partial remission: When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full criteria have been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning (DSM-V , p. 60). C. Severity is specified as mild, moderate, or severe. D. AAP (2015) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of ADHD now include children 4 to 18 years of age. E. Etiology. 1. Specific etiology unknown. It is believed that abnormal dopamine trans - port and uptake at nerve synapse may account for symptoms displayed. a. Other considerations: Combination of genetic, environmental, cul - tural factors. 2. Genetic and physiological. a. Incidence elevated if child has a first-degree biological relative with ADHD. 3. Environmental. a. Very low birth weight babies have a two- to three-fold risk for ADHD. b. Correlated with intrauterine exposure to maternal smoking behaviors. c. Neurotoxin exposures such as lead, infections (encephalitis), and intrauterine alcohol exposure. II. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 6514. Cultural. a. Cultural variations in attitudes and interpretation of behaviors. b. In the United States, black and Latino populations tend to have a lower prevalence rate than white populations, which may be influenced by cultural group of child and informants. F. Occurrence. 1. The prevalence of ADHD in children is about 5% in most cultures. The prevalence of ADHD is about 2.5% in adults. 2. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. 3. More prevalent in males than females\u2014approximate ratio of 2:1, with females presenting more frequently with primarily inattention. 4. Prevalence of comorbid conditions ranges from 9-50% depending on specific comorbid condition. Refer to Table 35-1. G. Clinical manifestations. 1. Child displays and/or parents and teachers report inappropriate degrees of: a. Combined hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive behaviors. b. Predominantly inattentive behaviors. c. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. 2. DSM-V diagnostic criteria delineate clinical manifestations of ADHD and clarify criteria utilized to make definitive diagnosis.

AHCPR Publication No. 99-0050.652 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral Disorders3. Identifying at-risk child. a. Nurse practitioner plays integral role in identifying children at risk for ADHD by evaluating comprehensive medical history. b. Positive family history of one or more of hyperactivity disorder, con - duct disorder, learning disorder, substance abuse, psychiatric disorder. c. Intrauterine exposure to smoking and drug/alcohol use, especially during first trimester. d. Parent and/or schoolteacher report that child displays impulsive, hyperactive, and/or inattentive behaviors. Several symptoms are present before age 12 years. Adult recall of childhood symptoms may be unreliable; it is important to gather information from other individuals who can provide objective data, such as teachers, counselors, etc. Symptoms occur in more than one setting (i.e., home, school, play activities). School-age children tend to steal, tell lies, deliberately destroy property. Adolescents display behaviors associated with anger and mood lability: Alcohol/substance abuse, smoking, sexually transmitted infections, early pregnancy, low self-esteem, involvement in motor vehicle accidents. 4. Comprehensive medical history: Include questions that elicit details concerning each of following parameters: a. Parental concerns. Onset and duration of symptoms. Parental approaches to displayed symptoms. b. Behavioral history. Hyperactivity/impulsivity as described by parents, caregivers, teachers. Behaviors that display inattentiveness to details. Ability to focus on interactive video games. Sleep patterns. General behavior at home and in school settings. Previous results of Denver Developmental Screening Tests and any formal psychological testing. School performance. Identification of any learning disabilities. Behaviors displayed while playing with other children. Parenting styles: What works, what does not work with the child. II. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 653c. Significant past medical history. Prenatal, birth, neonatal history. Evaluation of growth charts. Evaluation of previous diagnostic testing, including complete blood count (CBC) results, lead levels, visual and hearing test results. Seizures/seizure-like behaviors, including staring episodes, tics, head trauma. Medication history (prescribed, over the counter, illicit). d. Developmental history. Achievement of developmental milestones. Speech and language development. Gross motor and fine motor development. Coordination. e. Educational history. Type of educational program. Early intervention. Special education program. Participation in mainstream programs. One-on-one programs. Success/failure in each educational program. Mathematical ability. f. Behaviors at school. Reports from teachers, counselors. Relationships with children at home and school. Relationships with teacher, school nurse, counselor. g. Family history. Parents or siblings diagnosed with ADHD. Substance abuse. Mental illness. Learning disabilities. h. Psychosocial history. Family structure, function. Head of family. Parents' occupations, employment, levels of education. Substance abuse by parents/child. Evaluate family-child interactions. Family stress level due to child's behavior.654 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral Disordersi. Manifestations consistent with comorbid conditions: Lack of motor control; clumsiness (developmental coordination disorder [dyspraxia]). Preschooler with speech, language delay (learning disability). Writes number in reverse order after age 7 (learning disability). Poor school performance: Unable to learn to read, write, or do mathematics (learning disability). Insomnia. Enuresis, encopresis. Negative, hostile, defiant behaviors lasting at least 6 months (oppositional defiant disorder [ODD]). Violation of home/school rules (conduct disorder). Symptoms of depression. Inappropriate levels of anxiety. Low self-esteem. Autism spectrum disorders. Tic disorders. H. Physical findings. 1. For diagnosis without comorbid conditions, physical examination is usu - ally unremarkable. 2. Behavior during physical examination is often inappropriate for age: Refuses to cooperate; refuses to respond to questions. 3. Dysmorphic features may be consistent with comorbid conditions. 4. Neurocutaneous lesions may be consistent with comorbid conditions. I. Diagnostic tests. 1. No specific diagnostic tests for definitive diagnosis. 2. Diagnostics such as blood tests, brain scans, electroencephalogram (EEG), and psychological tests are not routinely necessary for children with ADHD without evidence of comorbid conditions. 3. Laboratory tests that may assist in ruling out or verifying comorbid conditions: a. CBC with differential. b. Lead level (children age 7 years and younger). c. Basic metabolic panel. d. Liver function panel. e. Thyroid studies including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). f. Electrocardiogram (ECG): To evaluate heart rate and QT interval (positive family history). g. EEG: Recommended for all children who may be placed on medication therapy and have a past medical history of seizures and/or a family history of a seizure disorder. II. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 6554. Diagnosis of ADHD. a. For definitive diagnosis, must use DSM-V diagnostic criteria for ADHD. b. AAP updated their published evidence-based guidelines (2015) for primary care diagnosis and clinical evaluation of children suspected of having ADHD. AAP guidelines require that a child meet the DSM-V criteria. c. AAP guidelines require evidence directly obtained from the classroom teacher regarding the core symptoms of ADHD, the duration of symp - toms, the degree of functional impairment, and coexisting conditions. J. Differential diagnosis. 1. Because diagnosis has several significant comorbid conditions, compre - hensive history and physical examination essential to establish definitive diagnosis and formulate treatment plan. 2. Differential diagnoses included in Table 35-2. K. Treatment ( Box 35-4 ). 1. Both medication and behavior therapy. 2. Evidence suggests that discontinuing treatment leads to reemergence of symptoms. 3. Aimed at alleviating major symptoms child displays and improving child's ability to function within family unit, social and educational environments. 4. In addition, if child also displays symptoms of one or more comorbid conditions, treatment is highly recommended to reduce or alleviate these symptoms. 5. Characteristics of treatment plan: a. Parent education. Provide education about ADHD and appropriate comorbid condition. Identify available resources and support groups for parents (Box 35-5 ). b. Preschool-age children (4 to 5 years old). Evidence-based parent or teacher behavioral interventions. Medication therapy: Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) if the behavior interventions do not improve. c. School-based strategies. Behavior therapy plus medication. Structured classroom setting. Consistent instruction and application of rules of conduct. Meets educational needs of child as identified through in-school testing.656 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral DisordersT able 35-2 Differential Diagnoses of ADHD Differential Diagnosis Characteristic Symptoms or Presentation Specific learning disorder: Other developmental disorders of scholastic skills, F81.89Language delay, especially in preschool years. Persistent reversal of numbers after 7 years of age. Unsuccessful in achieving reading, writing, and math skills. Difficulty understanding concept of left and right. Sleep disorders, G47.9 Insomnia leading to attention deficit in school activities. Sleeping during class. Extended daytime naps at home or in school (preschool or kindergarten). Frequent episodes of night terrors or nightmares. Mild intellectual disabilities, F70Child presents with learning difficulties in elementary grades. Tourette's disorder, F95.2 Usually symptoms are evident after 7 years of age. Reports by parents/caregivers that child has had 2 + motor tics and 1 vocal tic during 1-year interval. Oppositional defiant disorder, F91.3Negativistic. Hostile. Defiant behaviors. Uncontrolled temper. Angry. Refuses to comply with social rules at home, school. Behaviors are associated with poor school performance because affected child tends to resist work or school tasks that require self-application as they resist conforming to others' demands. Conduct disorder, unspecified, F91.9Violates rights of others. Violates societal norms. Violates rules at home, school. Participates in at-risk behaviors: Smoking, substance abuse. Often suspended from school. (continues ) II. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 657T able 35-2 Differential Diagnoses of ADHD (continued ) Differential Diagnosis Characteristic Symptoms or Presentation Intermittent explosive disorder, F63.81Displays high levels of impulsive behaviors. Does not show serious aggressive behavior toward others. Other neurodevelopmental disordersIncreased motor activity that may occur in ADHD is not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements that are seen in autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) or Tourette's disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder, F41.1Inattentive behavior. ADHD symptoms are not associated with worry or rumination as in anxiety disorder. Other differential diagnosis to considerDoes not display the characteristic symptoms of these major disorders: Reactive attachment disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, substance abuse disorder, personality disorder, psychotic disorder, medication- induced symptoms of ADHD, neurocognitive disorders. Box 35 -4 Role of Nurse Practitioner in Managing Child with ADHD Office assessment identifying parental concerns and child's behavior patterns. Establish rapport with psychiatrist or psychologist to identify treatment plan. Include parents, child, and school personnel in the treatment plan. Monitor effects of stimulant medication to ensure desired treatment plan outcomes. Follow-up should include biannual physical examinations and appropriate laboratory studies, including hemoglobin because anemia is a side effect. Emotional support measures for child and parents. Monitor weight, height, and BMI every 3 months. School nurses can assist between the regularly scheduled 6-month office visits. Stimulant therapy may cause weight loss. Gains in height may be slowed. Resources for Parents Parent Resources for ADHD www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/index.html National Resource Center on ADHD, www.chadd.org/NRC.aspx Attention Deficit Disorder Association, www.add.org Treatment recommendations for ADHD, www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/guidelines.html658 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral Disordersd. Behavior modification. Strategies are consistent and followed at home and at school. Inform child of rules of acceptable behavior. Rewards for demonstrating positive behaviors (positive reinforcement). Consequences for failure to meet the goals (punishment). Repetitive application of the rewards and consequences shapes behavioral changes. e. Medication therapy. Basic principles. Begin with lowest dosage and increase dosage every 5-7 days based on parent and teacher assessment of child's response (changes in behavior) to medication. Once positive response to medication therapy is reported, in - crease dose at least one more time. Medication administered every 12 hours has been shown to be most effective in controlling symptoms of ADHD. Drugs of choice. Evidence strongly supports the use of stimulant medications. The evidence is sufficient but less strong for atomoxetine (Strat - tera), extended-release guanfacine (Intuniv), (in effects: Decreased appetite, weight loss. Insomnia.Box 35 -5 Evidence-Based Treatment Guidelines for Children 4-18 Years of Age The AAP developed an algorithm to guide the clinical process. Diagnosis and Evaluation The primary care clinician should: Initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child 4 through 18 years old who presents with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Determine if the ADHD diagnostic criteria in the DSM-V are met. Determine if comorbid conditions are present. Recognize ADHD as a chronic illness and provide care using chronic care models and principles of medical home care management. Modified from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): recommendations. http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd /adhd December 30, 2017. II. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 659Tachycardia. Increased blood pressure. Nervousness. Headache. Dizziness. Irritability. Rebound moodiness. Leukopenia/anemia. Skin rash. Abnormal liver function tests. Exacerbations of tics and Tourette's syndrome. Management of side effects: Administer dose after meals to improve appetite; provide fre - quent high-calorie snacks. Avoid caffeine intake. Modify time of administration if sleep problems. For adolescents age 12 to 18 years, the primary care clinician should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD and behavior therapy. The preferred treatment for adolescents with ADHD includes both medication and behavior therapy. L. Follow-up. 1. Monitor height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure every 3 months in children younger than 12 years of age. School nurse can play integral role in monitoring these measurements in child every 3 months and reporting these findings to primary care provider. 2. In children older than 12 years of age, monitor height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure every 6 months. 3. Monitor CBC or hemoglobin every 6 months. Children are at increased risk for leukopenia/anemia while on psychostimulant drug therapy. 4. Perform interval history, physical assessment every 6 months to evaluate child's response to treatment program. 5. Consult with teacher and school psychologist prior to each 6-month healthcare evaluation for continuity of care. 6. Follow up with psychiatric referrals, as appropriate. M. Complications. Abnormal weight loss, R63.4 Essential (primary) hypertension, I10Tachycardia, unspecified, R00.0Tic disorder, unspecified, F95.9Tourette's disorder, F95.2660 CHAPTER 35 Behavioral Disorders1. Complications from medication therapy include weight loss, increased heart rate and blood pressure, growth suppression, exacerbations of tics and Tourette's syndrome. 2. Once medication is discontinued, symptoms related to complications of medication therapy resolve; however, evidence shows that ADHD symptoms return even with continuous behavior-modification therapy. N. Education. 1. Parent education is key to successful management. a. Parents should receive initial and updated education related to behavior modification strategies for successful treatment as child reaches each new developmental stage. b. Parents need to understand medication management. c. Parents should know possible side effects of medication therapy. d. Support groups. e. Group and family therapy. f. Internet resources.

Autistic Spectrum Disorder 661A. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a biologically based neurobiological disorder that includes autistic spectrum disorder; childhood disintegrative disorder; pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; and Rett syndrome. Characterized by impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, cognitive abilities, and social interactions. 1. Individuals with an established DSM-IV diagnosis of ASD, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, should be given the diagnosis of ASD. Individuals with significant deficits but whose symptoms do not meet the criteria of ASD should be evaluated for social communication disorders. 2. The first symptoms of ASD involve delayed language development and most often include a lack of social interest or unusual social interactions, odd play patterns, and unusual communication patterns. B. Etiology. 1. Genetic susceptibility: Children with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome (identified gene mutation). 2. Genetic susceptibility and environmental factors: No single environmental factor identified; however, may be linked to prenatal exposure to thalido - mides, valproic acid, and mesoprostol. 3. There is no evidence that links the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vac - cine or any immunizations to ASD. C. Occurrence. 1. Male-to-female ratio is 3:1. 2. In the United States: 1% of the population is affected. 3. Recurrence rate in siblings of affected children is 2-8%. 4. Present in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. D.

Significant loss of appetite. f. May also present with: Explosive/destructive rages, separation anxiety, defiance of authority, bedwetting, night terrors, strong and frequent cravings, impaired judgment, impulsivity. g. Presents with depressive symptoms and also exhibits ADHD-like symptoms that are very severe: Refer to mental health professional for further evaluation, particularly if family history of bipolar disorder. D. Physical findings. 1. Specifically ask about thoughts of suicide or self-harm: Suicide is third leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-olds. 2. Major depression may present with multiple, vague somatic complaints (e.g., headache, stomach ache, fatigue, sleep, appetite changes) . 3. Bipolar disorder may present with symptoms of ADHD, depression, mania, oppositional behavior. 4. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. a. Severe recurrent temper outbursts, verbal and/or behavioral, that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry. b. Symptoms have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms. c. Symptoms are present in at least two of three settings and are severe in at least one of these. d. The behaviors do not occur during an episode of major depressive disorder, mania, or hypomania and are not better explained by another mental disorder. e. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. f. The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years and should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years. g. Rates of comorbidity are extremely high. III. Mood Disorders 685E. Diagnostic tests. 1. Several screening tools useful for children/adolescents, including Children's Depression Inventory for ages 7-17 and Beck Depression Inventory for adolescents. Positive screens indicate need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by mental health professional. 2. Requires intensive interview with child/adolescent and family as well as detailed family history. F. Differential diagnosis. Adjustment disorder, unspecified, F43.20 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type, F90.2 Attention-deficit type, F90.0 Attention-deficit F90.9 Intermittent explosive disorder, F63.81 Oppositional defiant disorder, F91.3 1. Adjustment disorder. 2. ADHD. 3. Intermittent explosive disorder. 4. Oppositional defiant disorder. G. Treatment. 1. Major depression. a. Antidepressant medication may be indicated. Consider SSRI medications: Fluoxetine (Prozac): Starting dose of for children, 10-60 mg/day for teens. Fluvoxamine dose of increase to for children, 100-300 mg/day for teens. Sertraline dose of increase to for children, 50-200 mg/day for teens. Escitalopram (Lexapro): Indicated for 12- to 17-year-olds, start at 10 mg/day, may increase dose after 3 weeks, max dose is 20 mg/ day, titrate gradually to discontinue. Following remission of symptoms, continue medications with therapy for at least several months given high rate of relapse, re - currence of depression. Gradually discontinue medications over 6 weeks or longer.686 CHAPTER 36 Mental Health Disordersb. Short-term psychotherapy, such as CBT. CBT based on premise that young people with depression have distorted view of themselves, world, future. CBT focuses on chang - ing distortions through time-limited therapy. Continued therapy for several months after remission of symp - toms may help consolidate skills learned, cope with aftereffects of depression, address environmental stressors, understand how young person's thoughts and behaviors could contribute to relapse. 2. Bipolar disorder. a. Use of mood-stabilizing medications such as lithium (Eskalith, form for initial titration, adjust dose based on tx response and serum levels, check serum level every 4-7 days until serum level reaches therapeutic range of 0.6-1.2 mEq/L. Monitoring parameters include pregnancy test at baseline; calcium, creatinine, CBC, urinalysis, TSH at baseline, then at least q 6-12 months; electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline then q 12 months; lithium level q 6-12 months. Dose valproic acid at 15 mg/kg/day; increase by 5 mg/kg/day q 7 days, adjust dose based on therapeutic response and serum levels. Check serum level every 7 days until it reaches therapeutic range of 50-125 mcg/mL, give with food. Monitoring parameters include LFTs at baseline, then frequently; CBC with differential; coagulation tests at baseline, then peri - odically; ammonia. Dose aripiprazole at 10 mg q day; start at 2 mg q day \u00d7 2 days, then 5 mg q day, maximum dose is 30 mg/day. Monitoring parameters include CBC, fasting glucose, lipids, weight or BMI, stiff or sore muscles. Dose risperidone at 0.5-6 mg/day; start at 0.5 mg q day, then in - crease by 0.5 mg/day no more frequently than q 24 hours to target 2.5 mg/day, doses < 2.5 mg/day rarely more effective. Monitoring parameters include fasting glucose, lipids, prolactin, CBC, weight or BMI, stiff or sore muscles. III. Mood Disorders 687 Dose quetiapine at 400-600 mg/day divided bid-tid; start 25 mg bid \u00d7 1 day, then increase by 100 mg/day up to 200 mg bid by day 5. Monitoring parameters include lipids, fasting glucose, CBC, weight or BMI. b. Do not use antidepressant medication alone; may lead to mania or rapid cycling. c. Psychostimulant medications frequently used to treat ADHD may worsen manic symptoms. d. CBT, interpersonal therapy, multifamily support groups essential part of overall treatment plan. H. Follow-up. 1. Monitor effectiveness of medications; address side effects, compliance issues. 2. Monitor closely for suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors. Note : FDA black box warning on use of SSRI antidepressants in children and teens. 3. Monitor blood levels to assess appropriate medication dosing. 4.
