The pending rule becomes final and effective at the conclusion of the legislative session, unless the rule is approved or rejected in part by con current resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rej ected in part by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent res olution or upon the date specified in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 5 6-1011 through 56-1023, Idaho Code, and Senate Bill 1310 (2018).DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule: Title 56 (EMS Act) requires that the minimum staffing requirement for patient care providers in ambulances in Idaho is an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).

Senate Bill 1310 (2018) changes this requirement from an EMT to an EMR with an Ambulance Certification. The Ambulance Certification is a new process so the current EMS Rul es are silent on the requirements that agencies must meet in order to staff an ambulance with an ambulance certified EMR.

FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program is funded through dedicated funds. This rulemaking has no fiscal impact to those funds or to the state general fund. This rulemaking is intended to be cost-neutral.

The EMT is the second level of licensed Emergency Medical Services (EMS) patient care provider in Idaho. The first level is the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR). Senate Bill 1310 (2018) changes this requirement from an EMT to an EMR with an Ambulance Certification. The Ambulance Certification is a new process so the current EMS Rul es are silent on the requirements that agencies must meet in order to staff an ambula nce with an ambulance-certified EMR. This rulemaking is n eeded to align the chapter with Senate Bill 1310 (2018). Specifically, these rule changes add language to this chapter that allows an EMS agency to use an ambulance-certified EMR to be the sole patient care provider. Companion rule changes are being made simultaneously under Dockets 16-0102-1801 and 16-0107-1801 . TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor ha s found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate to comply wi th deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs, specifically, this rulemaking is being done t o align this chapter with Senate Bill 1310 (2018).

Due to the tight timeframe for bringing these rules before the Board of Health and Welfare in May so that they can go into effect July 1, 2018, as per statute, formal ne gotiated rulemaking will not be conducted under notices in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. However, informal negotiated rulemaking will be conducted with key stakeholders including volunteer EMS agencies and personnel, Bu reau of EMS & Preparedness staff, the EMS Advisory Committee, and the Idaho EMS Physician Commission.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule: A second dose (booster) of the meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccinat ion is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immuniza tion Practices (ACIP) for children aged 16 years and older who received the 1st dose of vaccine as recommended a t 11-12 years of age. Idaho does not currently require the booster dose for school entry. Requiring Idaho stud ents receive a second dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine before entry into the 12th grade, or receive the vaccination before entry into 12th grade for those children who did not receive the recommended first dose, would help to prevent potential cases of meningococcal disease among young people in Idaho. A second vac cination (booster) received before the 12th grade helps to ensure immunity from meningococcal disease in young pe ople as the immunity gained from the first dose of Meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine has been shown to fade after fi ve years. This rulemaking adds a new school entry immunization requiremen t to require a second dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination before a student enters the 12th grade in Idaho, or the first dose if not previously vaccinated, starting with school year 2020-2021. If a student r eceived their first dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine at 16 years of age or older, they will not be required to receive the second dose before entry into the 12th grade.

Under the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act, in re imbursing hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or the reasonable cost of inpatient services in accordance with the procedures detailed under this Section of rule. The upper limits observed by the Department in reimbursing each individual hospital must not exceed the payment that would be determined a s a reasonable cost under the policies, definitions and procedures observed under Medicare (Title XVIII) principles of cost reimbursement. (3-30-07) 01. Exemption of New Hospitals . A hospital that has operated as the type of facility for whic h it is certified (or the equivalent thereof) under present and previou s ownership for less than three (3) full years will be paid in accordance with the Title XVIII principles of reasonable cos t reimbursement, including those provisions applicable to new providers for the carryover and recovery of unreimbursed costs, in accordance with 42 CFR Section 413.64. (3-30-07) 02. Medicaid Inpatient Operating Cost Limits . The following describe the determination of inpatient operating cost limits. (3-30-07) a. Medicaid Cost Limits for Dates of Service Prior to a Current Ye ar. The reimbursable reasonable costs for services rendered prior to the beginning of the princ ipal year, but included as prior period claims in a subsequent period's cost report, will be subject to the same op erating cost limits as the claims under settlement. (3-30-07) b. Application of the Medicaid Cost Limit. In the determination of a hospital's reasonable costs for inpatient services rendered after the effective date of a princ ipal year, a hospital inflation index, computed for each hospital's fiscal year end, will be applied to the operating co sts, excluding capital costs and other allowable costs as defined for the principal year and adjusted on a per diem basis for each subsequent year under the hospital inflation index. (7-1-18) i. Each inpatient routine service cost center, as reported in th e finalized principal year end Medicare cost report, will be segregated in the Medicaid cost limit calc ulation and assigned a share of total Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs. The prorated ancillary costs will be determine d by the ratio of each Medicaid routine cost center's reported costs to total Medicai d inpatient routine service cost s in the principal year. (3-30-07) ii. Each routine cost center's total Medicaid routine service co sts plus the assigned share of Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs of the principal year will be divided by the related Medicaid patient days to identify the total THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 16-0309-1801DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0309-1801 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE S - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 72 2019 P ENDING RULE BOOKcosts per diem in the principal year. (3-30-07) (1) The related inpatient routine service cost center's per diem capital and graduate medical education costs plus the prorated share of inpatient ancillary capital co sts will be subtracted from the per diem amount identified in Subsection 405.02.b.ii. of this rule to identify each inpati ent routine service cost center per diem cost limit in the principal year. (3-30-07) (2) If a provider did not have any Medicaid inpatient utilizatio n or render any Medicaid inpatient services in an individual inpatient routine service cost center in the fiscal year serving as the principal year, the principal year for only those routine cost centers without util ization in the provider's principal year will be appropriately calculated using th e information available in the next subsequent year in which Medicaid utilization occurred. (3-30-07) iii. Each routine cost center's cost per diem for the principal year will be multiplied by the hospital inflation index for each subsequent fiscal year. (7-1-18) iv. The sum of the per diem cost limits for the Medicaid inpatie nt routine service cost centers of a hospital during the principal year, as adjusted by the hospital inflation index, will be the Medicaid cost limit for operating costs in the current year. (7-1-18) (1) At the date of final settlement, reimbursement of the Medica id current year inpatient routine cost centers plus the assigned ancillary costs will be limited to th e total per diem operating costs as adjusted for each subsequent fiscal year after the principal year through the cur rent year by the hospital inflation cost index. (7-1-18) (2) Providers will be notified of the estimated inflation index periodically or hospital inflation index (CMS Market Basket Index) prior to final settlement only upon writte n request. (7-1-18) 03. Adjustments to the Medicaid Cost Limit . A hospital's request for review by the Department concerning an adjustment to or exemption from the cost limits i mposed under the provisions set forth in Section 405 of this chapter of rules, must be granted under the following c ircumstances: (3-30-07) a. Adjustments. Because of Extraordinary Circumstances. Where a pr ovider's costs exceed the Medicaid limit due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the co ntrol of the provider, the provider can request an adjustment to the cost limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs result from the extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, increased costs attributable to strikes, fires, earthquake, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects. (3-30-07) b. Reimbursement to Public Hospitals. A public hospital that provi des services free or at a nominal charge, which is less than, or equal to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the hospital's charges were equal to , or greater than, its costs. (7-1-18) c. Adjustment to Cost Limits. A hospital is entitled to a reasonab le increase in its Medicaid cost limits if the hospital shows that its per diem costs of providing services have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinuation of services or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the principal year. Any hospital maki ng such showing is entitled to an increase commensurate with the increase in per diem costs. (7-1-18) i. The Medicaid operating cost limit may be adjusted by multiply ing cost limit by the ratio of the curren t year's case-mix index divided by the principal year's c ase-mix index. (7-1-18) ii. The contested case procedure set forth in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"R ules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings,\" is available to larger hospitals seeking such adjustments to their Medicaid cost limits. (7-1-18) d. Adjustment to the Proration of Ancillary Costs in the principal year. Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary costs does not adequately reflect the total Medicaid cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routine service cost centers in the principal year, t he provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0309-1801 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE S - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 73 2019 P ENDING RULE BOOKservices provided to each participant for each type of patient day during each participant's stay during the principal year.

The following procedures are applicable to in-patient hospita ls: (3-30-07) a. The participant's admission and length of stay is subject to pr ior authorization, concurrent review, continued stay review, and retrospective review by a Quality Im provement Organization (QIO) designated by the Department. QIO review will be governed by provisions of the QI O Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If a review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Sect ion 402 of this chapter of rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended, will result in t he QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically nece ssary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in Section 405 of this rule. (7-1-18) i. All admissions are subject to QIO review to determine if cont inued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary. A QIO continued stay review is required when the participant's length of stay exceeds the number of days certified by the QIO. If no initial length of st ay certification was issued by the QIO, a QIO continued stay review is required when the admission exceeds a number of days as specified by the Department. (3-30-07) ii. Reimbursement for services originally identified as not medi cally necessary by the QIO will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals process required in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.\" (3-30-07) iii. Absent the Medicaid participant's informed decision to incu r services deemed unnecessary by the QIO, or not authorized by the QIO due to the negligence of the provider, no payment for denied services may be obtained from the participant. (3-30-07) b. In reimbursing licensed hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or the reasonable cost of semi-private rates for in-patient hos pital care as set forth in th is rule, unless an exception applies as stated in Section 402 of these rules. The upper limi ts for payment must not exceed the payment which would be determined as reasonable cost using the Title XVIII st andards and principles. (3-30-07) 05. Hospital Penalty Schedule .

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 56 -202(b), Idaho Code; also House Bill 128 (2017) codified as Section 56-265(5), Idaho Code, re: Value-Based Care . DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The 2017 Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 128, amending Sect ion 56-265(5), Idaho Code, that provided the Department with the authority to develop a value-based payment model approach to provide Medicaid services to participants. This rulemaking in corporates new procedural requi rements needed to implement a fixed participant enrollment process to support the value-based model through the existing Healthy Connections Program. The existing Healthy Connections e nrollment process allows part icipants to change their primary care provider (PCP) any time they choose. These proposed rule changes impleme nt an enrollment process, (referred to as a \"fixed enrollment process\"), which designates a set period of time whe re participants are free to change their PCP at will. Once this time period ends, participants will not be able to ch ange their PCP at will until the next open enrollment period the following year. There are provisions that allow PCP changes outside of the open enrollment period, for cause, which have been added to meet the requirements of federa l law. These changes encourage a long-term provider-patient relationship through which a medical home is e stablished. This ensures the participant is receiving a consistent source of care, provides for better patient outcomes, and supports the value-based model of care, as directed by the legislature. There are no changes to the pendi ng rule and it is being adopte d as originally proposed. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the October 3, 2018, Idaho Admin istrative Bulletin, Vol. 18-10, pages 188-190 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the State General Fund or any other funds for these rule changes. The rule changes are considered to be budget neutral for providers and t here are no benefit changes for participants. Programmatic changes needed to implement this rulemaking are po ssible within existing Medicaid program funding.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: This rule, regarding school-based Medicaid services, revises th e definition of \"personal assistant\" to remove unnecessary job qualifications. The purpose of the rule is to make it easier for providers to offer services in a school- based setting.

There are no changes to the pendi ng rule and it is being adopte d as originally proposed.

FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This is a technical change to the rule, changing the requiremen ts to be a PCS provider in school settings to match the requirements for service providers outside of the school se tting.

The pending rule becomes final and effective July 1, 2019, unless the rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent reso lution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specifie d in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 56 -202(b), Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: This rulemaking simplifies and streamlines the current ventilat or and tracheostomy special rate process to allow for less administrative burden, and to allow rates to start on the day of admission and with no semi-annual renewals. Specifically, the ventilator and tracheostomy rates are being a djusted to allow for a fixed add-on rate, incorporating supplies, nursing and CNA hours. The rates will be updated on a yearly basis to reflect the changing costs of supplies and the Weighted Average Hourly Rate (WAHR) f or nursing and CNA hours. Ventilator and tracheostomy rates do not vary significantly in requested suppl ies and the amount of nursing and/or CNA hours. Providing a fixed rate will allow for facilities to submit a re quest for a ventilator or tracheostomy add-on rate for a participant that can be effective from the date of admission or when the rate is needed. It will enable providers to bill for the participant's entire length of stay without the need to submit documentation and renewal requests throughout the year. It will reduce the burden and risk for facilities and enhance the efficiency of Medicaid staff time. There are no changes to the pendi ng rule and it is being adopte d as originally proposed. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the September 5, 2018, Idaho Adm inistrative Bulletin, Vol. 18-9, pages 156-159 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The fiscal impact of this rulem aking is not expected to increas e the Department's claims expenditures for special rates in nursing facilities. During state fiscal year (SFY) 2016, the Department paid $2.4 million in claims (approximately $1.68 million in federal funds and $720,000 in s tate general funds) to provide special ventilator and tracheostomy care. The objective of a special rate for ventilat or and trac heos tomy car e is to co mpile th e co sts o f specialty supplies and additional nursing hours for this type o f care. Historical data indicates that supplies and additional nursing hours have not varied significantly between participants or providers. The Department proposes to imple ment fixed special rates based on the average of specialty supplies and additional nursing hours from the last fiscal year. Costs for s upplies and nursing care have been and will remain subject to annual readjustment based on findings from the Weigh ted Average Hourly Rate (WAHR) survey and inflation adjustments for supplies. Using the average of the histori cal rates is not expected to impact claims expenditures for the Department.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 56-202(b) and 56-264, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as fo llows: The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking Medicaid staff currently process special rates for participants receiving tracheostomy or ventilator care manually. A Nursing Facility (NF) must submit documentation before or on the date the special rate is to take effect. Most ventilator and tracheostomy rates are similar in supplies and s taffing and an average rate could be used instead. This would reduce administrative burden and reduce NF risk of nonpay ment due to late special rate requests, allowing NF to receive timely and ongoing add-on rates for these participan ts. Rules are needed to si mplify and streamline the current ventilator and tracheostomy special rate process to all ow for less administrative burden, and to allow rates to start on the day of admission and with no semi-annual renewals. The ventilator and tracheostomy rates will be adjusted to allow for a fixed add-on rate, incorporating supplies, nursing and CNA hours. The rates will be updated on a yearly ba sis to reflect the changing costs of supplies and the Weighted Average Hourly Rate (WAHR) for nursing and CNA hours. Ventilator and tracheostomy rates do not vary significantly in requested supplie s and the amount of nursing a nd/or CNA hours. Providing a fixed rate will allow for facilities to submit a request for a ventilator or tracheostomy add-on rate for a participant that can be effective from the date of admission or when the rate is needed.

Costs to be included in this category will be divided by the total participant days for the facility for the cost reporting period to arrive at all owable per diem costs. If costs for services provided some or all non-Medicaid residents are not included in the total cos ts submitted, the provider must determine the costs and combine them with the submitted costs in order that a total per diem cost for that facility can be determined both for both the purposes of determining the ICF/ID cap and of computin g final reimbursement. (3-19-07) 03. Cost Data to Determine the Cap . Cost data to be used to determine the cap for ICF/ID faciliti es will be taken from each provider's most recent final cost report available sixty (60) days before the beginning of the period for which the cap is being set. Cost reports are final w hen the final audit report is issued, or earlier if the Department informs the facility t he report is final for rate se tting purposes.

Allowable per diem costs will be projected forward from the m idpoint of the Base Period to the midpoint of the Target Period. \"Base Period\" is d efined as the last available final cost report period. \"Target Period\" is defined as th e effective period of the prosp ective rate. Procedures for inflating these costs are as follows: (3-19-07) a. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed from the beginning to the end of the Base Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward allowable per diem costs for each cost category from the midpoint to the end of the Base Period. (3-19-07) b. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed for the period from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. These percentages will then be used to project forward the allowable per diem costs for each cost category, as determined in Subsection 624.06.a. of these rules, from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. (3-19-07) c. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed for the beginning to the end of the Target Period.

Prior to October 1st of each y ear the Director will determine the that percent above the median that will assure aggregate payments to ICF/ID provid ers will approximate but not exceed amounts that would be incurred using Medicare cost principles of reimburseme nt. That percentage will apply to caps and rates set after September 30th of each year. Projected per diem costs as determined in this section and subject to the cap will be ranked from the highest to the lowest. The cap will be set at a percent of the bed-weighted median for each rate period. The initial cap will be set as of October 1, 1996. (3-19 -07) a. The median of the range will be computed based on the available data points being considered as the total population of data points. (3-19-07) b. The cap for each ICF/ID facility with a fiscal year beginning O ctober 1, 1996, will be computed prior to the beginning of that year. For those facilities with a fiscal year ending on a date other than September 30th, the first cap will be computed for the period beginning October 1, 1996, and ending on the fiscal year end date. (3-19-07) c. Facilities with cost reports that transcend the period from Oct ober 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, will be retrospectively settled using the previous reimbu r s e m e n t s y s t e m f o r t h e p e r i o d o f t h e r e p o r t u p t o September 30, 1996.

If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurre nt resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specifie d in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5226, Idaho Code, n otice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule and amended a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to 42 USC Section 9858f. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and amending the tem porary rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the rea sons for the change: With the adoption of IDAPA 16.07.17, \"Substance Use Disorders S ervices,\" DHW has identified a new class of individuals that must complete a DHW criminal history and backg round check in order to provide those services. This requires that this class of individuals be added to the ch apter to ensure that the Department of Health and Welfare retains the statutory authority to complete those backg round checks. Key elements were inadvertently missed with the previous rulemaking and are now included as part of th e pending rule. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance wit h Section 67-5227, Idaho Code, and is being republished following this notice. Rather than keep the tempora ry rule as previously adopted while the pending rule awaits legislative approval, the Department amended the tempora ry rule with the same revisions made to the pending rule. Only the sections that differ from the proposed rule text are printed in this Bulletin. The original text of the temporary and proposed rule was published in the July 4, 2018, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 18-7, pages 123 through 126 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no fiscal impact to the State General Fund or to dedic ated funds for these rule changes. This rulemaking is intended to be cost-neutral. NOTE: The Department will have to change its web-based background check system to enable this change. It estimates that the cost of these system changes will be $3,000.00. These modifications will be performed by DHW Information Technology staff, and it is an exp ense that is already integrated in the operational budget of the Department.ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the pending rule and the amendment to tempor ary rule, contact Fernando Cast ro, (208) 332-7999.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking pr ocedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Title 15 Chapter 5, Title 66 Chapter 4, Title 39 Chapter 3, Chapter 31, and Chapter 46, Title 56 Chapter 2, and Section 56-1004A, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than July 18, 2018. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: DHW has identified a new class of individuals that must complet e a DHW criminal history and background check due to the adoption of IDAPA 16.07.17, \"Substance Use Dis orders Services.\" This class of individuals must be added to the chapter ensure that the Department of Health and W elfare retains the statutory authority to complete those background checks. The Department's Bureau of Emer gency Medical Services has determined that the requirement to have its applicants processed as an enhanced background check is counter productive to the needs of the EMS community as these background checks take longer to process due to the addit ional research required. The Bureau of Emergency Medical Services will still require their applicants to pass a DHW background check but needs to have them removed from the chapter.TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Go vernor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate fo r the following reasons: (a) it is necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare; and (b) it complies with dea dlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs. Due to the nature of the state administrative rulemaking proces s, when a DHW program makes changes to their rules, and those changes are approved and enacted by the state Legislature, DHW must change all other rules affected by those changes at the earliest possible opportunity. This tem porary rule change is being sought to ensure that DHW retains the statutory authority to complete any new background check requirements, or, to cease any efforts to complete them once it has been det ermined that they are no long er required or needed. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no fiscal impact to the State General Fund or to dedic ated funds for these rule changes. The monies needed for this change are already part or the Department's ope rational budget dedicated to the maintenance and operations of its web-based background check system. The Depart ment will not increase the background check fee to the applicant with this change m aking it cos t -neutral to the General Fund.THE FOLLOWING NOTICE PUBLISHED WITH THE TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED RULEDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0506-1801 Criminal History and Background Checks PENDING RULE S - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 217 2019 P ENDING RULE BOOKNEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because it is not feasib le due to the short time fram e to implement these changes.

DEFINITIONS (RULE 54). For the purposes of these anesthesia rules, the following terms will be used, as defined below: (4-11-06) 01. Methods of Anxiety and Pain Control . (4-11-06) a. Analgesia shall mean the diminution or elimination of pain. (4-7-11) b. Local anesthesia shall mean the elimination of sensation, espec ially pain, in one (1) part of the body by the topical application or regional injection of a drug. (4-7-11) c. Minimal sedation shall mean a min imally depressed level of cons ciousness that retains the patient's ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway an d respond normally to tactile stimulation and verbal command. Although cognitive function and coordination may be modestly impaired, ventilator and cardiovascular functions are unaffected. In accord with this particular defini tion, the drugs and/or techniques used should carry a margin of safety wide enough never to render unintended loss of consciousness. Further, patients whose only response is reflex withdrawal from repeated painful stimuli would not be considered to be in a state of minimal sedation. (4-7-11) d. Moderate sedation shall mean a drug-induced depression of consc iousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accomp anied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous venti lation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. (4-7-11) e. Deep sedation shall mean a drug-induced depression of conscious ness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated o r painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilator function may be impaired. Patients may requ ire assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular funct ion is usually maintained. (4-7-11) f. General anesthesia shall mean a drug-induced loss of consciousn ess during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independ ently maintain ventilator function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airwa y, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced de pression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired. (4-7-11) 02. Sedation Terms . (4-11-06) a. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) shall mean an advanced car diac life support course or a pediatric advanced life support c ourse offered by a recognized accredited organization. (4-11-15) b. Monitor or monitoring shall mean the direct clinical observatio n of a patient during the administration of anesthesia by a person trained to observe the physical condition of the patient and capable of assisting with emergency or other procedures. (4-11-06) c. Operator shall mean the supervising dentist or another person w ho is authorized by these rules to induce and administer the proper level of anesthesia/sedation. (4-11-15) d. Titration shall mean the administration of incremental doses of a drug until a desired effect is reached. Knowledge of each drug's time of onset, peak response and duration of action is essential to avoid over sedation. Although the concept of titration of a drug to effect is critical for patient safet y, when the intent is moderate sedation one must know whether the previous dose has taken full effect before administering an additional drug THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 19-0101-1803IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTIS TRY Docket No. 19-0101-1803 Rules of the Idaho State Boar d of Dentistry PENDING RULE S - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 288 2019 P ENDING RULE BOOKincrement. (4-7-11) e. Maximum recommended dose (MRD) shall mean maximum FDA-recommend ed dose of a drug, as printed in FDA-approved labeling for unmonitored home use. (3-20 -14) f. Incremental dosing shall mean administration of multiple doses of a drug until a desired effect is reached, but not to exceed the maximum recommended dose (MRD). (4-7-11) g.Supplemental dosing during minimal sedation shall mean a single additional dose of the initial drug that may be necessary for prolonged procedures. The supplemental dose should not exceed one-half of the initial dose and should not be administered until the dentist has determined the clinical half-life of the initial dosing has passed. The total aggregate dose must not exceed one and one-half times (1.5x) MRD on the day of treatment. (4-7-11) 03. Routes of Administration . (4-11-06) a. Enteral. Any technique of administration in which the agent is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or oral mucosa (i.e ., oral, rectal, sublingual). (4-11-06) b. Inhalation. A technique of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent is introduced into the lungs and whose primary effect is due to absorption through the gas/blood interface. (4-7-11) c. Parenteral. A technique of administration in which the drug byp asses the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [i.e., intramuscular Transdermal. A technique of administration in which the drug is administered by patch or iontophoresis through skin. (4-7-11) e. Transmucosal. A technique of administration in which the drug i s administered across mucosa such as intranasal, sublingual, or rectal. (4-7-11) 055. MINIMAL SEDATION (RULE 55). Persons licensed to practice de ntistry in accordance with the Idaho Dental Practice Act and these rules are not required to obtain a permit to administer minimal sedation to p atients of sixteen (16) years of age or older. When the intent is minimal sedation, the appropriate initial dosing of a single enteral drug is no more than the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of a drug that can be prescribed for unm onitored home use. In cases where the patient weighs less than one hundred (100) pounds, or is under the age of sixteen (16) years, minimal sedation may be administered without a permit by use of nitrous oxide, or with a single enteral dose of a sedative agent administered in the dental office. (3-29-17) ( ) 01. Patient Safety . The administration of minimal sedation is permissible so long as it does not produce an alteration of the state of consciousness in a patien t to the level of moderate sedation, deep sedation or general anesthesia. A dentist must first qualify for and obtain the appropriate permit from the Board of Dentistry to be authorized to sedate patients to the level of moderate sedation , deep sedation or general anesthesia. Nitrous oxide/ oxygen may be used in combination with a single enteral drug in minimal sedation, except as described in Section 055 of these rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in thes e rules, a dentist shall initiate and regulate the administration of nitrous oxide/oxygen when used in combination with minimal sedation. (3-20-14) 02. Personnel . At least one (1) additional person currently certified in Bas ic Life Support for Healthcare Providers must be present in addition to the dentist .( 4-7-11)S - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 289 2019 P ENDING RULE BOOKIDAPA 19 - IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTISTRY 19.01.01 - RULES OF THE IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTISTRY DOCKET NO. 19-0101-1804 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - ADOPTION OF PENDING RULE EFF E CTIVE DATE: This rule has been adopted by the agency and is now pending re view by the 2019 Idaho State Legislature for final approval.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Section 54-1404, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 19, 2018. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Under current rule, students graduating from a nursing educatio n program can't remain employed as a nursing assistant in a non-licensed capacity. This causes financial har dship to the graduates while they wait for confirmation of passing the licensing examination. The rulemaking seeks to a lleviate this hardship by granting recent graduates a reasonable time-frame for receipt of the necessary paperwork be fore they are no longer eligible for nursing assistant status. Another board rule addressing multistate licensing is b eing deleted because it is no longer necessary given the recently passed Enhanced Nurse License Compact and withdrawal o n January 19, 2018 from the previous Nurse Licensure Compact to which the rules apply. Finally, the curren t rule requiring certain information in prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses is unnecessarily complex a n d i n c o n s i s t e n t w i t h s i m i l a r f o r m s u s e d b y physicians and other authorized prescribers in Idaho. The rulem aking seeks to correct this irregularity. BON Rule 76 is being amended to expand the definition of a \"nur se apprentice\" to include persons recently graduated (up to three months) from a nursing educational progr am; BON Rule 77 (multistate licensure) will be removed; and BON Rule 315 will be amended to make the informati on required on prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses uniform with information required on prescription forms used by physicians and other authorized prescribers licensed in Idaho. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because: (1) the proposed change to the nurse apprent ice rule was requested by a nurse educator, is very minor in nature and will have no opposition and will benefit nu rsing programs, nursing students and recent graduates, employers of nurse apprentices and the public; (2) the proposed change to the rule on multistate licensure is required by superseding statute; and (3) the proposed change to the cont ent of prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses will fully comply with all state and federal law, while making the forms uniform with similar forms used by other Idaho prescribers.

The Board will carefully extract the few rule s from the chapter that are needed to protect public health, and add them to other Board chapters as appropriate. To IDAPA 27.01.01, the Board intends to add a definition for \"DME Outlet,\" remove the definition for \"MPJE,\" and add distributing to the section of unprofessional conduct regarding misbranded or adulterated products.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ initiated this rulemaking at the recommendation of the Cro p Residue Advisory Committee to allow farmers to pay the required fees after the b urn instead of prior to the burn. This rulemaking also provides DEQ a more streamlined a dministrative process. The fee s t r u c t u r e w i l l n o t b e c h a n g e d . D u e t o t h e deployment timing of DEQ's software used to implement the crop residue burning program, it is necessary to adopt a temporary rule and implement this change prior to the 2019 spring burning season to avoid interruption of the burn season. This rulemaking will not change the timing of the fee p ayment for the spot and bale burn permit. Before this rule docket can become effective, it will be necess ary to revise Idaho Code \u00a7 39-114. Legislation was drafted in conjunction with the negotiated rulemaking. DEQ inte nds to submit the proposed legislation for consideration by the 2019 Idaho Legislature. The temporary rule would become effective on the date the companion legislation becomes law. The identical companion pending rule w ould become final and effective upon conclusion of the legislative session. Farmers desiring to burn crop residue, members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules, special interest groups, Idaho State Department of Agriculture, tribes, public officials, and members of the public who have an interest in the regulation of air emissi ons from sources in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out.

PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled . Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2 ), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty -five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersig ned on or before August 15, 2018. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure that the state rul es remain consistent with federal regulations. Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste, IDAPA 58.01.05, are updated annually to maintain consistency with the federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). This proposed rule updates federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2018. This proposed rule includes the incorporation by reference of 40 CFR Part 264, Subpart FF, and Part 265, Subpart FF , Fees for the Electronic Hazardous Waste Manifest Program (e-Manifest system). The fees are imposed and collected by the U.S. Envir onmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use of the e-Manifest system. The e-Manifest system is a new national system established by EPA for tracking hazardous waste shipments electronically. All receiving facilities, i.e., facilities that receive waste that must be manifested under federal law or receive state- regulated hazardous waste that must be manifested as required b y the state in which the waste was generated, must submit those manifests to EPA either in paper form or electroni cally beginning June 30, 2018. EPA will charge receiving facilities an associated fee for each manifest. The f ees are differentiated based on the manifest type and mode of submission. States with authorized hazardous w aste programs are required by EP A to revise their programs to be equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the requirement s of the final e-Manifest user fee regulations. All state programs must adopt or reference appropriately in their state r ules certain fee methodology provisions of the e- Manifest user fee rule so that u sers in all states are aware of the receiving facilities' obligation to pay user fees to EPA for e-Manifest related services. The fees depend on the type of manifest submitted and, for the first year, will range from $5 to $15 per manifest. The fee assessments and collections associated with this rule are performed solely by EPA. DEQ is not involved in any way with the assessment or collection of e-Manifest user fees. Therefore, DEQ will not have additional costs associated with implementing the e-Manifest rule, and the regulated community will not have additional costs with respect to DEQ; fees will not be imposed or collected by DEQ. Groups interested in hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatmen t, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested i n commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to wh ich public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board in November 2018 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2019 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature.
