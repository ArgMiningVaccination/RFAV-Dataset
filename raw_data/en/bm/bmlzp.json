People are waking up to the reality they they have no idea what they've allowed to be injected into themselves, and have zero recourse should they suffer short or long-term health implications. The pharmaceutical companies making vaccines cannot be sued or held liable for negligence, even if it causes death. As thousands upon thousands of reports of side effects including death come out, more and more people who've taken the experimental vaccines, wish they hadn't. Incentive For Safety? Since the vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued, there is zero incentive for them to be concerned with the long-term safety of their products. The only thing these companies have been concerned about is bringing a product to market as fast as possible, to make as much money as they can, as quickly as they can. Pfizer for example openly admit on their vaccine info sheet: WARNING: THIS VACCINE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS AND DEATH - This vaccine is experimental and has not been fully validated for safety of efficacy. - This vaccine has not been safety-tested for medium term or long term side effects. - This vaccine has not been tested for genetic impacts. - If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, immune compromised, otherwise ill, frail, taking other medications, or an Aboriginal or Torres Straight Islander, you should not take this vaccine. Yet, many uninformed people still took the vaccine, and now they regret it. Detox the Vaccine For standard vaccines, any standard protocol to remove toxins will help. The mRNA vaccine are a whole new way of attacking our biological systems however, and special protocols will need to be taken to repair you DNA to their former state. The first step in repairing your DNA after receiving an mRNA vaccine is to detoxify from the toxic chemicals and heavy metals such as mercury, aluminum, arsenic, lead and others that have been injected into you during vaccination with a chelating agent like NAC or EDTA. These will pull those toxins out of places where they can do most harm (your tissues). Detoxifying also helps repair by ridding the body of substances it cannot use or process on its own - this means more energy available for healing! Two Steps Forward, One Step Back The most important think to do when trying to remove poisons from within your body, is to reduce exposure to other chemicals as you do so. Stop Using: - Chemical Shampoos and Conditioners (sodium bicarbonate can substitute) - Face Creams and Lotions - Hand Sanitizer - You're killing off all your good bacteria too! - Deodorants (again, sodium bicarbonate can be used) - Perfumes and any Other Chemicals that might soak into your skin Stop Consuming: - Processed Foods - Anything GMO - Anything with Artificial or Added Sugar - HFCS - Meat that Isn't Organic - Soda or Sugary Fruit Juices You need to change your lifestyle to give your body the best opportunity to heal. There's no point trying to detox, if you are constantly exposing yourself to more chemicals which you also need to clean from your system as well. mRNA Damage The mRNA vaccines have been wreaking havoc on people's immune systems. Thousands of people have \"mysteriously\" died immediately after getting the shot, and report of shedding of RNA causing people around them to be sick have caused some schools and clinics to ban vaccinated people from entering. Hundred if not thousands of women all around the world are reporting strange bruising, migraines, and loss of their unborn children simply from being around the mRNA vaccinated. These claims sound wild, but since so many people are reporting the same things happening, it pays to be aware of what is possibly going on. Repairing your DNA The best way we know to repair DNA is through fasting for prolonged periods. If you're serious about healing yourself and detoxing from the toxic concoction you're allowed someone to inject into you, you should start fasting ASAP. Check out some YouTube videos on the benefits of fasting to help motivate you, and start off small, building up to longer fasts, to maximize you healing and cell repair. Dry Fasting Dry fasting is a more extreme version of regular fasting, where you don't drink water or eat food for a set period of time. Dry fasting offers increased benefits for detoxing, DNA repair, and overall healing, in a shorter time frame than with water fasting. Once you feel comfortable doing full day or multi-day water fasts, you should work on dry fasting to improve you health, repair your damaged RNA and DNA and remove toxins from your cells. There's no way I'll be getting one of those experimental and potentially DNA altering injections, but if I ever was forced to, I would immediately start a serious and long fasting regiment to try to remove that toxic concoction from my body. Start dry fasting as soon as you can, and work your way up to longer and longer fasts until you feel completely healthy again. Disclaimer There is no proof that once you have taken an RNA or DNA editing injection that you can repair your calls back to their original state. It is merely educated speculation on my part that anything that can repair DNA might be able to completely heal cell damage, of any form, either from an unwarranted injection or any other means. Fasting has been proven to help the body heal, cells repair, and remove chemicals and toxins. At best, a strict and prolonged fasting routine might help you completely remove any of the toxic effects and potential long term health implications of the vaccine, at worst, it will still boost your immunity, help you lose excess fat, increase your HGH to help with anti-ageing and give you more "}
