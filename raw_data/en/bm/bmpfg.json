This article examines whether there is a product-specific difference in the risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis between the two mRNA myocarditis and/or pericarditis were calculated from reports received by the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System from December 2020-March 2022. Excess cases and attributable incidence among individuals aged 18-39 were estimated for each vaccine in comparison with background rates from 2015 to 2019. Head-to-head comparisons used Poisson regression, conditioned on week of vaccine administration, to estimate rate ratios for the week after mRNA-1273 vaccination versus the week after BNT162b2, by age and sex as well as overall. Analyses were restricted to May 30-March 13, 2021, when heightened media awareness was unlikely to have affected reporting rates for the two products differentially. In 18-29 year-old males who received a second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, attributable risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was found to be 5.69 (95% CI: 4.07 - 7.95; p < 0.001) times higher among mRNA-1273 recipients (n = 106) as compared to BNT162b2 recipients (n = 33). In the same group, Poisson regression modelling estimated that the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was 4.72 (p-value = <0.001) times higher after mRNA-1723 compared to BNT162b2 vaccination. The risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis is higher after mRNA-1723 vaccination than BNT162b2 vaccination in those aged 18-39 years, especially in males aged 18-29 years, where the risk is several times higher.
