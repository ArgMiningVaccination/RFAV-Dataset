When planning to introduce a new essential oil into your healthcare program, test one drop on a small patch of skin first (e.g., on the underside of the forearm). Sensitivity to particular essential oils is highly individual. If the skin feels hot or turns red, this indicates sensitivity, and this essential oil or blend should NOT be used in your healthcare program. Apply a vegetable oil (e.g., olive or almond) to the area, which will dilute the essential oil. Washing with water is less effective. Apply only one new essential oil or blend at a time to the patch of skin to determine how your body responds. Wait 30 minutes before testing another new essential oil. DO NOT attempt to self-diagnose or prescribe any natural substances for health conditions that require professional attention. Consult your healthcare professional about any serious disease, medical condition, or injury, or if you are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant. DO NOT use wild tansy, clary sage, sage, fennel, wintergreen, or hyssop essential oils during pregnancy. Keep essential oils out of reach of children. LATEX ENEMA BAGS: Do not use essential oils in latex (rubber) enema bags. Essential oils degrade latex over time. Use essential oils only in silicone, stainless steel, or plastic enema equipment. "}
