Introduction A WHO Scientific Group on International Acupuncture Nomen- clature met in Geneva from 30 October to 3 November 1989. The meeting was opened by Dr H. Nakajima, Director-General of the World Health Organization. In his introductory remarks, Dr Nakajima said that the convening of the Scientific Group represented the culmination of many years of work in this field, initiated and sponsored by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Even when the practice of acupuncture was largely restricted to China, Japan and neighbouring Asian countries, the lack of a uniform nomenclature caused serious difficulties in teaching, research and clinical practice. With the great increase in the worldwide use of acupuncture in recent years, the need for a common language-a standard international reference nomenclature-had become pressing. WHO'S initiative began in 1980. After a series of preliminary consultations, the Regional Office for the Western Pacific convened a Working Group on the Standardization of Acupuncture Nomenclature in Manila in 1982. Thanks to the work of this group, as well as that of experts who met in 1984, 1985 and 1987, agreement was reached on the nomenclature structure for the meridians and acupuncture points and a consensus was achieved on nomenclature for the 361 classical acupuncture points, the 8 extra meridians, the 48 extra points, and scalp acupuncture points. Dr Nakajima invited the Scientific Group to review the termin- ology recommended to date and to propose a standard international acupuncture nomenclature. That would be an important contribution to the international exchange of information on the subject. A proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature 2. Background 2.1 Historical perspective Acupuncture-a unique system of therapy and pain relief-has been in constant use throughout the Chinese-culture area for some 2500 years. It developed during the Chou period (first millennium BC) and its theory and practice were already well systematized by the early Han period (second century BC). These are immortalized in the Huang Ti Nei Ching (The Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic or Canon of Medicine), consisting of two parts, the Su Wen (second century BC) and the Ling Shu (first century BC). l By approximately 300 AD, the development of the whole system was complete. The Su Wen and the Ling Shu describe where the 12 regular acu- puncture tracts (the main meridians) begin and end. It is striking that these limits have remained unchanged for two thousand years, while the anatomical courses of the meridians have undergone no serious alteration.' A large proportion of the classical acupuncture point names still in current use can be found in these treatises. In the history of acupuncture in China, Japan, the Korean penin- sula and elsewhere in Asia, there have been periods when its practice fell into decline, or, with the advent of modern Western medicine, when it was banned or neglected. During the last four decades, how- ever, great importance has been attached by the Chinese authorities to traditional Chinese medicine in general and to acupuncture in partic- ular. Concurrently, in Europe and the Americas, there has been grow- ing interest in the therapeutic applications of acupuncture and in the search for explanations of its modes of action, in terms of modern scientific knowledge. In the past 20 years many new acupuncture points have been recognized, notably in connection with auricular acupuncture. 2.2 Towards a standard nomenclature2 While the need for a common language has recently become more pressing, difficulties in communication about acupuncture have long been recognized. For one thing, acupuncture points have not one but ' LIJ GWEI-DJIEN & NEEDHAM, J. Celestial lancets: a history and rationale of acupuncfure and moxa. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1980.

Background several different names, which is not surprising given the vastness of China and its many dialects. Another problem has been the differing pronunciations of the Chinese characters, a difficulty compounded by the fact that acupuncture has long been practised in neighbouring countries of Asia. Moreover, acupuncturists in other countries have sometimes mistranslated the Chinese names of the points, and this has led to additional confusion and misunderstanding. Efforts have been made in China and Japan to develop a uniform nomenclature. In 1965, a Japanese Meridian and Points Committee was established which recommended Japanese names and an interna- tional numbering system for all acupuncture points. In China, the All China Acupuncture and Moxibustion Society subsequently set up a Nomenclature Committee, which developed a national system of names. Other countries then formed their own committees but impor- tant terminological differences persisted. In October 1980, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific sent a consultant to China to review the existing nomenclature and to identify needs for uniformity, with the ultimate aim of de- veloping an internationally acceptable standard nomenclature.' During 1981 and 1982 Chinese and Japanese experts met five times to for- mulate guiding principles for standardization, but because of the complexities of the issues involved, consensus could not be reached. 2.3 Essential elements of a standard nomenclature2 A critical evaluation of the consultant's report and her recommen- dations prompted the Regional Office to organize the first Working Group on the Standardization of Acupuncture Nomenclature. The Group, which met in Manila in December 1982, included participants from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, the Philip- pines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam. The Group drew up criteria for determining the structure of the meridians and acupuncture points. It proposed that the standard nomenclature should consist of three essential elements: - an alphanumeric code, - the Chinese phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) names of meridians and acupuncture points, and - the Han character names of meridians and acupuncture points. 1 NAWIMA, A. Assignment report to the People's Republic of China, 1 I October-2 November 1980. Manila, WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, 9 June 1981 (unpublished report ICP/PHC/ 005-E). 2 See footnote 2 to page 2. A proposed standard lnternat~onal acupuncture nomenclature The Group considered that an alphanumeric code would facilitate international communication on acupuncture. Since in medical science such exchanges are conducted mainly in the English language, it recommended that the alphanumeric code should be derived from the English translation of the meridian names. The Han character is widely used in oriental medicine in China and Japan, in Hong Kong and Singapore, and by Koreans. It confers philosophical concepts on meridians and acupuncture points which often defy translation, and should therefore be an essential element of the standard nomenclature. Finally, the Group considered that using the Chinese phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) for the names of meridians and acupuncture points would facilitate pronunciation of the Han character names and enable an alphabetic index to be drawn up. 2.4 Nomenclature proposals to date1 The Manila meeting agreed on the English-language names of the 14 main meridians and their alphabetic codes and reached consensus on an alphanumeric code for the 361 classical acupuncture points. These were published in 1984 in a book also comprising a listing of the equivalent terms hitherto used in English, French, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese language publications on acupuncture.' Subsequently, a Regional Consultation in Tokyo (1984) and Work- ing Groups in Hong Kong (1985) and Seoul (1987) reached agree- ment on nomenclature for the 8 extra meridians, the 48 extra points, and scalp acupuncture lines. These meetings also considered the nomenclature of basic technical terms in the field of acupuncture, certain auricular points of proven therapeutic value, acupuncture needles, and the unit of measurement for the location of meridians and acupuncture points. All of these still require further discussion. 2.5 The importance of a common language WHO has no official policy on the use of acupuncture in national health care delivery systems and, in fact, the subject has not been l See footnote 2 to page 2 2 WANG DESHEN, ed Standard acupuncture nomenclature Manila, World Health Organ~zat~on Regional Off~ce for the Western Pac~hc, 1984 (WHO Regional Publlcat~ons, Western Paclhc Ser~es No l] 4 Backaround debated by its governing bodies. The field has developed considerably in the last two decades, both in theory and practice, but the exact role that acupuncture can play in health care remains to be determined. Any decision to use acupuncture in a national health service is, of course, the prerogative of the Member State concerned. Putting acupuncture on a firm scientific basis requires rigorous investigation of the claims made for its efficacy. Many institutions and modem medical colleges are carrying out useful investigations to this end. Some are looking into the physiology and mode of action of acupuncture treatment, others are studying its efficacy in certain pathological conditions. These workers need to exchange information with one another regularly so as to facilitate their clinical and basic research. Such international communication is possible only if a common language is used by all concerned. A proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature 3. Proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature 3.1 Structure of the proposed nomenclature After discussion of the terminological proposals to date, the Scien- tific Group reached agreement on the standard international acu- puncture nomenclature set out in sections 3.1-3.6. Structurally, the proposed nomenclature is based on four elements: (l) the English translation of the Han character name of each meridian; (2) an alphanumeric code for the acupuncture points, of which the alphabetic part is derived from the English translation of the meridian names1 while the numbering follows the agreed course of each meridian; (3) the Chinese phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) names of meridians and acupuncture points; (4) the Han character names of meridians and acupuncture points. English was chosen because it is the language most commonly used for international communication, including communication at medical congresses and through medical journals having an interna- tional readership. The Han characters represent the full and original names of me- ridians and points, and are those currently recognized by the Chinese authorities. They tend to be pronounced differently depending on locality. The Pinyin names, intended as an aid to pronunciation, are therefore based on the standard pronunciation in use in China. 1 In the case of the 48 extra points and the scalp acupuncture lines, the alphabetic part of the code is derived from the English-language names of parts of the body. Pro~osed nomenclature 3.2 The 14 main meridians The English names and the respective alphabetic codes proposed for the 14 main meridians are as follows.

This term was agreed, with the alphabetic code TV. The proposed no- menclature for the 8 extra meridians is as follows. English name Pinyin name Han character name governor vessel l conception vessel l thoroughfare vessel belt vessel yin heel vessel yang heel vessel yin link vessel yang link 3.5 The 48 extra points In its review of the 48 extra points, the Scientific Group used the following criteria: 1. The point should be in common use. 2. It should be considered clinically effective. 3. It should have a clear anatomical location. 4. It should be at least 0.5 cun2 from a classical acupuncture point. 5. If it has the same name as an existing point, a prefix should be added to it. The proposed alphanumeric code consists of a general prefix \"EX\", denoting \"extra point\", followed by an alphabetic code indicating the region (HN for head and neck, CA for chest and abdomen, B for back, UE for upper extremity, and LE for lower extremity). Points are numbered from the higher to the lower level for the head, neck and trunk regions; from the proximal to the distal for the upper and lower extremities; and, if at the same level, from the medial to the lateral. 1 Although listed under the 14 main meridians, the governor vessel and conception vessel ore by custom also included among the 8 extra meridians. Of the 8 extra meridians, only these two have their own defined points. 2The unit of measurement used for locating acupuncture points.

Proposed nomenclature Scientific Group considered the scalp acupuncture lines (Fig. 1-5) as well as the underlying functional zones of the brain (Fig. 6-7).

Recommendations for further action by WHO in the field of acupuncture In addition to proposing the standard international acupuncture nomenclature set out in section 3, the Scientific Group discussed needs and opportunities for further action by WHO in the field of acupuncture. 4.1 Dissemination of the proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature A standard nomenclature is useful only to the extent that it is used. Through its publications, WHO should make every effort to bring the proposed nomenclature to the attention of researchers, teachers and practitioners of acupuncture. To gain worldwide acceptance, the nomenclature would have to be adopted at national and international acupuncture congresses, and for this purpose its endorsement by the WHO Executive Board and the World Health Assembly would be a great help. In addition, it would be advisable for WHO to distribute the nomenclature to all acu- puncture societies and to the editors of appropriate reviews and journals, asking for their cooperation in persuading authors of articles and communications to use the proposed terms and codes. A similar approach should be made to the organizers of conferences. A useful complement to the nomenclature in printed form would be an audio cassette giving the correct pronunciation of the Pinyin names. This could be prepared by the Chinese authorities and dis- tributed by WHO. 4.2 Further standardization of nomenclature WHO should take steps to ensure the further standardization of acupuncture nomenclature. Nomenclature proposals have already been made with respect to 43 auricular points of proven therapeutic value, the location of which is generally accepted. The standardization of nomenclature for auricular acupuncture should now be completed. In A proposed standard international acupuncture nomenclature addition, efforts should be pursued to standardize the basic technical terms used in acupuncture. 4.3 Regulation by health authorities As with other forms of medical practice, national authorities should bring acupuncture within the ambit of their health legislation and control mechanisms. Legislative and other measures will naturally differ between countries depending on whether acupuncture is used by recognized practitioners of traditional forms of medicine, or whether it is a relatively recent introduction. However, regulations should in all cases cover training, guidelines on practice, and the registration of acupuncturists. It would be useful for WHO to make a survey of existing govern- ment regulations and then prepare guidelines on the subject for the use of national authorities. 4.4 Basic training The decision as to who should be allowed to practise acupuncture must lie with the individual national health authorities. However, it is possible to establish general requirements for basic training in this field, and these are essential to the safe and competent practice of acupuncture. Among the basic requirements are a knowledge of anatomy, physi- ology, pathology, pharmacology and medicine, as well as diagnostic skills. What needs to be determined, above all, is how much knowl- edge of modern Western medical science is necessary for acu- puncturists trained in Oriental medicine and, conversely, how much knowledge of Oriental medicine (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) gradu- ates in modem Western medicine should possess if they wish to practise acupuncture. A preliminary analysis of acupuncture training programmes in different countries, conducted by WHO, would be helpful to national regulatory authorities. 4.5 Safety Accidents happen most often with acupuncturists who are not fully trained. The most effective safety measure, therefore, is to ensure Recommendations for further action by WHO sound and well supervised theoretical and practical training. This is the only way of minimizing incompetent examination, wrong diag- noses and errors of technique, of making certain that patients are properly selected for acupuncture treatment, and of ensuring that the acupuncturist knows how to deal with accidents when they do occur. Great importance must be attached to the quality of needles, their care and utilization, and their sterilization by means of adequate methods. Where economically feasible, disposable needles should be used. Authoritative guidelines on these matters are needed that set stan- dards for hospitals, clinics and private practitioners. 4.6 Indications and contraindications Clinical experience, but not necessarily controlled clinical trials, suggests that acupuncture treatment is effective in a range of diseases and conditions. An authoritative list of what conditions can effec- tively be treated by acupuncture can only be drawn up after each claim of efficacy has been examined and either verified or rejected. There is, so far, no such agreed list, although research aimed at establishing clinical indications for acupuncture is being pursued in institutions around the world. In any event, it should be borne in mind that the indications for acupuncture, and the contraindications to it, will vary with the level of training and the length of experience of the practitioner. For an acupuncturist who has a profound knowledge of the subject, the range of conditions for which such treatment may safely be used is greater than for someone of more limited ability. An important element of the training of practitioners is to help them grasp fully their own limi- tations and those of acupuncture. 4.7 Acupuncture equipment A wide variety of acupuncture equipment, including instruments that use lasers, is currently on the market. These machines and instruments need proper standardization so that their use does not entail the risk of damage to delicate body organs. WHO could promote the development of specifications for acupuncture equipment and compile guidelines for its use. A ~roposed standard international acuDuncture nomenclature 4.8 Education of the public Recently, a European country witnessed a sharp but temporary reduction in acupuncture consultations, following reports in the press that contaminated acupuncture needles could transmit infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is a need to inform the public in a responsible way about acupuncture, as indeed about any aspect of health care, so as to avoid creating unnecessary fear or anxiety. Education of the public (and of journalists) is as important as the professional education of acupuncture practitioners. 4.9 Clinical and basic research Clinical trials and related research should continue to be under- taken by independent groups, but their results should be brought together for comparison and conclusions drawn. WHO has a role to play in consolidating existing guidelines on research methodology so as to ensure the comparability of results. The Organization can also provide the ethical guidance needed on clinical and basic research, and serve as a documentation centre.
