Reiki (pronounced ray-key) is a Japanese word that means \"universal life-force energy.\" It is a way to treat your mind, body and spirit holistically. \"Reiki heals by balancing the body's energy centers and removing blockages. As a result, the energy goes to the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual spaces where it's needed. Reiki works to heal the cause rather than the symptoms of any disease,\" explained Patti Oskvarek, a Reiki practitioner and volunteer at [Banner Baywood Medical Center](/locations/mesa/banner-baywood-medical-center) in Mesa, AZ. Reiki treatments can occur anywhere, but most people prefer a calm, quiet room. During a treatment, you lie down or sit in a chair, fully clothed. A practitioner lightly places their hands on or just above your body in various locations on your head, torso, arms and legs to help you feel calm and relaxed. Oskvarek said, \"Many people feel a difference after just one session\u2014mentally, emotionally, spiritually and/or physically. Usually, the first thing a person says after a treatment is 'Wow!' And although some people come in as skeptics, after a session, they usually change to believers and advocates of Reiki.\" Sessions can last from 20 to 90 minutes, and 60 minutes is typical. You may want to schedule weekly, biweekly, or monthly treatments depending on your health. \"If you have a serious health condition, you should schedule your treatments close together,\" Oskvarek said. \"Reiki is safe, gentle and cannot harm. Reiki always works for the highest good, so there are no side effects.\" However, sessions are typically not covered by insurance. What kind of conditions can Reiki treat? \"It doesn't matter what health challenges you have\u2014Reiki can help,\" Oskvarek said. Reiki may bring help and comfort whether you're facing a minor bruise, cancer or recovery from surgery. Reiki helps you relax deeply, and relaxation can help you reduce muscle tension and pain, release stress, speed wound healing and improve your health and well-being. \"Reiki supports and accelerates your body's natural ability to heal itself while alleviating pain, removing toxins and balancing your whole energy field,\" Oskvarek said. People use it to treat: - Stress and anxiety - PTSD - Depression - Difficulty sleeping - Low mood - Pain - High blood pressure - Fibromyalgia - Surgical recovery - Cancer symptoms Reiki can also encourage you to examine your emotional responses and let go of negative emotions like anger and resentment. You can use Reiki in conjunction with conventional medical treatments, other holistic or medical therapies and alternative or complementary therapies. How can you find a Reiki practitioner? You can search for a Reiki practitioner in your area online through sites like [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/).
