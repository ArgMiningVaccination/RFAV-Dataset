Sales of health products including vitamin C effervescent tablets, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) brand Banlangen, and Xiao Chaihu (herbal formula) saw big increases. These supplements are used to help prevent fever, cold, and other respiratory symptoms. JD said the virus outbreak was the cause of the surge consumption, and its higher online sales was attributed to consumers preferring to order delivery online instead of going to supermarket to purchase products. 'Blue-hat' charm: Sirio Pharma gains approval for three probiotics formulations Sirio Pharma has obtained the 'blue-hat' approval for three of its probiotic formulations.
