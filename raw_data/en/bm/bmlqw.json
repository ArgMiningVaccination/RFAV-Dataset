Practiced for over 200 years throughout Europe and countries like India and the United States, homeopathy is a distinct medical practice that utilizes tiny doses of natural elements (i.e. derived from plants, elements from the periodic table, etc.) to stimulate the person's innate healing ability - the vis. Vis is the Latin root word for \"vitality\" and everyone is naturally born with it. As a homeopathic doctor, Dr. Sola's goal is to take a comprehensive case of the individual to understand their physical, mental, and emotional nature. Everyone has a unique makeup of how they perceive the world and how sensitive they are to it. Dr. Sola would be prescribing a homeopathic remedy that matches the person, rather than treating the symptoms or a diagnosis. Homeopathy incorporates the whole person - their mind, body, and soul - by treating from the inside out. The Philosophy Behind Homeopathy The concept behind homeopathy derives from the Law of Similars: \"Like cures like.\" A vaccine works by allowing the body to memorize a weakened version of a harmful organism (i.e. virus, bacterial toxin, etc.) and build an active acquired immunity towards it. Similar to the idea of how a vaccine works, a homeopathic remedy, which is a very small dose of a potentially harmful substance found in nature, would cure the same problem that it would create in an otherwise healthy person. Under the strict guidelines of being FDA-regulated, homeopathic medicine is made to be quite safe and effective as it is non-allergenic, non-toxic, and free of side effects. Homeopathic remedies treat all patients in every stage of life: infants, children, teens, adults, pregnant mothers, adults, and the elderly. Homeopathy is also popularly used in pets as well. Those who practice and administer homeopathic medicine include professionally-trained homeopathic doctors, naturopathic doctors, medical doctors, osteopathic doctors, chiropractors, and homeopathic veterinarians. The Art of Homeopathy The same medicine given to two different people would reveal different results and healing time. This is because everyone is born with a certain constitution. Some constitutions are stronger and more resilient, while others are more sensitive and delicate. This is why we carry ourselves differently and why one person's sneeze or burst of laughter sounds differently to another. Some people tend to run hot while others are freezing in the same room. Some people have health concerns in the physical sense through symptoms, while others struggle more in the cognitive and emotional realm. Homeopathic medicine is truly an art that no book can teach nor no algorithm could indicate a specific remedy. Finding the right homeopathic doctor that could truly observe and understand you as a person could make a world of a difference in how successful the outcome can be. With over 2,000 established homeopathic remedies, Dr. Sola will listen to and observe the individual, look for patterns and themes in their life, and find one homeopathic remedy that the individual needs at that point in their life. Returning that person back to their original constitution or essence will be Dr. Sola's goal as homeopathy works by peeling away the layers that the individual has built over time through experiences of heartbreak, pain and trauma.
