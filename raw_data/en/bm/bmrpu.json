She's so funny & personable, she made my recovery a breeze. Her staff was great, especially Nancy; she gave the best massages! Would highly recommend this clinic. Miya S. - 10/31/2018 Let's be honest here, in most instances, we go see a Chiropractor when either we were in a traffic collision (my situation) or for one reason or another, we are in a great deal of pain and need help for us feel better. I was in a four-car collision a few months ago on the freeway. I was in the front vehicle so I felt the hard impact of three other cars slam into the back of my car. As you could imagine, I was in a great deal of pain in my neck, shoulders, and throughout my back. I couldn't even sleep that night due to all the pain and soreness from the accident. I made an appointment the very next day at Nature's Remedy with Dr. Razipour. Honestly, Dr. Razipour and her entire staff were absolutely amazing in every respect. They are incredibly kind and very detailed-oriented in their treatment. They would see me consistently to make sure everything that could be done to help me feel better was being done, and it was. I am feeling much, much better since my traffic collision thanks to Dr. Razipour and her staff. Dr. Razipour herself was very involved herself in my treatment as well. Going over my treatment, diagnosis, and making sure all bases were covered to prevent any lingering issues from arising later. Dr. Razipour and her entire staff are very personable and truly care about actually making you feel better. I would never go to any other Chiropractor but Dr. Razipour in the future and I would highly recommend her office to anybody who is looking for a Chiropractor to help them feel better if they have been injured in any capacity. You're in great hands with Dr. Razipour's office. Business owner information DrMitra R. 3/4/2019 Thank you so much for your kind words Bobby. We are so happy you are feeling better.
