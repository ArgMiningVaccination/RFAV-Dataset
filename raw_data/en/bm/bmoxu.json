Before he entered politics, Mr Trump repeatedly claimed that giving children too many vaccines at once was a cause of autism, a theory which has been debunked by medical research. He said at a Republican debate in 2015 that there had been \"so many instances\" of children of people who work for his business becoming autistic after having vaccines. Mr Trump met on Tuesday with [Mr Kennedy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11007672/Bobby-Kennedy-Jr-to-marry-for-third-time.html), the nephew of President John F Kennedy and son of Robert F Kennedy, the former attorney general and presidential candidate. After the meeting, Mr Kennedy said the president-elect had asked him to chair a new commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity. \"President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it,\" he said. \"His opinion doesn't matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science.\" Mr Kennedy Jr has been one of the most notable opponents of the mandatory vaccination laws in place in most states. Speaking at the premier of an anti-vaccination film in 2015, he said vaccines were causing a \"holocaust\" across the US. \"They get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\" he said. \"This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\" In addition to Mr Trump and Mr Kennedy, [Robert de Niro, the actor, Jenny McCarthy, the television personality, and others have expressed their belief that vaccines can cause autism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/13/robert-de-niro-there-is-a-link-between-vaccines-and-autism/). At least 15 studies, involving hundreds of thousands of children, have been conducted and each has found that there is no correlation between vaccination and autism. \"We take the concerns seriously, we spend a lot of money trying to address those concerns, and the frustrating part is that when they are addressed people just choose not to believe it,\" Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Centre at the Children's Hosptial of Philadephia told the Telegraph last year.
