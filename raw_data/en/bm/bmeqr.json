In cases with oral lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, and lichen planus pigmentosa, where the main goal is to restrict the spread of the disease while reducing the number of lesions, homeopathy is strongly recommended. Restricting the further spread of lichen planus, an autoimmune disease that spreads, is also a commendable accomplishment. Some medicines that are used in lichen planus pigmentosus treatment - Sulfur Sulfur is the most effective and frequently used natural medicine to treat various types of skin illnesses, particularly in cutaneous lichen planus when the eruptions happen to deteriorate owing to the local application of other ointments and increase quickly. Patients with poor skin who have cutaneous LP with papules and severe skin dryness respond effectively to sulfur. This medication works great for treating severe itching in breakouts. Scratching leaves a mark and offers some relief from itching. Scratching may result in a burning feeling in these circumstances. In general, the itching gets worse at night and when you get warm in bed. These symptoms are indicative of the need for this homeopathic remedy. - Arsenicum Album When lichen planus has blue eruptions that are dry, rough, and scaly in appearance, Arsenicum Album is particularly effective. In these situations, scaling is intense. The eruptions can be very dry, which intensifies the itching and forces the sufferer to scratch all the time. The skin condition and discomfort aggravate, particularly at night, the more one scratches. In the later stages, when the plaques have disappeared and the underlying skin is hard, the medication Arsenicum Album is also recommended. When there are heavy scabs on the scalp due to LP, it is also beneficial. - Merc Sol One of the best natural treatments for mucosal lichen planus, particularly for oral lichen planus, is Merc Sol. When the patient's primary complaint is irregular cheek ulcers, Merc Sol is the recommended treatment. There are no clearly defined edges. The cheeks have an extremely unclean and unhealthy appearance. Along with these ulcers, the mouth also produces more saliva and has a terrible odor. - Anthrakokali Anthrakokali is a fairly uncommon natural remedy that can benefit a variety of people with lichen planus. Being uncommon does not imply that this natural remedy works less effectively than other widely used medications. When papular eruptions are conspicuously apparent on the hands and feet, anthrakokali begins to take effect. In males, the scrotum may also be covered by papules. In the case of papular eruptions, severe itching can occur. This medication also works well in situations of Lichen Planus where the area around the tibia is the predominant site. - Kali Iodatum When there are purple patches on the body, particularly on the legs, Kali Iodatum aids LP cases. These eruptions are often papular and dry. In many people, itching worsens primarily at night or in hot environments, including under heated bedcovers. Homeopathic medicines including Natrum Uriaticum, Apis Mellifica, Borax, Thuja Occidentalis, and Kali Chloratum have been discovered to be quite effective in treating the disease's disordered immunity, which is considered to be its primary cause. The length of the treatment in homeopathy depends on how long the patient has been ill. The length of the required treatment depends on how chronic the condition is. If steroids were administered for a longer amount of time during the initial treatment, the result is a complex disease that is difficult to manage.

After carefully examining your prior Lichen Planus therapies and medications that you have used, a homeopathic treatment plan for Lichen Planus is developed.
