Routine Prenatal Hepatitis B Screening A. All pregnant women are to be screened for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on the first prenatal visit, or within 15 days, but no later than the time of delivery, as stated in PA Code \u00a727.99 (a). If the patient is HBsAg negative: Record status in the medical record Provide a copy of the original lab report to the woman's delivery hospital Repeat HBsAg at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery if the patient is in any of the following high-risk categories: Recent or current injection drug use More than one sex partner in previous 6 months HBsAg + sex partner Evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease Symptoms of clinical hepatitis If the patient is HBsAg positive: Record status in the medical record Report the case to the Pennsylvania Department of Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program by contacting your local state health center or county/municipal health department, or through electronic laboratory reporting (ELR), and enter the information in the Pennsylvania National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA -NEDSS) Recall patient to clinic to inform of positive status, provide education and support and perform a medical evaluation. Order an HBV DNA test on the HBsAg -positive pregnant women. This test will guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal HBV transmission. AASLD suggests maternal antiviral therapy when the maternal HPV DNA is >200,000 IU/mL. Notify hospital maternity/neonatal/pediatric services of mother's HBsAg status. A copy of the original laboratory report should be provided to the hospital or birthing facility and to the HCP who will care for the newborn infant. B. Medical records of all pregnant women in the prenatal setting and all birthing hospitals should be reviewed for the HBsAg test when a woman is admitted for delivery. Revised 4/23 C. If a pregnant or delivering woman is admitted to the hospital and has not been screened or the test result is unavailable, HBsAg testing should be performed immediately by the hospital at the time of admission. D. It is recommended that all newborn infants born to mothers of HBsAg positive, or unknown status receives the first dose of single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. E. Full term infants who are medically stable and weigh >2,000 g born to HBsAg negative mothers should receive the first dose of single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. F. Preterm infants weighing less than 2,000 g born to HBsAg negative mothers should receive the first dose of single -antigen hepatitis B vaccine 1 month after birth or at hospital discharge (see Section IV). II. Management of Infants Born to HBsAg Positive Women Vaccination series for infants of birth weight 2,000 grams: Within 12 hours of birth, administer single antigen hepatitis B vaccine and Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG ) in different limbs The 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at 1-2 months of age with a minimum of 4 weeks from the first dose The 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at 6 months of age (minimum age of 24 weeks ) with an interval of at least 8 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd dose Infants should be tested for HBsAg & anti -HBs (quantitative) after completing the hepatitis B vaccine series at age 9 months ( 1-2 mo. after the 3rd dose) Vaccination series for pre -term infants of birth weight < 2,000 grams: Within 12 hours of birth, administer single antigen hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG in different limbs Do not count the birth dose as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered The 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at the chronological age of 1- 2 months The 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given 1 -2 months after the second . The 4th dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at the chronological age of 6 months (minimum age of 24 weeks) with an interval of at least 8 weeks between the 3rd and 4th dose Infants are to be tested for HBsAg & anti -HBs (quantitative ) after completing the hepatitis B vaccine series at chronological age 9 months (1-2 mo. after the 4th dose) Revised 4/23 III. Management of Infants Born to Women of Unknown HBsAg Status Vaccination series for infants of birth weight 2,000 grams: Within 12 hours of birth, administer single antigen hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g., presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg -positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg - positive mother. The infant should receive both HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth. If the mother is determined to be HBsAg positive, her infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age 7 days; the hepatitis B vacci ne series is to be completed according to the schedule for HBsAg positive mothers If the mother is determined to be HBsAg negative, the hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg negative mothers If the mother has never been tested to determine her HBsAg status or when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth, the hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to hepatitis B positive mothers. Administration of HBIG is not necessary for these infants. These infants should receive postvaccination serologic testing at age 9 months, and revaccination if necessary. Vaccination series for pre -term infants of birth weight < 2,000 grams: Administer single antigen hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth If the maternal HBsAg status cannot be determined within 12 hours of birth administer HBIG (0.5mL) because the immune response is less reliable in preterm infants weighing less than 2,000 grams Do not count the birth dose as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches the chronological age of 1 month The 2nd dose should be given at the chronological age of 1-2 months The 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given 1 -2 months after the second The 4th dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at the chronological age of 6 months but with an interval of at least 8 weeks between the 3rd and 4th dose Infants should be tested for HBsAg & anti -HBs (quantitative ) after completion of the hepat itis B vaccine series at age 9 months (1-2 mo. after the 4th dose) For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g., a hospital with a higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's Hep B vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered timely. Revised 4/23 IV. Preterm Infants weighing <2,000 g born to HBsAg Negative Mothers: Should have their first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine delayed until 1 month after birth or hospital discharge (even if weight is still < 2,000 grams). For these infants, a copy of the original laboratory report indicating the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. V. For All Infants Born to HBsAg + Mothers or Mothers of Unknown Status: Document immunization on the PA Immunization Card with the name, dose, date of vaccine and give to the infant's parent/ guardian . Report to DOH within 5 days of delivery by either method: \"Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Report,\" which can be found at www.health.pa.gov by searching for \"Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Report for Hospitals .\" PA-NEDSS as \"infant born to HBsAg positive mother .\" Instruct the parent/guardian to bring the PA Immunization Card to each medical appointment and update the card at each visit . VI. Testing for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Infants of HBsAg positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg & anti -HBs (quantitative) after completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series at age 9 months Testing should be performed 1-2 months after last dose To meet ACIP recommendations, HBsAg negative infants with anti -HBs levels > 10mIU/mL are protected an d need no further medical management HBsAg negative infants with anti -HBs levels <10mIU/mL or non -reactive results should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive post- vaccination serologic testing 1-2 months later. Infants who's anti-HBs remains <10mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by post - vaccination serologic testing 1-2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs<10mIU/ml may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3 - dose series, followed by post -vaccination serologi c testing performed 1 -2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Infants who are HBsAg positive should receive appropriate follow -up The results are to be forwarded to the local State Health Center or county/ municipal health department VII. Household and Sexual Contacts of HBsAg Positive Women All close contacts of HBsAg positive women are to be included on the attached Perinatal Hepatitis B Case and Contact Report List the date of birth and vaccination history Revised 4/23 Close contacts should be offered hepatitis B testing and vaccination Once this form is completed and forwarded to the state/local health department, appropriate contact and follow -up will be completed to provide hepatitis B testing and possible vaccination for the close contacts for those with no financial means The link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's The Pink Book, Hepatitis B Chapter: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/hepb.pdf .
