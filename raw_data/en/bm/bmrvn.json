METHODS Data were captured through the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) questionnaire (March-December 2021). Multivariable regression models accounted for age, gender, ethnicity, vaccine type, and background treatment. RESULTS Among 9462 complete respondents, 583 (6.2%) were SLE of SLE patients, major by 2.6%, hospitalisation by 0.2%.AE and hospitalisation frequencies were similar between patients with active and inactive SLE. Rashes were more frequent in SLE patients versus HC (OR; 95% CI: 1.2; 0.4-0.8) and nrAIDs (0.5; 0.3-0.8), (0.6; 0.4-0.9).Pfizer-recipients reported higher overall AE (2.2; 1.1-4.2) and injection site pain (2.9; 1.6-5.0) frequencies than recipients of other vaccines, Oxford/AstraZeneca-recipients more body ache, fever, chills (OR: 2.5-3.0), Moderna-recipients more body ache, fever, chills, rashes (OR: 2.6-4.3). Hospitalisation frequencies were similar across vaccine types. AE frequencies were similar across treatment groups, although chills were less frequent in antimalarial users versus non-users (0.5; 0.3-0.9). CONCLUSION While COVID-19 vaccination-related AEs were reported by four-fifths of SLE pa- tients, those were mostly minor and comparable to AEs reported by healthy individuals, providing reassurance regarding COVID-19 vaccination safety in SLE.

While four-fifths of SLE patients reported COVID-19 vaccination-related adverse events 129 (AEs), the majority were minor. 130 2. Frequencies of major AEs (2.6%) and hospitalisations (0.2%) were similar to those in healthy 131 individuals. 132 3. Active SLE yielded increased post-vaccine fever, fatigue, and tachycardia frequencies. 133 Background therapies had no influence. 134 135 136Page 6 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 20226137 Abstract 138 Objective: To determine COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) in the seven-day 139 post-vaccination period in patients with SLE versus autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs), 140 non-rheumatic autoimmune diseases (nrAIDs), and healthy controls (HC). 141 Methods: Data were captured through the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases 142 (COVAD) questionnaire (March-December 2021). Multivariable regression models accounted 143 for age, gender, ethnicity, vaccine type, and background treatment. 144 Results: Among 9462 complete respondents, 583 (6.2%) were SLE 40.5% AEs were 146 83.0% of SLE patients, major by 2.6%, hospitalisation by 0.2%. 147 AE and hospitalisation frequencies were similar between patients with active and 148 inactive SLE.

However, data concerning populations 165 considered vulnerable due to background diseases or ongoing immunosuppressant therapy, 166 such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are limited. Increasing knowledge 167 and experience on the management of COVID-19 has been pivotal in addressing the 168 controversies surrounding the use of or discontinuation of immunosuppression prior to 169 COVID-19 vaccination [2-6]. Current recommendations encourage COVID-19 vaccination 170 prior to B cell depleting therapy and withholding immunosuppression post-vaccination in some 171 circumstances, depending on agent and dose [7]. Furthermore, hesitancy for vaccination 172 remains a concern, especially among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) 173 [8,9]. Interestingly, toll-like receptor agonists used as COVID-19 vaccine adjuvants have the 174 potential to induce SLE flares via upregulation of the type I interferon pathway [10]. 175 We recently reported vaccine safety data from patients with idiopathic inflammatory 176 myopathies (IIMs) from the global COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases 177 (COVAD) study initiative, which demonstrated self-reported safety and tolerance for COVID- 178 19 vaccination, yet a higher frequency of skin rashes post-vaccination among dermatomyositis 179 patients, especially those with active disease during vaccination [11]. Similarly, we recently 180 reported data on COVID-19 vaccine safety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the 181 same survey, wherein most of the adverse events were minor and comparable to those reported 182 by healthy individuals. In that work, patients on methotrexate and antimalarial agents were 183 reported to have experienced fewer minor adverse events post-vaccination compared with RA 184 patients on other drugs [12]. The international vaccination against COVID in systemic lupus 185 (VACOLUP) study that comprised 696 patients with SLE showed an adequate safety and 186 tolerability profile for COVID-19 vaccination, with a minimal risk for disease flares, including Page 8 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 20228187 following mRNA vaccines [13]. However, assessment of relative risks was not possible in that 188 study due to the absence of a control group [13]. 189 There is a dearth of data in terms of the impact of disease activity or use of 190 immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapies on vaccine-specific adverse events (AEs) 191 in patients with SLE. Moreover, the paucity of data on COVID-19 vaccine safety in SLE from 192 diverse populations makes impossible their generalisability to the global population. The 193 present study from the COVAD initiative addresses the COVID-19 vaccine safety and 194 tolerance in the short term i.e., within seven days post-vaccination among patients with SLE 195 compared with patients with other AIRDs, non-rheumatic autoimmune diseases (nrAIRDs), or 196 healthy controls (HC), through a multi-centre patient-reported electronic survey. 197 198 Methods 199 Study design and data collection 200 We conducted an international, online, cross-sectional, multi-centre survey-based 201 study, as a part of the COVAD initiative [14]. A comprehensive patient self-reporting 202 electronic survey was developed, consisting of questions related to COVID-19 and AIRDs. 203 This questionnaire included demographic details, AIRD-specific diagnosis, treatment details, 204 current symptom status, COVID-19 infection history including symptoms, duration, and 205 complications (hospitalisation and requirement of oxygen therapy), COVID-19 vaccination 206 details, short-term (seven days) post-vaccination AEs (based on the Centre for disease control 207 and prevention criteria), and patient-reported outcome measures as per the Patient Reported 208 Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) tool [15]. After vetting by 209 international experts, pilot testing, revisions, validation, and translation into 18 languages, the 210 survey was hosted on an online platform i.e., http://surveymonkey.com and was circulated by 211 the international COVAD study group (106 physicians) across 94 countries (Supplementary Page 9 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 20229212 Table S1, available at Rheumatology online), as well as through numerous social media 213 platforms and online patient support groups. Convenience sampling was used and all 214 participants over the age of 18 years were included. Duplicate responses were removed 215 manually. Methods have been detailed at length in the published COVAD study protocol [14]. 216 Informed consent of the participants was obtained electronically through an initial 217 question in the online survey, prior to the main study questionnaire. No incentives were offered 218 for survey completion. Central approval was obtained from the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate 219 institute of medical sciences (SGPGIMS) ethics committee as per local guidelines and the 220 Checklist for Reporting results of the Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) was adhered to when 221 reporting results [16,17]. 222 223 Data extraction 224 Data were retrieved at the time of survey closure on the 30th of December 2021. Subjects 225 who had not received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine at the time of the survey 226 completion and subjects who had not completed the survey in full were excluded from the 227 analysis (Figure 1). Respondents who had received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine 228 and had completed the survey in full formed the study population that was deemed eligible for 229 analysis. Multiple relevant variables were extracted from the survey responses, including AEs 230 during the seven-day post-vaccination period. 231 232 Active and inactive disease 233 Active and inactive disease state four weeks prior to vaccination was assessed by the 234 patient's response to the question \"What was the status of your autoimmune disease in the four 235 weeks (prior to) before the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine?\". Responses of active and 236 worsening/static/improving disease were grouped together to designate \"active disease\".

Those who 238 responded \"I don't know\" or \"Other\" were assessed for activity at an individual basis based on 239 answers to the following questions: (i) What were your symptoms four weeks prior to 240 vaccination? (ii) If you have any swelling of your joints, how many joints are swollen? (iii) 241 Did you require an increase in the dose of any of these [referring to previous answers] 242 immunosuppressant medications (IS), or start a new immunosuppressant medicine within the 243 six months prior to the first COVID-19 vaccine? 244 245 Adverse events post vaccination 246 Seven-day AEs were categorised into injection site pain or reaction, minor AEs, major 247 AEs, and hospitalisations. Minor AEs included myalgia, body aches, fever, chills, nausea and 248 vomiting, headache, rashes, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, high pulse rate or palpitations, 249 rise in blood pressure, fainting, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, and chest pain. Major AEs 250 consisted of serious reactions to vaccination, requiring urgent medical attention, including 251 anaphylaxis, a marked difficulty in breathing, throat closure (choking), and severe rashes. AEs 252 not listed above were reported as \"others\" in an open-ended question. 253 254 Statistical analysis 255 As the survey was originally designed for patients with IIMs and distributed to IIM 256 patient groups, patients with IIM formed a disproportionately large subgroup and were 257 therefore excluded from the other AIRDs group prior to analysis to avoid selection bias. 258 Patients with SLE were excluded from the other AIRDs group. Comparisons were performed 259 for vaccination-related AEs in patients with active versus inactive SLE. Also, comparisons 260 between patients with SLE and patients with other AIRDs (IIM and SLE patients excluded) 261 were conducted, as well as between patients with SLE and patients with nrAIRDs, and between Page 11 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202211262 patients with SLE and HC. Patients with SLE and autoimmune disease comorbidities were 263 compared with those without autoimmune disease comorbidities. Autoimmune disease 264 comorbidities included other AIRDs and nrAIDs reported by SLE patients. Chi-squared ( 2) 265 and Mann Whitney U tests were used for comparisons between groups for categorical and 266 continuous variables, respectively. The variables that differed across SLE, other AIRDs, 267 nrAIDs, and HC in univariable analysis were included in multivariable binary logistic 268 regression analysis (BLR) with adjustment for baseline factors defined a priori i.e., age, 269 gender, ethnicity, country group defined by human development index (HDI), as well as factors 270 with p<0.200 in the univariable analyses. Stepwise forward regression methodology was used 271 to build the regression models starting with age, gender, ethnicity, and country group by HDI 272 first, followed by addition of other covariates. The results for continuous variables were 273 expressed as median (IQR) in view of the non-normal distribution of the data (by Kolmogorov- 274 Smirnov test and Shapiro Wilk test). In multivariable models, p<0.05 was considered 275 statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS version 26 276 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). 277 278 Results 279 Characteristics of study participants 280 Of 10679 survey participants with complete responses, 1227 patients with IIM (11.4%) 281 were excluded (Figure 1; Table 1). Of 9462 respondents forming the population under study, 282 583 were patients with SLE (6.2%), 3069 patients with other AIRDs (32.4%), (11.4%), and (50.0%). Within the total study population, 7028 284 (74.3%) respondents were females, the respondents' mean age was 42.2 \u00b1 14.8 years, and the 285 most frequently reported ethnicity was Caucasian (49.3%). The three most represented 286 countries were Turkey (16.1%), India (15.3%), and Mexico (13.3%; Supplementary Table S1).

Table 1 shows the type and proportion of patients with other AIRDs. 289 The most common vaccine received was Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) in 39.3%. The most 290 common immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory agents used by the SLE patients at the 291 time of survey completion were antimalarial agents (62.6%), followed by glucocorticoids 292 (55.6%) and azathioprine (14.4%; Table 1). Other population characteristics are shown in Table 293 1. 294 295 Population characteristics of SLE patients 296 Among the SLE patients, the mean age was 40.1 \u00b1 12.0 years, and the majority (94.5%) 297 were females. The most frequent ancestry was Asian (40.5%), followed by Caucasian (37,9%). 298 Seventy-one per cent had taken two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer-BioNTech 299 (BNT162b2) (42.9%) and Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) (11.7%) were the most 300 common vaccines received. The most common co-existing other AIDs within SLE patients was 301 thyroid disorder (n=46; 7.8%), type 1 diabetes (n=5; 0.8%), and haemolytic anaemia (n=8; 302 1.3%). 303 Patients with SLE were older than HC (median: 39 versus 34 years; p<0.001), but 304 younger than those with other AIRDs (median: 39 versus 49 years; p<0.001) and nrAIDs 305 (median: 39 versus 42 years; p<0.001) and had a higher female representation compared with 306 all other groups (p<0.001 for all comparisons; Table 1). Furthermore, differences were noted 307 regarding ethnicity and the proportion of vaccines received by SLE patients (Table 1). Patients 308 with SLE were more frequently on glucocorticoids compared with other AIRDs (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 7.7-12.8; on mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and antimalarial 311 agents compared with patients with other AIRDs (Table 1).Page 13 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202213312 313 Adverse events in SLE and comparisons with other subgroups 314 Overall, AEs within seven days following vaccination were reported by 484 (83.0%) of 315 the SLE patients; all these patients reported minor AEs (Supplementary Table S2, available at 316 Rheumatology online). Major AEs were reported by 15 patients (2.6%) and hospitalisation by 317 one (0.2%). Injection site pain was reported by 415 (71.2%) patients with SLE. 318 Among the minor AEs, the most frequently reported was fatigue (n=162; 27.8%), 319 followed by headache (n=147; 25.2%) and body ache (n=120; 20.6%; Supplementary Table 320 S2). Specific major AEs reported included anaphylaxis (n=3; others (n=11; SLE patients with self- 322 reported coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), none reported thrombosis (stroke, deep 323 vein thrombosis, or myocardial infarction) in the seven-day period post-vaccination, and none 324 reported chest pain, fainting, dizziness, or difficulty in breathing. Only minor AEs (n=7; 325 63.3%) were reported, mainly fatigue (n=6; 54.5%) and headache (n=3, 27.2%). 326 Within the SLE study population, 328 patients (56.3%) had active disease prior to 327 vaccination. The reported post-vaccination AEs were similar between those with active and 328 inactive disease except for higher patients 330 with active SLE (Table 2). Hospitalisation frequencies were similar between the two groups 331 (Table 2). A greater percentage of patients with self-reported active SLE were on 332 glucocorticoids (64.9% versus 43.9%; p<0.001) compared with inactive SLE patients; the 333 differences in AEs between patients with active and patients with inactive SLE persisted upon 334 adjustments for glucocorticoid dose and intake of other immunosuppressive or 335 immunomodulatory agents, yielding an OR of 1.9 for fever (95% CI: 1.1-3.2; p=0.012), an OR Page 14 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202214336 of 1.7 for fatigue (95% CI: 1.1-2.7; p=0.007), and an OR (95% CI: 1.8- 337 41.4; p=0.006). 338 Table 3, Supplementary Table S3 (available at Rheumatology online), and Figure 2 339 provide an overview of vaccination-related AEs based on the type of vaccine received by 340 patients with SLE. Overall, any AEs were reported more frequently by Pfizer-BioNTech compared with the rest. 342 Any minor AEs followed similar trends. Injection site pain was reported more frequently by 343 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine recipients (OR: 2.9; 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.6; 345 p=0.003) compared with the rest. 346 Major AEs were reported to be similar across recipients of different vaccine types. 347 Hospitalisation following vaccination was infrequent, with similar frequencies across 348 recipients of the various vaccine types. 349 Systemic minor AEs such as fever, chills, and body ache were more frequently reported 350 by Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine recipients 351 (OR ranging between 2.5 and 3.0; p<0.05 for all instances). All other minor AEs were similar 352 across recipients of different vaccine types (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3). 353 Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology 354 online, provide an overview of vaccination-related AEs stratified by the type of background 355 immunosuppressive therapy. The vaccination-related AEs were similar across background 356 treatment categories except for lower chills in SLE patients who were on antimalarial agents 357 (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9; not on antimalarials. 358 The hospitalisation frequencies were also similar across the various background treatment 359 groups.

Compared with HC, patients 364 with SLE had similar overall AEs frequencies, frequencies of injection site pain, overall minor 365 AEs, and hospitalisation frequencies, except for higher frequencies of patients with 367 SLE. In terms of absolute numbers, the patients with SLE who reported anaphylaxis were few 368 (n=3; 0.5%). When compared with other AIRD patients, patients with SLE reported similar 369 frequencies of overall AEs, minor AEs, major AEs, and hospitalisations, except for lower 370 frequencies of chills (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8; p=0.005) in SLE patients. Similarly, when 371 compared with nrAID patients, patients with SLE reported similar frequencies of overall AEs, 372 minor AEs, major AEs, and hospitalisations, except for chills that were less frequent in the SLE 374 population. 375 Supplementary Table S8, available at Rheumatology online, demonstrates that SLE 376 patients with autoimmune comorbidities (n=92; 15.8%) reported similar frequencies of overall 377 AEs, minor AEs, and major AEs compared with SLE patients without autoimmune 378 comorbidities (n=491; 84.2%), with the 1.1-12.1; p=0.033) that were more frequently 380 reported by SLE patients with autoimmune comorbidities. 381 382 Discussion 383 Rapid production of vaccines against COVID-19 was necessitated by the pernicious 384 impact of the pandemic on societies. However, the swift pace of vaccine development has Page 16 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202216385 resulted in hesitancy in a considerable proportion of the global population. This hesitancy has 386 been even more prominent in patients with chronic diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases, 387 patient groups not only considered more vulnerable to infections but also more prone to drug 388 reactions [8,9,18]. Patients with SLE are often on immunosuppressant therapies and/or 389 glucocorticoids, which may impact the biological responses to vaccines. In the present study, 390 we evaluated patient-reported post-vaccination AEs in patients with SLE and found overall 391 reassuring results; while 83.0% of patients reported AEs, these were typically minor and self- 392 resolving. Nevertheless, major AEs were reported by 2.6% of SLE patients and included 393 anaphylaxis, throat closure, and severe rashes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 394 study of this scale in terms of numbers, ethnic diversity, and global reach, to address COVID- 395 19 vaccination-related AEs over a seven-day post-vaccination period, with a focus on patients 396 with SLE and comparisons with patient populations with other AIRDs, nrAIDs, as well as 397 healthy individuals. 398 In analysis stratifying SLE patients into patients with active and inactive disease, 399 overall AE and hospitalisation frequencies were similar between the groups. However, active 400 SLE increased the chance for experiencing fever and fatigue by 1.6 and 1.5 times, respectively, 401 and the chance for experiencing tachycardia by 8 times. While the explanation underlying the 402 observed association between active SLE and post-vaccination tachycardia is unclear and 403 difficult to speculate upon, this is to the best of our knowledge the first time it is reported in 404 the literature. The association persisted upon adjustments for glucocorticoid doses and intake 405 of other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications. Lastly, SLE patients with 406 concurrent APS did not report thrombotic events post-vaccination, which is reassuring and 407 concordant with previous reports on patients with APS [19-22]. 408 In analysis stratified by vaccine type, AE frequencies reported by SLE patients were 409 overall similar across the different vaccine types, except for Pfizer recipients who reported Page 17 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202217410 overall AEs and injection site pain at a 2-fold and 3-fold higher extent compared with recipients 411 of other vaccine types, respectively, and Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna recipients who 412 reported a higher probability of some minor AEs e.g., body ache, fever, and chills. By contrast, 413 Sinopharm recipients less frequently experienced injection site pain. Major AE and 414 hospitalisation frequencies were similar across recipients of different vaccine types. These 415 findings were in line with those of the VACOLUP study, which reported similar frequencies 416 of AEs across vaccine types, and irrespective age or gender [13]. 417 Lastly, we performed a subgroup analysis stratifying SLE patients based on background 418 immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy. In this analysis, AE frequencies did not 419 differ across patient groups on different medications, with the exception of chills being less 420 frequently reported by patients who were on antimalarial agents compared with patients who 421 were not. Following conflicting initial signals, antimalarial agents were later disproved to be 422 of efficacy in managing patients with COVID-19 infection [23,24]. Patients with SLE who use 423 antimalarials are recommended to continue the antimalarial treatment during a COVID-19 424 infection without any dose adjustment. There have been speculations about cardiotoxicity and 425 electrocardiographic QTc prolongation with the use of antimalarials in COVID-19 infection, 426 with a corroborating meta-analysis of several studies [5]. However, in many COVID-19 427 infection treatment protocols, patients were given higher doses of antimalarial agents compared 428 with usual doses within rheumatology, e.g., hydroxychloroquine loading with 800 mg [25]. 429 Thus, SLE patients in the present study are anticipated to have received lower doses than those 430 shown to induce cardiotoxicity; it is worth mentioning that the recommended daily 431 hydroxychloroquine dose for patients with SLE is 5 mg/kg [26]. Moreover, many patients in 432 the studies that showed hydroxychloroquine-induced cardiotoxicity also received 433 azithromycin, another drug with potentiality to prolong the QTc [5]. Lastly, no signals were 434 seen for B cell depleting therapy regarding AE or hospitalisation frequency.

Firstly, the study was entirely based on 436 self-reported patient data, with no possibility for verification through medical charts or 437 healthcare professionals. Secondly, online surveys introduce inherent recall bias, as well as 438 selection bias due to an expected higher participation willingness in patients who experienced 439 AEs, a potential lack of internet access for individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and the 440 likely lower grade of data contribution by patients suffering severe disability. Thirdly, the focus 441 of the study was on short-term safety of COVID-19 vaccination, thus not contributing to the 442 knowledge on safety over a longer term. However, the study reaffirms the safety of COVID- 443 19 vaccination in SLE patients and is in agreement with existing evidence on COVID-19 444 vaccine safety within SLE populations of different studies [19,27-36]. Fourthly, it was beyond 445 the scope of this study to explore humoral responses to vaccines, which may also have impact 446 on the development of AEs. Nevertheless, the large number of study participants, the high 447 frequency of complete survey responses, and the wide geographical spread of survey 448 respondents constituted major strengths of the study. The anonymised and self-reported nature 449 of the questionnaire may also be considered a strength, by facilitating direct and likely unbiased 450 (without external influence) patient and HC representation. 451 In conclusion, the findings of the present study provide reassurance on the safety of 452 COVID-19 vaccination for the SLE patient population, adding to the body of literature that 453 addresses concerns and controversies around COVID-19 vaccination. Most AEs reported were 454 minor, self-resolving, and comparable in nature and frequencies to those reported by healthy 455 controls. Our results will hopefully allow greater confidence and better uptake of COVID-19 456 vaccines in this particularly vulnerable group of individuals, as advocated by European [37] 457 and American [7] guidelines. 458 459Page 19 of 47 Rheumatology 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac661/6839954 by guest on 30 November 202219460 Acknowledgments: 461 COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) Study Group Author List 462 The authors are grateful to all respondents for filling out the questionnaire.
