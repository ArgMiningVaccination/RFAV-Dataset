Of nearly 30,000 residency positions open, all but 1,041 were filled and announced on Match Day. An additional 939 were filled through SOAP, which is in its second year and has replaced the so-called scramble. The supplemental program aims to give residency programs and unmatched applicants a uniform, standardized way to find each other. Fourth-year allopathic medical students and prior-year allopathic graduates filled 662 of the openings through SOAP, while 90 slots went to osteopathic medical students and graduates. The remainder of the positions were filled by international medical school students and graduates, said the National Resident Matching Program. The specialty with the most unfilled positions after SOAP's conclusion was child neurology, with 17. Preliminary general surgery followed with 10, while the rest of the unfilled slots were in the single digits by specialty. "}
