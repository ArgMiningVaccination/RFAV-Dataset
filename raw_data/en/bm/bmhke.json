The evaluation of [safety signals](/en/glossary/safety-signal) is a routine part of [pharmacovigilance](/en/glossary/pharmacovigilance) and is essential to ensuring that regulatory authorities have a comprehensive knowledge of a medicine's benefits and risks. PRAC concludes review of signal of facial swelling with COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) has recommended a change to [Comirnaty](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)'s [product information](/en/glossary/product-information). After reviewing all the available evidence, including cases reported to the European database for suspected side effects ( [EudraVigilance](/en/glossary/eudravigilance)) and data from the scientific literature, [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) considered that there is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal association between the vaccine and the reported cases of facial swelling in people with a history of injections with dermal fillers (soft, gel-like substances injected under the skin). Therefore, [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) concluded that facial swelling in people with a history of injections with dermal fillers should be included as a side effect in section 4.8 of the [summary of product characteristics](/en/glossary/summary-product-characteristics) (SmPC) and in section 4 of the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Comirnaty. The benefit-risk balance of the vaccine remains unchanged. [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) concludes review of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets1 with Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) has now concluded its review of [COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/jcovden-previously-covid-19-vaccine-janssen) and confirmed, as [previously communicated](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood), that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects. In finalising the review, the Committee recommended on 20 April further refinement of the warning about thrombosis (formation of blood clots in the vessels) with thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) syndrome, which was listed previously in the [product information](/en/glossary/product-information) for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. The [product information](/en/glossary/product-information) will now also include advice that patients who are diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within three weeks of vaccination should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, patients who present with thromboembolism within three weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia. Lastly, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome will be added as an 'important identified risk' in the [risk management plan](/en/glossary/risk-management-plan) for the vaccine. Furthermore, the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) will provide a plan to further study the possible underlying mechanisms for these very rare events. [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) continues to closely review Comirnaty and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna for unusual blood clots with low blood platelets2 The [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) is closely monitoring whether mRNA vaccines might also be linked to cases of rare, unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, a side effect that has been reported in [Vaxzevria](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vaxzevria) and COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. Following a review of reports of suspected side effects, the [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) considers at this stage that there is no [safety signal](/en/glossary/safety-signal) for the mRNA vaccines. Only few cases of blood clots with low blood platelets have been reported. When seen in the context of the exposure of people to the mRNA vaccines, these numbers are extremely low, and their frequency is lower than the one occurring in people who have not been vaccinated. In addition, these cases do not seem to present the specific clinical pattern observed with Vaxzevria and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. Overall, the current evidence does not suggest a causal relation. EMA will continue to monitor this issue closely and communicate further if necessary. Topics of interests from enhanced monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines Enhanced safety monitoring in the form of pandemic summary safety reports is one of the commitments required from the [marketing authorisation holders](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) in the context of the [conditional marketing authorisation](/en/glossary/conditional-marketing-authorisation). [Marketing authorisation holders](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) are required to submit pandemic summary safety reports to EMA on a monthly basis. These reports are reviewed by the [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) and any areaof concern further investigated, if needed. PRAC assessing reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome with AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine As part of the review of the regular pandemic summary safety reports for Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, the [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) is analysing data provided by the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) on cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) reported following vaccination. GBS is an immune system disorder that causes nerve inflammation and can result in pain, numbness, muscle weakness and difficulty walking. GBS was identified during the [marketing authorisation](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation) process as a possible [adverse event](/en/glossary/adverse-event) requiring specific safety monitoring activities. [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) has requested the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) to provide further detailed data, including an analysis of all the reported cases in the context of the next pandemic summary safety report. [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) will continue its review and will communicate further when new information becomes available. PRAC assessing reports of myocarditis with Comirnaty and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna EMA is aware of cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart) mainly reported following vaccination with Comirnaty. There is no [indication](/en/glossary/indication) at the moment that these cases are due to the vaccine. However, [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) has requested the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) to provide further detailed data, including an analysis of the events according to age and gender, in the context of the next pandemic summary safety report and will consider if any other regulatory action is needed. Additionally, the [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac) has requested the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder) for [COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax) [-] also an mRNA vaccine - to monitor similar cases with their vaccine and to also provide a detailed analysis of the events in the context of the next pandemic summary safety report. EMA will communicate further when new information becomes available. 1Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome on a new or known [adverse event](/en/glossary/adverse-event)that is potentially caused by a medicine and that warrants further investigation. Signals are generated from several sources such as spontaneous reports, clinical studies and the scientific literature. More information can be found under [Signal management](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/pharmacovigilance/signal-management). [Periodic safety update reports](/en/glossary/periodic-safety-update-report), abbreviated as PSURs, are reports prepared by the [marketing authorisation holder](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder)to describe the worldwide safety experience with a medicine in a defined period after its authorisation. PSURs for [medicinal products](/en/glossary/medicinal-product)that contain the same [active substance](/en/glossary/active-substance)or combination [active substances](/en/glossary/active-substance), but have different [marketing authorisations](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation)and are authorised in different EU Member States, are jointly assessed in a single assessment procedure. More information can be found under . [Risk management plans](/en/glossary/risk-management-plan), abbreviated as RMPs, are detailed descriptions of the activities and interventions designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks relating to medicines. Companies are required to submit an RMP to EMA when applying for a [marketing authorisation](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation). RMPs are continually updated throughout the lifetime of the medicine as new information becomes available. More information is available under [Risk management plans](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/pharmacovigilance/risk-management/risk-management-plans). - Post-authorisation safety studies, abbreviated as PASSs, are studies carried out after a medicine has been authorised to obtain further information on its safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures. The [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac)assesses the protocols (aspects related to the organisation of a study) and the results of PASSs. More information can be found under [Post-authorisation safety studies (PASS)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/pharmacovigilance/post-authorisation-safety-studies-pass). [Referrals](/en/glossary/referral)are procedures used to resolve issues such as concerns over the safety or benefit-risk balance of a medicine or a class of medicines. In a [referral](/en/glossary/referral)related to safety of medicines, the [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac)is requested by a Member State or the European Commission to conduct a scientific assessment of a particular medicine or class of medicines on behalf of the EU. More information can be found under [Referral procedures: human medicines](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/referral-procedures-human-medicines). - Pandemic summary safety reports have been introduced as part of the enhanced safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines. [Marketing authorisation holders](/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation-holder)are required to submit these reports to EMA on a monthly basis. Their submission complements the submission of PSURs. For more information see [EMA's pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/pharmacovigilance-plan-eu-regulatory-network-covid-19-vaccines_en.pdf). Procedure Status Update [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac)continued its assessment. [Amfepramone-containing medicinal products - Article -31 Referral](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/referrals/amfepramone-containing-medicinal-products) [PRAC](/en/glossary/prac)continued its assessment.
