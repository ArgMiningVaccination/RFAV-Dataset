Truman lists more than 300 illnesses and the thinking patterns that are causally related to them. For Headaches, Tension & stress, she lists feelings such as: Hurt feelings going unexpressed, Feeling unable to control, and Unpleasant relationships, plus 6 other possible emotional causes that may be affecting you. She also lists hundreds of feelings, along with multiple antitheses for each that may be involved with your condition. Stress causes illness and illness causes stress. How do you know which Illness is in top priority (maybe you have Headaches, Heart Problems, and Obesity or some other combination of ill-nesses, all of which have multiple possible emotional causes, plus quite a few physical causes. There are also different emotional causes for the symptoms of Fat, Obesity, Over-Eating, and Overweight. How are you supposed to know whether it's Hidden anger, Seeking love & fulfillment or one of 20 other feelings that is causing your condition? Un Mind-Body Therapy, we have a method to identify the subconscious negative feelings that are involved, and a method for you to let go of them and replace them with the specific positive feelings that energetically neutralize them. You may also need to change some of your lifestyle choices, some relationships, or other causes of stress. If your therapy method up till now has been to take a pill for whatever is wrong with you according to your blood pressure and your lab tests, Mind-Body Therapy gives you a whole new window on the world. It is advantageous for you to have face-to-face/hands-on sessions with your therapist, but some work can be done remotely as well. In Mind-Body Therapy, you can take that journey from Confusion (Yankin' & Crankin') to Clarity (Self-Awareness/That Was Then, This is Now) to Focus (Self-Knowledge/There's Life After) to Peace. xv. Preface In 1966, after graduating from UC Berkeley and working in San Francisco for several years, I became a student at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa and ended up in practice with my first husband in Attleboro, MA. I used to treat about 40 patients per day, using full spine vertebral adjusting. The premise for this treatment is that bones out of place in the spine are putting pressure on nerves and causing symptoms. The chiropractic adjustment has the purpose of putting the vertebrae back into their proper alignment, thus relieving the symptoms. I did hundreds of thousands of treatments with this work before I learned about bio-energy healing in 1990. In 1998, after my second divorce, I moved to Laguna Beach, California for 5 years, where I had a practice in massage therapy and bioenergy healing. That's when I started writing the articles that became this book. In Mind-Body Therapy, we consider the many reasons why you may be having trouble with your health, happiness and success - what you eat, drink and breathe and how you exercise, rest and think, plus other causes of stress unique to each individual. People are complicated. In Mind-Body Therapy, I am looking to understand you and all your stressors. To treat you, I need to prioritize your issues and treat the most important ones first. When you embark on a course of Mind-Body Therapy, you should not be in a hurry. You did not get sick in a hurry and you are not going to get well in a hurry. Many things in you will have to change - both physical and emotional. I am located in Danville, VA USA and I have successfully treated people remotely. 1. Asthma and Allergies By: Dr. Judith Giustini According to The Merck Manual of Medical Information: Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow - usually reversibly - in response to certain stimuli and Allergies are considered to be inappropriate immune responses to normally harmless substances. If you have Asthma, you may become short of breath without warning, to the point of nearly suffocating. It affects more than 1700 Americans, mostly children. Asthma is thought to be a primary cause of crib death. If you have an Allergy, you are not alone. About one-third of people in the United States have an allergy. Some people are allergic to pollens, others are allergic to house dust, animal dander or foods. Some experts believe that asthma and allergies are a sign of chronic cellular dehydration and that cellular dehydration can cause early death. Some researchers say that asthma and allergies are associated with subconscious negative feelings such as chronic anxiety, fears, or being aggravated by someone or something. In Mind-Body Therapy, you can learn which subconscious negative feelings are associated with your symptoms and which positive feelings you need to replace them with to energetically neutralize them. Drugs cannot help you with dehydration or negative feelings. 2. A Problem Once Recognized is Half-Solved By: Dr. Judith Giustini Maybe you had been trying to ignore the few extra pounds on your body, but the scales at your doctor's office just said you are obese. Now you must recognize you have a problem. So now, the question is: what are you going to do about it? Doing nothing is one solution, if you don't mind the negative consequences to your health, happiness, and success. If you decide to do something, a whole field of choices opens up to you - different diets, diet classes, gym classes, potions, pills - lots of ways for other people to make money on your problem. If you choose to become a normal weight person, you will have decided to engage in a battle that will continue for the rest of your life. You will need weapons such as information about the calorie content of foods and beverages, content of various nutrients, etc. If you consume 100 calories per day more than it takes to maintain your weight, for 35 days, you will gain 1 lb. In obesity, there are many other aspects to consider: stress, culture, habits, social life, exercise, emotional baggage, etc. You may need special weapons to win your battle with these opponents, who are co-conspirators of your enemy Obesity. Once you recognize the problem, you are like Smoky Robinson, I can see clearly now. I can see all the obstacles in my way. Knowledge is power. It can help you get out of Confusion, so you can take charge of things in your life. 3. A Typical Mind-Body Therapy Session By: Dr. Judith Giustini When I am able to treat you in person: after we have discussed the items causing your stress, your blood pressure, your saliva pH and your urine pH, I will treat you in the Face-Up Position. I will use the resistance of the muscles in your arms and legs to gentle pressure as indicators of how your mind and body respond to the vibrations of the thoughts and feelings that are likely relevant to you. I will explain what is happening as we go along. Face-Up treatment consists of my gently holding points on your cranium while the control system of your mind and body is updating itself in response to your forgiving the subconscious negative feelings that have been polluting you and replacing them with the specific positive feelings that energetically neutralize them. When your brain cells have become updated, I will feel it with my fingers as your bio-energy pulse becoming balanced and at the correct rhythm. This may take minutes. In your Face-Down examination, I will be using the speed of resistance of your hamstring muscles against gentle pressure on the heel of your foot of your bent leg. This test reveals whether your body is functioning in the fight-or flight mode, the healing mode or the exhaustion mode. The contact points for my fingers will be on your neck and low back. When I am treating you remotely, we will use a different method. Remote therapy has been working pretty well, but some patients who live far away prefer to visit my town and take up lodging for a while. 4. About Judging People By: Dr. Judith Giustini According to The Law of Attraction, what you give is what you get. This is because your feelings have powerful vibrations that emanate into your energy fields and attract the experiences and relationships that resonate with them. If somebody commits a crime against you, there are legal remedies for that. Maybe you would not choose the same house, mate, job, etc. as the other person, but as a wise man said, That's why we don't all drive Fords. Sometimes we judge in others according to those things we do not like about ourselves. The Bible says, judge not lest you be judged. By judging the other person, you are inviting judgment upon yourself. What is the basis for your judgment? Probably some criteria from your belief system. How did that get there? Your belief system was programmed with your thoughts, feelings and beliefs about your experiences when you were very young. These opinions are very difficult to change. It is easier to criticize, condemn and complain about (at?) the other person than it is to examine the premise of your opinions, even though your judging is causing you to be a less popular person. In Mind-Body Therapy, we are seeking to identify the subconscious negative feelings that are interfering with your health, happiness and success as well as the positive feelings that energetically neutralize them. 5. About Your Motor Vehicle Accident By: Dr. Judith Giustini When you are involved in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, you experience an abrupt stop in your forward motion. If you are restrained by a seat belt, your head snaps back and forth, causing a whiplash, which can injure your spinal cord and the nerves traveling to your organs and your extremities, and may also injure your disks and your vertebrae. Injured nerves tend to heal up with scar tissue and they are never the same as they were before the accident. In years to come, you may develop arthritis or spurs in your spine that encroach on your nerves, causing pain and dysfunction. The injured disks between your vertebrae often deteriorate over time and this can cause compression on your nerves. This deterioration can be seen on X-rays and MRI's taken years after your accident.
