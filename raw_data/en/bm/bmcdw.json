The image for this lecture is the original oil painting for the first cover of Why People Believe Weird Things, commissioned by the publisher and painted by the artist Lawrence Berzon. Skepticism 101: How to Think Like a Scientist covers a wide range of topics, from critical thinking, reasoning, rationality, cognitive biases and how thinking goes wrong, and the scientific methods, to actual claims and whether or not there is any truth to them, e.g., ESP, ETIs, UFOs, astrology, channelling, psychics, creationism, Holocaust denial, and especially conspiracy theories and how to think about them.

This is accomplished through the concept of the Paradigm Shift. The discussion begins with non-scientific views of nature and then follows the development of scientific views and how/why they changed over many hundreds of years. This post concerns the first lecture in the series. Examples of paradigm shifts covered in this lecture series include: the shift from supernatural to nature interpretations of comets. the shift from astrology (Ptolemaic) to astronomy (Copernican revolution). the development of Copernican cosmology to a synthesis called Newtonian physics. the shift from Newtonian physics into Relativity Theory. Lecture 1 - PARADIGM SHIFT I This lecture demonstrates the power of natural explanations over supernatural ones. The main topic is about the various ways that people throughout history have interpreted comets when they appeared in the sky. The lecture beings with a discussion about what we currently know about comets and then transitions into what ancients believed. Two examples are given initially whereby major players in history misinterpreted the appearance of a famous comet (Halley's comet) as a sign from god to fulfill their destiny. The first example was Genghis Cohn who began his invasion of the west after comet Halley appeared in the sky, the second was William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066 after seeing comet Halley appear in the sky. A third and final example is given whereby a person saw Halley's comet in the sky but didn't leap to a supernatural conclusion. This person was Sir Issac Newton and his interpretation of the comet was quite different because he assumed that the comet was natural. By asking simple, empirical, questions about the nature of the comet, Newton, with the help of Edmund Halley, was able to make a prediction the comet would one day return. Comet Halley did return just as Newton and Halley predicted thus proving that comets were not supernatural but are 100% natural just like the planets and other celestial bodies. Resource added on: Thursday, April 4, 2013 at 5:22 pm Submitted by: William London This course was taught at California State University, Los Angeles during the spring 2012 semester Excerpt from Syllabus An introduction to skeptical inquiry as a foundation for drawing sound conclusions about popular claims made about health-related lifestyle practices, practitioners, facilities, products, services, and information portals. Healthy skepticism emphasizes careful consideration of scientific evidence and knowledge, and human susceptibility to deception and misperception. Learning Goals Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to: Discuss the major challenges, considerations, and science-based resources for distinguishing fact from fiction regarding information about health products, services, and practices promoted in the health marketplace. Apply key concepts of skeptical inquiry and science-based health care to plan and conduct meaningful descriptive studies concerning the promotion of health products, services, practices, and/or information in the health marketplace. Explain why testimonials regarding the effectiveness of health products, services, and practices are not trustworthy even when they are appealing. Evaluate quackery as a public health problem and efforts to combat quackery. Popular culture fills the mind with a steady diet of fantasy, from tales of UFO landings and alien abductions, haunted houses, and communication with the dead to claims of miraculous cures by spiritual healers and breakthrough treatments in 'alternative' medicine. The paranormal - and the pseudoscience that attempts to validate it - is so ubiquitous that many people lose sight of the distinction between the real and the imaginary, and some never learn to make the distinction in the first place. In this updated and expanded edition of \"Pseudoscience and the Paranormal\", the most comprehensive and up-to-date work of its kind, psychologist and neuroscientist Terence Hines explores the question of evidence for the paranormal and delves beyond it to one that is even more puzzling: Why do people continue to believe in the reality of the supernatural despite overwhelming evidence that it does not exist? Devoting separate chapters to psychics, life after death, parapsychology, astrology, UFOs, faith healing, alternative medicine, and many other topics, Hines examines the empirical evidence supporting these popular paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. New to this edition are extended sections on psychoanalysis and pseudopsychologies, especially recovered memory therapy, satanic ritual abuse, and facilitated communication. Also included are new chapters on 'alternative' medicine and environmental pseudoscience. Critiquing the whole range of current paranormal claims, this carefully researched, thorough review of pseudoscience and the paranormal in contemporary life shows readers how to carefully evaluate such claims in terms of scientific evidence. This scholarly yet readable volume is an invaluable reference work for students and general readers alike. \u2014Amazon This 16-page booklet is designed to hone your critical thinking skills. It includes suggestions on what questions to ask, what traps to avoid, specific examples of how the scientific method is used to test pseudoscience and paranormal claims, and a how-to guide for developing a class in critical thinking. Plus, you'll also find: (1) Sagan's Ten Tools for Baloney Detection and Shermer's Ten Questions For Baloney Detection. (2) How Thinking Goes Wrong: The 25 Fallacies of Thinking Problems in Scientific Thinking. (3) Eight Sample Syllabi: How to Teach a Course in Science & Pseudoscience. (4) The Most Recommended Skeptical Books. (5) Science and Skepticism: Science, Scientific Method and Skepticism \u2014 How They Contribute to Rational and Critical Thinking. \u2014Skeptic Do your students have the tools to distinguish between the true science of human thought and behavior from pop psychology? John Ruscio's book provides a tangible and compelling framework for making that distinction. Because we are inundated with \"scientific\" claims, the author does not merely differentiate science and pseudoscience, but goes further to teach the fundamentals of scientific reasoning on which students can base their evaluation of information. John Ruscio is Associate Professor of Psychology at Elizabethtown College, where he teaches courses in Research Methods and Statistics, and Research Methods in Social Psychology. His research interests include decision-making, classification and diagnosis and taxometric methods. \u2014Amazon Resource added on: Saturday, October 27, 2012 at 7:42 pm Submitted by: Mark Gifford Written by: Joseph Calabrese This book was required reading for the following course: \"Composition\" taught by Mark Gifford during the fall 2011 semester. Legends, Lore, and Lies: A Skeptic's Stance presents intriguing readings in five sections-urban legends, alternative medicine, the media's role in public gullibility, psychics and the paranormal, and pseudo science-to demonstrate the importance of critical examination and the differences between an opinion or assertion and a supported claim. Legends, Lore, and Lies offers a wealth of features, including: (1) Explorations of the powers and limits of skepticism in understanding topics like urban legends and pseudoscience that often are awarded uncritical acceptance in our culture. (2) An excellent explanation of skepticism, along with a number of tools that every reader can use to become a critical consumer of information. (3) A handful of \"believers\" point-of-view readings, which students are encouraged to examine with the tools they acquire throughout the text. (4) A variety of pedagogical tools including brief author biographies and questions preceding and following the readings that function as writing and discussion prompts. (5) End-of-chapter synthesis questions that provide writing suggestions for longer research and inquiry papers. \u2014Amazon Resource added on: Thursday, July 5, 2012 at 12:13 pm Suggested by: Jeffrey Behm Written by: Kenneth Feder This book was required reading for Jeffrey Behm's course, \"Fantastic Archaeology\" taught at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh during the fall 2010 semester. Committed to the scientific investigation of human antiquity, this indispensable supplementary text uses interesting archaeological hoaxes, myths, and mysteries to show how we can truly know things about the past through science. Examples of fantastic findings support the carefully, logically, and entertainingly described flaws in the purported evidence. By placing wildly inaccurate claims within the context of the scientific method, Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries demonstrates how science approaches fascinating questions about human antiquity and, in so doing, shows where pseudoscience falls short. \u2014Amazon \"The great astronomer and science writer challenges New Agers and explains social phenomena like UFOs, alien abductions, recovered memories, satanic cults, witch crazes, hallucinations, and how to detect baloney. This is Sagan's most popular book among skeptics, filled with quotable maxims, popular among college professors as a supplemental text for students, but a classic for everyone who cares about living in a sane and safe world without superstition.\" \u2014Skeptic \"Eminent Cornell astronomer and bestselling author Sagan debunks the paranormal and the unexplained in a study that will reassure hardcore skeptics but may leave others unsatisfied. To him, purported UFO encounters and alien abductions of gullibility, hallucination, misidentification, hoax and therapists' pressure; some alleged encounters, he suggests, may screen memories of sexual abuse. He labels as hoaxes the crop circles, complex pictograms that appear in southern England's wheat and barley fields, and he dismisses as a natural formation the Sphinx-like humanoid face incised on a mesa on Mars, first photographed by a Viking orbiter spacecraft in 1976 and considered by some scientists to be the engineered artifact of an alien civilization. In a passionate plea for scientific literacy, Sagan deftly debunks the myth of Atlantis, Filipino psychic surgeons and mediums such as J.Z. Knight, who claims to be in touch with a 35,000-year-old entity called Ramtha. He also brands as superstition ghosts, angels, fairies, demons, astrology, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster and religious apparitions.

Excerpt from Syllabus In this class students will utilize scientific critical thinking to examine the causes of various strange phenomena, including alleged paranormal events, magic, superstition, mystery illness, bogus therapies and pseudoscience. The main goal is to teach students how to think about weird things when they encounter them. Learning Goals By the end of this course, students should be able to do: Describe 3 scientific paradigm shifts that have occurred within the last 1000 years and explain why they happened. Describe the importance of temporal and spatial contiguity in relation to perceiving weird things. Describe how the environment selects superstitious behavior in organisms. o Describe the role that uncertainty plays in why people believe weird things. Describe the \"law of non-contradiction\" and why it must be true. Describe differences and similarities between logical and physical possibilities. Describe at least two principles of critical thinking. o Define \"knowledge\" and how it relates to evidence & belief. Demonstrate commonsense skepticism by proportioning your belief to the evidence. Define the \"criteria of adequacy\" and use them evaluate competing theories. Resource added on: Friday, May 18, 2012 at 12:21 pm Submitted by: Thomas Holtz & John Merck This course was taught at the University of Maryland during the fall 2011 semester. Excerpt from Syllabus What is Science, and how is it distinguished from other aspects of human thought? Physicist Richard Feynman famously said \"Science is what we do to keep from lying to ourselves\": words that get to the heart of the scientific enterprise. In an age when the activities of human society and technology can greatly affect Earth's systems for decades, centuries, and even millennia to come, we must be able to evaluate the merits of ideas as they relate to the actual natural world, independent of our personal, political, or philosophical preconceptions. In this semester, students will learn the basic intellectual \"tool kit\" of the scientific enterprise. They will discuss how Science differs from other fields of human endeavor, with a particular emphasis on distinguishing scientific ideas from pseudoscientific thinking. Students will also discuss the influence of our understanding (and often misunderstanding) of Science upon contemporary society. In this course we examine real cases of Science gone bad, and the effect (good and bad) of popular portrayals of Science and scientists has on the public. We begin exploring the details of the origin, use, and effects of the energy resources which we use to run our world. Learning Goals By the end of the semester, every student should be able to: Accurately employ understanding of logical fallacies and critical thinking skills in evaluating truth claims. Effectively distinguish between scientific and non-scientific approaches to the understanding of the natural world. Identify the major energy resources used in modern society. Write webpages using html code, upload them to a University server, and maintain their personal website. Resource added on: Friday, May 18, 2012 at 12:11 pm Submitted by: Travis Knowles This course was taught at Francis Marion University during the fall 2010 semester. Excerpt from Syllabus The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the methods of science, and especially its foundational philosophy of scientific skepticism. Students will learn the techniques for detecting pseudoscience; to examine pseudoscientific claims with skeptical thought; and to explore the limits and biases of personal experience. As a class, we discuss the value of a skeptical approach to human experience in general. The class is designed to be reading- and discussion-based. There will be weekly assignments from the texts, web pages, blogs, podcasts, and/or in-class videos.

Resource added on: Friday, May 18, 2012 at 11:50 am Submitted by: Shawn K. Stover This course was taught at Davis & Elkins College during the spring 2010 semester. Excerpt from Syllabus This course exposes students to ongoing biological research. Published articles from scientific magazines and peer-reviewed journals will be thoroughly analyzed and discussed. As part of the course, students will be invited to watch selected episodes of Penn & Teller's Showtime TV series \"Bullshit,\" which exposes and debunks pseudoscientific claims and paranormal phenomena. Learning Goals By the end of this course, students will be able to: Interpret scientific data, as presented in the literature. Determine whether authors' conclusions are valid, based on the available data. Suggest follow-up studies to address weaknesses in current research. Recognize the difference between science and pseudoscience. Resource added on: Monday, March 5, 2012 at 5:51 pm Submitted by: Evelyn Buday This course was taught at the University of Findlay during the fall 2011 semester. Excerpt from Syllabus This course examines the key issues associated with the scientific study of critical thinking. Although it's common to see courses on critical thinking in many domains (e.g. education & philosophy) the scientific examination of what critical thinking is and how it relates to problem solving is exclusively an advanced topic in cognitive science. Cognitive science is concerned with the study of the \"thinking mind\" and when we talk about \"critical thinking\" we base our examination on the hypothesis that while it's true that everyone \"thinks\" it's not true that everyone \"thinks well.\" At the core of this class is the idea that we can all fall prey to bad thinking strategies. In this course, students will learn how to be critical thinkers when dealing with a variety of situations, as well as learn how to tell the difference between science and pseudoscience. Students will focus primarily on how to think about weird situations, but if they can master the skills needed to effectively evaluate strange phenomena (e.g. UFOs) students can easily apply these skills to less bizarre situations (e.g. Will eating \"Cheerios\" really help lower cholesterol?). By the conclusion of this course students should be able to find answers for themselves (because everyone knows \"The Truth Is Out There\") and with good critical thinking skills they will be more likely to find it. Learning Goals Upon completion of this course students will be able to: Demonstrate scientific reading, and writing skills. Apply the science of critical thinking to unique situations. Discuss specific critical thinking & problem solving topics in depth. Understand the biological bases of behavior and mental processes. Use theories to explain and predict behavior and mental processes. Resource added on: Monday, March 5, 2012 at 5:43 pm Submitted by: Jeffery Behm This course was taught at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh during the fall 2010 semester. Excerpt from Syllabus In its broadest sense, Fantastic Archaeology describes those claims and interpretations about the archaeological record that are outside the orthodox mainstream of the scholarly and professional world of archaeology. This can range from new, as yet untested hypotheses that may become the orthodox interpretations to the outrageous claims that can be easily refuted. Students will examine this entire range of competing, non-orthodox interpretations of the archaeological record. This course has a much broader subject area than students are likely to encounter in other courses-even in an eclectic field like Anthropology. Students have the opportunity to bring knowledge and expertise acquired in other courses, or their general life experience, to the discussions.
