Rational Approach to Therapeutics Drugs should only be prescribed when they are necessary, and in all cases the benefit of administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risks involved. Bad prescribing habits lead to ineffective and unsafe treatment, exacerbation or prolongation of illness, distress and harm to the patient, and higher cost. The Guide to Good Prescribing (WHO, Geneva; 1994) provides important tools for training in the process of rational prescribing. The following steps will help prescribers to follow the rational approach to therapeutics. 1 Define the Patient's Problem Whenever possible, making the right diagnosis is based on integrating many pieces of information: the complaint as described by the patient; a detailed history; physical examination; laboratory tests; X-rays and other investiga- tions. This will help in rational prescribing, always bearing in mind that diseases are evolutionary processes. 2 Specify the Therapeutic Objective Doctors must clearly state their therapeutic objectives based on the pathophysiology underlying the clinical situ - ation. Very often physicians are required to select more than one therapeutic goal for each patient. 3 Selecting Therapeutic Strategies The selected strategy should be agreed with the patient; this agreement on outcome, and how it may be achieved, is termed concordance. The selected treatment can be non-pharmacological and/ or pharmacological; it also needs to take into account the total cost of all therapeutic options. a. Non-Pharmacological Treatment It is very important to bear in mind that the patient does not always need a medicine for treatment of the condition. Very often, health problems can be resolved by a change in lifestyle or diet, use of physiotherapy or exercise, provision of adequate psychological support, and other non-pharmacological treatments; these have the same importance as a prescription medi-cine, and instructions must be written, explained and XXVII NFI-2011monitored in the same way. b. Pharmacological Treatment Selecting the Correct Group of Drugs Knowledge about the pathophysiology involved in the clinical situation of each patient, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the chosen group of drugs, are fundamental principles for rational therapeutics. Selecting the Medicine from the Chosen Group The selection process must consider benefit/risk/cost information. This step is based on evidence about maximal clinical benefits of the medicine (efficacy) for a given indication with the minimum production of adverse effects (safety). It must be remembered that each medicine has adverse effects and it is estimated that up to 10% of hospital admissions in industrialized countries are due to adverse effects. Not all medicine-induced injury can be prevented but much of it is caused by inappro-priate selection of drugs. In cost comparison between drugs, the cost of the total treatment and not only the unit cost of the medi-cine must be considered. Verifying the Suitability of the Chosen Pharmaceutical Treatment for Each Patient The prescriber must check whether the active substance chosen, its dosage form, standard dosage schedule and standard duration of treatment are suit - able for each patient. Medicine treatment should be individualized to the needs of each patient. Prescription Writing The prescription is the link between the prescriber, the pharmacist (or dispenser) and the patient so it is important for the successful management of the presenting medical condition. Giving Information, Instructions and Warnings This step is important to ensure patient compliance and is covered in detail in the following chapter (Refer 2.11. Adherence (compliance) with medicine treat - ment). Monitoring Treatment Evaluation of the follow up and the outcome of treat - ment allow the stopping of it (if the patient's problem is solved) or to reformulate it when necessary. This step gives rise to important information about the effects of XXVIII NFI-2011drugs contributing to building up the body of knowl- edge of pharmacovigilance, needed to promote the rational use of drugs.XXIX NFI-20112. Factors Affecting Medicine Response 2.1. Variation in Dose Success and effectiveness of medicine therapy depends not only on the correct choice of medicine but also on the correct dose regimen. Unfortunately, treatment frequently fails because either the dose is too small or it is too large that it produces adverse effects amongst other factors. The concept of a standard or 'average' adult dose for every medicine is fir mly rooted in the mind of most prescribers. After the initial 'dose ranging studies on new drugs', manufacturers recom- mend a dosage that appears to produce the desired response in the majority of subjects. These studies are usually done on healthy, young male volunteers, rather than on older men and women with illnesses and of different ethnic and envi-ronmental bac kgrounds. The use of standard doses in the marketing literature suggests that standard responses are the rule, but in reality there is considerable variation in medicine response. There are many reasons for this variation such as medicine formulation, body weight and age, variation in phar - macokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excre - tion), variation in pharmacodynamics, disease variables, envi-ronmental and genetic variables, adherence to instructions and adverse effects and interactions etc. Some of them are described below. 2.2. Formulation The type of drug formulation is an important factor affecting its response, apart from its lipid solubility and so many other factors. Pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, emulsions, ointments, injectables, liposomes etc provide a mechanism for safe, effective, accurate, and convenient delivery of drugs to the target site. Poorly formu-lated drugs may fail to disintegrate or dissolve. Enteric-coated drugs are particularly problematic, and have been known to pass through the gastrointestinal tract intact. Some drugs like digoxin or phenytoin have a track record of formulation prob - lems, and dissolution profiles can vary not only from manufac-turer to manufacturer but also from batch to batch manufac-tured by the same manufacturer. Lately, biogeneric products (off patent biopharmaceuticals) have also been available in the pharmaceutical market. The production of biogenerics involves complex processes. 2.3. Body Weight and Age Although the concept of varying the dose with the body weight or age of children has a long tradition, adult doses have been XXX NFI-2011assumed to be the same irrespective of size or shape. Yet adult weights vary two to threefold, while a large fat mass can store large excess of highly lipid soluble drugs compared to lean patients of the same weight. Age changes are also important. Adolescents may oxidize some drugs relatively more rapidly than adults, while the elderly may have reduced renal function and eliminate some drugs more slowly. 2.4. Sex Females usually require smaller doses than males. Iron prep- arations and other haematinics are exceptions to this rule because of the blood lost by women during menstruation. There is a possibility that males metabolize benzodiazepines, estrogen containing preparations and salicylate at a faster rate than females. 2.5. Route of Administration It governs the speed and intensity of drug response. The indications for a drug may vary when route of administration varies. Example: Magnesium sulphate when administered orally- acts as a purgative, when administered topically- decreases swelling on sprained joints, and when administered intrave - nously- CNS depression and hypotension occur. 2.6. Tolerance The therapeutic effects of some medications are lessened in individuals over a prolonged period of use. Thus, a patient who has been using a drug for longer time, requires a higher dose so as to obtain the same therapeutic effect as produced by the drug when taken for the first time. This is called toler - ance. Opioids, benzodiazepines, 2 agonists, caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines, and barbiturates fall into this category. Cross- tolerance develops when the use of one drug causes a toler - ance to another. Alcoholics, barbiturate and narcotic addicts develop a cross-tolerance to sedatives and anaesthetics. These individuals require very large amounts of anaesthetics before surgical anaesthesia can be attained. 2.7. Synergistic Effect Several drugs when combined may show synergistic action in the form of either additive or supraadditive action or poten-tiation. A few examples are: a) Trimethoprim + Sulphamethoxazole. b) ACE inhibitor + Angiotensin Receptor blocker + Diuretic. c) Long acting 2 agonists + Inhaled steroids (Example- Salmeterol + Fluticasone)XXXI NFI-20112.8. Resistance Development of resistance to drugs is a common problem with antimicrobial agents (antituberculosis drugs, antileprotic drugs, antimalarial drugs etc). Rational prescribing and in turn compliance by the user will prevent the emergence of resist - ance. 2.9. Pharmacokinetic Variables 2.9.1. Absorption Absorption of a medicine is possible when it is present in solution form. Medicine absorption rates may vary widely between individuals and in the same individual at different times and in different physiological states. Drugs taken after a meal are delivered to the small intestine much more slowly than in the fasting state, leading to much lower medicine concentrations. In pregnancy gastric emptying is also delayed, while some drugs may increase or decrease gastric emptying and affect absorption of other drugs. 2.9.2 Distribution Medicine distribution varies widely: fat soluble drugs are stored in adipose tissue, water soluble drugs are distributed chiefly in the extracellular space, acidic drugs bind strongly to plasma protein albumin and basic drugs to muscle cells. Hence variation in plasma albumin levels, fat content or muscle mass may all contribute to dose variation. With very highly albumin bound drugs like warfarin, a small change of albumin concen-tration can produce a big change in free medicine concen- tration and a dramatic change in therapeutic action of a medicine. 2.9.3. Metabolism Medicine metabolic rates are determined both by genetic and environmental factors. Medicine acetylation shows genetic polymorphism, whereby individuals fall clearly into either fast or slow acetylator types. Medicine oxidation, however, is poly - genic, and although a small proportion of the population can be classified as very slow oxidizers of some drugs, for most drugs and most subjects there is a normal distribution of medicine metabolizing capacity, and much of the variation is under envi- ronmental control. Also refer 2.10.2. 2.9.4. Excretion Many drugs are eliminated by the kidneys without being metabolized. Renal disease or competitive tubular secretion of drugs can therefore slow down the excretion of certain drugs.XXXII NFI-20112.10. Pharmacodynamic Variables There is significant variation in receptor response to some drugs, especially central nervous system responses, for example pain and sedation. Some of this is genetic, some due to tolerance, some due to interactions with other drugs and some due to addiction, for example, morphine and alcohol. 2.10.1. Disease Variables Both liver and kidney disease can have major effects on medicine response, chiefly by the effect on metabolism and elimination respectively (increasing toxicity), but also by their effect on plasma albumin (increased free medicine also increasing toxicity). Heart failure can also affect metabolism of drugs with rapid hepatic clearance (for example lidocaine, propranolol). Respiratory disease and hypothyroidism can both impair medicine oxidation. 2.10.2. Environmental Factors and Genetic Factors (Pharmacogenetics) Many drugs and environmental toxins can induce cytochrome P450 oxygenases, leading to more rapid metabolism and elimination and ineffective treatment. Environmental pollut - ants, carcinogens, tobacco smoke, alcohol, anaesthetic drugs and pesticides can also induce metabolism. Diet and nutritional status also have an impact on pharmacokinetics. For example, in infantile malnutrition and in malnourished elderly populations medicine oxidation rates are decreased, while high protein diets, charcoal cooked foods and certain other foods act as metabolizing enzyme inducers. Sedative and hypnotics induce sleep better in calm environment and when administered at night. Pharmacogenetic variation will affect the medicine response, by 4-6 fold among different individuals. All major determinants of medicine response such as transporters, metabolizing enzymes, and receptors are controlled genetically. These factors in certain cases may result in toxicity- for example toxicity caused by inhibi-tory effect of isoniazid on phenytoin metabolism seems to be more significant in slow acetylators of isoniazid than in those patients who metabolize the drug more rapidly. The Appendix 10 summarizes the pharmacogenetic variation, the frequency of occurrence, drugs involved and the outcome. 2.11. Adherence (Compliance) with Medicine Treatment It is often assumed that once an appropriate medicine is chosen, the prescription correctly written and the medication correctly XXXIII NFI-2011dispensed, that it will be taken correctly then the treatment will be successful. Unfortunately this is very often not the case, and physicians overlook one of the most important reasons for treatment failure that is poor adherence (compliance) with the treatment plan. There are sometimes valid reasons for poor adherence. The medicine may be poorly tolerated, may cause obvious adverse effects or may be prescribed in a toxic dose. Failure to adhere with such a prescription has been described as 'intelligent non-compliance'. Bad prescribing or a dispensing error may also create a problem, and regarding which patients may have neither the insight nor the courage to question. Even with good prescribing, failure to adhere to treatment is common. Factors may be related to the patient, the disease, the doctor, the prescription, the pharmacist or the health system and can often be avoided. Low-cost strategies for improving adherence increase effectiveness of health interventions and reduce costs. Such strategies must be tailored to the individual patient. Health care providers should be familiar with techniques for improving adherence and they should employ systems to assess adherence and to determine what influences it. 2.11.1. Patient Reasons In general, women tend to be more adherent than men, younger patients and the very elderly are less adherent, and people living alone are less adherent than those with partners or spouses. Specific education interventions have been shown to improve adherence. Patient disadvantages such as illiteracy, poor eyesight or cultural attitudes (for example preference for traditional or alternative drugs and suspicion of modern medicine) may be very important in some individuals or societies, as may economic factors. Such disabilities or attitudes need to be discussed and taken account of. 2.11.2 Disease Reasons Conditions with a known worse prognosis (for example cancer) or painful conditions (for example rheumatoid arthritis) elicit better adherence rates than asymptomatic 'perceived as benign' conditions such as hypertension. Doctors should be aware that in most settings less than half of patients initiated on antihypertensive medicine treatment are still taking it a year later. Similarly, in epilepsy, where events may occur at long intervals, adherence is notoriously unsatisfactory. 2.11.3 Doctor Reasons Doctors may cause poor adherence in many ways-by failing to inspire confidence in the treatment offered, by giving too little or no explanation, by thoughtlessly prescribing too many XXXIV NFI-2011drugs, by making errors in prescribing, or by their overall atti- tude towards the patient. 2.11.4. The Doctor-Patient Interaction There is considerable evidence that this is crucial to concordance. 'Satisfaction with the interview' is one of the best predictors of good adherence. Patients are often well informed and expect a greater say in their health care. If they are in doubt or dissatisfied they may turn to alternative options, including 'complementary medicine' . There is no doubt that the medicine 'doctor' has a powerful effect to encourage confidence and perhaps contribute directly to the healing process. 2.11.5. Prescription Reasons Many aspects of the prescription may lead to non-adherence (noncompliance). It may be illegible or inaccurate; it may get lost; it may not be refilled as intended or instructed for a chronic disease. Also, the prescription may be too complex; it has been shown that the greater the number of medica-tions the poorer the adherence, while multiple doses also decrease adherence if more than two doses per day are given. Not surprisingly adverse effects like drowsiness, impotence or nausea reduce adherence and patients may not admit to the problem. 2.11.6. Pharmacist Reasons The pharmacist's behaviour and professionalism, like the doctor's, may have a positive impact, supporting adherence, or a negative one, raising suspicions or concerns. This has been reported in relation to generic drugs when substituted for brand-name drugs. Pharmacist information and advice can be a valuable reinforcement, as long as it agrees with the doctor's advice. 2.11.7. The Healthcare System The healthcare system may be the biggest hindrance to adherence. Long waiting times, uncaring staff, uncomfortable environment, exhausted medicine supplies and so on, are all common problems in developing countries, and have a major impact on adherence. An important problem is the distance and accessibility of the clinic from the patient. Some studies have confirmed the obvious, that patients farthest from the clinic are least likely to adhere to treatment in the long term. 2.12. Adverse Effects and Interactions An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) may be defined as 'any response to a medicine which is noxious, unintended and occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy'. ADRs are therefore unwanted or unintended effects XXXV NFI-2011of a medicine, including idiosyncratic effects, which occur during its proper use. They differ from accidental to deliberate excessive dosage or medicine maladministration. ADRs may be directly linked to the properties of the medicine in use, the so-called 'A' type reactions. An example is hypoglycaemia induced by an antidiabetic medicine. ADRs may also be unre - lated to the known pharmacology of the medicine, the 'B' type reactions including allergic effects, for example anaphy - laxis with penicillins. Thalidomide marked the first recognized public health disaster related to the introduction of a new medicine. It is now recognized that clinical trials, however thorough, cannot be guaranteed to detect all adverse effects likely to be caused by a medicine and hence necessitating post-marketing surveillance. Health workers are thus encour - aged to record and report to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre for any unexpected adverse effects with any medicine to achieve faster recognition of serious related problems. The National Regulatory Authority takes appropriate action on drugs showing serious ADRs. 2.12.1. Major Factors Predisposing to Adverse Effects It is well known that different patients often respond differ - ently to a given treatment regimen. For example, in a sample of 2422 patients who had been taking combinations of drugs known to interact, only 7 (0.3%) showed any clinical evidence of interactions. Therefore, in addition to the pharmaceutical properties of the medicine, the characteristics of the patients may be responsible for causing predisposition to ADRs. 2.12.2. Extremes of Age The very old and the very young persons are more susceptible to ADRs. Drugs which commonly cause problems in the elderly include hypnotics, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflamma- tory drugs, antihypertensives, psychotropics, digoxin etc. All children, and particularly neonates, differ from adult in their response to drugs. Some drugs are likely to cause problems in neonates (for example morphine ), but are generally toler - ated in children. Valproic acid is associated with increased risk of ADRs in children of all ages. Other drugs associated with problems in children include chloramphenicol (grey baby syndrome), antiarrhythmics (worsening of arrhythmias), acetylsalicylic acid (Reye's syndrome etc). 2.12.3. Intercurrent Illness If besides the condition being treated the patient concomi - tantly suffers from another disease, such as kidney, liver or heart disease, special precautions may be necessary to prevent ADRs. Remember also that, apart from the above factors, the XXXVI NFI-2011genetic make-up of the individual patient may also predispose to ADRs. 2.12.4. Drug Interactions Interactions (see Appendix 6) may occur between drugs which compete for the same receptor or act on the same physiolog - ical system. They may also occur indirectly when a medicine- induced disease or a change in fluid or electrolyte balance alters the response to another medicine. Interactions may occur when one medicine alters the absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination of another medicine, such that the amount which reaches the site of action is increased or decreased. Medicine-medicine interactions are some of the commonest causes of adverse effects. When two drugs are administered to a patient, they may either act independent of each other, or interact with each other. Interactions may increase or decrease the effects of the drugs concerned and may cause unexpected toxicity. As newer and more potent drugs become available, the number of serious medicine inter - actions is likely to increase. Remember that interactions which modify the effects of a medicine may involve non-prescription drugs, non-medicinal chemical agents, and social drugs such as alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and traditional remedies, as well as certain types of food. The physiological changes in individual patients, caused by such factors as age and gender, also influence the predisposition to ADRs resulting from medi-cine interactions. 2.12.5. Pharmaceutical Interactions Certain drugs, when added to intravenous fluids, may be inactivated by pH changes, by precipitation or by chemical reaction. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin lose potency after 6-8 hours if added to dextrose solutions, due to the acidity of these solutions. Some drugs bind to plastic containers and tubing, for example diazepam and insulin. Aminoglyco-sides are incompatible with penicillins and heparin. Hydro-cortisone is incompatible with heparin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2.12.6. Adverse Effects Caused by Traditional Drugs Patients who have been or are taking traditional herbal reme - dies may develop ADRs. It is not always easy to identify the responsible plant or plant constituent. For further details, refer to the Medicine and Toxicology Information Service if XXXVII NFI-2011available and/or to suitable literature. Appendix 6d summa- rises the Drug Herbal/Food Interactions. 2.12.7. The Effect of Food on Medicine Absorption Food delays gastric emptying and reduces the rate of absorp-tion of many drugs; the total amount of medicine absorbed may or may not be reduced. However, some drugs are pref - erably taken with food, either to increase absorption or to decrease the irritant effect on the stomach. Appendix 6d summarises the Drug Food Interactions. Recommendations Review the prescription to make sure that it is correct. Spend time explaining the health problem and the reason for the medicine. Counselling of patients. Establish good rapport with the patient. Explore problems, for example difficulty with reading the label or getting the prescription filled. Encourage patients to bring their medication to the clinic, so that tablet/capsule counts etc. can be done to monitor compliance. Encourage patients to learn the names of their drugs, and review their regimen with them. Write notes for them. Keep treatment regimens simple. Communicate with other health care professionals, to develop a team approach and to collaborate on helping and advising the patient. Involve the partner or another family member in elic- iting clinical history of the patient and explaining the advice. Listen to the patient. Pharmacist plays and important role as a connecting link between the physician and patient.2 to relieve/reduce body pain and antipy - retics are used to reduce elevated body temperature. Non- opioid analgesics are particularly suitable for relieveing or management of pain in musculoskeletal conditions whereas the opioid analgesics are more suitable for moderate to severe visceral pain. Those non-opioid analgesics which also have anti-inflammatory actions include salicylates and NSAIDs; they can reduce both pain and inflammation of chronic inflamma- tory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, but they do not alter or modify the disease process itself. For the manage - ment of rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) may favourably influence the outcome of the disease. The pain and inflammation of an acute attack of gout is treated with a NSAID or colchicine; a xanthine- oxidase inhibitor is used for long-term control of gout. Neuro- genic pain generally responds poorly to conventional anal - gesics; treatment can be difficult and includes the use of carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia anti-inflammatory activity such as acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. Non-opioid anal - or no anti-inflammatory activity include paracetamol.

Storage Store protected from light and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs 1.2 Opioid Analgesics Morphine is effective in relieving moderate to severe pain, particularly of visceral origin; there is a large variation in patient response. Weaker opioids such as codeine are suitable for mild to moderate pain. Morphine remains the most valuable analgesic for severe pain. In addition to pain relief it confers a state of euphoria and mental detachment; repeated administration may cause dependence and tolerance, but this should not be a deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness. Regular use may also be appropriate for certain cases of non-malignant pain, but specialist supervision is required. In normal doses common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation and drowsiness; larger doses produce respiratory depression and hypotension. Codeine is an opioid analgesic much less potent than morphine and much less liable, in normal doses, to produce adverse effects including dependency. It is effective for mild to moderate pain but is too constipating for long-term use.

Antacids Drugs 2. and Antiulcer Drugs Antacids (usually containing aluminium or magnesium compounds) can often relieve symptoms in ulcer dyspepsia and in non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux; they are also some - times used in non-ulcer dyspepsia but the evidence of benefit is uncertain. Antacids are best given when symptoms occur or are expected, usually between meals and at bedtime, Liquid preparations are more effective than solids. Aluminium-and magnesium-containing antacids (for example aluminium hydroxide being relatively insoluble in water, are long-acting if retained in the stomach. They are suitable antacids for most purposes. Magnesium-containing antacids have a laxative effect whereas aluminium-containing antacids may be consti-pating. H 2-receptor antagonists heal gastric and duodenal ulcers by reducing the secretion of gastric acid as a result of histamine H2-receptor blockade; they can also relieve gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. High doses of H2-receptor antagonists have been used in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, but a proton-pump inhibitor is now preferred. Maintenance treatment with low doses has largely been replaced in Helicobacter pylori positive patients by eradication regimens. Maintenance treatment may occasionally be used for those with frequent severe recurrences and for the elderly who suffer ulcer complications. Treatment of undiagnosed dyspepsia with H2-receptor antago- nists may be acceptable in younger patients but care is required in older patients because their symptoms may be caused by gastric cancer. H2-receptor antagonist therapy can promote healing of NSAID-associated ulcers (particularly duodenal). Treatment also reduces the risk of acid aspiration in obstetric patients at delivery (Mendelson syndrome).16 NFI-2011Antacids and by peptic ulceration that involves the stomach, duodenum and lower oesophagus. General and inex - pensive measures like introducing healthy life-style, stopping smoking and taking antacids should be promoted. The possi- bility of malignant disease should be considered in all patients over the age of 40 years who are suspected of having an ulcer. Gastric and duodenal ulcers are healed by 4-8 weeks treat - ment with H2-receptor antagonists but there is a high rate of relapse (greater than 70% over 2 years) requiring mainte- nance therapy. Relapses can be prevented very pylori which is causally associ- ated with most peptic ulcers (except those related to NSAID use). Eradication of H. pylori reduces the relapse rate to about 4-8%. This is undoubtedly cost-effective compared to the alternatives of long-term maintenance therapy with low-dose H 2-receptor antagonists or repeated treatment of recurrent ulcers. It is recommended that the presence of H. pylori is confirmed before starting eradication treatment, particularly for gastric ulcers. The urea breath test is used widely to test for H. pylori, but it may produce false negative results if used soon after proton-pump inhibitors or antibac- terials. Eradication regimens are based on a combination of an acid-reducing ('antisecretory') drug and antibiotics. The following model eradication regimen is suggested on the basis of its efficacy and simplicity (only doses suitable for adults are shown): Omeprazole 40 mg daily for 1 week plus Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for 1 week plus Amoxycillin 500 mg thrice daily for 1 week The decision on choosing an eradication regimen should take into account local resistance to antibacterials, cost and avail - ability of the necessary drugs. NSAID -Associated Ulcers Gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration may occur with NSAID use. To avoid this, emphasis should be on stopping NSAID use but this is not always possible. A proton-pump inhibitor may be considered for protection against NSAID- associated gastric and duodenal ulcers. An H 2-receptor antagonist may be effective for protection against NSAID- associated duodenal ulcers only. Patients who must continue NSAID therapy after ulcer 17 NFI-2011Antacids and Antiulcer Drugs development may take high-dose H2-receptor antagonists concomitantly, but ulcers tend to heal more slowly with H2-receptor antagonists if NSAIDs are continued. A proton- pump inhibitor such as omeprazole is more effective but it is also more expensive. In patients who can discontinue NSAID therapy after ulcer development, treatment with an H 2-receptor antagonist is effective, but a treatment period of up to 8 weeks may be necessary. A proton-pump inhibitor usually produces the most rapid healing. After healing, continued prophylaxis is required. Dyspepsia Dyspepsia covers pain, fullness, early satiety, bloating, or nausea. It can occur with gastric and duodenal ulceration and gastric cancer but most commonly it is of uncertain origin. Patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia should be advised to avoid smoking, alcohol and aggravating foods and to eat small regular meals to aid digestion. Non-ulcer dyspepsia tends to be self-limiting but antacids and H 2-receptor antagonists are often used to suppress gastric acid. Effective treatment is important in the presence of severe oesophageal ulceration to prevent longer term complications such as oesophageal stricture and carcinoma. Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) GERD (including non-erosive gastro-esophageal reflux and erosive esophagitis) is characterized by symptoms which include heartburn, acid regurgitation and sometimes difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia); esophageal inflammation (esophagitis), ulceration and stricture formation may occur and there is an association with asthma. The management of GERD includes drug treatment, lifestyle changes and, in some cases, surgery. Initial treatment is guided by the severity of symptoms and treatment is then adjusted according to response. For mild symptoms of GERD, initial management may include the use of antacids. H 2-receptor antagonists suppress acid secretion and they may relieve symptoms and permit reduc- tion in antacid consumption. Severe symptoms initially require a short-course of a proton-pump inhibitor. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Management of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome requires high dose H2-receptor antagonist treatment. The proton pump inhibitors are more effective particularly for cases resistant to other treatment but they are more expensive.18 NFI-2011Antacids and Antiulcer Drugs GERD; and mg; GEL 610 mg/10 ml; In combination as Tablet/Suspension/Gel/Syrup.

Antiallergics and Drugs used in Anaphylaxis 2525 NFI-2011Antiallergics and Drugs used in Anaphylaxis 3. Antiallergics and Drugs used in Anaphylaxis Antihistamines are used to treat drug allergies, food aller - gies, insect stings and some of the symptoms of anaphylaxis and angioedema. Drug treatment and other supportive care should not be delayed in critically ill patients. Specific precip- itants should be sought and if identified, further exposure avoided and desensitization considered. Drowsiness and sedation are particular disadvantages of the older antihistamines and the patient should be warned against driving or operating machinery. Other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, of antihistamines. Since antihistamines inter - fere with skin tests for allergy, they should be stopped at least one week before conducting a skin test. Allergic reactions of limited duration and with mild symp- toms, such as urticaria or allergic rhinitis, usually require no treatment. If on the other hand, symptoms become persistent, antihistamines constitute the mainstay of treat - ment. However, oral corticosteroids may be required for a few days in an acute attack of urticaria or for severe skin reactions. Oral corticosteroids are also used to relieve severe exacerbations in chronic urticaria, but long-term use should be avoided. Corticosteroids may be used topically to reduce inflammation in allergic rhinitis but should only be used systemically for this condition when symptoms are disabling. Allergic Emergencies Anaphylactic shock and conditions such as angioedema are medical emergencies that can result in cardiovascular collapse and/or death. They require prompt treatment of possible laryngeal oedema, bronchospasm or hypotension. Atopic individuals are particularly susceptible. Insect stings and certain foods including eggs, fish, cow's milk protein, peanuts and nuts are a risk for sensitized persons. Thera-peutic substances particularly associated with anaphylaxis include blood products, vaccines, hyposensitizing (allergen) preparations, antibiotics (especially penicillins), iron injec-tions, heparin drugs. Acetylsali-cylic drugs (NSAIDs) may cause bronchoconstriction in leukotriene-26 NFI-2011Antiallergics and Drugs used in Anaphylaxis sensitive patients. In the case of drug allergy, anaphylaxis is more likely to occur after parenteral administration. Resus-citation facilities should always be available while injecting a drug associated with risk of anaphylactic reactions. First-line treatment of a severe allergic reaction includes administering epinephrine, keeping the airway open (with assisted respiration if necessary) and restoring blood pres- sure (laying the patient flat, raising the feet). Epinephrine should immediately be given by intramuscular injection to produce vasoconstriction and bronchodilation and injection should be repeated if necessary at 5-min intervals until blood pressure, pulse and respiratory function have stabilized. If there is cardiovascular shock with inadequate circulation, epinephrine must be given cautiously by slow intravenous injection of a dilute solution . Oxygen administration is also of primary importance. An antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine is a useful adjunctive treatment given after epinephrine injection and continued for 24 to 48 h to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms and to prevent relapse. An intravenous corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone has an onset of action that is delayed by several hours but should be given to help prevent later deterioration in severely affected patients. Further treatment of anaphylaxis may include intravenous fluids, an intravenous vasopressor such as dopamine, intravenous injected or nebulized bronchodilator, such as salbutamol.27 NFI-2011Antiallergics and Drugs used in Anaphylaxis Steps in the of Anaphylaxis: 1.

Anti-Alzheimer and Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs 4.1 Anti-Alzheimer Drugs Alzheimer's disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenera- tive disorder characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. The disease mainly affects the older population and is the most common cause of dementia (early stage). Advancing age is one of the predominant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. As the disease advances behavioural changes such as confusion, irritability and aggression, mood swings, language break - down, long term loss of memory etc. appear. The biochemical mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis are suggested to be the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid and proteins in the brain, involvement of inflammatory cytokines, alteration in distribution of different neurotrophic factors and expression of their receptors etc. Alzheimer's Association has pointed out 10 warning symp- toms for this disease which are as under: 1. Memory loss 2. Difficulty performing familiar task 3. Problems with language 4. Disorientation to time and place 5. Poor or decreased judgement 6. Problems with abstract thinking 7. Misplacing things 8. Changes in mood or behaviour 9. Changes in personality 10. Loss of initiative There is no cure for this disease, drug therapy is mainly symp- tomatic and palliative in nature.

Effects Hepatotoxicity, effects. 43 NFI-2011Anti-Alzheimer and Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs 4.2 Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs The use of pharmacotherapy will depend upon the degree of incapacity of the patient and is generally not justified until symptoms compromise working ability and social rela- tionships; although levodopa is used in the early stages in some patients. Close supervision is then needed to ensure that treatment regimens are tolerated and that appropriate changes are made to the regimen as the disease progresses. The most effective form of therapy is a combination of levodopa and a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbi- dopa. The response to levodopa with carbidopa is a compromise between increased mobility and adverse effects. Dyskinesias may be dose limiting and increasingly frequent with increased duration of treatment. Many factors including tolerance and progression of the disease may result in complications after 2-5 years of treatment. 'End-of-dose' deterioration occurs when there is a reduced duration of benefit from a dose, resulting in disability and dystonias. The 'on-off' phenomenon is character - ized by sudden swings from mobility to episodes of akinesia, tremor and rigidity lasting from a few minutes to several hours. Amelioration of these effects can sometimes be achieved by administering levodopa in a sustained-release preparation or in a greater number of fractionated doses throughout the day. Psychiatric symptoms inducing disruption of sleep, vivid dreams and hallucinations are characteristic adverse effects that may occur at any time, especially in the elderly and may require dose reduction or withdrawal of levodopa. Treatment for idiopathic parkinsonism is often initiated with a dopamine receptor agonist such as bromocriptine. Supple - mentary use or the monoam - ine-oxidase-B inhibitor, selegiline can be of value either to enhance the effect of levodopa or to reduce 'end-of-dose' fluctuations and 'on-off' effects. Anticholinergic (more correctly termed antimuscarinic) drugs such as biperiden are usually sufficient in drug-induced parkinsonism. Drugs Used in Essential Tremor and Related Disorders: Essential Tremor: It can be treated with -blockers such as propranolol (120 mg daily) (chapter 13.4) which may be of value if the tremor results in physical or social disability.44 NFI-2011Anti-Alzheimer and Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs Dystonias: If no identifiable cause is found and the patient does not go into spontaneous remission, a trial of levodopa should be given to determine whether the patient has dopamine- responsive dystonia. If there is no response within three months, the drug should be withdrawn and small doses of an anticholinergic drug such as biperiden should be given. The dosage may be increased gradually and up to 16 mg daily may be tolerated. In patients who fail to respond to either levo- dopa or an anticholinergic, other drugs including diazepam, baclofen, carbamazepine or phenothiazines may be of value. Psychological treatments have also been used successfully in the management of dyskinesias. Chorea: Choreiform movements can be induced by certain drugs including levodopa, phenytoin and antipsychotic drugs. Hunt - ington's disease is the most common of the hereditary choreas. Drug treatment is symptomatic and does not alter the progres- sion of the disease. The aim of therapy is to reduce dopamin - ergic transmission which results from excessive or enhanced cholinergic activity. Antipsychotic drugs antagonize dopamine and usually lessen the chorea temporarily. Tetrabenazine, the dopamine-depleting drug, is used to control movement disor - ders in Huntington's chorea and related disorders. Tics: Tics which resemble choreiform movements are commonly associated with anxiety. However, in the more complex multiple tic disorder, Tourette syndrome, treatment with antipsychotic drugs may be required. Tardive Dyskinesia: It is associated with chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. It is characterized by involuntary, repetitive, choreiform movement of the cheek, mouth and fingers. The first step of treatment should always be discontinuation of the antipsy - chotic drug or dosage reduction if the underlying psychotic disorder permits.45 NFI-2011Anti-Alzheimer and Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs Biperiden Pregnancy Category-C extrapyramidal (but not tardive dyskinesias) and adjunctive treatment of parkinsonism.

Adverse Effects Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, dizziness, confusion, euphoria, hallucinations, impaired memory, anxiety, restlessness, urinary retention, blurred vision and rash. Angle-closure glaucoma of Epilepsy: Treatment of seizures should always be started with a single antiepileptic drug (AED), and the choice of an anticonvulsant should be made on an individual basis. The drug of choice will depend on the primary diagnosis, seizure type, efficacy of the drug and the patient's tolerance of treatment. If a drug fails to control the seizures after it has been used in full thera- peutic dosage for an adequate period, or if it is not tolerated, it should be gradually substituted with another drug, with the first drug being withdrawn only when the new regimen is established. If monotherpy is ineffective, next alternative drug should be started, and try to withdraw first drug if there was no response for that drug or continue with that if there was partial response for initial drug. Initial dose of the drug of choice should be determined on the basis of the degree of urgency, the size and age of the patient. It should be increased gradually until an effective response is obtained. All antiepileptics commonly produce neurological adverse effects at higher dose ranges and patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects to help in accurate dose titration. Except for phenytoin, it is rarely, useful to measure plasma-drug concentrations as an aid to dose adjust - ment. Non-compliance, inappropriate dosing and overdosing is a major impediment to effective antiepileptic treatment. Patients should ideally remain under supervision throughout treatment period. Withdrawal: Treatment is normally continued for a minimum of two years of seizure free period. In certain circumstances like in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs may need to be continued throughout life, because of the high relapse rate of seizure after AED withdrawal. Withdrawal should be extended over a period of several months because abrupt withdrawal can lead to recurrence of seizure and or/status epilepticus. A general rule for duration of tapering is how many years patient had taken that particular drug, over a period of so many months it should be tapered. In patients receiving several antiepileptic drugs, only one drug should be withdrawn at a time. Many adult patients relapse once treatment is withdrawn and it may be justified to continue 52 NFI-2011Anticonvulsants/Antiepileptics treatment indefinitely, particularly when the patient's liveli- hood or lifestyle can be endangered by recurrence of a seizure. Pregnancy and Lactation: Untreated epilepsy during pregnancy may cause harm to the fetus; there is therefore no justification for abrupt with - drawal of treatment although withdrawal of therapy may be an option if the patient has been seizure-free for at least 2 years; resumption of treatment may be considered after the first trimester. If antiepileptics are continued in pregnancy, monotherapy with the lowest effective dose is preferred, with adjustment made to take account of changes in plasma levels associated with pregnancy. There is an increased risk of birth defects with the use of anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, valproate and phenytoin. However, if there is good seizure control, there is probably no advantage in changing pregnant patients' antiepileptic drugs. In view of the risks of neural tube and other defects, patients who may become pregnant should be informed of the risks and referred for advice and pregnant patients should be offered counselling and antenatal screening. To counteract the risk of neural tube defects, adequate folate supplements are advised for women before and during pregnancy. In view of the risk of neonatal bleeding associated with carbamazepine, is recommended for the neonate and the mother before delivery. Antiepileptic drugs can be continued during lactation (see also Appendix 7b). Driving: Regulations are in place in many countries which may, for example, restrict driving by patients with epilepsy to those whose seizures are controlled. Further, antiepileptic drugs may cause CNS depression, particularly in the early stages of treat - ment and patients affected by adverse effects such as drowsi- ness or dizziness should not operate machinery or drive. Choice of Antiepileptic in Management of Convulsive Disorders Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures: Phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate are widely used in the treatment of these conditions. However, each of these drugs is associated with dose-related and idiosyncratic adverse effects and monitoring of haematological and hepatic func - tion is routinely not Seizures: Carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine and zonisamide are epilepsy. Absence Seizures: Both ethosuximide and valproate are recommended in the treatment of absence seizures (petit mal) and are usually well tolerated. However, ethosuximide can, rarely, cause lupus erythematosus and psychoses which call for immediate, but cautious, discontinuation. Absence seizures are commonly associated with tonic-clonic seizures and valproate is preferred since it has a broad spectrum of activity. Tonic Seizures, Atonic Seizures and Atypical Absence Seizures: Phenobarbital or phenytoin is widely used for tonic seizures, valproate or clonazepam for atonic seizures and clonazepam for atypical absence seizures. However, tonic seizures most of the times are associated with multiple seizures types like Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), where phenytoin and phenobarbitone should be avoided as they can precipitate other type of seizures. Myoclonic Seizures: Valproate is widely used and most effective for juvenile myoclonic seizures. As juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is associ - ated with a high relapse rate, it is often necessary to continue therapy indefinitely. Other myoclonic seizures are often resistant to treatment and some do not have an epileptic basis. Valproate or clonazepam can be of value in this case and other antiepileptic drugs may be useful in intractable cases. Both drugs are generally well accepted, although tolerance to clonazepam has been reported. Infantile Spasm (Infantile Myoclonic Epilepsy): Infantile spasms, which are often associated with severe brain damage, can be resistant to antiepileptic drugs. Drugs effec - tive in this type antipyretic such as para- cetamol is effective in controlling the temperature. Recurrent febrile convulsions or prolonged convulsions (those lasting >5 min) are treated with diazepam, either rectally in solution or 54 NFI-2011Anticonvulsants/Antiepileptics by intravenous injection, or intranasal or buccal midazolam, to prevent possible brain damage. Intermittent prophylaxis, with diazepam (or clobazam) admin - istered at the onset of fever, may prevent recurrence of febrile convulsions.Use of antiepileptics for continuous prophylaxis is controversial; it is probably indicated in only a small proportion of children including those who already have evident neuro-logical abnormalities, or who have had previous prolonged or focal convulsions. Phenobarbital may be used for this purpose but careful clinical monitoring and dosage adjustment are necessary in order to minimize the risk of adverse effects. Valproate can also be used. Status Epilepticus: Status epilepticus is a medical emergency which carries a high mortality rate. Initial management includes positioning the patient to avoid injury, supporting respiration including provi- sion of oxygen, maintaining blood pressure and the correc - tion of any hypoglycaemia; hypocalcemia or any other elec - trolyte disturbance; maintenance of the airway and assisted ventilation are crucial even when the seizures are controlled, because the drugs used in its management may cause respira- tory depression. Intravenous lorazepam, midazolam are often effective in status epilepticus. Lorazepam, which acts rapidly, should be administered first and should be followed immediately by a loading dose of phenytoin which has a longer-acting effect. When cannulation is difficult or impossible, diazepam may be administered rectally as a solution (absorption from supposi - tories is too slow for treatment of status epilepticus). Intrave - nous phenobarbital is also effective but is more likely to cause respiratory depression; it is used in refractory cases but should be avoided in patients who have recently received oral pheno - barbital. Rectal paraldehyde may also be used; it causes little respiratory depression and is therefore useful where facilities for resuscitation are poor. If seizures continue despite treatment, intravenous valproate, levetiracetam, midazolam infusion, propofol infusion, barbit - urate coma and general anaesthesia may be required. The underlying cause must be identified and remedied in all cases.55 NFI-2011Anticonvulsants/Antiepileptics Carbamazepine* (Refer Page No. 585) Pregnancy Category-D Schedule H Indications Partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation; trigeminal neuralgia; bipolar disorder.

Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives Acute diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality; frail and elderly patients are also at risk. In adults acute diarrhoea is the most frequent health problem of travellers and is increasingly common among HIV- infected persons. Assessment and correction of dehydration and electrolyte disturbance is the priority in all cases of acute diarrhoea. Symptomatic relief in adults may be warranted in some cases but antidiarrhoeals should never be used in chil - dren since they do not reduce fluid and electrolyte loss and may cause adverse effects. Diarrhoea persisting for longer than a month is known as chronic diarrhoea. A mild malabsorption syndrome, tropical enteropathy, is apparent in most healthy indigenous popu - lations of tropical countries. However the majority of cases of chronic diarrhoea have non-infectious causes including gluten-sensitivity, inherited metabolic disorders or inflamma-tory bowel disease. Bloody diarrhoea is usually a sign of invasive enteric infec - tion and should be treated with an appropriate anti-infective agent.72 NFI-2011Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives 6.1 Antidiarrhoeal Symptomatic Drugs in Adult Codeine* (Refer Page No. 10) Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Short-term symptomatic relief of acute diarrhoea in adult; pain.

Adverse Effects dizziness, drowsiness and skin reactions including urticaria; protected from light and moisture.74 NFI-2011Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives 6.2 Laxatives A balanced diet, including adequate fluid intake and fibre is of value in preventing constipation. Before prescribing laxatives, it is important to be sure that the patient is constipated and that the constipation is not secondary to an underlying undiagnosed complaint. It is also important that the patient understands that bowel habit can vary considerably in frequency without doing harm. For example, some people consider themselves constipated if they do not have a bowel movement each day. A useful definition of constipation is the passage of hard stools less frequently than the patient's own normal pattern and this should be explained to the patient since misconceptions about bowel habits have led to excessive laxative use which in turn has led to hypokalaemia and an atonic non-functioning colon. Laxatives should generally be avoided except where straining will exacerbate a condition such as angina or increase the risk of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids. Laxatives are of value in drug-induced constipation, for the expulsion of parasites after anthelminthic treatment and to clear the alimentary tract before surgery and radiological procedures. Prolonged treat - ment of constipation is rarely, necessary except occasionally in the elderly. There are many different laxatives. These include bulk-forming laxatives which relieve constipation by increasing faecal mass and stimulating peristalsis, stimulant laxatives which increase intestinal motility and often cause abdominal cramp, faecal softeners which lubricate and soften impacted faeces and osmotic laxatives which act by retaining fluid in the bowel by osmosis. Bowel cleansing solutions are used before colonic surgery, colonoscopy or radiological examination to ensure that the bowel is free of solid contents; they are not a treat - ment for constipation.75 NFI-2011Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives Bisacodyl* Pregnancy Category-B Indications Constipation.

Severely dehydrated patients must be treated initially with intravenous fluids until they are able to take fluids by mouth. For oral rehydration it is important to administer the solution in small amounts at regular intervals as indicated below. Treatment of Dehydration: WHO Recommendations According to the degree of dehydration, health professionals are advised to follow one of the three management plans. Plan A: No dehydration: Nutritional advice and increased fluid intake are sufficient (soup, rice, water and yoghurt, or even water). For infants aged under 6 months who have not yet started taking solids, oral rehydration solution must be presented before offering milk. Mother's milk or dried milk must be given without any particular restrictions. In the case of mixed breast-milk/formula feeding, the contribution of lactation must be increased. Plan B: Moderate dehydration: Whatever the child's age, a 4-h treatment plan is applied to avoid short-term problems. Feeding should not therefore be envisaged initially. It is recom-mended that parents are shown how to give approximately 75 ml/kg of oral rehydration solution with a spoon over a 4-h period and it is suggested that parents should be watched to see how they cope at the beginning of the treatment. A larger amount of solution can be given if the child continues to have frequent stools. In case of vomiting, rehydration must be discontinued for 10 min and then resumed at a slower rate (about one teaspoonful every 2 min). The child's status must be re-assessed after 4 h to decide on the most appropriate subsequent treatment. Oral rehydration solution should continue to be offered once dehydration has been controlled, for as long as the child continues to have diarrhoea. Plan C: Severe dehydration: Hospitalization is necessary, but the most urgent priority is to start rehydration. In hospital (or elsewhere), if the child can drink, oral rehydration solution must be given pending, and even during intravenous infusion (20 ml/kg every h by mouth before infusion, then 5 ml/kg every h by mouth during intravenous rehydration). For intra-venous supplementation, it is recommended that compound solution of sodium lactate (see chapter 28.2) is administered at a rate adapted to the child's age (infant under 12 months: 30 ml/kg over 1 h then 70 ml/kg over 5 h; child over 12 months: 78 NFI-2011Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives the same amounts over 30 min and 2.5 h respectively). If the intravenous route is unavailable, a nasogastric tube is also suitable for administering oral rehydration solution, at a rate of 20 ml/kg every h. If the child vomits, the rate of administra- tion of the oral solution should be reduced. Oral Rehydration Salts* Indications Dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Availability GLUCOSE SALT SOLUTION 5 and 37.5g. Sodium chloride g/litre of water Glucose (anhydrous) 13.5 g/litre of water When glucose and sodium citrate are not available, they may be replaced by Sucrose (common sugar) 27 g/litre of water Sodium bicarbonate 2.5 g/litre of water In cases of cholera, oral rehydration salts containing a higher concentration of sodium may be required to prevent hyponatraemia. Note: The solution may be prepared either from prepackaged sugar/salt mixtures or from bulk substances and water. Solutions must be freshly prepared, preferably with recently boiled and cooled water. Accurate weighing and thorough mixing and dissolution of ingredients in the correct volume of clean water is important. Administration of more concentrated solutions can result in hypernatraemia. Dose Oral 5g (single use): dissolve in water and drink; 37.5g: to reconstitute it with 1 litre of clean water. Adult- Fluid and electrolyte loss in acute diarrhoea; 200 to 400 ml solution after every loose motion. Precautions Renal impairment. Adverse Effects Vomiting- may indicate too rapid administration; hypernatraemia and hyperkalaemia may result from overdose in renal impairment or administration of too concentrated a solution.79 NFI-2011Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives Storage Store protected from moisture in a sachet preferably made of aluminium foil containing sufficient powder for single dose or for a day treatment or for use in hospital.80 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning 7. Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning 81 7.1 Non specific 82 7.2 Specific 8681 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning 7. Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning These notes are only guidelines and it is strongly recom- mended that poisons information centres (Appendix 5) be consulted in cases where there is doubt about the degree of risk or about appropriate management.82 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning 7.1 Non specific General Care and Non-Specific Treatment: All patients who show features of poisoning should generally be admitted to hospital. Patients who have taken poisons with delayed actions should also be admitted, even if they appear well; delayed-action poisons include acetylsalicylic acid, iron, lithium, and warfarin. The effects of modified-release or prolonged-release preparations are also delayed. However, it is often impossible to establish with certainty the identity of the poison and the size of the dose but information on the type and timing of poisoning may be useful for symptomatic management. Few patients require active removal of the poison. Most patients must be treated symptomatically and moni - tored. Particular care must be given to maintenance of respiration and blood pressure. Assisted ventilation may be required. Cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias often respond to correction of underlying hypoxia, acidosis, or other biochemical abnormalities. Hypothermia which may develop in patients who have been unconscious for some hour is best treated by wrapping the patient in blankets to conserve body heat. Convulsions which are prolonged or recurrent may be controlled by intravenous diazepam. In some situations removal of the poison from the stomach by gastric lavage may be appropriate (see below). Activated charcoal can bind many poisons in the stomach and therefore prevent absorp-tion. Active elimination techniques such as repeated adminis - tration of activated charcoal can enhance the elimination of some drugs after they have been absorbed (see below). Other techniques to enhance elimination of poisons after their absorption are only practical in hospital and are only suitable for a small number of patients and only to a limited number of poisons. Methods include haemodialysis and haemop-erfusion. Alkalinization of urine can be used to increase the elimination of salicylates. Forced alkaline diuresis is no longer recommended. Gastric Lavage: The dangers of attempting to empty the stomach have to be balanced against the toxicity of the ingested poison, as assessed by the quantity ingested, the inherent toxicity of the poison and the time since ingestion. Gastric emptying is clearly unnecessary if the risk of toxicity is small or if the patient presents too late. Emptying the stomach may be of value if undertaken within 1-2 h after ingestion. The main 83 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning risk is with inhalation of stomach contents and gastric lavage should not be undertaken in drowsy or comatose patients without assistance of an anaesthetist so that the airway can be protected by a cuffed endotracheal tube. Gastric lavage must not be attempted after corrosive poisoning or for hydro-carbon products which could be dangerous if aspirated. Emesis: Induction of emesis for the treatment of poisoning is not recommended. There is no evidence that it prevents absorp-tion of the poison and it may increase the likelihood of aspira- tion. Furthermore, the effects of the emetic substance may complicate diagnosis. Prevention of Absorption: Given by mouth activated charcoal can bind many poisons in the gastrointestinal system, thereby reducing their absorp-tion. The sooner it is given, the more effective it is, but it may be effective for up to 1 hour after ingestion of the poison. It may be effective several hour after poisoning with modified-release preparations or drugs with anticholinergic (antimus-carinic) properties. It is relatively safe and particularly useful for prevention of absorption of poisons which are toxic in small amounts, for example, antidepressants. Furthermore, repeated doses of activated charcoal enhance the faecal elimination of some drugs (that undergo enterohepatic or enteroenteric recycling) several hours after ingestion and after they have been absorbed, for example phenobarbital, theophylline.84 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning Activated Charcoal Indications Treatment of acute poisoning.

Contraindications Poisoning by hydrocarbons with high potential for harm if aspirated; poisoning by corrosive substances-may prevent visualization of lesions caused by poison. Precautions Drowsy or unconscious patients-risk of aspiration (intubate before administration via nasogastric or gastric tube); not poisoning (dicophane, DDT), cyanides, malathion and metal salts Adverse Effects Black stools; vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea; pneumonitis-due to aspiration. Storage Store protected from moisture. Calcium Disodium Edetate Pregnancy Category-B Indications Lead poisoning (acute and chronic) and lead encephalopathy. Availability AMPOULE 5 ml (200 mg/ml). Dose Intravenous injection Lead poisoning without encephalopathy: 1000 mg/m2/day as continous infusion for 5 days. Lead 1500 intravenous infusion (Final Concentration of edentate < 500 mg/100 ml), starting 4 h after first dose of BAL and after an adequate urine flow is established. Infusion is continued for 5 days. Intramuscular injection to be used if fluid overload is a concern. 1000 mg/m2/day divided into equal doses spaced 8 to 12 h apart. Lignocaine or procaine should be added to the injection to minimize pain at the injection site.85 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning Contraindications Anuria; patients with active renal disease or hepatitis; pregnancy (Appendix 7c). Precautions Ensure adequate urine output, pre-existing mild renal disease; patients with lead encephalopathy and cerebral edema may experience a lethal increase in intracranial pressure following intravenous infusion, the intramuscular route is preferred for these patients. Adverse Effects Renal tubular toxicity which may lead to acute renal failure, fever, chills, lacrimation, increased prothrombin time, pain at Poisoning 7.2 Specific Paracetamol Overdosage: Paracetamol in a dose of 10-15g or 150 mg/kg of paracetamol taken within 24 h may cause severe hepatocellular necrosis and less frequently renal tubular necrosis. The only early features of poisoning, nausea and vomiting, usually settle within 24 h. Persistence beyond this time, often with the onset of right subcostal pain and tenderness, usually indicates the development of liver damage which is maximal 3-4 days after ingestion. In spite of a lack of significant early symptoms, patients who have taken an overdose of paracetamol should be transferred to hospital urgently. Administration of activated charcoal should be considered if paracetamol in excess of 150 mg/kg or 12g, whichever is smaller, is thought to have been ingested within the previous hour. N-Acetylcysteine or N-methionine protect the liver if given within 10-12 h of ingesting paracetamol. Acetylcysteine, given intravenously is most effective within 8 h of overdosage, but is effective for up to and possibly beyond 24 h. Alternatively, methionine may be given by mouth provided the overdose was ingested within 10-12 h and the patient is not vomiting. However, acetylcysteine is the preferred treatment. Concur - rent use of activated charcoal and specific oral antidotes should be avoided. In remote areas methionine should be given, since adminis - tration of acetylcysteine outside hospital is not generally prac- ticable. Once the patient is in hospital the need to continue antidote treatment can be assessed from plasma-paracetamol concentrations. Opioid Analgesic Overdosage: Opioids cause varying degrees of coma, respiratory depression and pinpoint pupils. Naloxone is a specific antidote indicated if there is coma or bradypnoea. Naloxone has a shorter duration of action than many opioids so close monitoring and repeated injections are required depending on respiratory rate and depth of coma; naloxone may alternatively be given by intravenous infusion. The effects of some opioids such as buprenorphine are only partially reversed by naloxone. Acute withdrawal syndromes may be precipitated by the use of naloxone in patients with a physical dependence on opioids or in overdosage with large doses; a withdrawal syndrome may occur in neonates of opioid-dependent mothers.87 NFI-2011Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning and Carbamate Poisoning: Organophosphates are absorbed through the bronchi and intact skin as well as from the gastrointestinal tract. Initial treatment of organophosphate or carbamate poisoning includes prevention of further absorption by emptying the stomach by gastric lavage, moving patient to fresh air supply, removing contaminate d clothing and washing contaminated skin. A clear airway must be maintained. Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterases and thus prolong the effects of acetylcholine. Toxicity depends on the particular compound involved and onset after ingestion, skin exposure may be delayed. Atropine will reverse the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine and is used (in conjunction with oximes such as pralidoxime) with additional symptomatic treatment. Additional treatment for carbamate poisoning is generally symp- tomatic and supportive. Atropine may be given but may not be required because of the rapidly reversible type of cholineste- rase inhibition produced (oximes should not be given). Iron Poisoning and Iron and Aluminium Overload: Mortality from iron poisoning is reduced by specific therapy with desferrioxamine which chelates iron. Before administra-tion of desferrioxamine the stomach should be emptied by gastric lavage (with a wide-bore tube) within 1 h of ingesting a significant quantity of iron or if radiography reveals tablets in the stomach. Desferrioxamine is also used to diagnose and treat chronic iron overload. It is used in the diagnosis of aluminium overload and to treat aluminium overload in patients with end- stage renal failure undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. Heavy Metal Poisoning: Heavy metal poisoning may be treated with a range of anti- dotes including dimercaprol, penicillamine, potassium ferric hexacyanoferrate and edetate. Penicillamine is also used to promote excretion of copper in Wilson's disease. Methaemoglobinaemia: Methylthioninium chloride can lower the levels of methae- moglobin in red blood cells and is used in the treatment of methaemoglobinaemia.

Antiemetics Antiemetics are drugs effective against nausea and vomiting. They are typically used to treat motion sickness and the side effects of opioid analgesics, general anaesthetics and chemo- therapy induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients either alone or in combination. They act on the brain by preventing the stimulation of the vomiting centre (chemoreceptor trigger zone-CTZ). Some medications act on the gut by speeding up the rate at which the stomach empties and help to facilitate the quick transit of food through intestine (prokinetic action). Classification: 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists block serotonin receptors in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract: Ondansetron, Granisetron, Dolasetron stimu- lates upper gastrointestinal motility. It is effective against nausea and vomiting associated with gastrointestinal disor - ders or migraine, following surgery and chemotherapy and is also effective against radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. Combining metoclopramide with corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone) can improve its antiemetic effect in chemo-therapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide may be useful in the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastroparesis, as well as preoperatively in the prevention of aspiration syndromes. It is also used to facilitate intubation of the small bowel during radiographic examinations. It is not effective in the prevention or treatment of motion sickness. Metoclopramide may cause acute dystonic reactions with facial and skeletal muscle spasms and oculogyric crisis. These reac-tions are most common in the young (especially girls and young women) and the elderly; they occur shortly after the start of treatment and subside within 24 h of drug withdrawal. Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative. In addition to D 2 98 NFI-2011Antiemetics dopaminergic blockade it has pronounced histamine H1 and muscarinic receptor blocking properties. It is effective in the prevention and treatment of vertigo and motion sickness. Promethazine may be useful in the prevention and treatment of postoperative and drug-induced nausea and vomiting. It has limited effect on chemotherapy-induced mild to moderate emesis.

It is transmitted by the faeco-oral route and infection is usually caused by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food and drink. Asymptomatic carriers are common in endemic areas. In non-endemic areas, sympto mless carriers should be treated with a luminal amoebicide which will reduce the risk of transmission and protect the patient from invasive amoe - biasis. Diloxanide furoate is most widely used, but other compounds, including clefamide, etofamide and teclozan, are also effective. Treatment with diloxanide furoate is regarded as successful if stools are free of E. histolytica for one month. Several specimens should be examined in evalu-ating response to treatment. Symptomatic (invasive) amoebiasis may be classified as intestinal or extra-intestinal. Intestinal amoebiasis is either amoebic dysentery or non-dysenteric amoebic colitis. Extra-intestinal amoebiasis most commonly involves the liver, but may involve the skin, genito-urinary tract, lung and brain. Invasive amoebiasis is more likely in malnutrition, immu-nosuppression and pregnancy. Amoebic dysentery may take a fulminating course in late pregnancy and the puer - perium; treatment with metronidazole may be life saving. In less severe infection, metronidazole should, if possible, be avoided in the first trimester. All patients with invasive amoebiasis require treatment with a systemically active compound such as metronidazole, ornidazole and tinidazole followed by a luminal amoebicide in order to eliminate any surviving organisms in the colon. Combined preparations are useful. In severe cases of amoebic dysentery, tetracycline given in combination with a systemic amoebicide lessens the risk of superinfection, intestinal perforation and peritonitis. abscesses should be lanced needle aspiration. Giardiasis: Giardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis and is acquired by oral ingestion of Giardia cysts. Giardiasis can be treated with tinidazole in a single dose or with another 5-nitroimidazole 106 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives such as metronidazole ; both are highly effective and should be offered when practicable to all infected patients. Family and institutional contacts should also be treated. Larger epidemics are difficult to eradicate because of the high proportion of sympto mless carriers and because excreted cysts can survive for long periods outside the human host. Trichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is an infection of the genito-urinary tract caused by Trichomonas vaginalis and transmission is usually sexual. In women it causes vaginitis although some are asymptomatic. It is usually asymptomatic in men but may cause urethritis. Patients and their sexual partners should be treated with metronidazole or other nitroimidazole.

Storage Store protected from light and moisture.109 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives 9.2 Drugs Beta-Lactams: Beta-lactam carbapenems share a common structure; they are bactericidal, their mechanism of action resulting from inhibi - tion of peptidoglycan, a mucopeptide in bacterial cell walls. Benzylpenicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin are active against susceptible strains of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, spirochaetes and actinomycetes, are long-acting preparations which slowly release benzylpenicillin on injection. A range of penicillins with improved stability to gastric acid and penicillinases have been produced by substitution of the 6-amino position of 6-aminopenicillanic acid. Cloxacillin is an isoxazoyl penicillin which is resistant staphylococcal penicillinase. Broad-spectrum penicillins such as ampicillin are acid-stable Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but are inactivated by penicil - linase. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid are often necessary to provide activity against beta-lactamases produced by a wide range of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Cephalosporins are classified by generation, with the first generation agents having Gram-positive and some Gram-negative activity; the second generation drugs have improved Gram-negative activity and the third generation cephalosporin have a wider spectrum of activity, although may be less active against Gram-positive bacteria than first generation drugs, but they are active against Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Streptomyces cattleya. They have a broad spectrum of activity and are stable to most penicillinases. They should be reserved for severe infections resistant to other antibiotics. Penicillins may cause encephalopathy due to cerebral irritation. This rare, but serious adverse effect may result from very high doses or in severe renal failure. Penicillins should not be given by intrathecal injection because they can cause encephalopathy which may be fatal. Hypersensitivity: The most important adverse effect of penicillins is hypersensi- tivity which causes rashes and, occasionally anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. A careful history should be taken with regard to 110 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives previous allergic reactions. If rash develops, another antimicro- bial should be substituted. Allergic reactions to penicillins occur in 1-10% of exposed individuals, while anaphylactic reactions occur in fewer than 0.05% of treated patients. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria or rash immediately after peni-cllin administration are at risk of immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin. These individuals should not receive penicillin, rather a cephalosporins or another beta-lactam antibiotic may be used. Patients who are allergic to one penicillin will be allergic to them all because the hypersensitivity is related to the basic penicillin structure and about 10% of penicillin-sensitive patients will be allergic to cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. Individuals with a history of a minor rash (a non-confluent rash restricted to a small area of the body) or a rash occurring more than 72 h after penicillin administration are possibly not allergic to peni- cillin and in these individuals a penicillin should not be withheld unnecessarily for a serious infection; however, the possibility of an allergic reaction should be borne in mind and facilities should be available for treating anaphylaxis. Ampicillin, Amoxycillin, Amoxycillin with Clavulanic Acid active against certain Gram-positive and Gram- negative organisms. It is used to treat a wide range of infec-tions including otitis media, respiratory-tract and urinary- tract infections and gonorrhoea due to susceptible bacteria. However, ampicillin is inactivated by penicillinases including those produced by Staphylococcus aureus and by common Gram-negative bacilli such as Salmonella and Shigella spp. are resistant. There are geographical variations in the incidence of resistance and an awareness of local patterns is important. In some areas, oral use should be restricted to treatment of Shigella infections; it is given in an oral dose of 1g every 6 h for 7-10 days. Amoxycillin has a similar spectrum of activity to ampicillin, but is also inactivated by penicillinases. However, it is better absorbed after oral administration than ampicillin and higher plasma and tissue levels are achieved. Amoxycillin is preferred to ampicillin for the treatment of some infections including otitis media and respiratory-tract and urinary-tract infections. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. It has no signifi - cant antibacterial activity but in combination with Amoxycillin widens Amoxycillin's spectrum of activity and allows its use against Amoxycillin-resistant strains of bacteria. It is used in respiratory-tract, genito-urinary and abdominal infections, cellulitis, animal bites and dental infections.111 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Cloxacillin is used to treat infections due to penicillinase-pro- ducing staphylococci which are resistant to benzylpenicillin. It is acid-stable and may therefore be given by mouth as well as by injection. These antibiotics may also be administered with an aminogly - coside to increase their spectrums of activity. The penicillin and aminoglycoside should not be mixed before or during administration, because loss of aminoglycoside activity can occur on mixing. Benzylpenicillin and Phenoxymethylpenicillin: Benzylpenicillin remains an important and useful antibiotic but it is inactivated by bacterial beta-lactamases. It is effective for many streptococcal (including pneumococcal), gonococcal and meningococcal infections and also for anthrax, diph - theria, gas gangrene, leptospirosis, tetanus and treatment of Lyme disease in children. Pneumococci, meningococci and gonococci often have decreased sensitivity to penicillin and benzylpenicillin is no longer the first choice for pneumococcal meningitis. Benzylpenicillin is given by injection as it is inacti - vated by gastric acid and absorption from the intestinal tract is low. Depot preparations are used when therapeutic concentrations need to be sustained for several h. Benzathine benzylpeni - cillin or procaine benzylpenicillin provides a tissue depot from which the drug is slowly absorbed over a period of 12 hour to several days. They are the preferred choice for the treatment of syphilis or yaws. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is suitable for oral administration; it has a similar spectrum of activity but is less effective than benzylpenicillin. It should not be used for serious infections because absorption can be unpredictable and plasma concen-trations variable. Cephalosporins and Imipenem with third generation cefa- losporins. Ceftriaxone is used for serious infections such as septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis; it is used as a reserve antimicrobial to treat meningitis due to Streptococcus pneu- moniae in some areas where penicillin resistance is found. Ceftazidime is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria; it is used in the treatment of pseudomonal infections and in some areas is restricted to use only where gentamicin resistance is high. Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. As it is partially 112 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives inactivated by enzymatic activity in the kidney, it is adminis - tered with cilastatin which inhibits the renal metabolism of imipenem. It is active against many aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; in some areas it is reserve agent for the treatment of infections due to Acineto- bacter spp. and P . aeruginosa , which are resistant to other more usual treatments. Quinolones: Ciprofloxacin is active against both Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria. It is particularly active against salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, neisseria, Bacillus anthracis and pseudomonas. It is also active against chlamydia and some mycobacteria. Most anaerobic organisms are not susceptible. Ciprofloxacin is used with doxycycline and metronidazole to treat pelvic inflammatory disease. Nalidixic acid is an older quinolone effective in uncomplicated urinary-tract infections and, in the treatment of shigella in areas where it remains susceptible. Tetracyclines: Doxycycline is a tetracycline and is a broad-spectrum antibi otic effective for brucella and the spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). It is the preferred tetracycline since it has a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile than tetracycline. It is deposited in growing bone and teeth causing staining and occasionally dental hypoplasia. It should not be given to chil - dren under 8 years or pregnant women; in some countries, use in children under 12 years is contraindicated. Aminoglycosides: Aminoglycosides including gentamicin are bactericidal and active many Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Aminoglyco- sides are not absorbed from the gut and must therefore be given by injection for systemic infections. Excretion is mainly by the kidney and accumulation occurs in renal impairment. Use of gentamicin should be restricted to trained health personnel and care must be taken to ensure correct dosage and duration of treatment are not exceeded, because most adverse effects are dose related. The most important adverse effects are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and they are most common in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment. These groups and, if possible, all patients should be monitored for ototoxicity by audiometry. If there is impairment of renal function the dose interval must be increased; in severe renal impairment, the dose should also be reduced. Serum concen-113 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives tration monitoring avoids both excessive and subtherapeutic concentrations and can prevent toxicity and ensure efficacy. If possible serum concentrations should be monitored in all patients, but must be measured in infants, the elderly, in obesity, in cystic fibrosis, in high-dosage regimens, in renal impairment, or if treatment lasts for longer than 7 days. For most infections, doses of up to 5 mg/kg daily in divided doses are used if renal function is normal; higher doses are used occasionally for serious infections. Loading and mainte - nance doses are based on the patient's weight and renal func-tion (for example, using a nomogram) with adjustments based on plasma gentamicin concentration. Chloramphenicol: Chloramphenicol is a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is associated with serious haematological adverse effects and should be reserved for the treatment of severe infec- tions, particularly those caused by Haemophilus influenzae and typhoid fever. The oily suspension should be reserved for use in situations of catastrophic epidemics of meningo-coccal meningitis occurring mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, during which the medical services are overwhelmed by the epidemic and in which the overwhelming scale of the epidemic precludes any other form of antimicrobial therapy. Macrolides: Erythromycin is a macrolide; it has an antibacterial spec- trum that is similar but not identical to penicillin and is used as an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients. It is effective in respiratory infections, whooping cough, legion- naires' disease and campylobacter enteritis. Azithromycin is more active against some Gram-negative organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis . The concentration and persistance of azithromycin is much higher in the tissue than in plasma; a single dose of azithromycin is used in the treatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydia and trachoma. Azithromycin is not recommended if there is a possibility of gonorrhoea because macrolide resistance emerges rapidly when it is used in this setting. Metronidazole: Metronidazole has high activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Metronidazole by the rectal route is an effective alternative to the intravenous route when oral administration is not possible.114 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Nitrofurantoin: Nitrofurantoin is and Gram-negative urinary-tract pathogens and it is used to treat acute and recurrent urinary-tract infections. It is also used prophylactically in chronic urinary-tract infections. Sulfonamides and Trimethoprim: The usefulness of sulfonamides is limited by an increasing incidence of bacterial resistance. For many indications they have been replaced by antibiotics that are more active and safer. Sulfadiazine is used in the prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence. Sulfamethoxazole is used in combination with trimethoprim because of their synergistic activity. In some countries, indications for the use of this combination have been restricted. The treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infections must only be undertaken with specialist supervision where there are appropriate monitoring facilities. Trimetho - prim is also used alone for respiratory-tract infections and, in particular, for urinary-tract infections. Vancomycin: Vancomycin is not significantly absorbed from the gastroin - testinal tract and must be given intravenously for systemic infections which cannot be treated with other effective, less toxic antimicrobials. It is used to treat serious infections due to Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant 500 mg; KID TABLETS 125, 250 mg; CAPSULES 250, 500 mg; DR y S y RUP 125 and 250 mg per 5 ml; INJECTION 1 ml ampoule (100 mg/ml), 250 mg/vial; DROP 10 ml (100 mg/ml).

Diethylcar - bamazine is effective against both adult worms and larvae; a single weekly dose is normally effective as prophylaxis. During individual treatment, particularly of persons with heavy micro-filaraemia (>50 000 microfilariae/ml blood), a condition simu-lating meningoencephalitis occasionally occurs. This probably results from sludging of moribund microfilariae within cere- bral capillaries. The frequency of meningoencephalitis associ-ated with diethylcarbamazine therapy of loiasis is reported as 1.25%, with a mortality rate of about 50% in affected patients; treatment with diethylcarbamazine should be stopped at the first sign of cerebral involvement (and specialist advice sought). Permanent cerebral damage is common among patients who survive and this possibility should be considered when deciding on treatment. Treatment of heavily infected patients should thus begin at low dosage and corticosteroid and antihistamine cover should be provided for the first 2 to 3 days. Lymphatic Filariasis: Lymphatic filariasis variant of W. bancrofti infection. Indi - vidual treatment with diethylcarbamazine which has both microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal activity is effective. Total cumulative dosages of 72 mg/kg are generally recommended for Wuchereria bancrofti infections with half this dose used for Brugia malayi and B. timori infections. In all cases treat - ment is best initiated with smaller doses for 2-3 days to avoid the danger of immunological reactions. Rigorous hygiene to the affected limbs with adjunctive measures to minimize infection and promote lymph flow is important for reducing acute episodes of inflammation. In communities where filariasis is endemic, annual administra- tion of single doses of albendazole 400 mg with either diethyl-carbamazine (6 mg/kg) or ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg) is effective for interrupting transmission; this treatment is continued for at least 5 years. Trials in India and China have shown that the consistent use for 6-12 months of table salt containing diethyl-carbamazine 0.1% can eliminate W. bancrofti ; a concentration of 0.3% for 3-4 months may be required where B. malayi is endemic.153 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Diethylcarbamazine* Indications Treatment of loiasis; prophylaxis nematode infections; lymphatic filariasis; toxocariasis. Availability TABLETS 50 and 100 mg; S y RUP 5 mg/ml and 120 mg/5 ml. Dose Oral Adult and child- 11 mg/kg body weight daily in three divided doses on the first day.

Superfi - cial infections affect only the skin, hair, nails or mucous membranes whereas systemic fungal infections affect the body as a whole. Systemic fungal infections are sometimes caused by inhala - tion, ingestion or inoculation of primary pathogens and some- times by opportunistic invasion of commensals in patients with lowered host resistance. They are increasing in preva-lence not only because of the pandemic of HIV infection, but also because of the rise in illicit intravenous drug use in many countries and greater use of broad spectrum antibiotics and invasive medical procedures. In immunodeficient patients systemic fungal infections are often disseminated. Amphotericin B is a lipophilic polyene antibiotic; it is fungi - static against a broad spectrum of pathogenic fungi, spp. and against the Leishmania protozoa. It is used for the empirical treatment of serious fungal infections and is used in conjunc - tion with flucytosine to treat cryptococcal meningitis and systemic candidosis. Amphotericin B has to be administered parenterally as there is little or no absorption from the gastrointestinal tract; ampho-tericin B is liable to cause nephrotoxicity. Duration of therapy varies with the initial severity of the infection and the clinical response of the patient. In some infections a satisfactory response is only obtained after several months of continuous treatment. Intrathecal infusion has been used successfully in patients with meningeal coccidioidomycosis. Fluconazole an orally active synthetic imidazole derivative, possesses fungistatic activity against dermatophytes, yeasts and other pathogenic fungi. It is widely used in the treatment of serious gastrointestinal and systemic mycoses as well as in the management of superficial infections. Fluconazole is also used to prevent fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Flucytosine, is a synthetic fluorinated pyrimidine with a narrow spectrum of antifungal activity, particularly against Cryptococcus and Candida spp. In susceptible fungi, it is 5-fluorouracil by cytosine deaminase. Flucyto- sine is myelosuppressive and are associated with myelotoxicity.156 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Griseofulvin is a fungistatic antibiotic derived from Penicil lium griseofulvum with selective against pityriasis versicolor or candida infections. Griseofulvin is deposited selectively in keratin precursor cells of skin, hair and nails where it disrupts the mitotic apparatus of fungal cells thus preventing fungal invasion of newly-formed cells. It is unsuit - able for prophylactic use. Close attention should be given to hygiene and to possible reservoirs of reinfection in clothing, footware and bedding. Nystatin, a polyene antifungal antibiotic derived from Strepto- myces noursei, is effective against infections caused by a wide range of yeasts and yeast-like fungi. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and it is not absorbed from the skin or mucous membranes when applied topically. It is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of candidosis. Potassium iodide aqueous oral solution is a clear liquid with a characteristic, strong salty taste. It is effective against sporotrichosis and subcutaneous phycomycosis, which are chosis, amphotericin B is often effective in patients unable to tolerate iodides.

Neurocysticercosis occurs when the infection involves the brain. In man, echinococcosis is due to the larval stage of or E. or tumour-like infiltration (alveolar echinococcosis), respectively, in the liver, lungs, or other organs. 1. Diphyllobothriasis: In diphyllobothriasis, niclosamide or praziquantel in a single dose is highly effective. Hydroxocobalamin and folic acid supplements may also be required. 2. Echinococcosis: In echinococcosis, surgery (or, if this is not possible, a tech-nique such as 'puncture-aspiration-injection-reaspiration') is the treatment of choice for operable cystic disease due to Echinococcus granulosus but chemotherapy with benzimida - zoles, such as mebendazole and albendazole, may be of value as adjunctive therapy. Alveolar echinococcosis due to E. multi - locularis requires both surgery and long-term treatment with either mebendazole or albendazole to inhibit spread of the infection. In animal studies, albendazole and mebendazole have been found to be teratogenic. They are contraindicated for the treat - ment of cestode infections in pregnancy; pregnancy should be excluded before treatment with albendazole (non-hormonal contraception during and for 1 month after treatment). For single-dose or short-term use in pregnancy. 3. Hymenolepiasis: In hymenolepiasis, praziquantel is more effective than niclosa - mide, although resistance to praziquantel has been reported. Repeated treatment may be necessary to cure intense infec - tions or to eliminate the parasite within a family group or institution. 4. Taeniasis: In taeniasis, praziquantel is well tolerated and extensively absorbed and kills adult intestinal taenia worms in a single 165 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives dose. Praziquantel also kills T. solium cysticerci when taken for 14 days in high doses. It thus offers the prospect of a cure for neurocysticercosis, which has been treatable only by surgery, anti-inflammatory corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. However, because dying and disintegrating cysts may induce localized cerebral oedema, treatment with praziquantel must always be undertaken in a hospital setting. In addition, a corticosteroid is usually given to reduce the inflammatory response. Albendazole also kills neurocysticerci when given daily for one month; a corticosteroid or an antihistamine is also given to reduce any inflammatory reaction. The longer-established niclosamide acts only against the adult intestinal worms. Cestode infections due to T. solium, occurring during pregnancy should always be treated immediately (with prazi-quantel or niclosamide, but not with albendazole) because of the risk of cysticercosis. Intestinal Ascariasis: Ascariasis is an infection, usually of the small intestine, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm). Single doses of levami- broad-spectrum anthelmin are also effective. 2. Capillariasis: Capillariasis is caused by infection of the intestine with Capil - laria philippinensis . Prolonged treatment with mebendazole or albendazole offers the only prospect of cure. 3. Enterobiasis: Enterobiasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm, threadworm). All household members should be treated concurrently with a single dose of mebendazole, albendazole or pyrantel. Since reinfection readily occurs, at least one further dose should be given 2-4 weeks later. Piperazine is also effective but must be taken regularly for at least 7 consecutive days. 4. Hookworm Infections: Hookworm infections (necatoriasis); they are a cause of iron-deficiency anaemia in the tropics and sub-tropics. Ideally all cases of hookworm infection should be treated. However, when this is impracticable, priority should be given to women in second- and third-trimester of 166 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives pregnancy, children and debilitated patients. In hookworm, broad-spectrum anthelminthics are preferred wherever other nematode infections are endemic. Both mebendazole and albendazole are effective. In animal studies, albendazole and mebendazole have been found to be teratogenic. There is some evidence to suggest that the use of mebendazole in pregnancy is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects on the fetus. However, neither mebendazole nor albendazole should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy to treat nema-tode infections. Both drugs are contraindicated for the treat - ment of cestode infections in pregnancy. Levamisole is effective in the treatment of mixed Ascaris and hookworm infections and pyrantel has been highly effective in some community-based control programmes, although several doses are often needed to eliminate Necator ameri- canus infection. Patients with iron-deficiency anaemia caused by hookworm infection require supplementary iron salts and should receive ferrous sulphate (200 mg daily for adults) for at least 3 months after the haemoglobin concentration of 12g/100 ml is obtained. 5. Strongyloidiasis: Strongyloidiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. All infected patients should be treated. Ivermectin in a single dose of 200 \u00b5g/kg or 200 \u00b5g/ kg/day on two consecutive days is the treatment of choice for chronic strongyloidiasis but it may not be available in all coun-tries. Albendazole 400 mg once or twice daily for 3 days is well tolerated by both adults and children aged over 2 years and it may eradicate up to 80% of infections. Mebendazole has also been used but, to be effective, it must be administered for longer periods as it has a limited effect on larvae and hence the prevention of autoinfection. 6. Trichostrongyliasis: Trichostrongyliasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by Trichostrongylus spp. In symptomatic trichostrongyliasis, a single dose of pyrantel (10 mg/kg) or albendazole (400 mg) is effective. 7. Trichuriasis: Trichuriasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by Trichuris trichiura (whipworm). Chemotherapy is required whenever symptoms develop or when faecal samples are found to be heavily contaminated (up to 10,000 eggs per gram). A single dose of albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg) can be effective in mild to moderate infections; severe infec-167 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives tions require a rat lungworm, Parastrongylus cantonensis (Angiostrongylus cantonensis ). Symptomatic treatment pending spontaneous recovery is often all that is required. 2. Anisakiasis: Anisakiasis is caused by infection with seafood containing Anisakis, Contracaecum or Pseudoterranova spp. In anisakiasis, anthelminthic treatment is rarely, necessary. Prevention is dependent upon informing communities of the hazards of eating raw or inadequately prepared salt-water fish; and early evisceration of fish after capture and freezing of seafood at -20C for at least 60 h before sale. 3. Cutaneous Larva Migrans: Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption) is larvae of animal hookworms, usually Ancylos - toma braziliense and A. caninum which infect cats and dogs. Albendazole in a single dose of 400 mg is effective. 4. Dracunculiasis: Dracunculiasis (dracontiasis, guinea-worm infection) is caused by infection with Dracunculus medinensis , acquired through drinking water containing larvae that develop in small fresh- water crustaceans. Metronidazole (25 mg/kg daily for 10 days, with a daily max. of 750 mg for children) provides rapid symp- tomatic relief. It also weakens the anchorage of the worms in the subcutaneous tissues and they can then be removed by traction. However, since it has no effect on the larvae of pre-emergent worms, it does not immediately prevent trans-mission. 5. Trichinellosis: Trichinellosis (trichinosis) is caused by infection with the larvae of Trichinella spiralis . Each case of confirmed or even suspected trichinellosis infection should be treated in order to prevent the continued production of larvae. In both adults and children, mebendazole (200 mg daily for 5 days), albenda - zole (400 mg daily for 3 days) and pyrantel (10 mg/kg daily for 5 days) are all effective. Prednisolone (40-60 mg daily) may be needed to alleviate the allergic and inflammatory with the larval forms of Toxocara canis and less commonly, T. cati (which infect dogs and cats). Treatment should be reserved for symptomatic infections. A 3 week oral course of diethyl- carbamazine kills the larvae and arrests the disease, but established lesions are irreversible. To reduce the intensity of allergic reactions induced by dying larvae, dosage is commonly commenced at 1 mg/kg twice daily and raised progressively to 3 mg/kg twice daily (adults and children). Ocular larva migrans occurs when larvae invade the eye, causing a granuloma which may result in blindness. In order to suppress allergic inflammatory responses in patients with ophthalmic lesions, prednisolone should be administered concurrently, either topically or systemically.

Storage Store protected from light at temperature not exceeding 30C.171 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives 9.6 Anti-Leishmaniasis Drugs Leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoa Leishmania. It can be categorized as visceral, cutaneous or mucocutaneous. It may be a self-limiting localized skin lesion but may range from this to disseminated progressive disease. In endemic areas there is usually a reservoir of disease in a mammalian host and the usual vectors are sandflies. Visceral Leishmaniasis: Visceral L. infantum (Old World) and by L. chagasi (New World) and it is usually responsive initially to the pentavalent antimony compounds, meglumine antimoniate or Sodium stibogluconate. Both dosage and duration of treatment need to be adjusted according to the clinical response. Patients are considered to be clinically cured when no parasites are detected in splenic or bone marrow aspirates. However, biopsies should be repeated after 3 and 12 months since relapse is frequent. Antimonials combined with allopurinol, pentamidine isothionate and amphotericin B have been used with success in patients in relapse who have become unresponsive to antimonials alone. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: Cutaneous leishmaniasis comprises two conditions. The Old World variety is caused by L. tropica, L. major, L. infantum and L. aethiopica. The New World variety is caused by L. amazonensis, L. mexicana, L. peruviana, L. guyanensis, L. panamensis and L. braziliensis. These conditions are charac- terized by a cell-mediated reaction of varying intensity at the site of inoculation. The New World variety tends to be more severe and slower to heal. Infections caused by L. major, L. mexicana, L. tropica and L. peruviana, are responsive to intral- esional injections of antimonial compounds. Mild lesions can often be left to heal spontaneously. However, it is pref - erable to treat L. tropica infections with a view to reducing transmission since humans seem to be the only host. When the lesion is inflamed or ulcerated or when obstruction of lymphatic drainage or destruction of cartilage creates a risk of serious disfigurement or disability, antimonials should be administered systemically as well as locally. Infections due to L. braziliensis and the less common L. panamensis should be treated with antimonials because of the risk of mucosal involvement. L. aethiopica is less responsive at conventional doses and the sores should be left to heal spontaneously if there is no evidence of diffuse cutaneous involvement. L. 172 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives guyanensis infections should be treated with pentamidine Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis: is caused by L. braziliensis and L. panamensis . In this form of the disease the primary lesions do not heal and spread to the mucosa may occur. It usually responds to antimonials and, when relapses occur, more extended courses of treatment are often successful. Patients who still fail to respond should receive amphotericin B or pentamidine isothionate, although neither treatment is highly satisfactory. Because of resistance to antimonials, L. aethiopica infections should be treated with pentamidine from the outset until complete healing occurs. Emergency use of corticosteroids may be needed to control pharyngeal or tracheal oedema produced by severe inflam- mation resulting from antigens liberated from dead parasites during the early phase of treatment. Antibiotics may also be needed to treat secondary infections and plastic surgery offers the only means of ameliorating disfig- uring scars. Diffuse Cutaneous infec - tion with L. amazonensis, L. aethiopica or L. mexicana and is usually treated with antimonial compounds, but relapses must be expected and repeated courses of pentamidine isothionate may be needed until clinical immunity is established.

Plasmodium vivax is the most extensively distributed and causes much debilitating disease. P . falciparum is also widespread and causes the most severe infections which are responsible for nearly all malaria-related deaths. P . ovale is mainly confined to Africa and is less prevalent, while P . malariae , which causes the least severe but most persistent infections, also occurs widely. Certain tissue forms of P . vivax and P . ovale which persist in the liver for many months and even years are responsible for the relapses characteristic of malaria. Such latent forms are not generated by P . falciparum or P . malariae . Recrudes- cence of these infections results from persistent blood forms in inadequately treated or untreated patients. Treatment of Malaria: Blood schizonticides, which suppress malaria by destroying the asexual blood forms of the parasites, are the mainstay of the treatment of acute malaria and some are used for prophylaxis. They include the 4-aminoquinolines (example amodiaquine and chloroquine), the related arylaminoalcohols (example mefloquine and quinine) and artemisinin and its derivatives (example artemether and artesunate). Blood schizonticides are not active against intrahepatic forms and therefore they do not eliminate infections by P . vivax and P . ovale. Some antimetabolites act synergistically when given in combi - nation. For example, pyrimethamine in combination with a sulfonamide (sulfadoxine) or sulfone and some antibiotics (for example doxycycline) are blood schizonticides. Because they act more slowly, these substances are of little value when used alone. The tetracyclines are used primarily as adjuncts to quinine where multiple-drug-resistant P . falciparum is preva- lent. Chloroquine, a rapidly acting schizonticide, is well tolerated, safe and inexpensive. It should be used to treat malaria wher - ever the parasites remain susceptible. P . malariae and P . ovale remain fully sensitive to chloroquine. A 3-day course of chloroquine by mouth is sufficient to elimi- nate susceptible P . falciparum infections because effective plas- ma-chloroquine concentration is sustained for several weeks. If subsequent relapse occurs in P . ovale and P . vivax infections primaquine should be administered, after a second course of chloroquine, to eliminate the intrahepatic infection.176 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Amodiaquine is an alternative to chloroquine for the treat - ment of uncomplicated P . falciparum infection; but cross- resistance with chloroquine exists in some areas. It should preferably be used as part of combination therapy with other antimalarials, for example artesunate. Hepatitis and blood disorders were reported when amodiaquine was used for prophylaxis of malaria; patients should be told how to recog-nise the symptoms of these conditions and advised to seek medical help if they occur. The combination of sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine is recom- mended for the treatment of malaria only in areas of high chloroquine resistance. A single dose of sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine is usually sufficient to eliminate infection; quinine should also be given for 3 days in patients in whom quinine may accelerate reduction of parasitaemia and in those at risk of fulminating disease. Because sulfonamides are asso-ciated with a risk of haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia in the newborn, quinine is preferred to treat chloroquine-re - sistant malaria during pregnancy. Mefloquine is generally well tolerated, although, some adverse effects have been reported (see notes). However, because of the danger of the emergence of mefloquine-resistant strains of P . falciparum and because of its potential toxicity, it should be used only following either microscopic or careful clinical diagnosis of P . falciparum infections that are known or strongly suspected to be resistant to chloroquine or sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine. Quinine, given orally, should be reserved for P . falciparum infections likely to be unresponsive to other drugs. Doxycy - cline, which is an effective oral schizonticide, should be given in combination with quinine except in pregnant women and children under 8 years. In multi-drug resistant malaria, preparations of artemisinin or its derivatives (artemether or artesunate) offer the only prospect of cure. They should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy. For the treatment of multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria oral artesunate may be an effective antimalarial. It should always be given in combination with mefloquine. Parenteral artemether or artesunate, whose use is restricted, are effective alternatives to quinine for the treatment of severe falciparum malaria and are preferred in areas where decreased efficacy of quinine has been documented. To ensure radical cure following parenteral treat - ment with artemether or oral treatment with artesunate, a full therapeutic dose of mefloquine should be given. A fixed-dose oral formulation of artemether with lumefantrine has recently become available and is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in areas with significant resistance. The combi- nation is not for use in pregnancy or lactation.177 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Prophylaxis Against Malaria: No drug regimen gives assured protection to everybody and indiscriminate use of antimalarials can increase the risk of inducing resistance. Chloroquine, which is usually well tolerated at the required dosage, is preferred where P . falciparum remains fully sensi - tive. The combination of proguanil with chloroquine may overcome mild chloroquine resistance. Chloroquine must be started 1 week before exposure and be continued in pregnant women until after delivery and for at least 4 weeks after the last risk of exposure in the case of non-immune individuals. This is sufficient to ensure elimination of P . falciparum and P . malariae , vivax . ovale, whose residual hepatic forms survive. Mefloquine may be used for prophylaxis in areas of high risk or where multiple-drug resistance has been reported. Where possible prophylaxis should be started 2-3 weeks before travel to enable any adverse reactions to be identified before expo - sure (over three-quarters of adverse reactions occur by the third dose) and should be continued for 4 weeks after last exposure. Mefloquine may be used for prophylaxis during the second and third trimesters. It should be used in early pregnancy only if alternative drugs are either not available or unlikely to be effective and when it is impracticable for the woman to leave the endemic area. Proguanil, a predominantly tissue schizonticide with little blood schizonticidal activity, is a causal prophylactic agent since it is active against pre-erythrocytic intrahepatic forms, particularly of P . falciparum . The latent persistent liver forms of P . ovale and P . vivax are unresponsive. However, there is evidence that it may be effective against P . vivax only imme- diately after the initial infection. P . falciparum resistance to proguanil or related compounds may occur in malaria endemic areas and particularly where it has been employed in mass prophylaxis. Proguanil is used for prophylaxis with chlo - roquine in areas where there is resistance to chloroquine but a low risk of infection as it may give some protection against and may alleviate symptoms if an attack occurs. Proguanil and chloroquine may also be used prophylactically in areas of high risk or multi-drug resistance as a second choice where meflo - quine is not appropriate. There is no evidence that proguanil is harmful in prophylactic doses during pregnancy. Because of the vulnerablility of preg - nant women to falciparum malaria, it should be used at full prophylactic dosage wherever the disease is prevalent and likely to be responsive to proguanil, if chloroquine is not avail - able or with chloroquine, if the latter alone is unlikely to be effective.178 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives 9.7.1 Drugs for Prophylaxis Chloroquine* (Refer Page No. 383) Pregnancy Category-D Indications Treatment of acute malaria caused by P . malariae and susceptible P . falciparum; to eliminate intrahepatic forms); prophylaxis of malaria for pregnant women and non- immune individuals at risk; rheumatic disorders.

The incubation period between infection and appear - ance of leprosy is normally between 2 to 10 years, but may be up to 20 years. It is transmitted from person-to-person when bacilli are shed from the nose; most individuals have natural immunity and symptoms are suppressed. For treatment purposes patients may be classified as having paucibacillary (PB) or multibacillary (MB) leprosy. The 2 forms may be distin-guished by skin smears, but facilities are not always available to process them and their reliability is often doubtful. In prac-tice, most leprosy programmes classify and choose a regimen based on number of skin lesions; these are PB leprosy (1-5 skin lesions) and MB leprosy (more than 5 skin lesions). Drugs used in the treatment of leprosy should always be used in combination; this is essential to prevent the emergence of resistance. Rifampicin is now combined with dapsone to treat PB leprosy and rifampicin and clofazimine are now combined with dapsone to treat MB leprosy. The WHO Programme for the Elimination of Leprosy currently provides, free of charge, oral multidrug therapy in colour-coded blister packs (MDT blister packs) to improve patients' adherence to treatment. Any patient with a positive skin smear should be treated with the MDT regimen for MB leprosy. The regimen for PB leprosy should never be given to a patient with MB leprosy. If diagnosis classification in a particular patient is not possible the MDT regimen for MB leprosy must be used. Lepra reactions are episodes of sudden increase in the activity of leprosy and are often accompanied by neuritis; reactions must always be treated promptly to prevent permanent nerve damage and disability. Leprosy multidrug therapy should continue during a lepra reaction without interruption. This reduces the frequency and severity of lepra reactions. Type 1 lepra reactions, or reversal reactions, are delayed hypersensitivity reactions and may occur in either PB or MB leprosy. If there is no nerve damage, type 1 reactions may be treated with analgesics such as acetylsalicylic acid or para-cetamol. If there is nerve involvement corticosteroids, such as oral prednisolone should be used in addition to analgesics. The type 2 lepra reaction, also known as erythema nodosum 188 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives leprosum (ENL), is an antibody response to dead leprosy bacteria and occurs only in MB leprosy. Therapy for type 2 reactions may include analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol and a corticosteroid, such as oral prednisolone. In patients not responding to a corticosteroid, clofazimine may be used. Severe type 2 lepra reactions should be treated under medical supervision in hospital. If a patient does not respond to lepra reaction treatment within 6 weeks or seems to become worse, the patient must be sent immediately to the nearest specialist centre. Neuritis may occur during or independently of lepra reactions. It can be successfully treated with a 12-week course of oral pred-nisolone; if patients do not respond, specialist centre treat - ment is required. Treatment Regimens: The recommended regimen for paucibacillary leprosy in adults (50-70 kg) is rifampicin 600 mg once monthly and dapsone 100 mg daily. Children aged 10-14 years may be given rifampicin 450 mg once monthly and dapsone 50 mg daily. Appropriate dose adjustments are required for younger children. For example, dapsone 25 mg daily and rifampicin 300 mg once a month. Treatment is continued for 6 months for PB leprosy. The recommended regimen for MB leprosy in adults (50-70 kg) is rifampicin 600 mg and clofazimine 300 mg, both given once a month together with clofazimine 50 mg and dapsone 100 mg, both daily. Children aged 10-14 years may be given rifampicin 450 mg and clofazimine 150 mg, both once a month together with clofazimine 50 mg every other day and dapsone 50 mg daily. Appropriate dosage adjustments are required for younger children. For example, dapsone 25 mg daily, clofazimine 50 mg twice a week and clofazimine 100 mg and rifampicin 300 mg once a month. Treatment is continued for 12 months for MB leprosy. For patients who cannot take rifampicin because of allergy, other diseases, or rifampicin-resistant leprosy and for patients who refuse to take clofazimine, there are alternative regimens which incorporate ofloxacin and minocycline 189 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Clofazimine* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications MB leprosy; type 2 lepra reactions.

Infection is usually due to inhalation of infected droplet nuclei with the lung generally being the first organ affected, but the primary infection is usually asymptomatic. Infec-tion and inflammatory responses resolve with the develop-ment of acquired immunity. Surviving bacteria may become dormant or in susceptible patients, progress to active primary disease; dormant organisms may produce disease and this often occurs if immune status is altered. Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infectious disease of adults and causes 26% of avoidable adult deaths in the developing world. More than 80% of tuberculosis cases are pulmonary (PTB). At least 30% of patients who are infected with HIV will also develop active tuberculosis. The increase in resistant strains and poor compliance of dosage regimen which may contribute to resistance and treatment failure has led to the development of regimens with directly super - vised treatment. Directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) therapy which lasts for 6 or 8 months, given under direct observation is one of the most important components of the WHO strategy against tuberculosis. Simplified drug regimens and intermittent therapy have been introduced to improve compliance. WHO does not generally recom-mend twice weekly regimens. If a patient receiving a twice weekly regimen misses a dose of tablets, the missed dose represents a bigger fraction of the total number of treat - ment doses than if the patient was receiving a three times weekly or daily dose regimen. Therefore, there is a greater risk of treatment failure with twice weekly regimens. Fixed- dose combination tablets incorporating 2 or more drugs are also used to improve compliance and decrease medication errors; they should be used unless one of the components cannot be given because of resistance or intolerance. Modern short-course therapy is usually in 2 phases. The initial phase (2 months) involves the concurrent use of at least 3 drugs to reduce the bacterial population rapidly and prevent drug-resistant bacteria emerging. The second continuation phase (4-6 months) involves fewer drugs and is used to eliminate any remaining bacteria and prevent recur - rence. Direct observation of therapy is considered essential to ensure compliance in the initial phase and also useful in the continuation phase if patients are receiving rifampicin. Five antituberculosis drugs, isoniazid, 193 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives (which is bacteriostatic) are used in various combinations as part of WHO-recommended treatment regimens; thiaceta-zone is used only if ethambutol cannot be used. In supervised regimens change of drug regimen should be considered only if the patient fails to respond after 5 months of DOTS. Isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are components of all antituberculosis drug regimens currently recommended by WHO. Unsupervised and alternative regimens as set out in the following tables may be administered as specified. Additional reserve antituberculosis treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis should be used in specialized centres adhering to WHO standards for TB control. Worldwide, an important predisposing cause of immunosup- pression leading to tuberculosis is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; it increases susceptibility to primary infection and increases the reactivation rate of tuberculosis. Preventative antituberculosis therapy of such persons is recommended. Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid can prevent the devel- opment of clinically apparent disease in persons in close contact with infectious patients and also prevent the reac-tivation of previously dormant disease in other persons at high risk particularly those who are immunodeficient. Where the disease remains highly prevalent routine immuni - zation of infants within the first year of age with BCG vaccine is cost-effective. However, there is no evidence that BCG will protect children older than 15 years of age. Infants born to HIV-positive mothers should be vaccinated during the first year of life, provided they have no clinical signs suggestive of HIV. The tuberculin test has limited diagnostic value. A positive tuberculin test indicates previous exposure to mycobacterial antigens through infection with one of the tubercle bacilli, or BCG vaccination. The tuberculin test does not distinguish between tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infection, between active and quiescent disease, or between acquired infection and seroconversion induced by BCG vaccination.194 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Recommended 6-Month Treatment Regimens for Tuberculosis1 Drug Initial phase (2 months) Continuation phase (4 months) Isoniazid 5 mg/kg daily 5 mg/kg daily Rifampicin 10 mg/kg daily 10 daily Pyrazinamide or Ethambutol215 mg/kg daily Isoniazid 10 mg/kg 3 times weekly 10 mg/kg 3 times weekly Rifampicin 10 mg/kg 3 times weekly 10 mg/kg 3 times weekly Pyrazinamide 35 mg/kg 3 times weekly together with Streptomycin315 mg/kg 3 times weekly or Ethambutol 30 mg/kg 3 times weekly 1Unless otherwise indicated, doses are suitable for both adults and children 2Not suitable for children Recommended 8-month treatment regimen for tuberculosis1 Drug Initial phase (2 months) Continuation phase (6 months) Isoniazid 5 mg/kg daily 5 mg/kg daily Rifampicin 10 mg/kg Pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg mg/kg daily4 or Streptomycin2 15 mg/kg daily 1Unless otherwise indicated, doses are suitable for both adults and children 2Streptomycin always replaces ethambutol in meningeal TB 3Not suitable for children under 5 years 4Thiacetazone (2.5 mg/kg daily) may be used (only if etham- butol cannot be given) in combination with isoniazid in the continuation phase; risk of severe toxicity, particularly in HIV- infected individuals195 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Category I: New pulmonary disease (smear-positive or smear-negative with extensive involvement of parenchyma), concomitant severe HIV disease and new severe extra-pulmo - nary disease Initial phase1 (antibacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + 2 months Continuation phase1 (anti- bacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin for 4 months (or isoniazid + ethambutol for 6 months but less effective than isoniazid + rifampicin) Category II: Previously treated smear-positive pulmonary disease which has relapsed, or failed to respond, or if treat - ment was interrupted Initial phase 1 (antibacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol months then:isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol for 1 month Continuation phase 1 (antibacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin + ethambutol for 5 months Category III: New smear-negative pulmonary disease (other than in Category I) and less severe extra-pulmonary disease Initial phase 1 (antibacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol3 for 2 months Continuation phase 1 (antibacterials administered daily or 3 times weekly): isoniazid + rifampicin for 4 months (or isoniazid + etham- butol for 6 months but less effective than isoniazid + rifampicin) Category IV: Chronic and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (smear-positive despite supervised re-treatment)4 specially designed standardized or individualized regimens recommended Treatment regimens by category of tuberculosis diagnosis 1Drug intake should be directly observed in patients who are smear positive during the initial phase and always when rifampicin is given 2Drug sensitivity testing recommended before prescribing Category II treatment in failure cases; patients with MDR-TB should be prescribed Category IV regimen 3Omit ethambutol in initial phase if disease is not complicated by cavitary disease or concomitant HIV disease and in patients infected with fully susceptible bacilli or young children with primary tuberculosis 4Early culture and sensitivity testing recommended for contacts of patients with MDR-TB196 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Amikacin* Pregnancy Category-D Schedule H Indications Short-term treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, species.

Since then DOTS has been widely advocated and successfully applied. (Revised National TB Control Policy) DOTS is the most effective strategy available for controlling TB.The five key components of DOTS area) Political commitment to control TB; b) Case detection by sputum smear microscopy examination among symptomatic patients; c) Patients are given anti- TB drugs under the direct observation of the health care provider/community DOT provider; d) Regular, uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs; and e) Systematic recording and reporting system that allows assessment of treatment results of each and every patient and of whole TB control programme. Responsibility of ensuring regular and complete treatment of the patient lies with the health system. In 2006, the new stop TB strategy was recommended interna- tionally by WHO. The components of the new stop TB strategy are the following: 1. Pursue high quality DOTS expansion and enhancement 2. Address TB/HIV, MDR-TB and other challenges 3. Contribute to health system strengthening 4. Engage all health care providers 5. Empower people with TB and communities 6. Enable and promote research DOTS involves treatment with combination of drugs -Rifampicin 300 mg + Isoniazid 150 mg + Pyrazinamide 800 mg + Ethambutol 550 mg, given thrice weekly. Twice weekly therapy can also be given but it is not recommended since it does not have margin for error and missing even one dose makes the therapy ineffective.206 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives 9.9 Antipneumocystosis and Antitoxoplasmosis Drugs Pneumocystosis: Pneumocystis carinii is classified as a protozoan although there is evidence to suggest that it is probably a fungus. Pneumo- cystis carinii pneumonia is probably acquired by the airborne route. In otherwise healthy persons it rarely, produces signs of infection. However, it is a frequent cause of opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed, debilitated or malnourished patients; it is the commonest cause of pneumonia in AIDS and the most frequent immediate cause of death in these patients. Sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim is the treatment of choice for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and is also used for prophylaxis in high-risk patients; pentamidine isothionate is used in patients unresponsive to or intolerant of sulfameth-oxazole with trimethoprim. The treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infections must only be undertaken with specialist supervision where there are appro- priate monitoring facilities. Toxoplasmosis: Toxoplasmosis is caused the protozoan para- site Toxoplasma gondii . Most infections are self-limiting and do not require treatment. However, in immunodeficiency, primary infection may result in encephalitis, myocarditis or pneumonitis; impairment of immunity (such as in AIDS) in a previously infected person, may result in encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Congenital transmission may occur if there is a primary infection in early pregnancy or if the mother is immunodeficient. Such cases often result in spontaneous abortion, fetal death or severe congenital disease. Ocular toxoplasmosis causes chorioretinitis and is often the result of a childhood infection that becomes apparent in adulthood. The treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis is pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine; a folate supplement is also given to coun- teract the megaloblastic anaemia associated with Page No 175)207 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives 9.10 Antiretrovirals Antiretroviral drugs do not cure HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection; they only temporarily suppress viral replica-tion and improve symptoms. Patients receiving these drugs require careful monitoring by appropriately trained health professionals in an adequately resourced setting. Rigorous promotion of measures to prevent new infections remains essential and its need is not diminished by the availability of antiretroviral drugs. Effective therapy requires the simulta- neous use of 3 or 4 drugs; alternative regimens are necessary to meet specific requirements at start-up, to substitute for first-line regimens in cases of intolerance, or to replace failing regimens. The use of a 3- or 4-drug combination as speci-fied in the WHO treatment guidelines is recommended. The use of fixed-dose preparations for these combinations is also recommended if the pharmaceutical quality is assured and interchangeability with the single products is demonstrated as specified by the relevant drug regulatory authority. Selection of 2 or 3 protease inhibitors from the Model List will need to be determined by each country after considera-tion of local treatment guidelines and experience, as well as comparative costs of available products. Low-dose ritonavir is used in combination with indinavir, lopinavir or saquinavir as a 'booster'; ritonavir is not recommended as a drug in its own right. Principles of Treatment: Treatment is aimed at reducing the plasma viral load as much as possible and for as long as possible; it should be started before the immune system is irreversibly damaged. The need for early drug treatment should, however, be balanced against the development of toxicity. Commitment to treatment and strict adherence over many years are required; the regimen chosen should take into account convenience and the patient's tolerance of it. The development of resistance is reduced by using a combination of 3 or 4 drugs; such combinations should have additive or synergistic activity while ensuring that their toxicity is not additive. Testing for resistance to antiviral drugs, particularly in therapeutic failure, should be considered. Women of childbearing age receiving antiretroviral therapy must have available effective contraceptive methods to prevent unintended pregnancy. Women who are taking no n nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibi - tors which can lower blood concentration of hormonal oral contraceptives, should be advised to use additional or alterna - tive contraceptives.208 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives Drugs used to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (or first saquinavir. is used in combination with indinavir, lopinavir or saquinavir as a booster. The small amount of ritonavir in such combi - nations has no intrinsic antiviral activity but it increases the antiviral activity of the other protease inhibitors by reducing their metabolism. Indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and possibly saquinavir inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and therefore have a potential for significant drug interactions. Protease inhibitors are associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic effects (see below). The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors include efavirenz and nevirapine. They interact with a number of drugs metabolized in the liver; the doses of protease inhibitors may need to be increased when they are given with efavirenz or nevirapine. Nevirapine is associated with a high incidence of rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and occasionally fatal hepatitis. Rash is also associated with efavirenz but it is usually milder. Efavirenz treatment has also been associated with an increased plasma cholesterol concentration. Initiation of Treatment The time for initiating antiviral treatment is determined by the clinical stage of the HIV infection as indicated by symptoms and where available, by the CD4-cell count or total lymphocyte count; the plasma viral load, if available, is also a valuable guide for staging the disease (see Monitoring, below). Recommended initial treatment with a combination of drugs ('highly active antiretroviral therapy', HAART) protease which may be combined with ritonavir as booster. Monitoring: In resource-limited settings the basic clinical assessment before initiating antiretroviral therapy includes documenta-tion of past medical history, identification of current and past 209 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives HIV-related illnesses, identification of co-existing medical conditions that may influence the choice of therapy (for example, pregnancy or tuberculosis) as well as current symp- toms and physical signs. The absolute minimum laboratory tests before initiating antiretroviral therapy are an HIV antibody test (in patients over 18 months of age) and a haemoglobin or haematocrit measurement. Additional basic testing should include: white blood cell count; differential cell count (to identify a decline in neutrophils and the possibility possibility of hepatitis - tion and to monitor for hepatotoxicity; serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen to assess baseline renal function; serum glucose; pregnancy tests for women. Desirable supplemental tests measurement of bilirubin, amylase and serum lipids. CD4-cell determinations are, of course, very desirable and efforts should be made to make these widely available. Viral load testing is currently considered optional because of constraints on resources. Changing Therapy: Deterioration of the condition (including clinical and viro- logical changes) usually calls for replacement of the failing drugs. Intolerance to adverse effects and drug-induced organ dysfunction usually require change in therapy. The choice of an alternative regimen depends on factors such as the response to previous treatment, tolerance and the possibility of cross-resistance. If treatment fails, a new second-line regimen will be needed. If toxicity occurs, either a new second-line regimen is indicated or, if the toxicity is related to an identifiable drug in the regimen, the offending drug can be replaced with another drug that does not have the same adverse effects. Pregnancy: Treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy aims to: minimize the viral load and disease progression in the mother;210 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives reduce the risk of toxicity to the fetus (although the teratogenic potential of most antiretroviral drugs is unknown); prevent transmission of infection to the neonate. In pregnant women, it may be desirable to initiate antiretro- viral therapy after the first trimester, although for pregnant women who are severely ill, the benefit of early therapy outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. All treatment options require careful assessment by a specialist. The use of zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, nelfinavir and saquinavir are recommended for women of child-bearing potential or who are pregnant. Efavirenz should be avoided because of its potential teratogenic effect on the fetus in the first trimester. First-line treatment in pregnant women should when possible include zidovudine and lamivudine. Mono - therapy with either zidovudine or with nevirapine reduces transmission of infection to the neonate (see also below), but combination antiretroviral therapy maximizes the chance of preventing transmission and represents optimal therapy for the mother. Low-dose ritonavir is required if either indi - navir or saquinavir is used in pregnancy because adequate drug concentration is achieved only with ritonavir boosting. Information is lacking on the use of lopinavir with ritonavir in pregnancy. Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis associated with nucleo - side reverse transcriptase inhibitors may be more frequent in pregnant women and therefore the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used in pregnancy only when no alternatives are available. Protease inhibitors have been asso- ciated with glucose intolerance and pregnant women should be instructed to recognize symptoms of hyperglycaemia and to seek health care advice if they occur. Various regimens have been used to specifically prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to the neonate at term. More information is available in New Data on the Preven-tion of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and their Policy Implications: Conclusions and Recommendations (WHO/RHR/01.28), which reflects an inter-agency consultation, held on 11-13 October 2000. Lactation: Antiretroviral drugs may be present in breastmilk and may reduce viral load in breastmilk and reduce the risk of trans-mission through lactation. However, the concentration of antiretroviral drugs in breastmilk may not be adequate to 211 NFI-2011Anti-Infectives prevent viral replication and there is therefore the possibility of promoting the development of drug-resistant virus which could be transmitted to the infant. Women with HIV infection should be counselled about the risks of lactation and, where possible, they should limit or avoid lactation; in particular, lactation should be avoided where replacement feeding is acceptable, affordable, sustainable and safe. HIV-infected women should be counselled on infant feeding options and they should be supported in their choice. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis: Treatment with antiretroviral drugs may be appropriate following occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated mate - rial. Immediate expert advice should be sought in such cases; national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis for health - care workers have been developed and local ones may also be available. Lipodystrophy and Metabolic Effects: Combination antiretroviral therapy, including regimens containing a protease inhibitor, is associated with redistribu - tion of body fat in some patients (for example, decreased fat under the skin, increased abdominal fat, 'buffalo humps' and breast enlargement). Protease inhibitors are also associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia. Clinical examination should include an evaluation of fat distribution; measurement of serum lipids and blood glucose should be considered. 9.10.1 Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors In some settings it may not be possible to carry out full moni- toring described under each drug entry; in such cases the level of monitoring should be determined by local guidelines (see also notes above).

Adverse Effects Nausea, vomiting, abdominal dyspepsia, diarrhoea; headache, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness; conjunctivitis, epistaxis; rash; infection, is caused by several species of trematode worms (blood flukes). Its socio - economic impact as a parasitic disease is outstripped only by that of malaria. Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused principally by Schistosoma mansoni as well as japonicum, S. mekongi and . Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by S. haematobium . The latter is an important predisposing cause of squamous cell cancer of the bladder. Praziquantel has transformed the treatment of schistosomiasis and is often effective in a single dose, against all species of the parasite. It can be of particular value in patients with mixed infections and those who do not respond adequately to other drugs. It is also extremely well tolerated and well suited for mass treatment control programmes. Extensive use over several years has provided no evidence of serious adverse effects or long-term toxicity, nor has mutagenic or carcino - genic activity been shown in experimental animals. Drugs still widely used in the treatment of schistosomiasis include oxamniquine, which is effective against S. mansoni . It is preferable to delay treatment with oxamniquine in pregnant women until after delivery unless immediate intervention is essential. Due to lack of information on whether oxamniquine is excreted in breast milk, it is preferable not to administer it to nursing mothers. Praziquantel* Pregnancy Category-B Schedule H 600 mg.

Genital lesions, oesophagitis and proc- titis may be treated with oral Acyclovir. should Valacyclovir, a prodrug of Acyclovir, can be given by mouth as an alternative treatment for herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucous membranes (including initial and recurrent genital herpes). Herpes Zoster Virus: While most HIV positive patients with zoster experience only one self-limiting course, some will experience repeated episodes. Treatment should be reserved for debilitating disease and when there is high risk of serious complications, such as in advanced HIV disease. Acyclovir is the treatment of choice and it can be administered in high oral dose or in the case of lack of response to oral therapy or CNS involvement, it should be given intravenously. Cytomegalovirus (CMV): ganciclovir arrests retinochoroiditis CMV in HIV infected patients. Mainte - nance therapy with oral ganciclovir should be given to prevent relapse of retinitis.

Antimigraine Drugs 235 10.1 For Prophylaxis 236 10.2 For Treatment of Acute Attack 238235 NFI-2011Antimigraine Drugs 10. Antimigraine Drugs Chronic recurrent headache is associated with many disor - ders, both somatic and psychogenic. An accurate diagnosis must consequently be made before appropriate treatment can be initiated for migraine. Untreated migraine attacks last for several hours and sometimes for as long as 3 days. Migraine headache is frequently accompanied by episodes of gastrointestinal disturbance including nausea and vomiting. The headache may be preceded or accompanied by aura (clas - sical migraine) which is characterised by visual disturbances such as flickering lines and fragmented vision or sensory disturbances such as tingling or numbness; rarely, hemiparesis or impaired consciousness may occur. Migraine without aura (common migraine) is the more common form occurring in about 75% of patients who experience migraine. Emotional or physical stress, lack of or excess sleep, missed meals, menstruation, alcohol and specific foods including cheese and chocolate are often identified as precipitating factors; oral contraceptives may increase the frequency of attacks. Avoidance of such precipitating factors can be of great benefit in preventing or reducing the frequency of attacks and should be addressed in detail. Women taking combined oral contraceptives who experience an onset or increase in frequency of headaches should be advised of other contra-ceptive measures. The two principal strategies of migraine management are treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment.236 NFI-2011Antimigraine Drugs 10.1 For Prophylaxis Prophylactic treatment should be considered for patients in whom treatment of acute migraine attacks with analgesics or ergotamine is ineffective, or in whom attacks occur more than once a month, or for those with less frequent but severe or prolonged attacks. Prophylaxis can reduce the severity and frequency of attacks but does not eliminate them completely; additional symptomatic treatment is still needed. However, long-term prophylaxis is undesirable and treatment should be reviewed at 6-monthly intervals. Of the many drugs that have been advocated beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are most frequently used. Propranolol , a non-selec - tive beta-blocker and other related compounds with similar profile such as atenolol are generally preferred. The poten- tial for beta-blockers to interact with ergotamine should be borne in mind. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline or calcium-channel blocking drugs such as flunarizine or verapamil may be of value.

Storage Store protected from light and moisture.238 NFI-2011Antimigraine Drugs 10.2 For Treatment of Acute Attack Treatment of acute attacks may be non-specific using simple analgesics, or specific using an ergot alkaloid such as ergot - amine. If nausea and vomiting are features of the attack, an antiemetic drug may be given. Treatment is generally by mouth; some drugs are available as suppositories which may be administered if the oral route is not effective (poor oral bioa-vailability, or absorption from the gut impaired by vomiting) or not practicable (patient unable to take drugs orally). Simple analgesics including NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflam- matory drugs) can be effective in mild to moderate forms of migraine if taken early in the attack; most migraine headaches respond to paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid or NSAID such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. Peristalsis is often reduced during migraine attacks and, if available, a dispersible or effervescent preparation of the drug is preferred because of enhanced absorption compared with a conventional tablet. The risk of Reye syndrome due to acetylsalicylic acid in chil - dren can be avoided by giving paracetamol instead. Frequent and prolonged use of analgesics by migraine sufferers may lead to analgesic-induced headache. Ergotamine should be considered only when attacks are unresponsive to non-opioid analgesics. It is poorly absorbed when taken orally or sublingually. Rectal suppositories may offer an advantage when other routes of administration are unsatisfactory. To be fully effective ergotamine must be taken in adequate amounts as early as possible during each attack. Adverse effects limit how much ergotamine can be used in a single attack and consequently the recommended dosage should never be exceeded and at least four days should elapse between successive treatments. Even normal dosage can lead to dependence, tolerance to adverse effects and to a with - drawal syndrome on discontinuing the drug. To avoid depend - ence the frequency of administration should be limited to no more than twice a month. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and vertigo; chronic ergotism is charac-terized by severe peripheral vasoconstriction which can lead to gangrene in the extremities. The severity of adverse effects prevents the use of ergotamine for migraine prophylaxis. An antiemetic such as metoclopramide, given as a single dose orally or by intramuscular injection at the onset of a 239 NFI-2011Antimigraine Drugs migraine attack, preferably 10-15 min before the analgesic or ergotamine, is useful not only in relieving nausea but also in restoring gastric motility, thus improving absorption of the antimigraine drug. Products which contain barbiturates or codeine are undesir - able, particularly in combination with ergotamine, since they may cause physical dependence and withdrawal headaches.

Adverse Effects Tightness in head and chest, paraesthesia in limbs, dizziness; rise in BP Immunosuppressives 11.1 Antineoplastics Note: W H o advises that adequate resources and specialist supervision are a prerequisite for the introduction of this class of drugs. Specific expertise, diagnostic precision, individualization of dosage or special equipment are required for their proper use The treatment of cancer with drugs, radiotherapy and surgery is complex and should only be undertaken by an oncologist. For this reason, the following information is provided merely as a guide. Chemotherapy may be curative or used to alle- viate symptoms or to prolong life. Where the condition can no longer be managed with cytotoxic therapy, alternative pallia - tive treatment should be considered. For some tumours, single-drug chemotherapy may be adequate, but for many malignancies a combination of drugs provides the best response. Examples of combination therapy drugs are often combined with other classes of drugs in the treatment of malignant conditions. Such drugs include hormone agonists and antagonists, corticosteroids and immunostimulant drugs. Combinations are, however, more toxic than single drugs. Precautions and Contraindications Treatment with cytotoxic drugs should be initiated only after baseline tests of liver and kidney function have been performed and baseline blood counts established. It may be necessary to modify or delay treatment in certain circum- stances. The patient should also be monitored regularly during chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs withheld if there is signifi - cant deterioration in bone-marrow, liver or kidney function. Many cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic and should not be 244 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives administered during pregnancy especially in the first trimester. Contraceptive measures are required during therapy and possibly for a period after therapy has ended. Cytotoxic drugs are also contraindicated during lactation. Cytotoxic drugs should be administered with care to avoid undue toxicity to the patient or exposure during handling by the health care provider. All waste, including patient's body fluids and excreta (and any material contaminated by them) should be treated as hazardous. Extravasation of intravenously administered cytotoxic drugs can result in severe pain and necrosis of surrounding tissue. If extravasation occurs, aspiration of the drug should first be attempted, then the affected limb is elevated and warm compresses applied to speed and dilute the infusion or it is localized by applying cold compresses until the inflamma-tion subsides; in severe cases, hydrocortisone cream may be applied topically to the site of inflammation. The manufac-turer's literature should also be consulted for more specific information. Adverse Effects Cytotoxic drugs have a considerable potential to damage normal tissue. Specific adverse effects apply, but a number of effects are common to all cytotoxics such as bone-marrow and immunological suppression. Furthermore, the concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs will enhance susceptibility to infections. Fever associated with neutropenia or immuno - suppression requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Nausea and vomiting: Nausea and vomiting following admin - istration of cytotoxic drugs and abdominal radiotherapy are often distressing and may compromise further treatment. Symptoms may be acute (occurring within 24 h of treatment), delayed (first occurring more than 24 h after treatment), or anticipatory (occurring before subsequent doses). Delayed and anticipatory symptoms are more difficult to control than acute symptoms and require different management. Cytotoxic drugs associated with a low risk of emesis include etoposide, 5- fluorouracil, low-dose methotrexate and the vinca those low-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and high-dose meth- with cisplatin, high-dose cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine. For patients at a low risk of emesis, pretreatment with an oral phenothiazine (for example chlorpromazine), continued for up to 24 h after chemotherapy, is often helpful. For patients at a higher risk dexamethasone 6-10 mg by mouth may be added 245 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives before chemotherapy. For patients at a high risk of emesis or when other therapies are ineffective, high doses of intrave - nous metoclopramide may be used. Note: High doses of metoclopramide are preferably given by continuous intravenous infusion: an initial dose of 2-4 mg/kg is given over 15 to 20 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 3-5 mg/kg over 8 to 12 h; the total dose should not exceed 10 mg/kg in 24 h. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice for the prevention of delayed symptoms; it is used alone or with metoclopramide. Good symptom control is the best way to prevent anticipa - tory symptoms and the addition of diazepam to antiemetic therapy is helpful because of its sedative, anxiolytic and amnesic effects. Hyperuricaemia: Hyperuricaemia may complicate treat - ment of conditions such as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and leukaemia. Renal damage may result from the formation of uric acid crystals. Patients should be adequately hydrated and hyperuricaemia may be managed with allopurinol initiated 24 h before cytotoxic treatment and continued for 7 to 10 days afterwards. Alopecia: Alopecia is common during treatment with cytotoxic drugs. There is no drug treatment, but the condition often reverses spontaneously once treatment has stopped. Alkylating Drugs: Alkylating drugs are among the most widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy. They act by damaging DNA and there - fore interfering with cell replication. However, there are two complications. Firstly, they affect gametogenesis and may cause permanent male sterility; in women, the reproductive span may be shortened by the onset of a premature meno-pause. Secondly, they are associated with a marked increase in the incidence of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, in particular when combined with extensive radiation therapy. Cyclophosphamide requires hepatic activation; it can there- fore be given orally and is not vesicant when given intrave - nously. Like all alkylating drugs its major toxic effects are myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting. It can also cause haemorrhagic cystitis; an increased fluid intake for 24 to 48 h will help to avoid this complication. Cyclophosphamide is used either as part of treatment or as an adjuvant in Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, breast cancer, childhood leukaemia and ovarian cancer. It is also used in several palliative regimens.246 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives Hodgkin's disease, ovarian cancer and Waldenstrom (primary) macroglobulinaemia. Adverse effects, apart from bone marrow suppression, are uncommon. However, severe widespread rash can develop and may progress to Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. If a rash occurs, further treatment with chloram-bucil is contraindicated. Chlormethine (mustine) forms part of the regimen for treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease and malignant lymphomas. Its toxicity includes myelosuppression, severe nausea and vomiting, alopecia and thrombophlebitis due to vesicant effect. Cytotoxic Antibiotics: Bleomycin is used in regimens for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer. It has several antineoplastic drug toxicities; it is known to cause dose-related pneumonitis and fibrosis which can be fatal and is associated with rare acute hypersensitivity reactions. Cutaneous toxicity has also been reported. Doxorubicin is the most widely used anthracycline antibiotic. It is used for acute leukaemias although other anthracyclines are more commonly used in these circumstances. Doxorubicin also plays a palliative role in the treatment of other malignan - cies. The primary toxic effects are myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea, vomiting and dose-related cardiomyopathy. It is also vesicant and can cause severe skin ulceration on extravasa-tion. Dactinomycin is used to treat paediatric cancers. Its toxicity is similar to that of doxorubicin, but it is not cardiotoxic. Daunorubicin is used in acute leukaemias. Its toxicity is similar to that of doxorubicin. Antimetabolites and Related Therapy: Cytarabine is used in the treatment of acute leukaemia; chil - dren may tolerate high doses better than adults. Its effects are highly dependent upon the schedule of administration. It causes myelosuppression, mucositis and in high doses, central neurotoxicity. 5-Fluorouracil is primarily used in the adjuvant treatment of colorectal and breast cancer. It is also employed in the pallia - tive treatment of other malignancies. It causes myelosuppres- sion and the palmar-plantar syndrome (erythema and painful desquamation of the hands and feet). When its action is modified by other drugs (such as calcium folinate), its toxicity 247 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives profile can change; mucositis and diarrhoea may be significant problems. Central neurotoxicity can also occur. 6-Mercaptopurine is frequently used in the therapy of child - hood leukaemia. It can be administered orally and myelosup - pression and nausea are the only important toxic effects. Methotrexate is used to treat a variety of malignancies and it plays a major role as an adjuvant for the treatment of breast cancer. Like 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate is myelotoxic, but nausea and vomiting are minimal. It also causes mucositis. Renal impairment reduces methotrexate excretion and can exacerbate toxicity. Calcium folinate is used to counteract the folate-antagonist action of methotrexate and thus speeds recovery from meth- otrexate-induced mucositis or myelosuppression. Calcium folinate also enhances the effects of 5-fluorouracil when the two are used together for metastatic in the treatment of acute leukaemias. Vinblastine is also used for Hodgkin's disease and some solid tumours. Vincristine is also used in the management of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Both can cause neurotoxicity, but this is more of a problem with vincristine. Myelosuppression is more common with vinblastine. Etoposide is an important component of the treatment of testicular carcinoma and is also used in several regimens for lung cancers and lymphomas. It causes myelosuppression and alopecia and it can cause hypotension during infusion. It does not produce significant nausea and vomiting. Other Antineoplastic Drugs: The enzyme asparaginase is an important component in the management of childhood leukaemia, but is not used in any other malignancy. Its toxicity profile is broad and the drug must be carefully administered because of the risk of anaphy - laxis. Cisplatin is a platinum compound used in the treatment of ovarian and testicular malignancies. It is also a component of regimens used in non-small cell and small cell lung cancer and plays a palliative role in other malignancies. Cisplatin is myelosuppressive and also produces slight alopecia. However, it causes severe dose-related nausea and vomiting. It is also nephrotoxic and neurotoxic. Nephrotoxicity can be reduced by maintaining high urine output during cisplatin administra-tion and immediately afterwards, but neurotoxicity is often dose-limiting.248 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives Dacarbazine , thought to act as an alkylating drug, is a compo - nent of a regimen for Hodgkin's disease. It is also used in the palliative therapy of metastatic malignant melanoma. Its major toxic effects are myelosuppression and intense nausea and vomiting. Levamisole is an anthelminthic with immunostimulating prop - erties; it is used in combination with 5-fluorouracil as adju - vant therapy for colorectal cancer following resection of the tumour. Its major toxic effects are a variety of CNS symptoms, nausea, dermatitis and hypersensitivity reactions. Procarbazine is used in the treatment of advanced Hodg- kin's disease. Toxic effects include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, CNS symptoms and depression. Procarbazine possesses a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitory effect but dietary restriction is not necessary.

Note: WH o advises that this class of drugs is for use only when adequate resources and specialist care are available. Specific expertise, diagnostic precision, individualization of dosage or special equipment are required for their proper use Immunosuppressive drugs are used in organ transplant recipi - ents to suppress rejection; they are also used as second-line drugs in chronic inflammatory conditions. Treatment should only be initiated by a specialist. Careful monitoring of blood counts is required in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs and the dose should be adjusted to prevent bone-marrow toxicity. Immunosuppressed patients are particularly prone to atypical infections. Azathioprine is the most widely used drug in transplant recipi - ents. It is useful when corticosteroid therapy alone has proven inadequate or for other conditions when a reduction in the dose of concurrently administered corticosteroids is required. It is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine and, as with mercap-topurine, doses need to be reduced when given with allop - urinol. The predominant toxic effect is myelosuppression, although hepatic toxicity also occurs. Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressant which is virtu- ally free of myelotoxic effects, but is markedly nephrotoxic. It is particularly useful for the prevention of graft rejection and for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease. The dose is adjusted according to plasma-cyclosporine concentrations and renal function. Dose-related increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during the first few weeks may necessitate dose reduction. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone have significant immu - nosuppressant activity and can also be used to prevent rejec - tion of organ transplants.266 NFI-2011Antineoplastics and Immunosuppressives Azathioprine* (Refer Page No. 382 and 434) Pregnancy Category-D Schedule H Indications To prevent rejection in transplant recipi- dermatitis (AD).

Antiseptics and Disinfectants 12.1 Antiseptics An antiseptic destroys or inhibits growth of micro-organisms on living tissues without causing injurious effects when applied to surfaces of the body or to exposed tissues. Some antisep- tics are applied to the unbroken skin or mucous membranes, to burns and to open wounds to prevent sepsis by removing or excluding microbes from these areas. Iodine has been modified for use as an antiseptic. The iodophore, povidone-iodine, is effective against bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, cysts and spores and significantly reduces surgical wound infections. The solution of povidone iodine releases iodine on contact with the skin. Chlorhexidine has a wide spectrum of bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity and is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria although it is less effective against some species of Pseudomonas and Proteus and relatively inactive against mycobacteria. It is not active against bacterial spores. Chlorhexidine is incompatible with soaps and other anionic materials, such as bicarbonates, chlorides, and phosphates, forming salts of low solubility which may precipitate out of solution. Ethanol has bacteri-cidal activity and is used to disinfect skin prior to injection, venepuncture or surgical procedures.272 NFI-2011Antiseptics and Disinfectants Cetrimide* Indications Antiseptic; disinfectant for surgical instruments.

Disinfectants do not necessarily kill all organ- isms but reduce them to a level, which does not harm health or the quality of perishable goods. Disinfectants are applied to inanimate objects and materials such as instruments and surfaces to control and prevent infection. They may also be used to disinfect skin and other tissues prior to surgery (see also Antiseptics, above). Disinfection of water can be either physical or chemical. Physical methods include boiling, filtration and ultraviolet irradiation. Chemical methods include the addition of chlorine releasing compounds, such as Sodium hypochlorite solution, chloramine T powder, or Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) powder or tablets. Where water is not disinfected at source it may be disin-fected by boiling or by chemical means for drinking, cleaning teeth and food preparation. Chlorine is a hazardous substance. It is highly corrosive in concentrated solution and splashes can cause burns and damage the eyes. Appropriate precautions must be taken when concentrated chlorine solutions or powders are handled. The chlorinated phenolic compound, chloroxylenol, is effec - tive against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria. It is less effective against staphylococci and Gram-negative bacteria; it is often ineffective against Pseudomonas and inactive against spores. The aldehyde bactericidal disinfectant, glutaraldehyde, is strongly active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is active against the tuberculosis bacillus, fungi such as Candida albicans, and viruses such as HIV 2% w/v aqueous alkaline (buffered to glutaral solution can be used to sterilize heat-sensitive pre-cleansed instruments and other equipments.276 NFI-2011Antiseptics and Disinfectants Bleaching Powder* Indications Disinfection of surfaces, equipments, water.

Cardiovascular Drugs 13.1 Antianginal Drugs The three main types of angina are: Stable angina (angina of effort), where atherosclerosis restricts blood flow in the coronary vessels; attacks are usually caused by exertion and relieved by rest Unstable angina (acute coronary insufficiency), which is considered to be an intermediate stage between stable angina and myocardial infarction Prinzmetal angina (variant angina), caused by coro- nary vasospasm, in which attacks occur at rest. Management depends on the type of angina and may include drug treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery, or percuta- neous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Stable Angina: Drugs are used both for the relief of acute pain and for proph - ylaxis to reduce further attacks; they include (beta-blockers) a vasodilating effect; they are some- times used alone, especially in elderly patients with infre - quent symptoms. Tolerance leading to reduced antianginal effect is often seen in patients taking prolonged-action nitrate formulations. Evidence suggests that patients should have a 'nitrate-free' interval to prevent the development of toler - ance. Adverse effects such as flushing, headache and postural hypotension may limit nitrate therapy but tolerance to these effects also soon develops. The short-acting sublingual formulation of glyceryl trinitrate is used both for prevention of angina before exercise or other stress and for rapid treat - ment of chest pain. A sublingual tablet of isosorbide dinitrate is more stable in storage than glyceryl trinitrate and is useful in patients who require nitrates infrequently; it has a slower onset of action, but effects persist for several h. Beta-Blockers: Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), such as aten- olol, block beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and thereby decrease heart rate and myocardial contractility and oxygen 280 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs consumption, particularly during exercise. Beta-blockers are first-line therapy for patients with effort-induced chronic stable angina; they improve exercise tolerance, relieve symp-toms, reduce the severity and frequency of angina attacks and increase the anginal threshold. Beta-blockers should be withdrawn gradually to avoid precipi - tating an anginal attack; they should not be used in patients with underlying coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina). Beta-blockers may precipitate asthma and should not be used in patients with asthma or a history of obstructive airways disease. Some, including atenolol, have less effect on 2 (bronchial) receptors and are therefore relatively cardioselec - tive. Although they have less effect on airways resistance they are not free of this effect and should be avoided. Beta-blockers slow the heart and may induce myocardial depres- sion, rarely, precipitating heart failure. They should not be given to patients who have incipient ventricular failure, second-or third-degree atrioventricular block, or peripheral vascular disease. Beta-blockers should be used with caution in diabetes since they may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, such as rapid heart rate. Beta-blockers enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin and may precipitate hypoglycaemia. Calcium-Channel Blockers: A calcium-channel blocker, such as verapamil, is used as an alternative to a beta-blocker to treat stable angina. Calcium- channel blockers interfere with the inward movement of calcium ions through the slow channels in heart and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Myocardial contractility may be reduced, the formation and propagation of electrical impulses within the heart may be depressed and coronary or systemic vascular tone may be diminished. Calcium-channel blockers are used to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina due to coronary atherosclerosis or with abnor - mally small coronary arteries and limited vasodilator reserve. Calcium-channel blockers can also be used in patients with unstable angina with a vasospastic origin, such as Prinzmetal's angina and in patients in whom alterations in cardiac tone may influence the angina threshold. Unstable Angina: Unstable angina requires prompt aggressive treatment to prevent progression to myocardial infarction. Initial treatment is with acetylsalicylic acid to inhibit platelet aggregation, followed by heparin. Nitrates and beta-blockers contrain -281 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs dicated, verapamil provided left ventricular function is adequate. Prinzmetal's Angina: Treatment is similar to that for unstable angina, except that a calcium-channel blocker is used instead of a beta-blocker.

Elderly- Paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias: 5 to 10 mg over 3 min, further 5 mg may be given after 5 to 10 min if required. Contraindications Hypotension, bradycardia, second- syndrome; cardiogenic shock; history of heart failure or significantly impaired left ventricular function (even if controlled by therapy); atrial flutter or Adverse Effects Constipation; less commonly nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache, dizziness, fatigue, ankle oedema; rarely, with doses, hypotension, heart failure, bradycardia, heart block and asystole Drugs Treatment of arrhythmias requires precise diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia and electrocardiography is essential; underlying causes such as heart failure require appropriate treatment. Antiarrhythmic drugs must be used cautiously since most drugs that are effective in treating arrhythmias can provoke them in some circumstances; this arrhythmogenic effect is often enhanced by hypokalaemia. When antiarrhythmic drugs are used in combination, their cumulative negative inotropic effects may be significant, particularly if myocardial function is impaired. Atrial Fibrillation: The increased ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation can controlled with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) or verapamil. Digoxin is often effective for controlling the rate at rest; it is also appropriate if atrial fibrillation is accompa-nied by congestive heart failure. Intravenous digoxin is occa- sionally required if the ventricular rate needs rapid control. If adequate control at rest or during exercise cannot be achieved readily verapamil may be introduced with digoxin, but it should be used with caution if ventricular function is impaired. Anticoagulants are indicated especially in valvular or myocardial disease and in the elderly. Warfarin is preferred to acetylsalicylic acid in preventing emboli. If atrial fibrillation began within the previous 48 h and there does not appear to be a danger of thromboembolism, antiarrhythmic drugs, such as procainamide or quinidine, may be used to terminate the fibrillation or to maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion. Atrial Flutter: Digoxin will sometimes slow the ventricular rate at rest. Rever - sion to sinus rhythm is best achieved by direct current elec - trical shock. If the arrhythmia is long-standing, treatment with an anticoagulant should be considered before cardioversion to prevent emboli. Intravenous verapamil reduces ventricular fibrillation during paroxysmal (sudden onset and intermittent) attacks of atrial flutter. An initial intravenous dose may be followed by oral treatment; hypotension may occur with high doses. It should not be used for tachyarrhythmias where the QRS complex is wide unless a supraventricular origin has been established beyond doubt. If the flutter cannot be restored to sinus rhythm, antiarrhythmics such as quinidine can be used. Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia: In most patients this remits spontaneously or can revert to 292 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs sinus rhythm by reflex vagal stimulation. Failing this, intrave - nous injection of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) or verapamil may be effective. Verapamil and a beta-blocker should never be administered concomitantly because of the risk of hypotension and asystole. Ventricular Tachycardia: Very rapid ventricular fibrillation causes profound circula- tory collapse and must be treated immediately with direct current shock. In more stable patients intravenous lidocaine or procainamide may be used. After sinus rhythm is restored, drug therapy to prevent recurrence of ventricular tachycardia should be considered; a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) or verapamil may be effective. Torsades de pointes is a special form of ventricular tachy - cardia associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Initial treatment with intravenous infusion of magnesium sulphate (usual dose 2g over 10-15 min, repeated once if necessary) together with temporary pacing is usually effective; alter - natively, isoprenaline infusion may be given with extreme caution until pacing can be instituted. Isoprenaline is an inotropic sympathomimetic; it increases the heart rate and therefore shortens the QT interval, but given alone it may induce arrhythmias. Bradyarrhythmias: Sinus bradycardia (less than 50 beats/min) associated with acute myocardial infarction may be treated with atropine. Temporary pacing may be required in unresponsive patients. Drugs are of limited value for increasing the sinus rate long term in the pres- ence of intrinsic sinus node disease and permanent pacing is usually required. Cardiac Arrest: In cardiac arrest, epinephrine (adrenaline) is given by intrave - nous injection in a dose of 1 mg (10 ml of 1 in 10,000 solution) as part of the procedure for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Verapamil* (Refer Page No. 289)302 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs 13.3 Antihypertensive Drugs Management of Hypertension: Treatment of hypertension should be integrated into an overall programme to manage factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular events (such as stroke and myocardial infarc- tion). Treatment is oftten life-long. Hypertension was formerly classified as mild, moderate or severe, but a grading system is now preferred. Grade 1 hypertension is defined as 140-159 mmHg systolic blood pressure and 90-99 and 100-109 mmHg diastolic and Grade 3 hypertension more than 180 mmHg systolic and more than 110 mmHg diastolic. The goal of treatment is to obtain the max. tolerated reduc-tion in blood pressure. Lifestyle changes should be introduced for all patients; they include weight reduction, reduction in alcohol intake, reduc-tion of dietary Sodium, stopping tobacco smoking and reduc-tion in saturated fat intake. The patient should eat a healthy nutritious diet including adequate fruit and vegetables and should exercise regularly. These measures alone may be suffi-cient in mild hypertension, but patients with moderate to severe hypertension will also require specific antihypertensive therapy. Drug Treatment of Hypertension: Three classes of drug are used for first-line treatment of hyper - tension: thiazide blockers are considered first-line in specific populations only e.g. Africans or the elderly. Other classes of drugs may be used in certain situations. Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, have been used as first-line antihypertensive therapy and are particularly indicated in the elderly. They have few adverse effects in low doses, but in large doses they may cause a variety of unwanted metabolic effects (principally potassium depletion), reduced glucose tolerance, ventricular ectopic beats and impotence; they should be avoided in gout. These effects can be reduced by keeping the dose as low as possible; higher doses do not produce an increased reduction in blood pressure. Thiazides are inexpensive and, when used in combination, can enhance the effectiveness of many other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) such as aten- olol are effective in all grades of hypertension and are particu-303 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs larly useful in angina and following myocardial infarction; they should be avoided in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart block. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) such as enalapril are effective and well tolerated by most patients. They can be used in heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction and diabetic nephropathy, but should be avoided in renovascular disease and in pregnancy. The most common adverse effect is a dry persistent cough. Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine are useful for isolated systolic hypertension, in populations unresponsive to other antihypertensives (e.g. Africans) and in the elderly when thiazides cannot be used. Short-acting formu-lations of nifedipine should be avoided as they may evoke reflex tachycardia and cause large variations in blood pressure. Drugs acting on the central nervous system are also effective antihypertensive drugs. In particular, methyldopa is effective in the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. A single antihypertensive drug is often not adequate and other antihypertensive drugs are usually added in a stepwise manner until blood pressure is controlled. Hypertensive EmergenciesIn situations where immediate reduction of blood pressure is essential and treatment by mouth is not possible, intravenous infusion of Sodium nitroprusside is effective. Over-rapid reduc-tion in blood pressure is hazardous and can lead to reduced organ perfusion and cerebral infarction. Hypertension in Pregnancy This is defined as a sustained diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more. Drug therapy for chronic hypertension during pregnancy remains controversial. If diastolic blood pressure is greater than 95 mmHg, methyldopa is the safest drug. Beta-blockers should be used with caution in early pregnancy, since they may retard fetal growth; they are effective and safe in the third trimester. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in preg-nancy since they may damage fetal and neonatal blood pres-sure control and renal function. Women who are taking these drugs and become pregnant should have their antihyperten-sive therapy changed immediately. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: If pre-eclampsia or severe hyper - tension occurs beyond the 36th week of pregnancy, delivery is the treatment of choice. For acute severe hypertension in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous hydralazine can be used. Magnesium sulphate is the treatment of choice to prevent eclamptic convulsions in eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia.304 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs Amlodipine* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Angina, hypertension, coronary artery disease.

Antiplatelet drugs also help to inhibit thrombus formation by decreasing platelet aggregation. Thrombolytics (fibrinolytics) such as streptokinase are used to break up thrombi; they are used to treat acute myocardial infarction, extensive deep vein thrombosis, major pulmonary of myocardial infarction includes two phases: initial management of the acute attack long-term management, including prevention of further attacks 1. Initial Management: Oxygen should be given to all patients, except those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pain and anxiety are relieved by slow intravenous injection of an opioid analgesic such as morphine. Metoclopramide may also be given by intramuscular injection to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting caused by morphine. Acetylsalicylic acid 150-300 mg by mouth (preferably chewed or dispersed in water) is given immediately for its antiplatelet effect. Thrombolytic drugs such as streptokinase help to restore perfusion and thus relieve myocardial ischaemia; they should ideally be given within 1 h of infarction (use after 12 h requires specialist advice). Nitrates may also be given to relieve ischaemic pain. Early administration of beta-blockers such as atenolol have been shown to reduce both early mortality and the recur - rence rate of myocardial infarction; initial intravenous admin - istration is followed by long-term oral treatment (unless the patient has contraindications). ACE inhibitors have also been shown to be beneficial in initial management (unless patient has contraindications) when given within 24 h and if possible continued for 5-6 weeks. If arrhythmias occur, they should be treated aggressively, but the likelihood decreases rapidly over the first 24 h after infarction. Ventricular fibrillation should be treated imme-diately with a defibrillator; if this is ineffective alone, the antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine should be given. All patients should be closely monitored for hyperglycaemia; 316 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs those with diabetes mellitus or raised blood-glucose concen- tration should receive insulin. 2. Long-term Management Acetylsalicylic acid should be given to all patients in a dose of 75-150 mg daily by mouth, unless it is contraindicated. The prolonged antiplatelet effect has been shown to reduce the rate of reinfarction. Treatment with beta-blockers should be continued for at least 1 year and possibly for up to 3 years. ACE inhibitors such as enalapril should also be used since they reduce mortality, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Nitrates may be required for patients with angina.The use of statins may also be considered in patients with high risk of recurrence. Stroke: Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) may be ischaemic or haem- orrhagic; precise diagnosis is essential, as management for the two types of stroke is quite different. Primary prevention of both types of stroke includes reduction of high blood pressure, stopping smoking, weight reduction and cholesterol reduction. Atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction and valvular disease may produce embolism and ischaemic stroke. Prophylaxis in patients at risk of ischaemic stroke includes oral anticoagulants such as warfarin and antiplatelet drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid. Treatment of acute ischaemic stroke includes use of acetylsalicylic acid, anticoagulants such as heparin and of thrombolytics, such as streptokinase. Streptokinase must be used with extreme caution due to risk of bleeding. Long-term therapy with acetyl-salicylic acid reduces the risk of having another stroke. Antiplatelet and thrombolytic drugs are not used in the management of haemorrhagic stroke, as they may exacerbate bleeding. The main treatment is to normalize blood pressure. Acetylsalicylic acid is normally given for at least one year after coronary artery bypass surgery. It is also given to patients with prosthetic heart valves who have had cerebral embolism despite warfarin treatment.317 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs Abciximab Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions.

They should also be used with caution in external chest compression; pregnancy (Appendix 7c); elderly; hypertension; abdominal aneurysm or other conditions in which thrombolysis might give rise to embolic complications such as enlarged left atrium with atrial fibrillation (risk of dissolution of clot and subsequent embolisation); diabetic retinopathy (very small risk of retinal bleeding) and recent or concurrent use of drugs that increase the risk of bleeding; hematocrit platelet count; thrombin and prothrombin time. Adverse bleeding. When used in myocardial infarction, reperfusion arrhythmias may occur. Hypotension can also occur and can usually be controlled by elevating the patient's legs or by reducing the rate of infusion or stopping it temporarily. Back pain; fever and convulsions have been reported. Bleeding is usually limited to the site of injection; but intracerebral haemorrhage or bleeding from other sites can occur. Serious bleeding calls for discontinuation of the thrombolytic and may require administration of coagulation factors and antifibrinolytic drugs (aprotinin or tranexamic acid). Rarely, further embolism may occur (either due to clots that break away from the original thrombus or to cholesterol crystal emboli). It causes allergic reactions (including rash; flushing and uveitis) and anaphylaxis has also been reported. Storage Store in a sealed container protected from light in refrigerator (2 to 8C). The container should be sterile, tamper evident and sealed so as to exclude micro-organisms.323 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs 13.5 Blood Products and Plasma Substitutes 13.5.1 Plasma Substitutes Dextran 70 and polygeline are macromolecular substances which are metabolized slowly; they may be used to expand and maintain blood volume in shock arising from conditions such as burns or septicaemia. They are rarely, needed when shock is due to Sodium and water depletion as, in these circumstances, the shock responds to water and electrolyte repletion. Plasma substitutes should not be used to maintain plasma volume in conditions such as burns or peritonitis where there is loss of plasma protein, water and electrolytes over periods of several days. In these situations, plasma or plasma protein frac-tions containing large amounts of albumin should be given. Plasma substitutes may be used as an immediate short-term measure to treat massive haemorrhage until blood is avail - able, but large volumes of some plasma substitutes can increase the risk of bleeding by depleting coagulation factors. Dextran may interfere with blood group cross-matching or biochemical measurements and these should be carried out before the infusion is started. Albumin* Pregnancy Category-C Indications Burns, hypoproteinaemia, shock, hypovolemia, acute liver dialysis. Availability S of infusion: up or 1 to 2 ml/min (20%). Contraindications Congestive heart failure, severe anaemia, history of allergic reactions to human albumin; pregnancy (Appendix 7c).324 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs Precautions If dehydration is present additional fluid must follow the administration of albumin.

Adverse Effects Hypersensitivity reactions may occur including; rarely,; severe anaphylactoid reactions; in bleeding time occur; headache; tachycardia; itching; fall in blood pressure. 13.5.2 Plasma Fraction for Specific Use Factor VIII is essential for blood clotting and the maintenance of effective haemostasis; von Willebrand factor is a mediator in platelet aggregation and also acts as a carrier for factor VIII. Blood coagulation factors VII, IX and X are essential for the conversion of factor II (prothrombin) to thrombin. Deficiency in any of these factors results in haemophilia. Bleeding episodes in haemophilia 326 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs require prompt treatment with replacement therapy. Factor VIII, used for the treatment of haemophilia A, is a sterile freeze-dried powder containing the blood coagulation factor VIII fraction prepared from pooled human venous plasma. Standard factor VIII preparations also contain von Willebrand factor and may be used to treat von Willebrand disease. Highly purified prepara-tions, including recombinant factor VIII, are available; they are indicated for the treatment of haemophilia A but do not contain sufficient von Willebrand factor for use in the management of von Willebrand disease. Factor IX Complex is a sterile freeze-dried concentrate of blood coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X derived from fresh venous plasma. Factor IX complex which is used for the treatment of haemophilia B may also be used for the treatment of bleeding due to deficencies of factor II, VII and X. High purity prepa-rations of factor IX which do not contain clinically effective amounts of factor II, VII and X are available. A recombinant factor IX preparation is also available.

(Appendix 7c), intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic history, coadministration with hormonal contraceptives may increase risk of thrombosis, stroke, or myocardial infarction; women using hormonal contraception should take tranexamic acid only if there is a strong medical need, and if the benefit of treatment outweighs risks. Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported. Retinal venous and arterial occlusion has been reported in patients using tranexamic acid. Patients should be instructed to report visual and ocular symptoms promptly. Adverse Effects Nausea, vomiting, diarhoea, disturbances in colour vision (discontinue), thromboembolic events, allergic skin reactions; giddiness and hypotension on rapid intravenous injection, headache, backache, musculoskeletal pain. Storage Store protected from light and moisture at a temperature not exceeding 30C.329 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs 13.6 Drugs Affecting Coagulation Anticoagulants are used to prevent thrombus formation or extension of an existing thrombus in the slower-moving venous side of the circulation, where the thrombus consists of a fibrin web enmeshed with platelets and red cells. They are there - fore used widely in the prevention and treatment of deep- vein thrombosis in the legs, prophylaxis of embolization in rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation and to prevent thrombi forming on prosthetic heart valves. Heparin is a parenteral anticoagulant that initiates antico- agulation rapidly but has a short duration of action. The low molecular weight heparins have a longer duration of action. For the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmo - nary embolism heparin is given as an intravenous loading dose followed by continuous intravenous infusion (using an infusion pump) or by intermittent subcutaneous injection. An oral anticoagulant is started at the same time as heparin. The heparin needs to be continued for at least 5 days, until the oral anticoagulant has taken effect and the INR (interna-tional normalized ratio) has been in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days. Laboratory monitoring is essential, on a daily basis. Heparin is also used in regimens for the manage- ment of myocardial infarction, the management of unstable angina, acute peripheral arterial occlusion and in dialysis. In patients undergoing general surgery, low-dose heparin by subcutaneous injection is used to prevent postoperative deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high risk patients (those with obesity, malignant disease, history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, patients over 40 years, those with an established thrombophilic disorder or those undergoing major or complicated surgery). It is also of value in high-risk medical patients, for example obesity, heart failure, when confined to bed. If haemorrhage occurs it is usually sufficient to withdraw heparin, but if rapid reversal of the effects of heparin is required, protamine sulphate is a specific antidote. Oral anticoagulants take at least 48-72 h for the anticoagulant effect to develop fully; if an immediate effect is needed, heparin must be given concomitantly. Warfarin is indicated in deep- vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, for patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of embolization and for those with mechanical prosthetic heart valves (to prevent emboli devel-oping on the valves); oral anticoagulants should not be used in cerebral thrombosis or peripheral arterial occlusion as first- line therapy. The main adverse effect of oral anticoagulants is 330 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs haemorrhage. Prothrombin time (usually reported as INR, inter - national normalized ratio) should be checked on a daily basis initially then at longer intervals depending on response. If severe haemorrhage occurs, stop warfarin and give phytom-enadione (vitamin K) by Slow intravenous injection Anticoagulants in Pregnancy: Oral anticoagulants are teratogenic and should not be given in the first trimester of pregnancy. Women at risk of pregnancy should be warned of this danger since stopping warfarin before the sixth week of gestation may largely avoid the risk of fetal abnormality. Oral anticoagulants cross the placenta with the risk of placental or fetal haemorrhage, especially during the last few weeks of pregnancy and at delivery. Therefore, if at all possible, oral anticoagulants should be avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first and third trimester. Difficult decisions may have to be made, particularly in women with prosthetic heart valves or with a history of recurrent venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Haemophilia: Desmopressin by injection may aid haemostasis and be useful in mild forms of haemophilia. For minor procedures including dental surgery, it may circumvent the need for factor VIII. 331 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs Heparin* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications and prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; atrial of peripheral prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in major surgery; lipemia clearing.

Contraindications Pregnancy (Appendix Store protected from light.336 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs 13.7 Drugs Used in Heart Failure Treatment of heart failure aims to relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, reduce incidence of acute exacerbations and reduce mortality. Drugs used to treat heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction include ACE inhibitors, bisoprolol), cardiac glycosides and vasodilators. In addition, measures such as weight reduction, moderate salt restriction and appro-priate exercise should be introduced. The primary treatment of heart failure is with ACE inhibitors such as enalapril which can be used in all stages of chronic heart failure to prevent further deterioration and progression of heart disease. A thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide is used in the management of mild to moderate heart failure when the patient has mild fluid retention and severe pulmonary oedema is not present; however thiazides are ineffective if renal function is poor. In these patients and in more severe fluid retention, a loop diuretic such as furosemide is required. In severe fluid retention, intravenous furosemide produces relief from breathlessness and reduces preload sooner than would be expected from the time of onset of diuresis. Hypoka-laemia may develop, but is less likely with the shorter-acting loop diuretics than with the thiazides; care is needed to avoid hypotension. A combination of a thiazide and a loop diuretic may be required to treat refractory oedema. The combination often produces a synergistic effect on solute and water excretion, which relieves symptoms in the diuretic-resistant heart failure patient. However, the combination may produce excessive intravascular volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances including potentially life-threatening hypokalaemia. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone may be considered for patients with severe heart failure who are already receiving an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic; a low dose of spironolactone (usually 25 mg daily) reduces symptoms and mortality rate in these patients. Close monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium is necessary with any change in treatment or in the patient's clinical condition. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, increases the strength of cardiac muscle contractions and increases cardiac output. In mild heart failure, digoxin inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and produces arterial vasodilation. It produces symptomatic improvement, increases exercise tolerance and reduces hospi - talization, but it does not reduce mortality. It is considered for patients with atrial fibrillation and those who remain sympto-337 NFI-2011Cardiovascular Drugs matic despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and a suitable beta-blocker. Vasodilators are used in heart failure to reduce systemic vascular resistance. Isosorbide dinitrate produces mainly venous dilatation, which reduces left ventricular preload, leading to a reduction in pulmonary congestion and dysp-noea. Hydralazine produces mainly arterial vasodilation, which reduces left ventricular afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output. Isosorbide dinitrate and hydrala-zine can be used in combination when an ACE inhibitor cannot be used. Dopamine, an inotropic sympathomimetic, may be given for short periods in the treatment of severe heart failure. Dosage is critical; at low doses it stimulates myocardial contractility and increases cardiac output, however, higher doses (more than 5 \u00b5g/kg per min) cause vasoconstriction, with a wors-ening of heart failure.

Studies indicate that, 1% drop in serum cholesterol reduces the risk for Coronary heart disease (CHD) by 2%. Various classes of drugs used as lipid lowering drugs are- H mg-CoA reductase inhibitors They are the most efficacious and tolerable drugs like simv - astatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin etc. They are primarily indi - cated in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients who have symptomatic atherosclerotic disease following acute myocardial infarction or stroke and in primary prevention of arterial disease in patients who are at high risk because of elevated serum cholesterol concentra-tion. Common adverse effects include mild gastrointestinal disturbances, rhabdomyolysis etc. Fibric acid derivatives This class of drugs including fenofibrate, gemfibrozil etc are indicated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (i.e. raised serum triglycerides and cholesterol), low high density lipopro- tein (HDL) and high risk of atheromatous disease (often type 2 diabetic patients), and in severe treatment- resistant dysli - pidemia. Major adverse effect include rhabdomyolysis and myoglobulinuria. Fibrates are better avoided in alcoholics. Bile acid sequestrants Drugs like cholestyramine, colestipol though are not clinically popular because of interference with absorption of many drugs like digoxin, warfarin etc and poor patient acceptability, but can be indicated in heterozygous familiar hypercholeste - rolemia. Adverse effects include nausea, abdominal constipation or diarrhoea. Nicotinic acid Nicotinic acid reduces serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels in types II, III, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemias.

Dermatological Drugs 14.1 Antibacterial Drugs Staphylococcal infections of the skin such as impetigo, follicu - litis, and furunculi and streptococcal infections such as cellu - litis and erysipelas are very common where the climate is hot and humid, where standards of hygiene are compromised, and in immunodeficient patients. In all skin infections, an important part of treatment is cleansing and thorough drying. Washing with soap and water will often help to prevent infection. Light localized infections can often be treated effectively with an antiseptic solution such as chlo - rhexidine. Superficial crusts should be gently washed with soap and water or a weak solution of aluminium acetate or a 0.01% solution of potassium permanganate. Infected burns should be treated with silver sulfadiazine, which is bactericidal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. An ointment containing 2% mupirocin, which is active against Gram-positive bacteria, is of value, particularly in impetigo. To prevent the development of resistance, mupirocin should not be used for more than 10 days. Topical preparations containing neomycin and bacitracin are also widely used but these carry a risk of sensitization particularly with continued or repeated use. Topical use of preparations containing antimicrobials which are widely used systemically should be avoided. These include penicillins, sulfonamides, streptomycin and gentamicin, which should be reserved for the systemic treatment of infections because of the possibility of inducing sensitivity and favouring the emergence of resistant organisms. Only widespread super - ficial or deep-seated infections associated with fever require treatment with a systemic antibiotic. Whenever possible, the choice of an antimicrobial should be based on the results of sensitivity tests.348 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs Gentian Violet* Pregnancy Category-C Indications Superficial fungal and bacterial infections.

Storage Store light.350 Ringworm: Benzoic acid and chloride (gentian violet) solution are inexpensive and effective fungistatic compounds for the treatment of dermatophyte infections such as ring- worm. Minor skin lesions due to ringworm can be cleared with repeated applications of compound benzoic acid ointment (Whitfield ointment), which combines the fungistatic action of benzoic acid with the keratolytic action of salicylic acid. However, the most effective topical treatment for dermato- phyte infections is a cream containing an imidazole such as miconazole, which is effective for long-established lesions but is more expensive than compound benzoic acid ointment. Extensive and generalized infections of the skin, nails and scalp should be treated systemically for several weeks with griseofulvin or fluconazole. Scalp ringworm (Tinea capitis) typically appears as a patch of scaling alopecia, or a swollen inflammatory area (Tinea kerion). Mild forms may remit spontaneously at puberty. Inflamed lesions should be treated systemically with griseof - ulvin. Application of miconazole cream may accelerate healing of scaly lesions. Ringworm on the body (Tinea corporis) can also be cleared with compound benzoic acid ointment or a topical imidazole such as miconazole. In resistant cases a 4-week course of oral griseofulvin is required. Foot ringworm (Tinea pedis or athlete's foot) is usually treated topically. Compound benzoic acid ointment should be applied twice daily to all infected areas and all toe clefts for at least 4 weeks. Systemic therapy with griseofulvin or fluconazole may be required if the foot is extensively infected. Tinea pedis commonly recurs and may be treated with miconazole cream. Severe weeping lesions respond to frequent soaking in solu - tions of 1:10,000 potassium permanganate and systemic anti-fungals also be needed. Nail infections (onychomycosis, tinea unguium ) are difficult to treat; fingernails may require 6 months treatment with oral griseofulvin and toenails may require 12 months or more of this treatment. Approximately 60% of nail infections either do not respond or relapse after treatment with griseofulvin. Ringworm of the groin (Tinea cruris) is usually limited to the skin of the inner thigh in contact with the scrotum. Flex - ural eczema, often superinfected with candida or bacteria, occurs in the same site. The latter is frequently treated with 351 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs combined antifungal/corticosteroid preparations, but must not be treated with a corticosteroid alone, which will worsen the condition. An imidazole cream such as miconazole applied daily for 2 weeks is usually effective. Lesions unresponsive to topical preparations can usually be cleared with a 4-week course of griseofulvin. Candidosis: Candida can infect the oral cavity, the vagina or the skin. Cuta- neous lesions tend to occur in patients with diabetes mellitus and some chronic debilitating conditions, including hypopar - athyroidism and various congenital disorders of the immune system. The most severe infections of candida are now seen in patients with HIV infection. Cutaneous candidosis usually responds to miconazole cream as a twice daily application. Chronic candida paronychia, which can result ultimately in nail dystrophy, is more diffi-cult to treat. Treatment should be based on determination of the underlying cause and its reduction or elimination; hands and folds of the nail must be kept dry and daily application of an imidazole cream for several months may be required, ensuring penetration of the cleft between the nail plate and the swollen skin around the nail. Pityriasis Versicolor: Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor is caused by a commensal yeast. Application of Sodium thiosulfate twice daily for 4 weeks is usually effective although areas of depigmentation on darker skins remain after completion of treatment. Relapses can be frequent, however, probably because much of the infected area may appear normal and be left untreated. Better results have been reported with topical applications of miconazole or selenium sulphide. Benzoic Acid + Salicylic Acid Salicylic Acid Pregnancy Category-C Indications Mild dermatophyte infections, particularly caused by Tinea pedis and Tinea corporis. Availability CREAM 25 and 50g (Aluminium tubes, jars). Dose Fungal skin infections: apply twice daily until the infected skin is shed (usually at least 4 weeks).

Storage Store protected from light and moisture.353 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs 14.3 Anti-Inflammatory and Antipruritic Drugs Contact Dermatitis: Contact dermatitis can result from an allergic or irritant skin reaction. Removal of the substance provoking the reaction is the first step in treating this condition. Mild cases of contact dermatitis can be treated with topical hydrocortisone which suppresses inflammation. A short course of oral prednisolone or a topical corticosteroid such as betamethasone should be considered for more severe cases and for suppression of severe acute reactions associated with blistering, exudation and oedema. Soaking in clean water or mild saline solution is recommended in the acute stages of severe dermatitis. Pruritus: Pruritus or itching is a common symptom of many skin diseases. However, contact with certain substances, condi - tions that dry the skin, stress, and extremes of temperature may also be a cause. Thus, an important part of treatment is to eliminate or minimize the reason for the irritation. Corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone or betamethasone applied topically, can give relief. Soothing baths or the appli - cation of an emollient cream may also be helpful. Systemic antihistamines, such as oral chlorpheniramine, may relieve generalized pruritus. Atopic Dermatitis: Atopic dermatitis (or eczema) is a common skin disorder, which mainly occurs in infants and children; it is associated with intense itching, with areas of red skin. Pruritus may be partially relieved by applying astringent aluminium acetate lotion to exudative lesions and emollients to lichenified plaques. Topical hydrocortisone should be applied in short courses of 1-2 weeks to treat even mild areas of involvement. The use of betamethasone should be considered in the treat - ment of persistent localized dermatitis in adults. Topical anti- histamines are not effective and should be avoided because of the risk of sensitization. However, a sedative antihistamine can be given at night to calm pruritus and facilitate sleep. A secondary infection, often involving Staphylococcus aureus, may be responsible for exacerbations; in such cases, an oral antibiotic such as erythromycin can be given for 7-10 days. Seborrhoeic Dermatitis: Use of a keratolytic shampoo and exposure to ultraviolet light reduce both the inflammation and the scaling resulting from seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp (dandruff). The shampoo 354 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs should be massaged into the scalp, immediately rinsed off and then reapplied until a foam is produced, leaving the second application in contact with the scalp for at least 5 min. Sele-nium sulfide, which has both antifungal and keratolytic prop - erties, is widely used in many proprietary shampoos. A combi - nation of sulphur and salicylic acid, which has an additional antimicrobial action, is also effective. Ichthyosis: In ichthyosis, emollients such as aqueous creams and emul-sifying creams should be applied daily (or more frequently in severe cases) to affected skin. The addition of a keratolytic, such as salicylic acid 5% can be helpful. Lichen Planus: Lichen planus is a chronic, papular, pruritic skin eruption that occurs typically in middle age and later life; the condition is often mild and may need no treatment. In more severe cases, when the underlying cause cannot be identified, a topical corticosteroid offers the only prospect of remission. Pityriasis Rosea: In pityriasis rosea, a common self-limiting dermatosis that is probably of infective origin, calamine lotion helps to relieve pruritus in most cases. If it does not, topical application of hydro-cortisone in a concentration not exceeding 1% is worth trying. Betamethasone* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Severe inflammatory Addison's disease, Simmond's disease, bursitis.

Potassium permanganate may be used in the same way. Zinc Oxide* It is astringent antiseptic available in the form of powder.358 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs 14.5 Drugs Affecting Skin Differentiation and Proliferation Acne Vulgaris: Acne is a disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and typically first appears during puberty when androgenic stimulation trig-gers excessive production of sebum. Mild acne is characterized by comedones and a few pustules which heal without scarring, and usually responds to topical therapy alone. In moderate acne, where there are more extensive pustules causing mild scar - ring, oral antibiotics such as a tetracycline or erythromycin are commonly used. In severe acne , widespread pustules are accom- panied by nodular with estrogens, antiandrogens, or retinoids. Since scarring of the skin resulting from severe nodular acne causes major distress, acne should always be treated as soon as possible. Exposure to substances suspected of causing or aggravating the condition should be avoided. Systemic treatment must be continued for several months before a response can be anticipated. During this time, topical preparations should be applied to the affected areas to prevent the development of new lesions. Benzoyl peroxide is a keratolytic drug with bacteriostatic activity against Propionibacterium acnes; treatment is usually started at a lower strength and increased as tolerance develops to the initial irritant reaction. Preparations containing sulphur, which is bactericidal and promotes desquamation, are often used, and may be combined with salicylic acid, which is a keratolytic agent. Topical antibiotics such as clindamycin are widely used in inflammatory acne. However, treatment must be maintained for 2 to 3 months before any benefit is seen and this prolonged course carries the risk of selection and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Psoriasis: Psoriasis, which affects people of all ages in all countries, is one of the most common chronic dermatoses in industrial-ized countries, and is characterized by epidermal thickening and scaling. Considerable local variations in its prevalence have been variously attributed to genetic, climatic, nutritional and ecological factors. Various biological events may trigger psoriasis, such as streptococcal or viral infection, an emotional crisis or pregnancy. Occasionally psoriasis may be provoked or exacerbated by drugs such as ACE inhibitors, beta-adreno-ceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), chloroquine, vulgaris (chronic plaque psoriasis) is the most common form of the condition, usually affecting extensor surfaces of the limbs and the scalp. Guttate psoriasis, commonly seen in children, is often caused by a streptococcal infection; lesions may disappear following antimicrobial treat - ment. The condition is also known to resolve spontaneously but more commonly transforms into chronic plaque psoriasis. No treatment is known to assure remission, although sunlight often clears lesions. Dithranol restores the normal rate of epidermal cell prolif - eration and keratinization, and localized psoriasis vulgaris can frequently be cleared by daily applications for a period of 2 to 4 weeks. A short contact method of application causes little, if any, irritation or staining of normal skin, and is particularly useful for outpatient management. There is a risk of severe conjunctivitis if dithranol enters the eye. Crude coal tar is also effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Some preparations additionally contain salicylic acid as a kera-tolytic. Good results are often obtained when daily applica-tions or baths are combined with exposure to ultraviolet light or sunlight. Emollients containing low concentrations of salicylic acid (1-2%) are a useful adjunct to treatment, particularly where there is thick scaling. A preparation containing urea 10%, which has moisturizing, keratolytic and antimitotic properties, may prove more effective than an emollient. Topical corticosteroids have a limited role in psoriasis. A mild corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone may be used on the face and flexures, whereas a potent corticosteroid such as betamethasone is most appropriate for the scalp, hands and feet. However, when extensive areas of the body surface are involved or when there is erythrodermic psoriasis, sufficient may be absorbed to cause adrenal suppression; also rebound often occurs after stopping treatment, resulting in a more unstable form of psoriasis. Actinic Keratosis: The lesions of actinic keratosis are distributed primarily over sun-exposed areas. Horny growths, which are often covered by light brown scales, are usually asymptomatic but can be disfiguring. They respond to light cautery and cryosurgery or topical application of 5-fluorouracil over a three-week period. Simple emollients may be satisfactory for people with many lesions.360 NFI-2011Dermatological Drugs Warts: Warts most commonly affect the hands, feet (plantar warts, verrucas), and anogenital region (condylomata acuminata); all are caused by the human papilloma virus. They may regress spontaneously at any time within months or years of their first appearance; however, particularly in immunosup-pressed patients, they may spread and be difficult to cure. Many common, plane and plantar warts can reasonably be left untreated, but painful or unsightly lesions generally respond to application of preparations containing salicylic acid. Where available, cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen applied with a cotton-tip or a spray is highly effective; however, freezing the skin can produce temporary or permanent depigmentation (particularly on dark skin), and should be used with caution. Anogenital warts are usually transmitted by sexual contact; they should always be treated, although they frequently recur, because of the increased risk of cervical cancer. Podo - phyllum resin, a caustic antimitotic agent, may be applied to small external lesions. The risk of extensive local necrosis and of systemic toxicity excludes the use of podophyllum resin on larger surfaces. When available, podophyllotoxin is a less toxic alternative. Where podophyllum is contraindicated or ineffective surgical removal, electrocautery, cryosurgery and laser therapy are possible options. Topical application of 5-fluorouracil has been reported to be of value in resistant cases but the treatment is expensive and efficacy is still under investigation.

It is readily transmitted from person to person; therefore the entire household must be treated at the same time to prevent reinfection. It is not necessary to take a bath before treatment with an acaricide, but all clothing and bedding should be washed to prevent reinfection. Benzyl benzoate is an inexpensive scabicide. It must be applied to all skin surfaces, from the scalp to the soles of the feet, avoiding contact with the eyes; it is too irritant for use on chil- dren. Permethrin is less irritant and more effective than benzyl benzoate, but also more expensive; it may be used on children. Young infants can be treated with a cream containing precipi-tated sulphur 6-10% applied once daily for one week. Pediculosis: Pediculosis of the head and body is capitis by Pthirus pubis , which may also affect the eye lashes and brows. All are trans-mitted by person to person contact, and may also contaminate clothing and bedding. All members of the affected household (and sexual contacts) must be treated at the same time, and clothing and bedding should be washed or exposed to the air; in head lice infestations, hair brushes and combs should also be disinfected. Head and body lice are readily treated with permethrin; malathion is effective against pubic lice. Benzyl benzoate may used for all lice Indications Scabies; head, body (25g). Dose Adult- Scabies: apply from neck down at night for 2 nights; on each occasion wash off after at least 24 h.

Diagnostic Agents 15.1 Immunologicals The tuberculin test has limited diagnostic value. A positive tuberculin test indicates previous exposure to mycobacterial antigens through infection with one of the tubercle bacilli, or BCG vaccination. The tuberculin test does not distinguish between tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infection, between active and quiescent disease, or between acquired infection and seroconversion induced by BCG vaccination. Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative* (Tuberculin PPD) Indications Used for test of hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein. Availability Available at special clinics or by specialists. Dose Intradermal injection Adult and Child- 5 to 10 units (1 unit may be used in hypersensitive patients or if tuberculosis is suspected). Contraindications Should not be used within 3 weeks of receiving a live viral vaccine. Precautions Elderly; malnutrition; viral or bacterial infections (including HIV and severe tuberculosis), malignant disease, corticosteroid or immunosuppressant therapy-diminished sensitivity to tuberculin; avoid contact with open cuts, abraded or diseased skin, eyes or mouth. Adverse Effects Occasionally nausea, headache, malaise, rash; immediate local reactions (more common in atopic patients); rarely, vesicular or ulcerating Agents 15.2 Ophthalmics Fluorescein is used in ocular diagnostic procedures and for locating damaged areas of the cornea due to injury or disease. Tropicamide is a short-acting relatively weak mydriatic that dilates the pupil and paralyses the ciliary muscle. It facilitates the examination of the fundus of the eye.

Avoid operating machinery or driving for 1-2 h after mydriasis. Adverse Effects Transient stinging and raised intraocular pressure; Store protected from light and moisture. For eye drops: store in a refrigerator (8 to 15C). It should not be allowed to freeze.372 NFI-2011Diagnostic Agents 15.3 Radiocontrast Media Radiographic contrast media are needed for delineating soft tissue structures such as blood vessels, stomach, bowel loops and body cavities not otherwise visualized by standard X-ray examination. The contrast media in this group containing heavy atoms (metal or iodine) absorb a significantly different amount of X-rays than the surrounding soft tissue, thereby making the examined structures visible on radiographs. Barium sulphate is a metal salt which is used to delineate the gastrointestinal tract. It is not absorbed by the body and does not interfere with stomach or bowel secretion or produce misleading radiographic artefacts. Barium sulphate may be used in either single- or double-contrast techniques or computer-assisted axial tomography. For double contrast examination gas can be introduced into the gastrointestinal tract by using suspensions of barium sulphate containing carbon dioxide or by using separate gas-producing prepara-tions based on Sodium bicarbonate. Air administered through a gastrointestinal tube can be used as an alternative to carbon dioxide to achieve a double-contrast effect. Amidotrizoates (meglumine monomeric organic compounds. Both salts have used alone in diagnostic radiography including computer-assisted axial tomography but a mixture of both is often preferred to minimize adverse effects and to improve the quality of the examination. Amidotrizoates are used in a wide range of procedures including urography and examination of the gallbladder, biliary ducts and spleen. Owing to their high osmolality and the resulting hypertonic solutions, they are associated with a high incidence of adverse effects. Radiodensity depends on iodine concentration, and osmolality depends on number of particles in a given weight of solvent. The osmolality for a given radiodensity can be reduced by using an ionic dimeric medium such as meglumine iotroxate which contains twice the number of iodine atoms in a molecule or by using a non-ionic medium such as iohexol. Low osmolality media such as iohexol are associated with a reduction in some adverse effects (see below), but they are generally more expen-sive. Iohexol is used for a wide range of diagnostic procedures including urography, angiography and arthrography and also in is an oral iodinated ionic monomeric organic compound. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, excreted into the bile and concentrated in the gallbladder thus making it ideal for chole-cystography. Propyliodone is an iodinated organic compound which is used for the examination of the bronchial tract. Meglu-373 NFI-2011Diagnostic Agents mine to iodinated radiocontrast media are more common with ionic, high osmolality compounds. Patients with a history of asthma or allergy, drug hypersensi - tivity, adrenal suppression, heart disease, previous reaction to contrast media, and those receiving beta-adrenoceptor antag-onists (beta-blockers) are at increased risk. Non-ionic media are preferred for these patients and beta-blockers should be discontinued if possible. Barium Sulphate* Indications Radiographic examination of the gastrointestinal tract.

Dialysis Fluids Solutions for peritoneal dialysis are preparations for intraperi- toneal use which contain electrolytes in a similar concentra-tion to that in plasma, and also contain glucose or another suitable osmotic agent. Peritoneal dialysis solutions always contain sodium, chloride, and hydrogen carbonate or a precursor; they may also contain calcium, magnesium, and potassium. In renal failure haemodialysis is the preferred method to correct the accumulation of toxins, electrolytes and fluid. Peritoneal dialysis is less efficient than haemodialysis, but it is preferred in children, diabetic patients, and patients with unstable cardiovascular disease; it is also used in patients who can manage their condition, or those who live far from a dialysis centre. It is unsuitable for patients who have had significant abdominal surgery. In peritoneal dialysis, the solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity, where exchange of electrolytes takes place by diffusion and convection, and excess fluid is removed by osmosis, using the peritoneal membrane as an osmotic membrane. There are two forms of peritoneal dialysis: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), in which dialysis is performed manually by the patient several times each day automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), in which dialysis is performed by machine overnight. The main complication of peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, which often results from poor exchange technique; infec - tions of the catheter exit site may also occur, again because of poor technique. With long-term dialysis progressive struc-tural changes to the peritoneal membrane occur, ultimately resulting in dialysis failure.378 NFI-2011Dialysis Fluids Intraperitoneal Dialysis Solution* Indications Haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in renal failure; acute pulmonary oedema with renal insufficiency, cardiac dropsy.

Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and Drugs for Gout 17.1 Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) The process of cartilage and bone destruction which occurs in rheumatoid arthritis may be reduced by the use of a diverse group of drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modi gold compounds. Treatment should be started early in the course of the disease, before joint damage starts. Treatment is usually initiated with a NSAID when the diagnosis is uncertain and the disease course unpredictable. However, when the diagnosis, progression and severity of rheumatic disease have been confirmed, a DMARD should be introduced. DMARDs do not produce an immediate improvement but require 4-6 months of treatment for a full response. Their long- term use is limited by toxicity and loss of efficacy. If one drug does not lead to objective benefit within 6 months, it should be discontinued and another DMARD substituted. Adverse reac-tions with DMARDs occur frequently and may be life threat - ening; careful monitoring is needed to avoid severe toxicity. Blood disorders (bone marrow suppression) can occur during treatment with many DMARDs; blood counts should be carried out before and during treatment, and patients should be advised to report without delay any unexplained symptom such as bleeding, bruising, purpura, infection, sore throat or fever. It has been suggested that combinations of DMARDs may be more effective than single drug but increased toxicity may be a problem; whether used alone or in combination, they should be prescribed only by specialists to ensure that they are used safely and to best advantage. The antimalarial chloroquine is less effective than most other DMARDs, but as it is generally better tolerated it may be preferred in the treatment of mild rheumatoid arthritis. Chloroquine should not be used for psoriatic arthritis. Because long-term therapy can result in retinopathy ophthalmolog - ical examinations should be conducted before and during treatment.382 NFI-2011Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and Drugs for Gout Sulfasalazine has a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect and is considered by some rheumatologists to be a first-line DMARD, but it is poorly tolerated by about 25% of patients. Adverse reactions include blood disorders (bone marrow suppres-sion), hepatotoxicity, skin reactions and gastrointestinal distur - bances. immunosuppressant, is considered to be a first-line DMARD; at the low doses used for rheumatoid arthritis it is well tolerated but there remains the risk of blood disorders (bone marrow suppression) and of hepatic and pulmonary toxicity. Other immunosuppressant drugs, including azathioprine, are generally reserved for use in patients with severe disease who have failed to respond to other DMARDs, especially in those with extra-cellular manifestations such as vasculitis. Immunosuppressants are used in psoriatic arthritis. Adverse reactions include blood disorders, alopecia, nausea and vomiting. Penicillamine is not a first-line drug and its use is limited by a significant incidence of adverse effects including blood disor - ders (bone marrow suppression), proteinuria and rash. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs but their place in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis remains contro-versial. Their usefulness is limited by adverse effects and their use should be controlled by specialists. Corticosteroids are usually reserved for use in patients with severe disease which has failed to respond to other antirheumatic drugs, or where there are severe extra-articular effects such as vascu-litis. Corticosteroids are also used to control disease activity during initial therapy with DMARDs. Although corticosteroids are associated with bone loss this appears to be dose-related; recent studies have suggested that a low dose of a corticos- teroid started during the first two years of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis may reduce the rate of joint destruc-tion. The smallest effective dose should be used, such as oral prednisolone 7.5 mg daily for 2-4 years only, and at the end of treatment the dose should be tapered off slowly to avoid possible long term adverse effects. Relatively high doses of a corticosteroid, with cyclophosphamide, may be needed to control vasculitis.

Storage Store protected from light.388 NFI-2011Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and Drugs for Gout 17.2 Drugs for Gout Acute Gout: Acute attacks of gout are usually treated with high doses of a NSAID such as indomethacin (150-200 mg daily in divided doses); ibuprofen has weaker anti-inflammatory properties than other NSAIDs and is therefore less suitable for treatment of gout. Salicylates, including acetylsalicylic acid are also not suitable because they may increase plasma-urate concentra-tions. Colchicine is an alternative for those patients in whom NSAIDs are contraindicated. Its use is limited by toxicity with high doses. It does not induce fluid retention and can there - fore be given to patients with heart failure; it can also be given to patients receiving anticoagulants. Chronic Gout: For long-term control of gout in patients who have frequent attacks, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol may be used to reduce production of uric acid. It should not be used to treat an acute attack since it may prolong it indefinitely. Treatment for chronic gout should not be started until after an acute attack has completely subsided, usually 2-3 weeks. The initiation of allopurinol treatment may precipitate an acute attack therefore colchicine or a suitable NSAID should be used as a prophylactic and continued for at least one month after the hyperuricaemia has been corrected. If an acute attack develops during treatment for chronic gout, then allopurinol should continue at the same dosage and the acute attack should be treated in its own right. Treatment for chronic gout must be continued indefinitely to prevent further attacks of gout.389 NFI-2011Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and Drugs for Schedule H Indications Prophylaxis of gout; prophylaxis of hyperuricaemia associated with cancer chemotherapy.

Some diuretics are used at lower doses to reduce raised blood pressure. Osmotic diuretics are mainly used to treat cerebral oedema, and also to lower raised intraocular pressure. Most diuretics increase urine volume by inhibiting the reab- sorption of Sodium and chloride ions in the renal tubule; they also modify renal handling of potassium, calcium, magnesium and urate. Osmotic diuretics act differently; they cause an increase in urine volume by an osmotic effect. Although loop diuretics are the most potent their duration of action is relatively short, whilst thiazide diuretics are moder - ately potent but produce diuresis for a longer period. Potassi - um-sparing diuretics are relatively weak. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are weak diuretics which are rarely, used for their diuretic effect and are principally used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Electrolyte Imbalance: The adverse effects of diuretic therapy are mainly due to the fluid and electrolyte imbalance induced by the drugs. Hyponat - raemia is an adverse effect of all diuretics. The risk of hypoka- laemia, which may occur with both thiazide and loop diuretics, depends more on the duration of action than on potency and is thus greater with thiazides than with loop diuretics (when given in equipotent doses). Potassium-sparing diuretics and loop diuretics). Symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, thirst, gastrointestinal disturbances (including nausea, vomiting), weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, headache, muscle pains or cramps, hypo-tension (including postural hypotension), oliguria, arrhyth-mias. Elderly: The elderly are more susceptible to electrolyte imbalance than younger patients. Treatment should begin with a lower initial dose of the diuretic (commonly about 50% of the adult dose) and then adjusted carefully according to renal function, plasma electrolytes and and act by inhibiting Sodium and chloride reab- sorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule. They produce diuresis within 1-2 h of oral administration and most have a duration of action of 12-24 h. Thiazide diuretics are used in the management of oedema associated with mild to moderate congestive heart failure, renal dysfunction or hepatic disease; however, thiazides are not effective in patients with poor renal function (creatinine clear - ance of less than 30 ml per min). In severe fluid retention a loop diuretic may be necessary. In hypertension, a thiazide diuretic is used at a low dose to lower blood pressure with very little biochemical disturbance; the max. therapeutic effect may not be seen for several weeks. Higher doses should not be used because they do not neces-sarily increase the hypotensive response but may cause marked changes in plasma potassium, magnesium, uric acid, glucose and lipids. If a thiazide alone does not lower blood pressure adequately, it may be used in combination with another anti-hypertensive such as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Urinary excretion of calcium is reduced by thiazide diuretics and this property is occasionally utilized in the treatment of idiopathic hypercalciuria in patients with calcium-containing calculi. Paradoxically, thiazide diuretics are used in the treat - ment of diabetes insipidus, since in this disease they reduce urine volume. Thiazide diuretics, especially in high doses, produce a marked increase in potassium excretion which may cause hypoka-laemia; this is dangerous in patients with severe coronary artery disease and those being treated with cardiac glyco- sides. In hepatic failure hypokalaemia can precipitate enceph-alopathy, particularly in alcoholic cirrhosis. Potassium-sparing diuretics are used as a more effective alternative to potas-sium supplements for prevention of hypokalaemia induced by thiazide diuretics; however supplementation with potas-sium in any form is seldom necessary with the smaller doses of diuretics used to treat hypertension. Loop Diuretics: Loop diuretics, or high-ceiling diuretics, such as furosemide, are the most potent and rapidly produce an intense dose-de-pendent diuresis of relatively short duration. Oral furosemide produces diuresis within 30-60 min of administration, with the max. diuretic effect in 1-2 h. The diuretic action lasts for 4-6 h. Intravenous furosemide produces diuresis within 5 min, with the max. Diuretic effect in 20-60 min and diuresis completes within 2 h.395 NFI-2011Diuretics Loop diuretics inhibit reabsorption from the ascending loop of Henl\u00e9 in the renal tubule and are useful, particularly in situ - ations where rapid and effective diuresis is needed such as reduction of acute pulmonary oedema due to left ventricular failure. They are also used to treat oedema associated with renal and hepatic disorders and are used in high doses in the management of oliguria due to chronic renal insufficiency. Loop diuretics may be effective in patients unresponsive to thiazide diuretics. Because of their shorter duration of action, the risk of hypoka- laemia may be less with loop diuretics than with thiazide diuretics; if required, potassium-sparing diuretics may be used for prevention of hypokalaemia. Loop diuretics may cause hypovolaemia and excessive use can produce severe dehydration with the possibility of circulatory collapse. Furo- semide may cause hyperuricaemia and precipitate attacks of gout. Rapid high-dose injection or infusion of furosemide may cause tinnitus diuretics and reduce potassium excretion and increase Sodium excretion in the distal tubule. Amiloride acts about 2 h after oral administration, reaching a peak in 6-10 h and persisting for about 24 h. Spironolactone, which acts by antagonising aldosterone, has a relatively slow onset of action requiring 2-3 days to achieve max. diuretic effect, and a similar period of 2-3 days for diuresis to cease after discontinuation of treatment. Amiloride may be used alone, but its principal use is in combi- nation with a thiazide or a loop diuretic to conserve potassium during treatment of congestive heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis with ascites. Spironolactone is used in the treatment of refractory oedema due to heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis (with or without ascites), nephrotic syndrome and ascites associated with malignancy. It is frequently given with a thiazide or a loop diuretic, helping to conserve potassium in those at risk from hypokalaemia. A low dose of spironolactone is beneficial in severe heart failure in patients who are already taking an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. Spironolactone is used in the diagnosis and treat - ment of primary hyperaldosteronism; presumptive evidence for diagnosis is provided by correction of hypokalaemia and of hypertension. The most dangerous adverse effect of potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride or spironolactone, is hyperka-laemia, which can be life-threatening. These diuretics are thus best avoided or used very carefully in patients who have or may develop hyperkalaemia, such as those with renal failure, 396 NFI-2011Diuretics patients receiving other potassium-sparing diuretics and patients taking ACE inhibitors or potassium supplements. Osmotic Diuretics: Osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol, are administered in suffi-ciently large doses to raise the osmolarity of plasma and renal tubular fluid. Osmotic diuretics are used to reduce or prevent cerebral oedema, to reduce raised intraocular pressure or to treat disequilibrium syndrome. Mannitol is also used to control intraocular pressure during acute attacks of glaucoma. Reduc-tion of cerebrospinal and intraocular fluid pressure occurs within 15 min of the start of infusion and lasts for 3-8 h after the infusion has been discontinued; diuresis occurs after 1-3 h. Circulatory overload due to expansion of extracellular fluid is a serious adverse effect of mannitol; as a consequence, pulmo - nary oedema can be precipitated in patients with diminished cardiac reserve, and acute water intoxication may occur in patients with inadequate urine flow.

Drugs in Osteoporosis 403403 NFI-2011Drugs in Osteoporosis 19. Drugs in Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is defined as a reduction in the strength of bone leading to increased risk of fractures. It occurs more frequently with increasing age as bone tissue is progressively lost. If diag- nosed early, the fractures associated can often be prevented. Attempt should be made to prevent it by taking measures such as balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, weight bearing exercises, adequate exposure to sunlight, adopting a healthy lifestyle with no smoking and alcohol consumption. Pharmacotherapy is recommended only when not controlled by above measures. Bisphosphonates (BPNs) are structurally related to pyrophos - phates, compounds that are incorporated into bone matrix. They specifically impair osteoclast function and reduce osteo-clast number, in part by the induction of apoptosis. BPNs can be grouped into 3 different categories. The first category of drugs, like etidronate, have simpler side chains, are the least potent and are seldom used now. The second and third cate - gories of drugs have an amino or nitrogenous ring substitution in the side chain; are more potent and have higher efficacy, eg. pamidronate, alendronate and risedronate, zoledronate respectively. BPNs are poorly absorbed on oral administration. The most common side effect associated with bisphosphonates is stomach upset. These drugs are also known to cause esopha - geal inflammation, which can lead to erosion of the esophagus and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. Esophageal irrita-tion can be minimized by taking the drug with a full glass of water and remaining upright for 30 minutes. Other serious but rare side effect associated with bisphosphonates include osteonecrosis (death of bone cells) of the jaw. This compli - cation is more frequently seen in individuals who have taken high IV doses of zoledronate. Estrogens have been found to reduce bone turnover, prevent bone loss, and induce small increases in bone mass of the spine, hip, and total body. The effects of estrogen are seen in women with natural or surgical menopause and in late postmenopausal women with or without established oste - oporosis. Estrogens are efficacious when administered orally or transdermally. Calcium and vitamin D are needed to increase bone mass in addition to estrogen replacement therapy. A daily intake of 404 NFI-2011Drugs in Osteoporosis 1,000-1,200 mg of calcium (through diet and supplements) is recommended. A daily intake of 200-600 IU of vitamin D is also recommended. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene is a non-hormonal drug recommended for the prevention of vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis who are not at high risk of non-vertebral fractures and who do not have a past history of venous thromboembolism. It is slightly less potent than BPNs with regard to hip fracture reduction. However it reduces the risk of new vertebral frac-tures and also the risk of cardiovascular events. Calcitonin-salmon is a synthetic version of the body's natural hormone, calcitonin, which is produced by the thyroid gland. The hypocalcaemic hormone is also used in osteoporosis and paget's disease. It may be administered via nasal spray and injection. Strontium ranelate appears to block osteoclast differentia- tion while promoting their apoptosis and thus inhibiting bone resorption. At the same time, strontium ranelate appears to promote bone formation. It is therefore regarded as a \"dual action bone agent\" (DABA). This results in a rebalance of bone turnover in favour of bone formation.

Drugs for Anaesthesia During the use of Anaesthetics special precautions and close monitoring of the patient are required. These drugs may be fatal if used inappropriately and should be used by non-spe - cialized personnel only as a last resort. Irrespective of whether a general or conduction (regional or local) anaesthetic tech-nique is used; it is essential that facilities for intubation and mechanically assisted ventilation are available. A full preop-erative assessment is required including; if necessary; appro- priate fluid replacement. Long-Term Medication The risk of stopping long-term medication before surgery may be greater than the risk of continuing it. It is essential that the anaesthetist is told of all drugs that the patient is (or has been) taking; in case of oral anticoagulants; corticosteroids; hormonal contraceptives be used alone to produce anaesthesia for short surgical procedures but are more commonly used for induction only. They can produce apnoea and hypotension and thus facilities for adequate resuscitation must be available. Before intubation is attempted; a muscle relaxant must be given. Individual requirements vary consid - erably; lesser dosage is indicated in the elderly; debilitated or hypovolaemic patients. Intravenous induction using thiopental is rapid and excite - ment does not usually occur. Anaesthesia persists for about 4-7 min; large or repeated doses severely depress respiration and delay recovery. Anaesthesia with ketamine persists for up to 15 min after a single intravenous injection and is characterized by profound analgesia. It may be used as the sole agent for diagnostic and minor surgical interventions. Subanaesthetic concentrations of ketamine may be used to provide analgesia for painful procedures of short duration such as the dressing of burns; radiotherapeutic procedures; marrow sampling and minor orthopaedic procedures. Recovery from ketamine anaes-thesia is associated with a high incidence of hallucinations and other emergence reactions. Ketamine is of particular value in children; in whom hallucinations are believed to be less significant. Volatile Inhalational Agents: One of the volatile anaesthetics; ether; halothane (with or without nitrous oxide); must be used for induction when intra-venous agents are contraindicated and particularly when intuba- tion is likely to be difficult. Full muscle relaxation is achieved in deep anaesthesia with ether. Excess bronchial and salivary secretion can be avoided by premedication with atropine. Laryngeal spasm may occur during induction and intubation. Localized capillary bleeding can be troublesome and postoperative nausea and vomiting are frequent; recovery time is slow particularly after prolonged administration. If intubation is likely to be difficult; halothane is preferred. It does not augment salivary or bronchial secretions and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting is low. Severe hepatitis; which may be fatal; sometimes occurs; it is more likely in patients who are repeatedly anaesthetized with halothane within a short period of time.411 NFI-2011Drugs for Anaesthesia Inhalational Gases: Nitrous oxide is used for the maintenance of anaesthesia. It is too weak to be used alone; but it allows the dosage of other anaesthetic agents to be reduced. It has a strong analgesic action. Oxygen should be added routinely during anaesthesia with inhalational agents; even when air is used as the carrier gas; to protect against hypoxia. Oxygen is also used in the management of anaphylaxis; myocardial infarction and severe acute asthma. Halothane* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.

Adverse Effects Respiratory container.416 Anaesthesia 20.2 Local Anaesthetics Drugs used for conduction anaesthesia (also termed local or regional anaesthesia) act by causing a reversible block to conduction along nerve fibres. Local anaesthetics are used very widely in dental practice; for brief and superficial inter - ventions; for obstetric procedures and for specialized tech- niques of regional anaesthesia calling for highly developed skills. Facilities and equipment for resuscitation should be readily available at all times. Local anaesthetic injections should be given slowly in order to detect inadvertent intra-vascular injection. Hypersensitivity testing should be done in all patients before administrations of local anaesthetics. Local Infiltration Many simple surgical procedures that neither involve the body cavities nor require muscle relaxation can be performed under local infiltration anaesthesia. Lower-segment caesarean section can also be performed under local infiltration anaes- thesia. The local anaesthetic drug of choice is lidocaine 0.5% with or without epinephrine. No more than 4 mg/kg of plain lidocaine or 7 mg/kg of lidocaine with epinephrine should be administered on any one occasion. The addition of epine- phrine (adrenaline) diminishes local blood flow; slows the rate of absorption of the local anaesthetic and prolongs its effect. Care is necessary when using epinephrine for this purpose since; in excess; it may produce ischaemic necrosis. It should not be added to injections used in digits or appendages. Surface Anaesthesia Topical preparations of lidocaine are available and topical eye drop solutions of tetracaine (chapter 19.2) are used for local anaesthesia of the cornea and conjunctiva. Regional Block A regional nerve block can provide safe and effective anaes-thesia but its execution requires considerable training and practice. Nevertheless; where the necessary skills are avail - able; techniques such as axillary or ankle blocks can be invalu - able. Either lidocaine 1% or bupivacaine 0.5% is suitable. Bupi - vacaine has the advantage of a longer duration of action. Spinal Anaesthesia This is one of the most useful of all anaesthetic techniques and can be used widely for surgery of the abdomen and the lower limbs. It is a major procedure requiring considerable training and practice. Either lidocaine 5% in glucose or bupi- vacaine 0.5% in glucose can be used but the latter is often chosen because of its longer duration of action.417 NFI-2011Drugs for Anaesthesia Bupivacaine* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications anaesthesia; peripheral and sympathetic nerve block; spinal anaesthesia; postoperative pain relief.

Storage Store in a cool place.419 NFI-2011Drugs for Anaesthesia 20.3 Preoperative Medication Pre-anaesthetic medication is often advisable prior to both conduction and general anaesthetic procedures. Sedatives improve the course of subsequent anaesthesia in apprehensive patients. Diazepam and promethazine are effec - tive. Diazepam can be administered by mouth; by rectum; or by intravenous injection. Promethazine; which has antihista- minic and antiemetic properties as well as a sedative effect; is of particular value in children. A potent analgesic such as morphine should be administered preoperatively to patients in severe pain or for analgesia during and after surgery. Anticholinergic (more correctly antimuscarinic) drugs such as atropine are also used before general anaesthesia. They inhibit excessive bronchial and most effective; but oral administration is more conven-ient in children. Lower doses should be used in cardiovascular disease or hyperthyroidism.

Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease 427427 NFI-2011Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease 21. Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. Ulcerative Colitis: Acute attacks of ulcerative colitis require treatment with local corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone in the form of suppositories or retention enemas. Because of the risk of intestinal perforation, rectal administration of hydrocorti- sone must be used with extreme caution in patients with severe ulcerative disease and should not be given to such patients without conducting a thorough proctological exami - nation. More extensive disease requires oral corticosteroid treatment and severe extensive or fulminant disease needs hospital admission and intravenous corticosteroid admin-istration; other therapy may include intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, blood transfusion and possibly parenteral nutrition and antibiotics. The aminosalicylate sulfasalazine is useful in the treatment of symptomatic disease. It also has value in the mainte - nance of remission in ulcerative colitis for which corticos- teroid treatment is unsuitable because of adverse effects. In resistant or frequently relapsing cases azathioprine 2-2.5 mg/kg daily (chapter 12.1) given under close supervision may be helpful. Laxatives are required to facilitate bowel movement when proctitis is present. Antimotility drugs such as codeine and antispasmodic drugs should not be used in active ulcerative colitis because they can precipitate para-lytic ileus and megacolon. Diarrhoea resulting from reduced bile salt absorption may improve with cholestyramine. General nutritional care and appropriate supplements are essential. High-fibre or low-residue diets should be used as appropriate. Irritable bowel syndrome during remission of ulcerative colitis requires avoidance of a high-fibre diet and possibly treatment with an antispasmodic. Crohn's Disease: Treatment of Crohn's disease of the colon is similar to that of ulcerative colitis. In small bowel disease sulfasalazine may have marginal benefit. Symptoms and inflammation associated with disease exacerbation are suppressed by oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone. Metronidazole may be beneficial in the treatment of active Crohn disease particu-428 NFI-2011Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease larly with perianal involvement, possibly through its antibac- terial activity. Other antibacterials should be given if specifi - cally indicated (for example, sepsis associated with fistulas and perianal disease) and for managing bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel. General nutritional care and appropriate supplements are essential.429 NFI-2011Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Dicyclomine* Pregnancy Category-B Schedule H Indications Infantile colic, gastrointestinal tract spasm.

Drugs for Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder of peripheral nerves characterized by variable weak - ness of voluntary muscles. It is caused by a defect in the trans- mission of nerve impulses to muscles. It occurs when normal communication between the nerve and the muscle is inter - rupted at the neuromuscular junction. In this autoimmune disorder antibodies are formed against Acetylcholine (ACh.) nicotinic postsynaptic receptors at the myoneural junction. A reduction in the number of ACh receptors results in a charac-teristic pattern of progressively reduced muscle strength and recovery of muscle strength following a period of rest. The bulbar muscles are affected severely. 434 NFI-2011Drugs for Myasthenia Gravis Azathioprine* (Refer Page No. 266 and 382) Pregnancy Category-D Schedule H Indications Long term immunosuppression in Myasthenia gravis.

Drugs for Respiratory Diseases 439 23.1 Antiasthmatics and Drugs for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 439 23.2 Antitussives (Cough suppressants) 456439 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases 23. Drugs for Respiratory Diseases 23.1 Antiasthmatics and Drugs for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Asthma: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by episodes of reversible airways obstruction due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness; inflammation may lead to irreversible obstruction in few patients. A classification based on severity before the start of treatment and disease progression is of impor - tance when decisions have to be made about management. It can be divided by severity into intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe persistent. Antiasthmatics are useful in the management of the disease since therapy has a stepwise approach which must be discussed with the patient before commencing therapy. The level of therapy is increased as the severity of the asthma increases with stepping-down if control is sustained (see tables on treatment below). Inhalation: Medications for asthma can be administered in several different ways, including inhalation, oral and parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous routes). The main advantage of delivering drugs directly into the airways via inhalation is that high concentrations can be delivered more effectively and rapidly to the airways, and systemic adverse effects avoided or minimized. It is important that patients receive careful instruction in the use of pressurized (aerosol) inhalation (using a metered-dose inhaler) to obtain optimum results. Before use, the inhaler should be shaken well. After exhaling as completely as possible, the mouthpiece of the inhaler should be placed well into the mouth and the lips fir mly closed around it. The patient should inhale deeply through the mouth while actu-ating the inhaler. After holding the breath for 10 seconds or as long as is comfortable, the mouthpiece should be removed and the patient should exhale slowly. It is important to check that patients continue to use their inhalers correctly as inadequate technique may be mistaken for drug failure. Spacing devices provide a space between the 440 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases inhaler and the mouth. They may be of benefit for patients such as the elderly, small children and the asthmatic who find inhalers difficult to use or for those who have difficulty synchronizing their breathing with administration of the aerosol. A large volume spacing device is also recommended for inhalation of high doses of corticosteroids to reduce oropharyngeal deposition which can cause candidosis. The use of metered-dose inhalers with spacers is less expensive and may be as effective as use of nebulizers, although drug delivery may be affected by choice of spacing device. Breath-actuated devices including dry powder inhalers are also available. Solutions for nebulization are available for use in acute severe asthma. They are administered over a period of 5-10 min from a nebulizer, usually driven by oxygen in hospital. Oral: The oral route is used when administration by inhalation is not possible. Systemic adverse effects occur more frequently when a drug is given orally rather than by inhalation. Drugs given by mouth for the treatment of asthma include 2-agonists, corticosteroids and theophylline. Parenteral: Drugs such as corticosteroids, aminophylline etc. may be given by injection in acute severe asthma when administration by nebulization is inadequate or inappropriate. If the patient is being treated in the community, urgent transfer to hospital should be arranged. Pregnancy: Poorly controlled asthma in pregnant women can have an adverse effect on the fetus, resulting in perinatal mortality, increased prematurity and low birth-weight. For this reason using medications to obtain optimal control of asthma is justified. Administration of drugs by inhalation during preg-nancy has the advantage that plasma drug concentrations are not likely to be high enough to have an effect on the fetus. Acute exacerbations should be treated aggressively in order to avoid fetal hypoxia. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma: Severe asthma can be fatal and must be treated promptly and energetically. Acute severe asthma attacks require hospital admission where resuscitation facilities are imme - diately available. Severe asthma is characterized by persistent dyspnoea 441 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases poorly relieved by bronchodilators, exhaustion, a high pulse rate (usually more than 110/min) and a very low peak expira-tory flow. As asthma becomes more severe, wheezing may be absent. Patients should be given oxygen 40-60% (if available). Patients should also be given salbutamol or terbutaline via a nebulizer. In emergencies where a nebulizer is not available, salbutamol 100 \u00b5g by aerosol inhalation can be repeated 10-20 times preferably using a large-volume spacing device. Patients should also be given a corticosteroid ; for adults, prednisolone 30-60 mg by mouth or hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously; for children, prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg by mouth (1-4 years, max. 20 mg, 5-15 years, max. 40 mg) or hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously; if the patient experi - ences vomiting the parenteral route may be preferred for the first dose. If response is inadequate, ipratropium by nebulizer should be considered. Most patients do not benefit from the addi-tion of intravenous aminophylline or a parenteral 2-agonist; both cause more adverse effects than nebulized 2-agonists. Nevertheless, an occasional patient who has not been taking theophylline, may benefit from a slow intravenous infusion of aminophylline. The use of epinephrine (adrenaline) in asthma has generally been superseded by 2-selective adrenoceptor agonists. Treatment should never be delayed for investigations, patients should never be sedated and the possibility of pneumoth - orax should be considered. Patients who deteriorate further despite treatment may need intermittent positive pressure ventilation.442 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases Treatment of Chronic Asthma: Infants and y oung Childrens under 5 y ears Preferred treatments are in bold print Long-term Preventive Quick Relief STEP 4 Severe PersistentDaily medications Inhaled corticosteroid, beclomethasone dipropionate MDI with spacer and face mask > 1 mg daily or nebulized beclomethasone > 1 mg twice daily.

Step down Review treatment every 3 to 6 months. If control is sustained for at least 3 months, a gradual stepwise reduction in treatment may be possible.Step up If control is not achieved, consider step up. But first: review patient medication technique, compliance and environmental control. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) may be helped by an inhaled short-acting 2-adrenoceptor agonist used as required or when the airways obstruction is more severe, by an inhaled anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) bronchodilator or both if necessary. Although many patients are treated with an inhaled corticosteroid its role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not clear at present. A limited trial of high-dose inhaled corticosteroid or an oral corticosteroid is recommended for patients with moderate airflow obstruction to determine the extent of the airway reversibility and to ensure that asthma has not been overlooked. Long-term oxygen therapy prolongs survival in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.445 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases 2-Adrenoceptor Agonists (2-Adrenoceptor Stimulants): The adrenoreceptors in bronchi are mainly 2 type and their stimulation causes bronchial muscles to relax. The 2-adrenoceptor agonists include salbutamol, by inhalation (100-200 \u00b5g) the effect can last as long as 4 h thus making it suitable for both the treatment (see tables) and prevention of asthma. Salbutamol can also be taken orally in a dose of 2-4 mg up to 4 times daily but is less effective and causes more adverse effects. It can also be given by injection for severe bronchospasm. Adverse Effects Cardiovascular adverse effects (arrhythmias, palpitations and tachycardia) may occur with salbutamol, but are infrequent with inhaled preparations. Hypokalaemia may result from 2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy. Particular caution is required in severe asthma because this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthines (for example theophyl- line), corticosteroids, diuretics and hypoxia. Plasma potassium concentrations should be monitored in severe asthma. Xanthines: Xanthines include theophylline and aminophylline. They relax bronchial smooth muscle relieving bronchospasm and also stimulate respiration. Absorption of theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract is usually rapid and complete. It is metabo-lized by the liver but its half-life can vary considerably in certain diseases including hepatic impairment and cardiac failure, with some coadministered drugs (see Appendix 5) as well as by factors such as age, smoking and alcohol intake. The half-life variation can be important because theophylline has a narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic effects. At therapeutic doses some patients experience nausea and diarrhoea and when plasma concentrations exceed the recommended range of 10-20 mg/litre (55-110 micromol/litre) arrhythmias and convulsions which may be fatal can occur. Monitoring of plasma concentrations is therefore recommended. Theophylline is used to treat chronic asthma, usually in the form of modified-release preparations which produce adequate plasma concentrations for up to 12 h. It is used as an adjunct to 2-agonist or corticos- teroid therapy when additional bronchodilation is required but there is an increased risk of adverse effects with 2-agonists (see 446 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases above). When given as a single dose at night, modified-release preparations may be useful in controlling nocturnal asthma and early morning wheezing. The absorption characteristics of modified-release theophylline peparations vary considerably and therefore it is important to keep the patient on the same brand-name formulation. Theophylline is given by injection as aminophylline (a mixture of theophylline with ethylenediamine) which is 20 times more soluble in water than theophylline alone. It is administered by slow intravenous injection in severe asthma attacks. Corticosteroids: Inhaled Corticosteroids: Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, are the most effective anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of asthma. They are recommended for the long-term control of asthma in patients using a 2-adrenoceptor agonist more than once a day. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of exacerbations of asthma. Corticosteroids must be used regularly to obtain max. benefit. Symptom control is usually effective after 3 to 7 days treat - ment. Long-term high-dose regimens of inhaled corticoster - oids are useful for the treatment of severe persistent asthma because they both reduce the need for the long-term use of oral corticosteroids and have fewer systemic adverse effects. Local adverse effects from inhaled corticosteroids include oropharyngeal candidosis, dysphonia and occasional coughing from upper airway irritation. The use of spacing devices reduces oropharyngeal deposition and thus reduces the incidence of candidosis. The risk for systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids is small and is dependent upon the dose and potency of the corticosteroid as well as its bioavail - ability and the plasma half-life of its systemically absorbed fraction. Systemic effects are rare and include skin thinning and easy bruising, a small increased risk of glaucoma and cata-racts, adrenal suppression, decrease of bone metabolism and growth retardation in children. Systemic Corticosteroids Oral corticosteroids may be used as 'max. therapy' to achieve control of a patient's asthma. This may be useful either when initiating long-term therapy for a patient with uncontrolled asthma or as a short 'rescue' course at any stage for acute exacerbation. Long-term oral corticosteroid therapy may be required to 447 NFI-2011Drugs for Respiratory Diseases control severe persistent asthma, but its use is limited by the risk of significant adverse effects. In these cases high-dose inhaled corticosteroids should be continued so that oral requirements are reduced to a minimum. Oral doses should be given as a single dose in the morning to reduce the disturbance to the circadian cortisol secretion. Dosage should always be adjusted to the lowest dose which controls symptoms. Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Bronchodilators: Ipratropium can provide short-term relief in chronic asthma, but short-acting 2-agonists work more quickly. Ipratropium is also used as a bronchodilator in chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease.

Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs 24.1 Contraceptives 24.1.1 Oral Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal contraception is one of the most effective methods of reversible fertility control. Combined Oral Contraceptives: Estrogen plus progestogen combinations are the most widely used hormonal contraceptives. They produce a contracep-tive effect mainly by suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary system resulting in prevention of ovulation; in addition, changes in the endometrium make it unreceptive to implanta-tion. Endometrial proliferation is usually followed by thinning or regression of the endometrium resulting in reduced menstrual flow. Ovulation usually resumes within three menstrual cycles after oral contraception has been discontinued; anovulation and amenorrhoea persisting for six months or longer requires investigation and appropriate treatment if necessary. Potential non-contraceptive benefits of combined oral contra- ceptives include improved regularity of the menstrual cycle, decreased blood loss, less iron-deficiency anaemia and signifi - cant decrease in dysmenorrhoea. Long-term use is associated with reduced risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer and of some pelvic infections. An association between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects has been observed. The use of oral contraceptive combinations containing the progestogens, desogestrel or gestodene are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with oral contraceptives containing the progestogens, levonorg-estrel norethisterone. Risk Factors for Disease: Risk for family history of venous thromboembolism in first-degree relative aged under 45 years, obesity, long-term immobilization and varicose veins. Risk factors for arterial disease include family history of arterial 460 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs disease in first-degree relative aged under 45 years, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, age over 35 years (avoid if over 50 years), obesity and migraine. If any one of the factors is present, combined oral contra- ceptives should be used with caution; if 2 or more factors for either venous thromboembolism or arterial disease are present, combined oral contraceptives should be avoided. Combined oral contraceptives are contraindicated in migraine with aura, in severe migraine without aura regularly lasting over 72 h despite treatment and in migraine treated with ergot derivatives. Surgery: Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should preferably be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery and all surgery to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged immobilization of a lower limb. They should normally be restarted at the first menses occuring at least 2 weeks after full mobilization. When discontinuation is not possible throm-boprophylaxis (with heparin and graduated compression hosiery) is advised. Reasons to Stop Combined Oral Contraceptives Immediately: Combined estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should be stopped immediately if any of the following symptoms occur and resumed only after consultation with a health care provider: Sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left arm); Sudden breathlessness (or cough with blood-stained sputum); Severe pain in calf of one leg; Severe stomach pain; Serious neurological effects including unusual, severe, prolonged headache especially if first time or getting progressively worse or sudden partial or complete loss of vision or sudden disturbance of hearing or other percep-tual disorders or dysphagia or bad fainting attack or collapse or first unexplained epileptic seizure or weakness, motor disturbances, very marked numbness suddenly affecting one side or one part of body;Hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement; Blood pressure above 160 mmHg systolic and 100 mmHg diastolic;Detection of 2 or more risk factors for venous thromboem- bolism or arterial disease, see and Related Drugs Progestogen-Only Contraceptives: Progestogen-only contraceptives, such as oral levonorgestrel may offer a suitable alternative when estrogens are contrain - dicated but the oral progestogen-only preparations do not prevent ovulation in all cycles and have a higher failure rate than combined estrogen-containing preparations. Progestogen-only contraceptives carry less risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular disease than combined oral contraceptives and are preferable for women at increased risk of such complica- tions, for example smokers over 35 years. They can be used as an alternative to estrogen-containing combined preparations prior to major surgery. Oral progestogen-only contraceptives may be started 3 weeks after birth; lactation women should preferably start at least 6 weeks after birth. Menstrual irregu-larities (oligomenorrhoea, menorrhagia, amenorrhoea) are common. Injectable preparations norethisterone enantate may be given intramus- cularly. They have prolonged action and should only be given with full counselling and manufacturer's information leaflet. Emergency Contraception: Levonorgestrel is used for emergency contraception. Levonorg- estrel 1.5 mg should be taken as a single dose within 72 h of unprotected intercourse; alternatively, levonorgestrel 750 \u00b5g can be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse followed 12 h later by another 750 \u00b5g. Under these circumstances levonorgestrel prevents about 86% of pregnancies that would have occurred if no treatment had been given. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, breast discom- fort, and menstrual irregularities. If vomiting occurs within 2-3 h of taking the tablets, replacement tablets can be given with an antiemetic. It should be explained to the woman that her next period may be early or late; that she needs to use a barrier contracep-tive method until her next period, and that she should return promptly if she has any lower abdominal pain or if the subse-quent menstrual bleed is abnormally light, heavy, brief or absent. There is no evidence of harmful effects to the fetus if pregnancy should occur.462 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs Centchroman (Non-steroidal oral contraceptive) Pregnancy Category-X Schedule H Indications Contraception.

It is important to bear in mind that the critical time for loss of protection is when a pill is omitted at the beginning or end of a cycle (which lengthens the pill-free interval). Note: Ethinylestradiol with levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol with norethisterone are representative combined oral contraceptive preparations. Various combinations can serve as alternatives. Contraindications Use within 3 weeks of birth; lactation until weaning or for first 6 months after birth (Appendix 7b); personal history of 2 or more risk factors for venous or arterial thrombosis (see notes above); heart disease associated with pulmonary hypertension or risk of embolism; migraine (see below); history of sub-acute bacterial endocarditis; ischaemic liver disease (Appendix 7a), hepatic secretion such as Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes, function systemic (if neuropathy or if more than 20 years duration); after evacuation of hydatidiform mole (until return to normal of urine and plasma gonadotrophin values).

Smaller devices have been introduced to minimize adverse effects and the replacement time for these devices is normally between 3 and 8 years. Fertility declines with age and therefore a copper intrauterine device fitted in a woman over 40 years of age, may remain in the uterus until menopause. The intrauterine device is appropriate for women who expect to use it for continuous long-term contraception. It is suit - able for older parous women; intrauterine devices should be used with caution in young nulliparous women because of the increased risk of expulsion. Young women at risk of sexually transmitted infections are also at risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. The timing and technique of fitting an intrauterine device play a critical role in its subsequent performance and call for proper training and experience. Patients should receive full counsel-ling backed by the manufacturer's approved leaflet. For routine contraception the device can be inserted between 4 and 12 days after the start of menstruation; for emergency contraception the device can be inserted at any time in the menstrual cycle within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. There is an increased risk of infection for 20 days after insertion and this may be related to existing lower genital tract infection. Pre-screening (at least for chlamydia and gonorrhoea) should if possible be performed. If sustained pelvic or lower abdominal pain occur during the following 20 days after insertion of the device, the woman should be treated as having acute pelvic inflamma- tory disease. An intrauterine device should not be removed in mid-cycle unless an additional contraceptive was used for the previous 7 days. If removal is essential (for example to treat severe pelvic infection) post-coital contraception should be considered. If the woman becomes pregnant, the device should be removed in the first trimester and the possibility of ectopic pregnancy considered; if the threads of the intrauterine device are already missing on presentation, the pregnancy is at risk of second trimester abortion, haemorrhage, pre-term delivery and infection.468 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs Emergency Contraception: Insertion of a copper intrauterine contraceptive device is a highly effective method of emergency contraception and is more effective than hormonal methods of emergency contra- ception. Sexually transmitted diseases should be tested for and insertion of the device should usually be covered by anti-bacterial prophylaxis. Hormone Releasing IUD* Indications For contraception.

Adverse Effects Uterine or cervical perforation, displacement, expulsion; pelvic infection exacerbated; heavy menstrual bleeding; dysmenorrhoea; pain and bleeding and occasionally epileptic seizure or vasovagal attack on insertion. 24.1.4 Estrogens Estrogens are necessary for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics; they also stimulate myome-trial hypertrophy with endometrial hyperplasia. They affect bone by increasing calcium deposition. They are secreted at varying rates during the menstrual cycle throughout the period of activity of the ovaries. During pregnancy, the placenta becomes the main source of estrogens. At the meno-pause, ovarian secretion declines at varying rates. Estrogen therapy is given cyclically or continuously princi - pally for contraception and for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms. If long-term therapy is required for menopausal hormone therapy a progestogen should be added to prevent cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (or of endometrial foci in women who have had a hysterectomy) and possible trans-formation to cancer. The palliative care of advanced inoperable, metastatic carci- noma of the breast in both men and postmenopausal women is another indication for estrogen therapy.470 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs Hormone Therapy (HT): Estrogens are used for replacement therapy in perimenopausal and menopausal women for the treatment of vasomotor insta-bility, vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the meno- pause and for the prevention of osteoporosis. HT should not be prescribed with the aim of reducing the incidence of heart disease. HT may be used for menopausal women whose lives are unduly inconvenienced by vaginal atrophy or vasomotor instability. Vaginal atrophy may respond to a short course of a vaginal estrogen preparation. Systemic treatment is needed for vasomotor and other symptoms of estrogen deficiency and can be given for up to 2-3 years; Medroxyprogesterone acetate (see also chapter 21.4.2) may be given in a dose of 10 mg daily for the last 12-14 days of each estrogen HT cycle. Alternatively, norethisterone 1 mg daily may be given on the last 12-14 days of each 28-day estrogen cycle. HT should be considered for women with early natural or surgical menopause (before age 45 years) because they have a high risk of osteoporosis. Small doses of estrogen given systemically in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal period also diminish osteoporosis, but the slight increased risk of breast cancer needs to be taken into account. For early menopause, HT can be given until the approximate age of natural menopause (until age 50 years). For longer-term use of HT in postmenopausal women (with a uterus or without a uterus), women must be made aware of the increased incidence of breast cancer and other adverse effects. Each decision to start HT should be made on an indi - vidual basis, and treatment should be regularly reappraised (at least once a year). Factors such as corticosteroid therapy, family history of osteoporosis, thinness, lack of exercise, alco- holism or smoking, early menopause, fractures to the hip or forearm before age 65 years should be taken into account when considering the use of HT; women of African origin appear to be less susceptible to osteoporosis than those who are white or of Asian origin. There is an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis and of pulmonary embolism in women taking HT. In women who have predisposing factors such as a personal or family history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, severe varicose veins, obesity, surgery, trauma or prolonged bed-rest, the overall risk may outweigh the benefit. Using HT increases the risk of breast cancer slightly. The increased risk is related to the duration of HT use and this excess risk disappears within about 5 years of stopping. The risk of breast cancer is greater with combined HT (an estrogen 471 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs and a progestogen) than with estrogen-only HT (but estrogen alone may not be suitable for women with intact uterus). Epidemiological studies indicate that in women aged between 50 and 65 years not using HT, about 32 cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in every 1000 women. In those using HT, the risk of breast cancer is increased as follows: Women using combined HT with an estrogen and a progestogen for 5 years, about 6 additional cases in 1000; in those using combined HT for 10 years, about 19 additional cases in 1000 Women using estrogen-only HT for 5 years, about 2 additional cases in 1000; in those using estrogen-only HT for 10 years, about 5 additional cases in 1000. HT does not provide contraception. If a potentially fertile woman needs to use HT, non-hormonal contraceptive meas - ures are necessary. Precautions for patients on HT undergoing surgery and reasons to stop HT are the same as those for hormonal contraceptives.

The adrenal cortex normally secretes hydrocortisone which has glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. It also secretes the aldosterone. betamethasone, dexamethasone and properties but it has potent mineralocor - ticoid properties and is used for its mineralocorticoid effects. Pharmacology of the corticosteroids is complex and their actions are wide-ranging. In physiological (low) doses, they replace defi-cient endogenous hormones. In pharmacological (high) doses, glucocorticoids decrease inflammation and suppress the immune response. In therapeutic doses glucocorticoids suppress release of corti- cotrophin (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, secretion of endog-enous corticosteroids. If suppressive doses are given for prolonged periods, the adrenal cortex may undergo atrophy and this leads to a deficiency on sudden withdrawal or dosage reduction or situations such as stress or trauma where corti-costeroid requirements are increased. After high dosage or prolonged therapy, withdrawal should be gradual, the rate depending on various factors including patient response, corticosteroid dose, duration of treatment and disease state. The suppressive action of a corticosteroid on cortisol secre - tion is least when given in the morning. Corticosteroids should normally be given in a single morning dose to attempt to mini - mize pituitary-adrenal suppression. Because the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids are of longer duration than the metabolic effects, intermittent therapy may allow the body's normal metabolic rhythm and the therapeutic effects to be maintained. Alternate day dosing is, however, suitable only in certain disease states and with corticosteroids with small mineralocorticoid effects and a relatively short duration of action. Hydrocortisone is used in adrenal replacement therapy and on a short-term basis by intravenous injection for the emer - gency management of some conditions. Its mineralocorticoid activity is too high for it to be used on a long-term basis for disease suppression. The mineralocorticoid activity of fludro-cortisone is also high and its anti-inflammatory activity is of no clinical relevance. It is used together with glucocorticoids in adrenal insufficiency. Prednisolone has predominantly gluco-475 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs corticoid activity and is the corticosteroid most commonly administered for long-term disease suppression. It is the active metabolite of prednisone, conversion of which is vari- able and prednisone should not be used interchangeably with prednisolone. Dexamethasone has very high glucocorticoid activity in conjunction with insignificant mineralocorticoid activity making it particularly suitable for high-dose therapy in conditions where water retention would be a disadvantage such as cerebral oedema. It also has a long duration of action and this, together with its lack of mineralocorticoid activity makes it particularly suitable for conditions requiring suppres-sion of corticotrophin secretion such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Adverse Effects of Corticosteroids: Overdosage or prolonged use may exaggerate some of the normal physiological actions of corticosteroids leading to mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid adverse effects. Mineralocorticoid adverse effects include hypertension, sodium and water retention and potassium loss. These effects are most marked with fludrocortisone but are significant with hydrocortisone, occur slightly with prednisolone and are negligible with dexamethasone. Glucocorticoid adverse effects include diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis which is of particular importance in the elderly since it may result in osteoporotic fractures of the hip or vertebrae. High doses may also be associated with avascular necrosis of the femoral neck. Muscle wasting may also occur and there is a weak link with peptic ulceration. Mental distur - bances can occur, including serious paranoid state or depres-sion with risk of suicide, particularly in patients with a history of mental disorders; euphoria is also common. High doses may cause Cushing syndrome (typical moon face, striae and acne), which is usually reversible on withdrawal of treatment, but this should always be tapered gradually to avoid symp-toms of acute adrenal insufficiency (see also Withdrawal). In children, corticosteroids may result in suppression of growth and corticosteroids administered during pregnancy can affect adrenal development in the fetus. Any adrenal suppression in the neonate following prenatal exposure usually resolves spontaneously after birth and is rarely, clinically important. Healing of wounds may be impaired and infections and thin - ning of the skin may occur; spread of infections may result from modification of tissue reactions. Adrenal Suppression Adrenal suppression occurs during prolonged therapy with corticosteroids, with development of adrenal atrophy which 476 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs may persist for years after stopping. Abrupt withdrawal after a prolonged period may lead to acute adrenal insufficiency, hypotension or death (see Withdrawal of Systemic Corti- costeroids, below). Withdrawal may also be associated with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, painful itchy skin nodules and weight loss. Corticosteroid Cover During Stress: To compensate for a diminished adrenocortical response caused by prolonged corticosteroid treatment, any significant intercurrent illness, trauma, or surgery requires a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose, or if already stopped, a tempo- rary re-introduction of corticosteroid treatment. Anaesthetists must therefore know whether a patient is taking or has been taking a corticosteroid, to avoid a precipitous fall in blood pres-sure during anaesthesia or in the immediate postoperative period. A suitable regimen for corticosteroid replacement, in patients who have taken more than 10 mg prednisolone daily (or equivalent) within 3 months of surgery, is: Minor surgery under general anaesthesia -usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery or hydrocortisone 25-50 mg intravenously at induction; the usual oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced after surgery. Moderate or major surgery -usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery and hydrocortisone 25-50 mg intravenously at induction, followed by hydrocortisone 25-50 mg 3 times a day by intrave - nous injection for 24 h after moderate surgery or for 48-72 h after major surgery; the usual preoperative oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced on stopping hydrocortisone injections. Infections: Prolonged courses of corticosteroids increase susceptibility to infections and increase their severity; clinical presentation of infections may also be atypical. Serious infections, for example septicaemia and tuberculosis, may reach an advanced stage before being recognised, and amoebiasis or strongyloidiasis may be activated or exacerbated (exclude before initiating a corticosteroid in those at risk or with suggestive symptoms). Fungal or viral ocular infections may also be exacerbated. Chickenpox Unless they have had chickenpox, patients receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids for purposes other than replace-ment should be regarded as being at risk of severe chickenpox on exposure. Manifestations of fulminant illness include pneu - monia, hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation; 477 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs rash is not necessarily a prominent feature. Passive immunization with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is needed for exposed non-immune patients receiving systemic corticosteroids or for those who have used them within the previous 3 months; varicella-zoster immunoglobulin should preferably be given within 3 days of exposure and no later than 10 days. Confirmed chickenpox warrants specialist care and urgent treatment. Corticosteroids should not be stopped and dosage may need to be increased. Topical, inhaled or rectal corticosteroids are less likely to be associated with an increased risk of severe chickenpox. Measles Patients taking corticosteroids should be advised to take particular care to avoid exposure to measles and to seek immediate medical advice if exposure occurs. Prophylaxis with intramuscular normal immunoglobulin may be needed. Dosage and Administration: Adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids, including suppres- sion of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, are dose- and duration-dependent; thus patients should be given treat - ment for the shortest period at the lowest dose that is clinically necessary. Patient response is variable and doses should there - fore be individualized. In life-threatening diseases, high doses may be needed because the complications of therapy are likely to be less serious than the disease. In long-term therapy in rela- tively benign chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, adverse effects often outweigh the advantages. In order to minimize the adverse effects, the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possible and if possible, single morning doses or alternate day therapy should be used. Glucocorticoids can improve the prognosis of serious conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa; in such disorders the effects of the disease process may be suppressed and symptoms relieved but the underlying condition is not cured. Glucocorticoids are used both topically and systemically. In emergency situations, hydrocortisone may be given intrave - nously; in the treatment of asthma, inhalation therapy with beclomethasone may be used (chapter 20.1). Whenever possible, local treatment with creams, intra-articular injec-tions, inhalations, eye-drops or enemas should be used in preference to systemic therapy. Withdrawal of Systemic Corticosteroids: The rate of withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids is dependent upon several factors including size of dose, dura-478 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs tion of treatment, individual patient's response and the likeli- hood of relapse of the underlying disease. If there is uncer - tainty about suppression of the HPA axis, withdrawal should be gradual to enable the adrenal gland to recover. Patients should be advised not to stop taking glucocorticoids abruptly unless permitted by their doctor. Gradual withdrawal should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have: recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than 3 weeks)taken a short course within 1 year of stopping long- term therapyother possible causes of adrenal suppression received more than 40 mg daily prednisolone (or equivalent)been given repeat doses in the evening received more than 3 weeks' treatment Abrupt withdrawal may be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for 3 weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above. During corticosteroid withdrawal the dose may be reduced rapidly down to the physiological dosage (equivalent to 7.5 mg prednisolone daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assess-ment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur.

Precautions Refer Corticosteroids.482 Contraceptives and Related Drugs 24.2.2 Androgens Androgens are the testes and weaker androgens by the adrenal cortex and ovaries. In the male, they are respon-sible for the development and maintenance of the sex organs and the secondary sexual characteristics, normal reproduc-tive function, and sexual performance ability in addition to stimulating the growth and development of the skeleton and skeletal muscle during puberty. At high doses in the normal male androgens inhibit pituitary gonadotrophin secretion and depress spermatogenesis. Testosterone is used as replacement therapy in those who are hypogonadal due to either pitui- tary (secondary hypogonadism) or testicular disease (primary hypogonadism). Androgens are useless as a treatment of impo-tence and impaired spermatogenesis unless there is associated hypogonadism; they should not be given until the hypogo-nadism has been properly investigated and treatment should always be under expert supervision. When given to patients with hypopituitarism they can lead to normal sexual develop-ment and potency but not fertility. If fertility is desired, the usual treatment is with gonadotrophins or pulsatile gonado-trophin-releasing hormone which will stimulate spermatogen-esis as well as androgen production. Androgens cannot induce fertility in men with primary hypogonadism. Caution should be used in treating boys with delayed puberty with excessive doses of testosterone since the fusion of epiphyses is hastened and may result in short stature. Androgens, including testosterone have also been used in postmenopausal women for the pallia-tive treatment of androgen-responsive, advanced, metastatic breast cancer; care is required to prevent masculinizing effects.

There are 2 principal types of diabetes. Type-1 diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is due to a deficiency of insulin caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic -cells. Patients require administration of insulin. Type-2 diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is due to reduced secretion of insulin or to peripheral resistance to the action of insulin. Patients may be controlled by diet alone, but often require administration of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin. The energy and carbohydrate intake must be adequate but obesity should be avoided. In type 2 diabetes, obesity is one of the factors associated with insulin resistance. Diets high in complex carbohydrate and fibre and low in fat are beneficial. Emphasis should be placed on exercise and increased activity. The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control of plasma glucose concentration and prevent or minimize compli-cations including microvascular complications (retinopathy, albuminuria, neuropathy). Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease; other risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, obesity and hyperlipidaemia should also be addressed. Insulin Appropriate insulin regimens should be worked out for each patient. Insulin requirements may be affected by variations in lifestyle (diet and exercise)-drugs such as corticosteroids, infections, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, puberty and pregnancy (second and third trimesters) may increase insulin requirements; renal or hepatic impairment and some endocrine disorders (for example Addison's disease, hypopituitarism) or coelic disease may reduce requirements. In pregnancy insulin requirements should be monitored frequently. If possible patients should monitor their own blood-glucose concentration using blood glucose strips. Since blood-glucose concentration varies throughout the day, patients should aim to maintain blood-glucose concentration between 4 and 9 mmol/litre (4-7 mmol/L before meals, <9 mmol/L) for most of the day while accepting that on occasions it will be higher; strenuous efforts should be made to prevent blood-glucose concentrations falling below 4 mmol/litre because of the risk of hypoglycaemia. Patients should be advised to look for troughs and peaks of blood glucose and to adjust their insulin dosage only once or twice a week. Insulin doses are 486 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs determined on an individual basis, by gradually increasing the dose to optimise blood-glucose concentration while avoiding hypoglycaemia. In the absence of blood-glucose monitoring strips, urine-glu- cose monitoring strips can be used; in fact this is the method of personal choice for many patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is less reliable than blood glucose but is easier and costs much less. All patients should monitor either blood- or urine-glucose concentration daily. Hypoglycaemia is a potential complication in all patients treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents. The consequences of hypoglycaemia include confusion, seizures, coma and cerebral infarction. Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia is common among insulin- treated patients and can be a serious hazard especially for drivers and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control lowers the blood glucose concentration needed to trigger hypoglycaemic symptoms; increase in the frequency of hypogly - caemic episodes reduces the warning symptoms experienced by patients. Beta-blockers can also blunt hypoglycaemic aware - ness (and delay recovery). Some patients report loss of hypogly - caemic warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemic awareness. If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible for loss of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin. To restore warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must be reduced to a minimum; this involves appropriate adjustment of insulin dose and frequency, and suitable timing and quantity of meals and snacks. Drivers need to be particularly careful to avoid hypoglycaemia. They should check their blood-glucose concentration before driving and, on long journeys, at intervals of approximately two hour; they should ensure that a supply of sugar is always readily available. If hypoglycaemia occurs, the driver should stop the vehicle in a safe place, ingest a suitable sugar supply and wait until recovery is complete (may be 15 min or longer). Driving is particularly hazardous when hypoglycaemic awareness is impaired. For sporadic physical activity, extra carbohydrate may need to be taken to avert hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose should be monitored before, during and after exercise. Hypoglycaemia can develop in patients taking oral antidiabetics, notably the sulfo-nylureas, but this is uncommon and usually indicates excessive dosage. Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may persist for several hour and must be treated in hospital. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially lethal condition caused by 487 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs an absolute or relative lack of insulin; it commonly occurs when adjustments to insulin dosage fail to compensate for increases in insulin requirements, for example during severe infection or major intercurrent illness. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs mostly in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. It also occurs in Type 2 diabetics who have a temporary need for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperketo-naemia and acidaemia with dehydration and electrolyte distur - bances. It is essential that soluble insulin (and intravenous fluids) is readily available for its treatment. Infections are more likely to develop in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. These should be treated promptly and effectively to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis. Surgery: Particular attention should be paid to insulin require - ments when a patient with diabetes undergoes surgery that is likely to need an intravenous infusion of insulin for longer than 12 h. Soluble insulin should be given in intravenous infu-sion of glucose and potassium chloride (provided the patient is not hyperkalaemic), and adjusted to provide a blood-glucose concentration of between 7 and 12 mmol/litre. The duration of action of intravenous insulin is only a few min therefore the infusion must not be stopped unless the patient becomes frankly hypoglycaemic. For non-insulin dependent diabetics, insulin treatment is almost always required during surgery (oral hypoglycaemic drugs having been omitted). Insulin must be given by injection because it is inactivated by gastrointestinal enzymes. Generally, insulin is given by subcu-taneous injection into the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. There may be increased absorption from a limb, if the limb is used in strenuous exercise following the injection. It is essential to use only syringes calibrated for the particular concentration of insulin administered. There are three main types of insulin preparations, classified according to duration of action after subcutaneous injection: those of short duration which have a relatively rapid onset of action, for example soluble or neutral insulin; those with an intermediate action, for example isophane insulin and insulin zinc suspension;those with a relatively slow onset and long duration of action, for example crystalline insulin zinc suspension. Soluble insulin, when injected subcutaneously, has a rapid onset of action (after 30-60 min), a peak action between 2 and 4 h, and a duration of action up to 8 h. Soluble insulin by the intravenous route is reserved for urgent treatment and fine control in serious illness and perioperative state. When injected 488 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs intravenously, soluble insulin has a very short half-life of only about 5 min. When injected subcutaneously, intermediate-acting insulins have an onset of action of approximately 1-2 h, a maximal effect at 4-12 h and a duration of action of 16-24 h. They can be given twice daily together with short-acting insulin or once daily, particularly in elderly patients. They can be mixed with soluble insulin in the syringe, essentially retaining properties of each component. The duration of action of different insulin preparations varies considerably from one patient to another and this needs to be assessed for every individual. The type of insulin used and its dose and frequency of administration depend on the needs of each patient. For patients with acute onset diabetes mellitus, treatment should be started with soluble insulin given 3 times daily with medium-acting insulin at bedtime. For those less seri-ously ill, treatment is usually started with a mixture of pre-mixed short- and medium-acting insulins (for example 30% soluble insulin with 70% isophane insulin) given twice daily. The propor - tions of soluble insulin can be increased in patients with exces-sive post-prandial hyperglycaemia. Oral Antidiabetic Drugs Oral used for non-insu- lin-dependent diabetes mellitus in patients who do not respond to dietary adjustment and an increase in physical exercise. They are used to supplement the effect of diet and exercise. There are various types of oral antidiabetic agents. The most commonly used are the sulfonylureas and the biguanide, metformin. Sulfonylureas act mainly by augmenting insulin secretion and are therefore only effective if there is some residual pancreatic beta-cell activity. They may occasionally lead to hypoglycaemia 4 h or more after food. This may be dose-related and usually indicates excessive dose and it occurs more frequently with long-acting sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide and occurs particularly in the elderly. The sulfonylureas have the disad-vantage that they may encourage weight gain. They should not be used during lactation and caution is required in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of the risk of hypoglycaemia. Insulin therapy is generally required during intercurrent illness such as myocardial infarction, coma, infec- tion, and trauma, during surgery and also during pregnancy. Metformin exerts its effect by decreasing gluconeogenesis and by increasing peripheral utilization of glucose. Metformin can only act in the presence of endogenous insulin therefore is effective only in diabetics with some residual functioning pancreatic islet cells. It is used as a first-line treatment in over -489 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs weight non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and in others when strict dieting and sulfonylureas have failed to control the disease. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common on initial treatment and may persist, particularly when very high doses (such as 3g daily) are given. In order to reduce gastrointestinal effects, treatment should be initiated with a low dose which may be gradually increased. Metformin may provoke lactic acidosis which is most likely to occur in patients with renal impairment; it should not be used in patients with even mild renal impairment. One major advantage of metformin is that it does not usually cause hypoglycaemia. It may be used together with insulin (but weight gain and hypoglycaemia can be problem) or sulfo-nylureas (but possibility of increased adverse effects with such combinations). During medical and surgical emergencies insulin treatment is almost always required; insulin should be substi- tuted for metformin before elective surgery and in pregnancy.

It induces gonadotrophin release by occupying estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby interfering with feedback mecha- nisms. Patients should be carefully counselled and should be fully aware of the potential adverse effects, including a risk of multiple pregnancy (rarely, more than twins), of this treat - ment. Most patients who are going to respond will do so to the first course; 3 courses should be adequate; long-term cyclical therapy (more than 6 cycles) is not recommended as it may increase risk of ovarian cancer. Clomifene* Pregnancy Category-X Schedule H Indications Anovulatory infertility. Availability TABLETS 25, 50 and 100 mg.

Adverse Effects Visual disturbances; Contraceptives and Related Drugs 24.4.2 Progestogens Progesterone is a hormone secreted by the corpus luteum whose actions include induction of secretory changes in the endometrium, relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and production of changes in the vaginal epithelium. Proges-terone is relatively inactive following oral administration and produces local reactions at site of injection. This has led to the development of synthetic progestogens including levonorg-estrel, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone. Where endometriosis requires drug treatment, it may respond to synthetic progestogens on a continuous basis. They may also be used for the treatment of severe dysmenorrhoea. In post - menopausal women receiving long-term estrogen therapy for hormone replacement, a progestogen needs to be added for women with an intact uterus to prevent hyperplasia of the endometrium. Progestogens are also used in combined oral contraceptives and progestogen-only contraceptives.

These include oxytocic drugs used to stimulate uterine contractions both in induction of labour and to control postpartum haem- orrhage and 2-adrenoceptor agonists used to relax the and prevent premature labour. Postpartum Haemorrhage: Ergometrine and oxytocin differ in their actions on the uterus. In moderate doses oxytocin produces slow generalized contrac-tions with full relaxation in between; ergometrine produces faster contractions superimposed on a tonic contraction. High doses of both substances produce sustained tonic contractions. Oxytocin is now recommended for routine use in postpartum and post-abortion haemorrhage since it is more stable than ergometrine. However, ergometrine may be used if oxytocin is not available or in emergency situations. Premature Labour: Salbutamol is a 2 -adrenoceptor agonist which relaxes the uterus and can be used to prevent premature labour in uncomplicated cases between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. Its main purpose is to permit a delay in delivery of at least 48 h. The greatest benefit is obtained by using this delay to administer corticosteroid therapy or to implement other measures known to improve perinatal health. Prolonged therapy should be avoided since the risk to the mother increases after 48 h and the response of the myometrium is reduced. 24.5.1 Oxytocics Ergometrine Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Prevention and treatment of postpartum and post-abortion haemorrhage in emergency situations and where oxytocin not available.

The principal effect is to increase the metabolic rate. They also exert a cardiostimulatory effect which may be the result of a direct action on the heart. Thyroid hormones are used in hypothyroidism (myxoedema) and also in diffuse non-toxic goitre, Hashimoto thyroiditis (lymphadenoid goitre) and thyroid carcinoma. Neonatal hypothyroidism requires prompt treatment for normal development. Levothyroxine Sodium (thyroxine Sodium) is the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy. It is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but the full effects are not seen for up to 1 to 3 weeks after beginning therapy; there is a slow response to dose change and effects may persist for several weeks after withdrawal. Dosage of levothy - roxine in infants and children for congenital hypothyroidism and juvenile myxoedema should be titrated according to clinical response, growth assessment and measurement of plasma thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Antithyroid Drugs: Antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and carbimazole are used in the management of thyrotoxicosis. They are also used to prepare the patient for thyroidectomy. They are usually well- tolerated, with mild leukopenia or rashes developing in a few percent of cases, usually during the first 6-8 weeks of therapy. During this time the blood count should be checked every 2 weeks or if a sore throat or other signs of infection develop. The drugs are generally given in a high dose in the first instance until the patient becomes euthyroid, the dose may then be gradually reduced to a maintenance dose which is continued for 12-18 months, followed by monitoring to identify relapse. There is a lag time of some 2 weeks between the achievement of biochemical euthyroidism and clinical euthyroidism. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) (usually propranolol) may be used as a short-term adjunct to antithyroid drugs to control symptoms but their use in heart failure associated with thyrotoxicosis is controversial. Treatment can be given, if neces-sary, in pregnancy but antithyroid drugs cross the placenta and in high doses may cause fetal goitre and hypothyroidism. The lowest dose that will control the hyperthyroid state should be used (requirements in Graves disease tend to fall during preg-nancy). Propylthiouracil appears in breast milk but does not 505 NFI-2011Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs preclude lactation as long as neonatal development is closely monitored and the lowest effective dose is used. If surgery (partial thyroidectomy) is contemplated, it may be necessary to give iodine for 10 to 14 days in addition to antithyroid drugs to assist control and reduce vascularity of the thyroid. Iodine should not be used for long-term treat - ment since its antithyroid action tends to diminish. In patients in whom drug therapy fails to achieve long-term remissions definitive treatment with surgery or (increasingly) radioactive iodine is preferable.

Immunologicals Active Immunity: Active immunity may be induced by the administration of micro-organisms or their products which act as antigens to induce antibodies to confer a protective immune response in the host. Vaccination may consist of (a) a live attenuated form of a virus or bacteria, (b) inactivated preparations of the virus or bacteria, or (c) extracts of or detoxified exotoxins. Live attenuated vaccines usually confer immunity with a single dose which is of long duration. Inactivated vaccines may require a series of injections in the first instance to produce an adequate antibody response and in most cases, require reinforcing (booster) doses. The duration of immunity varies from months to many years. Extracts of or detoxified exotoxins require a primary series of injections followed by reinforcing doses. Passive Immunity: Passive immunity is conferred by injecting preparations made from the plasma of immune individuals with adequate levels of antibody to the disease for which protection is sought. Treat - ment has to be given soon after exposure to be effective. This immunity lasts only a few weeks but passive immunization can be repeated where necessary. Sera and Immunoglobulins Antibodies of human origin are usually termed immunoglob - ulins. Material prepared from animals is called antiserum. Because of serum sickness and other allergic-type reactions that may follow injections of antisera, this therapy has been replaced wherever possible by the use of immunoglobulins. All immunoglobulins and antisera should comply with WHO requirements for blood and plasma products. Contraindications and Precautions Anaphylaxis, although rare, can occur and epinephrine (adrenaline) must always be immediately available during immunization. Immunoglobulins may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines which should normally be given either at least 3 weeks before or at least 3 months after the administra-tion of the immunoglobulin.510 NFI-2011Immunologicals Adverse Reactions: Intramuscular injection; Local reactions including pain and tenderness may occur at the injection site. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur including, rarely, anaphylaxis. Intravenous injection; Systemic reactions including fever, chills, facial flushing, headache and nausea may occur, partic-ularly following high rates of infusion. Hypersensitivity reac - (Human): Anti-D immunoglobulin is prepared from plasma with a high titre of anti-D antibody. It is available to prevent a rhesus-negative mother from forming antibodies to fetal rhesus- positive cells which may pass into the maternal circulation. The aim is to protect any subsequent child from the hazard of haemolytic disease of the newborn. It should be administered following any potentially sensitizing episode (for example abortion, miscarriage, still-birth) immediately or within 72 h of the episode but even if a longer period has elapsed it may still give protection and should be used. The dose of anti-D immunoglobulin given depends on the level of exposure to rhesus-positive blood. The injection of anti-D immunoglobulin is not effective once the mother has formed anti-D antibodies. It is also given following Rh0 (D) incompatible blood. Antitetanus Immunoglobulin (Human): Antitetanus immunoglobulin of human origin is a preparation containing immunoglobulins derived from the plasma of adults immunized with tetanus toxoid. It is used for the management of tetanus-prone wounds in addition to wound toilet and if appropriate antibacterial prophylaxis and adsorbed tetanus vaccine. Diphtheria Antitoxin: Diphtheria antitoxin is prepared from the plasma or serum of healthy horses immunized against diphtheria toxin or diph - theria toxoid. It is used for passive immunization in suspected cases of diphtheria without waiting for bacterial confirmation of the infection. A test dose should be given initially to exclude hypersensitivity. Diphtheria antitoxin is not used for prophy - laxis of diphtheria because of the risk of hypersensitivity. Rabies Immunoglobulin (Human): Rabies immunoglobulin is a preparation containing immu- noglobulins derived from the plasma of adults immunized with rabies vaccine. It is used as part of the management of potential rabies following exposure of an unimmunized indi -511 NFI-2011Immunologicals vidual to an animal in or from a high-risk country. It should be administered as soon as possible after exposure without waiting for confirmation that the animal is rapid. The site of the bite should be washed with soapy water and the rabies immunoglobulin should be infiltrated round the site of the bite and also given intramuscularly. In addition rabies vaccine should be administered at a different site. 25.1 Immunoglobulins Anti-D Immunoglobulin (Human)* Indications Prevention of formation of antibodies to rhesus-positive blood cells in rhesus-negative patients. Availability INJECTIONS 150 \u00b5g/vial and 300 \u00b5g/vial. Dose Intramuscular injection Adult and Child- Following birth of a rhesus- positive infant in rhesus-negative mother: 250 \u00b5g immediately or within 72 h. Following any potentially sensitizing episode like amniocentesis, still birth, up to 20 weeks gestation: 250 \u00b5g per episode, after 20 weeks: 500 \u00b5g immediately or within 72 h. Following Rho (D) incompatible blood transfusion: 10 to 20 \u00b5g/ml transfused rhesus-positive blood. Contraindications See introductory notes; known hypersensitivity. Precautions See introductory notes; caution in rhesus- positive patients for treatment of blood disorders; caution in rhesus-negative patients with anti-D antibodies in their serum; patients should be observed for 20 min after injection. Rubella Vaccine. Rubella vaccine may be administered in the postpartum period at the same time as anti-D immunoglobulin injection, but only using separate syringes and separate contralateral sites. If blood is transfused, the antibody response to the vaccine may be inhibited and a test for antibodies should be performed after 8 weeks and the subject revaccinated if necessary. Adverse Effects See introductory notes; local pain and tenderness, fever, headache; cutaneous reaction; tachycardia, hypotension.512 NFI-2011Immunologicals Storage For liquid preparations: Store protected from light at temperature stated on the label.

Availability INJECTION 150 IU/2 ml; Dose Intramuscular injection and wound infiltration Adult and Child- 20 units/kg (half by intramuscular injection and half by wound infiltration). Contraindications See introductory notes; avoid repeat doses after vaccine treatment initiated; intravenous administration. Precautions Epinephrine should be available for management of anaphylactic reaction. If schedule requires rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin to be administered at the same time, they should be administered using separate syringes and separate sites.; pregnancy (Appendix 7c). Adverse Effects See Sera: The snake bite may cause local and systemic effects. Local effects include pain, swelling, bruising and tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Wounds should be cleaned and pain may be relieved by analgesics. If significant amounts of toxin are absorbed after a snake bite, this may result in early anaphylactoid symptoms such as tran-sient hypotension, angioedema, abdominal colic, diarrhoea and vomiting, followed by persistent or recurrent hypoten-sion and ECG abnormalities. Spontaneous systemic bleeding, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure may occur. Early anaphylactoid symptoms may be treated with epinephrine (adrenaline). Snake antivenom sera are the only specific treatment available but they can produce severe adverse reactions. They are generally only used if there is a clear indication of systemic involvement or severe local involvement or, if supplies are not limited, in patients at high risk of systemic or severe local involvement. Spider bites may cause either necrotic or neurotoxic syndromes depending on the species involved. Supportive and symptomatic treatment is required and in the case of necrotic syndrome, surgical repair may be necessary. Spider antivenom sera, suitable for the species involved, may prevent symptoms if administered as soon as possible after envenomation. Antivenom Sera* Indications Treatment of snake bites. Availability INJECTION 10 ml ampoule. Dose 60-100 ml in 5% dextrose or normal saline intravenously over one hour; start at 1 ml of diluted solution per minute initially, watch-ing for reaction. Skin sensitivity test is not recommended; In hemotoxic snake bites, may repeat a second dose at 6 h. if bleeding/clotting abnormalities continue, or whole blood clotting time is still prolonged at 6 h; In neurotoxic snake bites, may repeat at 1-2 h. Precautions Resuscitation facilities should be immediately available; antihistamine and treatment for anaphylactic shock should be kept Adverse Effects Serum sickness; anaphylaxis with hypotension, dyspnoea, urticaria and shock. Storage Store liquid vaccines at a temperature below 2 to 8C. Should not be allowed to freeze. 515 NFI-2011Immunologicals 25.3 Vaccines Vaccines may consist of a live attenuated form of a virus (for example, rubella or measles) or bacteria (for example, BCG vaccine); an inactivated preparation of a virus (for example, influenza vaccine) or bacteria; an extract of or detoxified exotoxin produced by a micro-organism (for example, tetanus vaccine). Contraindications and Precautions Recipients of any vaccine should be observed for an adverse reaction. Anaphylaxis though rare, can occur and epinephrine (adrenaline) must always be immediately available whenever immunization is given. If a serious adverse event (including anaphylaxis, collapse, shock, encephalitis, encephalopathy, or non-febrile convulsion) occurs following a dose of any vaccine, a subsequent dose should not be given. In the case of a severe reaction to Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus vaccine, the pertussis component should be omitted and the vaccination completed with Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine. Immunization should be postponed in acute illness which may limit the response to immunization, but minor infections without fever or systemic upset are not contraindications. A definite reaction to a preceding dose is a definite contraindi - cation. If alcohol or other disinfecting agent is used to wipe the injec- tion site it must be allowed to evaporate, otherwise inactiva-tion of a live vaccine may occur. The intramuscular route must not be used in patients with bleeding disorders such as haemophilia or thrombocyto-penia. Some viral vaccines contain small quantities of antibacterials such as polymyxin B or neomycin; such vaccines may need to be withheld from individuals who are extremely sensitive to the antibacterial. Some vaccines are prepared using hens' eggs and a history of anaphylaxis to egg ingestion is a contrain - dication to the use of such vaccines; caution is required if such vaccines are used in persons with less severe hypersensitivity to egg. When two live virus vaccines are required (and are not avail - able as a combined preparation) they should be given either simultaneously at different sites using separate syringes or with an interval of at least 3 weeks. Live virus vaccines should normally be given either at least 2-3 weeks before or at least 3 months after the administration of immunoglobulin. Live vaccines should not be routinely administered to preg -516 NFI-2011Immunologicals nant women because of the possible harm to the fetus but where there is significant risk of exposure, the need for immu-nization may outweigh any possible risk to the fetus. Live vaccines should not be given to anyone with malignant disease such as leukaemia or lymphomas or other tumours of the reticulo-endothelial system. Live vaccines should not be given to individuals with an impaired immune response caused by disease, radiotherapy or drug treatment (for example, high doses of corticosteroids). However, the WHO recommends that immunocompromized individuals who are HIV-positive should, under certain circum-stances, be given some live vaccines. Asymptomatic and symp- tomatic HIV-positive children and women of child-bearing age should receive diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and oral poliomyelitis vaccines (included in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Because of the risk of early and severe measles infection, infants should receive an extra dose of measles vaccine at 6 months of age with the EPI dose as soon after 9 months of age as possible. Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection must not be given either BCG or yellow fever vaccines. Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus (MMR) vaccine should not be given to severely immunocom-promized children with HIV infection. Individuals with asymp- tomatic HIV infection should only be given BCG or yellow fever vaccines where the prevalence of tuberculosis or yellow fever, respectively, is high. National policies on immunization of HIV-positive individuals may vary. Adverse Reactions: Local reactions including inflammation and lymphangitis may occur. Sterile abscess may develop at the injection site; fever, headache, malaise starting a few hour after injection and lasting for 1-2 days may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur including rarely, anaphylaxis. Vaccines for Universal Immunization: The WHO EPI currently recommends that all countries immu- nize against diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, poliomyelitis, pertussis, tetanus and that countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis infections should immunize against tuberculosis. Immunization against yellow fever is recommended in endemic countries. Routine vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b infection is also recommended in some countries. In geographical regions where the burden of disease is unclear, efforts should be made to evaluate the magnitude of the problem.517 NFI-2011Immunologicals Immunization schedule recommended by WHO: Scheme A Recommended in countries where perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus is frequent (for example, countries in South-east Asia) Age Vaccines Birth BCG; Poliomyelitis, oral (1 st); Hepatitis B (1st) 6 weeks tetanus philus influenzae (type b)1 (1st); Poliomyelitis, oral (2nd); Haemo- philus influenzae (type b)1 (2nd); influenzae (type b)1 (3rd); Poliomyelitis, oral (4th); Hepatitis B (3rd) 9 months Yellow fever (in countries where yellow fever poses a risk); Measles Scheme B Recommended in countries where perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus is less frequent (for example, countries in sub-Saharan Africa) Schedule as Scheme A, but hepatitis B (1 st) given at 6 weeks and hepatitis B (2nd) given at 10 weeks 1 Haemophilus influenzae (type b). BCG Vaccine (Dried): Where tuberculosis remains highly prevalent, routine immuni - zation of infants within the first year of life with BCG vaccine, derived from Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis), is highly cost-effective. This has been estimated, in several settings, to reduce the incidence of meningeal and miliary tuberculosis in early childhood by 50 to 90%. However, estimates of its effectiveness in older chil - dren have differed greatly from region to region and because efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis is doubtful, the main - stay of the tuberculosis control programme is case-finding and treatment. Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT) Vaccines: Diphtheria Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacte-518 NFI-2011Immunologicals rium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. Diphtheria vaccine is a formaldehyde-inactivated preparation of diphtheria toxin, adsorbed onto a mineral carrier to increase its antigenicity and reduce adverse reactions. Immunized individuals can be infected by toxin-producing strains of diphtheria but systemic manifestations of the disease do not occur. When administered for primary immunization in infants, diph - theria vaccine is almost always given together with pertussis and tetanus vaccines as part of a three-component prepara- tion (DPT). A two-component diphtheria vaccine with tetanus but without pertussis exists in two forms, DT and Td. Diphtheria-tetanus vaccine for children (DT) is used for primary immunization in infants who have contraindications to pertussis vaccine; it is also used in children under the age of 10 years for reinforcing immunization against diphtheria and tetanus in those coun - tries which recommend it. Tetanus-diphtheria vaccine for adults, adolescents and children over 10 years of age (Td), which has a reduced amount of diphtheria toxoid to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, is used for primary immunization in persons over the age of 10 years; it is also used for reinforcing immunization in persons over the age of 10 years in those countries that recommend it. Pertussis Pertussis (whooping cough) is a bacterial respiratory infec- tion caused by Bordetella pertussis. Many of the symptoms are thought to be caused by toxins released by B. pertussis. Whole cell vaccine composed of whole pertussis bacteria killed by chemicals or heat is effective in preventing serious illness. It causes frequent local reactions and fever and rarely, it may be associated with neurological reactions. Neurological complications after pertussis infection are considerably more common than after the vaccine. It is combined with diphthe - ria-tetanus vaccine for primary immunization unless immuni-zation against pertussis is contraindicated. Single component pertussis vaccines are available in some countries for use when the pertussis component has been omitted from all or part of the primary immunization Schedule An acellular form of the vaccine is also available. In some countries it is recommended that children with a personal or family history of febrile convulsions or a family history of idiopathic epilepsy should be immunized. It is also recommended that children with well-controlled epilepsy are immunized. Advice on prevention of fever should be given at the time of immunization. In children with evolving neurolog -519 NFI-2011Immunologicals ical problems, immunization with pertussis should be deferred until the condition is stable; in such children diphtheria and tetanus vaccine should be offered for primary immunization, and there may be an opportunity at a later date to complete immunization with a single-component pertussis vaccine. Where there is doubt advice should be sought from a paedia - trician. Tetanus Tetanus is caused by the action of a neurotoxin of Clostridium tetani in necrosed tissues such as occur in dirty wounds. Tetanus vaccine is available as a single component vaccine for primary immunization in adults who have not received childhood immunization against tetanus and for reinforcing immunization. The vaccine is also used in the prevention of neonatal tetanus and in the management of clean wounds and tetanus-prone wounds. Some countries recommend a max. of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine in a life-time; for the fully immunized patient reinforcing doses at the time of a tetanus-prone injury should only be required if more than 10 years have elapsed since the last dose. Neonatal tetanus due to infection of the baby's umbilical stump during unclean delivery is the cause of many deaths of newborn infants. Control of neonatal tetanus may be achieved by ensuring adequate hygiene during delivery and by ensuring protective immunity of mothers in late pregnancy. Tetanus vaccine is highly effective and the efficacy of two doses during pregnancy in preventing neonatal tetanus ranges from 80-100%. Women of child-bearing age may be immunized by a course of 5 doses (3 primary and 2 reinforcing) of tetanus vaccine. Wounds are considered to be tetanus-prone if they are sustained either more than 6 h before surgical treatment of the wound or at any interval after injury and show one or more of the following: a puncture-type wound, a significant degree of devitalized tissue, clinical evidence of sepsis, contamina - tion with soil/manure likely to contain tetanus organisms. All wounds should receive thorough surgical toilet. Antibacterial prophylaxis may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds. For clean wounds ; fully immunized individuals (those who have received a total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine at appropriate intervals) and those whose primary immunization is complete (with boosters up to date) do not require tetanus vaccine; individuals whose primary immunization is incomplete or whose boosters are not up to date require a reinforcing dose of tetanus vaccine (followed by further doses as 520 NFI-2011Immunologicals required to complete the schedule); non-immunized individuals (or whose immunization status is not known) should be given a dose of the vaccine immedi - ately (followed by completion of the full course of the vaccine if records confirm the need). For tetanus-prone wounds; management is as for clean wounds with the addition of a dose of antitet - anus immunoglobulin given at a different site; in fully immunized individuals and those whose primary immunization is complete (see above) the immu-noglobulin is needed only if the risk of infection is especially high (for example, contamination with manure). Antibacterial prophylaxis (with benzylpeni-cillin or Amoxycillin with clavulanic metro- nidazole) may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds. Hepatitis B Vaccine: Hepatitis B is caused by hepatitis B virus. It is transmitted in blood and blood products, by sexual contact and by contact with infectious body fluids. Persons at increased risk of infec - tion because of their life-style, occupation or other factors include parenteral drug abusers, individuals who change sexual partners frequently, health care workers who are at risk of injury from blood-stained sharp instruments and haemophiliacs. Also at risk are babies born to mothers who are HbsAg-positive (hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive) and individuals who might acquire the infection as the result of medical or dental procedures in countries of high preva-lence. The main public health consequences are chronic liver disease and liver cancer rather than acute infection. Routine immunization is recommended and has been implemented in some countries. Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine is highly efficacious. Over 90% of susceptible children develop a protective antibody response. A recombinant DNA vaccine is also available. Measles Vaccines: Measles is an acute viral infection transmitted by close respi- ratory contact. In some countries routine immunization of children against measles is given as one dose of a single compo- nent vaccine; in other areas, a two-dose schedule has been found to be more applicable. In developing countries, clinical efficacy is usually greater than 85%. Convulsions and encepha-litis are rare complications. Measles vaccine is administered in many countries as part of a combined preparation with mumps vaccine and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine); a single-521 NFI-2011Immunologicals dose primary immunization is followed by a reinforcing dose 2-5 years later. Single-component vaccines or MMR may be used in the control of outbreaks of measles and should be offered to susceptible children within 3 days of exposure. It is impor - tant to note that MMR vaccine is not suitable for prophylaxis following exposure to mumps or rubella since the antibody response to the mumps and rubella components is too slow for effective prophylaxis. Poliomyelitis Vaccines: Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection spread by the faecal-oral route which can cause paralysis of varying degree. There are two types of vaccine against poliomyelitis: oral and injectable. Oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) is composed of three types of live attenuated poliomyelitis viruses. The efficacy of OPV in preventing paralytic polio in developing countries ranges from 72% to 98% and is the vaccine of choice in eradication of the disease. Oral poliomyelitis vaccine may need to be repeated in patients with diarrhoea or vomiting. Those infected wth HIV should receive poliomyelitis vaccine according to the standard schedule but the vaccine is contraindicated in those with primary immune deficiency or those who are immunosup - pressed. The need for strict personal hygiene must be stressed as the vaccine virus is excreted in the faeces. The contacts of a recently vaccinated baby should be advised particularly of the need to wash their hands after changing the baby's nappies. After primary immunization reinforcing doses may be given. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is injectable and composed of inactivated strains of three types of poliomyelitis virus. It should be used for individuals who are immunosuppressed or for their household contacts. Vaccines for Specific Groups of Individuals: There are several other vaccines available which are used in different countries but are not yet recommended for routine use throughout the world. Allergic patients require specific immunotherapy. Influenza Vaccine: While most viruses are antigenically stable, the influenza viruses A and B (especially A) are constantly changing their antigenic structure as indicated by changes in the haemagglu- tinins (H) and neuraminidases (N) on the surface of the viruses. It is essential that influenza vaccines in use contain the H and N components of the prevalent strain or strains. The changes are monitored and recommendations are made each year 522 NFI-2011Immunologicals regarding the strains to be included in influenza vaccines for the following season. The recommended vaccine strains are grown on chick embryos and the vaccine is therefore contraindicated in individuals hypersensitive to egg. There are three forms of influenza vaccine; whole virion vaccine (not recommended for use in children because of the increased risk of severe febrile reactions), split-virion vaccine and surface-antigen vaccine. The vaccines will not control epidemics and they are recom- mended only for those at high risk. Annual immunization is recommended in the elderly and those of any age with diabetes mellitus, chronic heart disease, chronic renal failure, chronic respiratory disease including asthma, or immunosup - pression due to disease or drug treatment. Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine: Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is effective against sero- groups A and C of Neisseria meningitidis but infants respond less well than adults. Immunity to some meningococcal vaccines may be insufficient to confer adequate protection against infec- tion in infants under about 2 years of age and the minimum age recommended by manufacturers varies from 2 months to 2 years. It is indicated for persons at risk of serogroups A and C meningococcal disease in epidemics (where it must be adminis- tered early in the course of the epidemic) or endemic areas and as an adjunct to chemoprophylaxis in close contacts of persons with the disease. It is indicated for visits of longer than 1 month to areas of the world where risk of infection is high. Mumps Vaccine: Mumps vaccine is used for active immunization against mumps. In some countries the single antigen vaccine is no longer available and a combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine) is used for primary immunization. Rabies Vaccine (Inactivated): Rabies vaccine is used as part of the post-exposure treat - ment to prevent rabies in patients who have been bitten by rabid animals or animals suspected of being rabid. Treatment is dependent upon the individual's immune status and upon the level of risk of rabies in the country concerned in certain circumstances such as patients with incomplete prophy - laxis or unimmunized individuals passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulin may be indicated (see Rabies Immu- noglobulin). Treatment should also include thorough wound cleansing. The vaccine is also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in those at high risk such as laboratory workers, 523 NFI-2011Immunologicals veterinary surgeons, animal handlers and health workers who are likely to come into close contact with infected animals or patients with rabies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is also recom- mended for those living or travelling in enzootic areas who may be exposed to unusual risk. Rubella Vaccine: Rubella vaccine should be given to women of child-bearing age if they are seronegative to protect them from the risks of rubella in pregnancy. It should not be given in pregnancy and patients should be advised not to become pregnant within one month of vaccination. However, congenital rubella syndrome has not been reported following inadvertent immunization shortly before or during pregnancy. There is no evidence that the vaccine is teratogenic and routine termina- tion of pregnancy following inadvertent immunization should not be recommended. There is no risk to a pregnant woman from contact with recently vaccinated persons as the vaccine virus is not transmitted. The vaccine may contain traces of antibiotics and if so should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to them. In some countries the policy of protecting women of child - bearing age has been replaced by a policy of eliminating rubella in children. Rubella vaccine is a component of the MMR vaccine. Countries seeking to eliminate rubella should ensure that women of child-bearing age are immune and that over 80% of children are immunized. Typhoid Vaccine: Typhoid vaccine is used for active immunization against typhoid fever and immunization is advised for those travelling to endemic areas. The efficacy of the vaccine is not complete and the importance of maintaining scrupulous attention to food and water hygiene as well as personal hygiene must also be emphasized. Typhoid vaccine is available as a capsular polysaccharide injection.In children under 2 years the injection may show sub-optimal response. Immunization is also recommended for laboratory workers handling specimens from suspected cases. A live oral typhoid vaccine containing an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhi (Ty21a) may also be available. yellow Fever Vaccine: Yellow fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in some countries of South America and Africa. The disease is trans-524 NFI-2011Immunologicals mitted by Haemagogus and Aedes mosquito bites. The vaccine is highly immunogenic and offers about 10 years protec - tion. Over 92% of children develop protective antibodies. It is recommended that all countries in which yellow fever is endemic should incorporate this vaccine into their immuniza-tion Schedule. It is also used for travellers to endemic areas. BCG Vaccine* Pregnancy Category-C Indications Active immunisation against tuberculosis.

Ophthalmological Preparations Administration of Eye Preparations: Preparations for the eye should be sterile when issued. Use of single-application containers is preferable; multiple-appli - cation preparations include antimicrobial preservatives and when used particular care should be taken to prevent contam- ination of the contents, including the avoidance of contact between the applicator and the eye or other surfaces. Eye drops are generally instilled into the lower conjunctival sac which is accessed by gently pulling down the lower eyelid to form a pocket into which one drop is instilled. The eye should be kept closed for as long as possible after application, preferably 1-2 min. A small amount of eye ointment is applied similarly; the ointment melts rapidly and blinking helps to spread it. When two different eye drops are required at the same time, dilution and overflow may occur when one immediately follows the other; an interval of 5 min should be allowed between the two applications. Systemic absorption, which may occur after topical applica- tion of eye drops, can be minimized by using the finger to compress the lacrimal sac at the medial canthus for at least one min after instillation of the drops. This helps block the passage of the drops through the naso-lacrimal duct. Performance of Skilled Tasks Application of eye preparations may cause blurring of vision which is generally transient; patients should be advised not to carry out skilled tasks such as operating machinery or driving until their vision has cleared.544 NFI-2011Ophthalmological Preparations 27.1 Antiglaucoma Drugs Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blind - ness world wide. Glaucoma is normally associated with raised intra-ocular pressure and eventual damage to the optic nerve which may result in blindness. The rise in pressure is almost always due to reduced outflow of aqueous humour, the inflow remaining constant. The most common condition is chronic open-angle glaucoma (chronic simple glaucoma) in which the intra-ocular pressure increases gradually and the condition is usually asymptomatic until well advanced. In contrast, angle-closure glaucoma (closed-angle glaucoma) usually occurs as an acute emergency resulting from a rapid rise in intra-ocular pressure; if treatment is delayed, chronic angle-closure glau-coma may develop. Ocular hypertension is a condition in which intra-ocular pressure is raised without signs of optic nerve damage. Drugs used in the treatment of glaucoma lower the intra- ocular pressure by a variety of mechanisms including reduc-tion in secretion of aqueous humour by the ciliary body, or increasing the outflow of the aqueous humour by opening of the trabecular network. Antiglaucoma drugs used include topical application of a beta-blocker (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), a miotic, or a sympathomimetic administration of a carbonic anhydrase inhib - itor may be used as an adjunct. Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that reduces the secre - tion of aqueous humour. A beta-blocker is usually the drug of choice for initial and maintenance treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma. If further reduction in intra-ocular pressure is required a miotic, a sympathomimetic or a systemic carbonic anhydrase used with timolol. In angle-closure glaucoma, timolol should be used with a miotic and not alone. Since systemic absorption can occur, an ophthalmic beta-blocker should be used with caution in certain individuals. A miotic such as pilocarpine, through its parasympatho - mimetic action, contracts the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle, and opens the trabecular network. It is used in chronic open-angle glaucoma either alone or, if required, with a beta-blocker, epinephrine or a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Pilocarpine is used with systemic acetazolamide in an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma prior to surgery; however, it is not advisable to use pilocarpine after surgery because of a risk of posterior forming. Systemic absorption of topically applied pilocarpine can occur producing muscarinic adverse effects.545 NFI-2011Ophthalmological Preparations The sympathomimetic drug epinephrine (adrenaline) probably acts by reducing the rate of production of aqueous humour and increasing the outflow through the trabecular network. Epinephrine is usually used with a miotic, a beta-blocker or a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma; however, because epinephrine is also a mydriatic, it is contraindicated for angle-closure glau-coma unless an iridectomy has been carried out. Acetazolamide, by reducing carbonic anhydrase in the eye, reduces the production of aqueous humour and so reduces intra-ocular pressure. It is used systemically as an adjunct in chronic open-angle glaucoma unresponsive to treatment with topically applied antiglaucoma drugs. Prolonged therapy with acetazolamide is not normally recommended, but if treatment is unavoidable blood count and plasma electrolyte concentra-tion should be monitored. Acetazolamide is also used as part of emergency treatment for an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma; however it should not be used in chronic angle-clo - sure glaucoma as it may mask deterioration of the condition.

Storage Store protected from light and moisture.550 NFI-2011Ophthalmological Preparations 27.2 Anti-Infective Drugs Blepharitis, conjunctivitis and keratitis are common acute infections of the eye and can be treated topically. However, in some cases, for example, in gonococcal conjunctivitis, both topical and systemic anti-infective treatment may be neces - sary. Blepharitis and conjunctivitis are often caused by - while keratitis and endophthalmitis may be bacte - rial, viral or fungal. Bacterial blepharitis is treated with an anti- bacterial eye ointment or drops. Although most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis may resolve spontaneously, anti-infec - tive treatment shortens the infectious process and prevents complications. Acute infective conjunctivitis is treated with antibacterial eye drops by day and eye ointment applied at night. A poor response may indicate viral or allergic conjuncti - vitis. Keratitis requires immediate specialist treatment. Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum Pseudomonas aeru- ginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoea and other bacteria that may be implicated in blepharitis or conjunctivitis. Topical applica-tion may lead to systemic absorption and possible adverse effects. Silver nitrate is a topical anti-infective. Its antibacterial activity is attributed to precipitation of bacterial proteins by silver ions. It is available in 1% ophthalmic solutions and is used for prophylaxis of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. Tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic with activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including N. gonorrhoea, and most chlamydia, used conjunctivitis, and keratitis produced by susceptible bacteria. Tetracycline is also used in the treatment of trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and in the rhoea C. trachomatis.

Dangers include the development of open-angle glau- coma (chronic simple glaucoma) and cataracts, and the aggrava- tion of a simple herpes simplex epithelial lesion into an exten-sive corneal ulcer and subsequent permanent corneal scarring, with possible damage to vision and even loss of the eye. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone are useful in the treat - ment of inflammatory conditions including uveitis and scle- ritis. They are also used for reducing postoperative ocular inflammation. Before administration of an ophthalmic corti-costeroid, the possibility of bacterial, viral or fungal infection should be excluded. Treatment should be the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time; if long-term therapy (more than 6 weeks) is unavoidable, withdrawal of an ophthalmic corticosteroid should be gradual to avoid relapse.

Psychotherapeutic Drugs 28.1 Antianxiety Agents and Drugs Used In Sleep Disorders A sedative drug decreases activity, moderates excite - ment and calms the recipient, whereas, a hypnotic drug produces drowsiness and facilitates the onset and main- tenance of a sleep state that resembles natural sleep. The most widely used anxiolytics and hypnotics are the benzo-diazepines. Treatment of anxiety should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. The cause of insomnia should be established and appropriate treatment for underlying factors instituted before hypno-tics are considered. Hypnotics may be of value for a few days but rarely, longer than a week. Tolerance and dependence (both physical and psychological) and subsequent difficulty in withdrawing the drug may occur after regular use for more than a few weeks. Patients with chronic anxiety, alcohol or drug dependence or those with personality disorders are more likely to become dependent. Anxiolytics and hypnotics should be prescribed in carefully individualized dosage and use should be limited to control of acute conditions such as panic attacks and acute anxiety and severe, incapacitating insomnia. There is usually no justifica-tion for prolonging treatment with anxiolytics and hypnotics for more than one to two weeks. If used for longer periods, withdrawal should be gradual by reduction of the dose over a period of weeks or months, as abrupt discontinuation may produce confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions or a condition resembling delirium tremens. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may develop at any time up to 3 weeks after stopping a long-acting benzodiazepine but may occur within a few hour in the case of a short-acting one. The syndrome is character - ized by insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and body-weight, tremor, perspiration, tinnitus and perceptual disturbances. These symptoms may be similar to the original complaint and encourage further prescribing. Some symptoms may continue for weeks or months after stopping benzodiazepines. Patients should be warned that their ability to drive or operate machinery may be impaired and that the effects of alcohol may be enhanced.566 NFI-2011Psychotherapeutic Drugs Alprazolam* Pregnancy Category-D Schedule H Indications Anxiety disorders; panic attacks.

Precautions Myasthenia gravis; depressed patients; hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; obstructive sleep apnoea, compromised respiratory function; pregnancy (Appendix 7c), lactation, interactions (Appendix 6a,6c). Adverse Effects Abnormal thinking, behaviour changes, and complex behaviours, withdrawal effects, more recently introduced selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely used drugs in the treatment of depressive disorders. The response to antidepressant therapy is usually delayed with a lag-period of up to two weeks and at least six weeks before max. improvement occurs. It is important to use doses that are sufficiently high for effective treatment, but not so high as to cause toxic effects. Low doses should be used for initial treatment in the elderly. The use of more than one anti- depressant at a time is not recommended since this does not enhance effectiveness and it may result in enhanced adverse effects or interactions. Patients should be reviewed every 1-2 weeks at the start of treatment. Treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks in the elderly) before considering whether to change to another antidepressant due to lack of efficacy. In the case of a partial response, treatment may be continued for a further 2 weeks (elderly patients may take longer to respond). Remission usually occurs after 3-12 months. Treatment at full therapeutic dose should be continued for at least 4-6 months after resolu-tion of symptoms (about 12 months in the elderly). Treatment should not be withdrawn prematurely otherwise symptoms are likely to recur. Patients with a history of recurrent depres-sion should continue to receive maintenance treatment (for at least 5 years and possibly indefinitely). Lithium may be used as an alternative for maintenance treatment. Reduction in dose should be gradually carried out over a period of about 4 weeks or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients who have been on long-term maintenance treatment). Tricyclic and related antidepressants can be divided into those with more or less sedative effect. Those with sedative properties include amitriptyline and those with less sedative effects include imipramine. These drugs are most effective in the treatment of depression associated with psychomotor and physiological disturbances. Adverse effects include anti-cholinergic (more correctly antimuscarinic) symptoms of dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention. Arrhythmias and heart block can occur. Minimal quantities of tricyclic antidepressants should be prescribed at any one time because they are dangerous in overdose. The SSRIs characteristically cause gastrointestinal distur - bances, sleep disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions including rash (may be a sign of an impending serious systemic reaction and discontinuation should be considered) but they are less sedating and have fewer anticholinergic (antimus-carinic) and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. The SSRIs are less toxic in overdose than the older tricyclic 571 NFI-2011Psychotherapeutic Drugs compounds. They may be preferred in patients in whom the risk of suicide is strong, but there is some concern that SSRIs may increase suicidal ideation.

Individual and community programmes for relearning old skills and developing new ones and for learning to cope with the illness should be initiated. Classes of antipsychotic drugs include phenothiazines (for example chlorpromazine), butyrophenones (for neuroleptics including clozapine and risperidone. The various antipsychotic drugs do not, in general, differ in their antip-sychotic activity, but differ in range and quality of adverse effects (see below). Acute Phase Treatment: The administration of chlorpromazine or haloperidol will relieve symptoms such as thought disorder, hallucinations and delusions and prevent relapse. They are usually less effec- tive in apathetic, withdrawn patients. However, haloperidol may restore an acutely ill schizophrenic, who was previously withdrawn, or even mute and akinetic, to normal activity and social behaviour. In the acute phase chlorpromazine may be administered by intramuscular injection in a dose of 25-50 mg which can be repeated every 6-8 h while observing the patient for possible hypotension. In most cases, however, the intramuscular injection is not needed and patients can be treated with an oral dose. Haloperidol may be adminis- tered in the acute phase. Maintenance Therapy: Long-term treatment in patients with a definite diagnosis of schizophrenia may be necessary after the first episode to prevent the manifest illness from becoming chronic. The lowest possible dose of antipsychotic drug that will prevent major exacerbations of florid symptoms is used for long-term management. Too rapid a dose reduction should be avoided. Intramuscular depot preparations such as fluphenazine may be used as an alternative to oral mainte - nance therapy especially when compliance with oral treat - ment is unreliable. Exacerbations of illness in patients on maintenance drug therapy can be precipitated by stress. Withdrawal of maintenance drug treatment requires careful surveillance since it is not possible to predict the course of the disease and the patient may suffer a relapse if treatment is withdrawn inappropriately. Further, the need for continuation of treatment may not be evident on withdrawal of treatment because relapse may be delayed for several weeks.576 NFI-2011Psychotherapeutic Drugs Adverse Effects They are very common with long-term administration of antip- sychotic drugs. Hypotension and interference with tempera-ture regulation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and bone- marrow depression are the most life-threatening. Hypoten- sion and interference with temperature regulation are dose-related. They can result in dangerous falls and hypothermia in the elderly and this must be considered before prescribing these drugs for patients over 70 years of age. Extrapyramidal symptoms are the most troublesome and are caused most frequently by the piperazine phenothiazines such as fluphenazine, the butyrophenones such as haloperidol and the depot preparations. Although easily recognized, they are not so easy to predict because they depend in part on the dose and patient susceptibility as well as the type of drug. However, there is a general tendency for low-potency drugs to have less extrapyramidal adverse effects, while high-potency drugs such as haloperidol have more extrapyramidal effects but less seda-tion and anticholinergic (more correctly antimuscarinic) effects. Sedation and anticholinergic effects usually diminish with continued use. Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of parkin-sonian-type symptoms including tremor which may occur gradually; dystonia (abnormal face and body movements) and dyskinesia, which may appear after only a few doses; akathisia (restlessness), which may occur after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated; and tardive dyskinesia (an orofacial dyskinesia), which usually takes longer to develop but may develop on short-term treat - ment with low doses; short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug. Parkinsonian symptoms are usually reversible on withdrawal of the drug and may be suppressed by anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) drugs but they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is usually associated with long-term treatment and high dosage of an antipsychotic, particularly in elderly patients. There is no established treatment for tardive dyskinesias, which may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy. However, withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia may halt its full devel-opment. Treatment of all patients on antipsychotics must be carefully and regularly reviewed. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hypothermia, fluctuating levels of consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating and urinary incontinence) is a rare adverse effect of haloperidol and chlorpromazine. It is managed by discontin-uing the antipsychotic, correcting fluid and electrolyte defects, and giving bromocriptine and sometimes dantrolene.577 NFI-2011Psychotherapeutic Drugs Chlorpromazine* Pregnancy Category-C Schedule H Indications Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mania, psychomotor agitation and violent behaviour; adjunct in severe anxiety; psychosis, mania, hiccups.

Lithium is effec-tive in acute mania but symptomatic control of the florid symp-toms with an antipsychotic or benzodiazepine is often neces- sary whilst waiting for the antimania drug to exert its effect. Benzodiazepines may be given during the initial stages until lithium becomes effective but they should not be used for long periods because of the risk of dependence. Lithium may be given concurrently with antipsychotics and treatment with the antipsychotic should be tailed off as lithium becomes effec-tive. Alternatively, lithium therapy may be delayed until the patient's mood is stabilized with the antipsychotic. However, there is a risk of neurotoxicity and increased extrapyramidal disorders when lithium and antipsychotics are used concur - rently (Appendix 6c). Lithium is the mainstay of treatment but its narrow therapeutic range is a disadvantage. Sodium valproate is effective and carbamazepine may also be used. Treatment of depressive episodes in bipolar disorders will mostly involve combination treatment using either lithium or Sodium valproate together with a tricyclic antidepressant. Increased adverse effects are a problem which may compro-mise treatment. Lithium prophylaxis should usually only be undertaken with specialist advice and the likelihood of recurrence considered. Long-term lithium therapy has been associated with thyroid disorders and mild cognitive and memory impairment. Patients should continue the treatment for longer than 3 to 5 years only if benefit persists. Withdrawal appears to produce high levels of relapse. If lithium is to be discontinued, the dose should be reduced gradually over a few weeks and patients should be warned of possible relapses if discontinued abruptly. Lithium salts have a narrow therapeutic/toxic ratio and should only be prescribed if there are facilities for monitoring serum lithium concentrations. Doses are adjusted to achieve serum-lithium concentrations of 0.4-1 mmol/litre (lower end of range for maintenance therapy and the elderly) on samples taken 12 h after the preceding dose. The optimum range for each patient should be determined.585 NFI-2011Psychotherapeutic Drugs Overdosage, usually with serum-lithium concentration of over 1.5 mmol/litre may be fatal and toxic effects include coarse tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, renal impairment and convulsions. If any of these effects occur, treatment should be stopped, serum-lithium concentration determined and in mild overdosage large amounts of sodium and fluid should be given to reverse the toxicity; in severe toxicity, haemodialysis may be required. For patients who are unresponsive to or intolerant of lithium, carbamazepine may be used in the prophylaxis of bipolar illness particularly in those with rapid cycling affective disor - ders (more than four affective episodes per year).

Solutions Correcting Water, Electrolyte and Acid Base Disturbances 29.1 Oral Oral Rehydration Salts* (Refer Page No. 78 ) 29.2 Parenteral Solutions of electrolytes are given intravenously, to meet normal fluid and electrolyte requirements or to replenish substantial deficits or continuing losses, when the patient is nauseating or vomiting and is unable to take adequate amounts by mouth. The nature and severity of the electrolyte imbalance must be assessed from the history and clinical and biochemical examination of each individual. Sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, and water depletion can occur singly and in combination with or without disturbances of acid-base balance. Isotonic solutions may be infused safely into a peripheral vein. More concentrated solutions, for example 20% glucose, are best given through an indwelling catheter positioned in a large vein. Sodium chloride in isotonic solution provides the most impor - tant extracellular ions in near physiological concentrations and is indicated in sodium depletion which may arise from conditions such as gastroenteritis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ileus and ascites. In a severe deficit of from 4 to 8 litres, 2 to 3 litres of isotonic sodium chloride may be given over 2 to 3 h; there - after infusion can usually be at a slower rate. Excessive administration should be avoided; the jugular venous pressure should be assessed; the bases of the lungs should be examined for crepitations, and in elderly or seri-ously ill patients it is often helpful to monitor the right atrial (central) venous pressure. Chronic hyponatraemia should ideally be managed by fluid restriction. However, if sodium chloride is required, the deficit should be corrected slowly to avoid risk of osmotic demyeli-594 NFI-2011Solutions Correcting Water, Electrolyte and Acid Base Disturbances nation syndrome; the rise in plasma-sodium concentration should be limited to no more than 10 mmol/litre in 24 h. The more physiologically appropriate compound solution of sodium lactate can be used instead of isotonic sodium chlo-ride solution during surgery or in the initial management of the injured or wounded. Sodium chloride and glucose solutions are indicated when there is combined water and sodium depletion. A 1:1 mixture of isotonic sodium chloride and 5% glucose allows some of the water (free of sodium) to enter body cells which suffer most from dehydration while the sodium salt with a volume of water determined by the normal plasma Na + remains extra- cellular. Combined sodium, potassium, chloride, and water depletion may occur, for example, with severe diarrhoea or persistent vomiting; replacement is carried out with sodium chloride intravenous infusion 0.9% and glucose intravenous infusion 5% with potassium as appropriate. Glucose solutions (5%) are mainly used to replace water defi- cits and should be given alone when there is no significant loss of electrolytes. Average water requirement in a healthy adult are 1.5 to 2.5 litres daily and this is needed to balance unavoidable losses of water through the skin and lungs and to provide sufficient for urinary excretion. Water deple-tion (dehydration) tends to occur when these losses are not matched by a comparable intake, as for example may occur in coma or dysphagia or in the aged or apathetic who may not drink water in sufficient amount on their own initiative. Excessive loss of water without loss of electrolytes is uncommon, occurring in fevers, hyperthyroidism, and in uncommon water-losing renal states such as diabetes insipidus or hypercalcaemia. The volume of glucose solution needed to replace deficits varies with the severity of the disorder, but usually lies within the range of 2 to 6 litres. Glucose solutions are also given in regimens with calcium, bicarbonate, and insulin for the emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia. They are also given, after correction of hyper - glycaemia, during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, when they must be accompanied by continuing insulin infusion. If glucose or sugar cannot be given orally to treat hypogly - caemia, glucose 50% may be given intravenously into a large vein through a large-gauge needle; this concentration is very irritant on extravasation and it is also viscous and difficult to administer. Larger volumes of less concentrated glucose solu - tions (10% or 20%) can be used as alternatives and are less irritant.595 NFI-2011Solutions Correcting Water, Electrolyte and Acid Base Disturbances Sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicarbonate) is used to control severe metabolic acidosis (as in renal failure). Since this condition is usually attended by sodium depletion, it is reasonable to correct this first by the administration of isot - onic sodium chloride intravenous infusion, provided the kidneys are not primarily affected and the degree of acidosis is not so severe as to impair renal function. In these circum-stances, isotonic sodium chloride alone is usually effective as it restores the ability of the kidneys to generate bicarbonate. In renal acidosis or in severe metabolic acidosis of any origin, for example blood pH < 7.1, sodium hydrogen carbonate (1.4%) may be infused with isotonic sodium chloride when the acidosis remains unresponsive to correction of anoxia or fluid depletion; a total volume of up to 6 litres (4 litres of sodium chloride and 2 litres of sodium hydrogen carbonate) may be necessary in the adult. In severe shock due for example to cardiac arrest, metabolic acidosis may develop without sodium depletion; in these circumstances sodium hydrogen carbonate is best given in a small volume of hypertonic solution (for example 50 ml of 8.4% solution intravenously); plasma pH should be monitored. Sodium hydrogen carbonate is also used in the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. Intravenous potassium chloride in sodium chloride infusion is the initial treatment for the correction of severe hypokalaemia when sufficient potassium cannot be taken by mouth. Potas- sium chloride concentrate may be added to sodium chloride 0.9% infusion, thoroughly mixed and given slowly over 2 to 3 h with specialist advice and ECG monitoring in difficult cases. Repeated measurements of plasma potassium are necessary to determine whether further infusions are required and to avoid the development of hyperkalaemia which is especially likely to occur in renal impairment. Initial potassium replacement therapy should not involve glucose infusions because glucose may cause a further decrease in the plasma-potassium concentration.

Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs 603603 NFI-2011Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs 30. Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs Vitamins: Vitamins are used for the prevention and treatment of specific deficiency states or when the diet is known to be inadequate. It has often been suggested but never convinc- ingly proved, that subclinical vitamin deficiencies cause much chronic ill-health and liability to infections. This has led to enormous consumption of vitamin preparations, which have no more than placebo value. Most vitamins are compara-tively non-toxic but prolonged administration of high doses of retinol (vitamin A), ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may have severe adverse effects. Retinol (vitamin A) is a fat-soluble substance stored in body organs, principally the liver. Periodic high-dose supplementa- tion is intended to protect against vitamin A deficiency which is associated with ocular defects particularly xerophthalmia (including night blindness which may progress to severe eye lesions and blindness), and an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly measles and diarrhoea. Universal vitamin A distribution involves the periodic administration of supplemental doses to all preschool-age children with priority given to age groups, 6 months to 3 years, or regions at greatest risk. All mothers in high-risk regions should also receive a high dose of vitamin A within 8 weeks of delivery. Since vitamin A is associated with a teratogenic effect it should be given in smaller doses (no more than 10,000 units/day) to women of child-bearing age. It is also used in the treatment of active xerophthalmia. Doses of vitamin A should be admin - istered orally immediately upon diagnosis of xerophthalmia and thereafter patients with acute corneal lesions should be referred to a hospital on an emergency basis. In women of child-bearing age there is a need to balance the possible teratogenic effects of vitamin A should they be pregnant with the serious consequences of xerophthalmia. Where there are severe signs of xerophthalmia high dose treatment as for patients over 1 year should be given. When less severe symp-toms are present (for example night blindness) a much lower dose is recommended. Vitamin A therapy should also be given during epidemics of measles to reduce complications. Vitamin B is composed of widely differing substances which are, for convenience, classed as 'vitamin B complex'. Thiamine 604 NFI-2011Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs (vitamin B1) is used orally for deficiency due to to inadequate dietary intake. Severe deficiency may result in 'beri-beri'. Chronic dry 'beri-beri' is characterized by peripheral neurop - athy, muscle wasting and weakness, and paralysis; wet 'beri- beri' is characterized by cardiac failure and oedema. Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome (demyelination of the CNS) may develop in severe deficiency. Thiamine is given by intravenous injection in doses of up to 300 mg daily (parenteral preparations may contain several B group vitamins) as initial treatment in severe deficiency states. Potentially severe allergic reactions may occur after parenteral administration. Facilities for resuscita-tion should be immediately available. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) deficiency may result from reduced dietary intake or reduced absorption due to liver disease, alcoholism, chronic infection or probenecid therapy. It may also occur in association with other deficiency states such as pellagra. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency is rare as the vitamin is widely distributed in foods, but deficiency may occur during isoniazid therapy and is characterized by peripheral neuritis. High doses are given in some metabolic disorders, such as hyperoxaluria and it is also used in sideroblastic anaemia. Nicotinic acid inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and triglyceride and is used in some hyperlipidaemias. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are used to prevent and treat nicotinic acid deficiency (pellagra). Nicotina - mide is generally preferred as it does not cause vasodilation. Hydroxocobalamin is the form of vitamin B 12 used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency due to dietary deficiency or malabsorp- tion (see chapter 13.1). Folic acid is essential for the synthesis of DNA and certain proteins. Deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12 is associated with megaloblastic anaemia. Folic acid should not be used in undiagnosed megaloblastic anaemia unless vitamin B12 is administered concurrently, otherwise neuropathy may be precipitated (see chapter 13.1). Supplementation with folic acid 500 \u00b5g daily is recommended for women of child-bearing potential in order to reduce the risk of serious neural tube defects in their offspring. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used for the prevention and treat - ment of scurvy. Claims that ascorbic acid is of value in the treatment of common colds are unsubstantiated. The term vitamin D covers a range of compounds including ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). These two compounds are equipotent and either can be used to prevent and treat rickets. Simple deficiency of vitamin D occurs in those who have an inadequate dietary intake or who fail to produce enough 605 NFI-2011Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in their skin from the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in response to ultraviolet light. Vitamin K is necessary for the production of blood clotting factors. Minerals: Calcium gluconate: Calcium supplements are usually only required where dietary calcium intake is deficient. This dietary requirement varies with age and is relatively greater in child - hood, pregnancy and lactation due to an increased demand, and in old age, due to impaired absorption. In osteoporosis, a calcium intake which is double the recommended daily amount reduces the rate of bone loss. In hypocalcaemic tetany calcium gluconate must be given parenterally but plasma calcium must be monitored. Calcium gluconate is also used in cardiac resuscitation. Iodine is among the body's essential trace elements. The recommended intake of iodine is 150 \u00b5g daily (200 \u00b5g daily in pregnant and lactation women); in children the recommended intake of iodine is 50 \u00b5g daily for infants under 1 year, 90 \u00b5g daily for children aged 2-6 years, and 120 \u00b5g daily for children aged 7-12 years. Deficiency causes endemic goitre and results in endemic cretinism (characterized by deaf-mutism, intellectual deficit, spasticity and sometimes hypothyroidism), impaired mental function in children and adults and an increased inci - dence of still-births and perinatal and infant mortality. Iodine and iodides may suppress neonatal thyroid function and in general iodine compounds should be avoided in pregnancy. Where it is essential to prevent neonatal goitre and cretinism, iodine should not be witheld from pregnant women. Control of iodine deficiency largely depends upon salt iodization with potassium iodide or potassium iodate and through dietary diversification. In areas where iodine deficiency disorders are moderate to severe, iodized oil given either before or at any stage of pregnancy is found to be beneficial. Sodium fluoride: Availability of adequate fluoride confers significant resistance to dental caries. It is now considered that the topical action of fluoride on enamel and plaque is more important than the systemic effect. Where the natural fluoride content of the drinking water is significantly less than 1 mg per litre, artificial fluoridation is the most economical method of supplementing fluoride intake. Daily administra-tion of fluoride tablets or drops is a suitable alternative, but systemic fluoride supplements should not be prescribed without reference to the fluoride content of the local water supply; they are not advisable when the water contains more than 700 \u00b5g per litre. In addition, infants need not receive 606 NFI-2011Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs fluoride supplements until the age of 6 months. Dentifrices which incorporate Sodium fluoride are a convenient source of fluoride. Individuals who are either particularly caries prone or medically compromized may be given additional protection by the use of fluoride rinses or by application of fluoride gels. Rinses may be used daily or weekly; daily use of a less concen-trated rinse is more effective than weekly use of a more concentrated one. High-strength gels must be applied on a regular basis under professional supervision; extreme caution is necessary to prevent the child from swallowing any excess.

It occurs when the haemoglobin concentration falls below the normal range for the age and sex of the individual. It is essential that a correct diagnosis is made before initiating therapy. Any serious underlying cause of iron-deficiency anaemia, including gastric erosion and colonic carcinoma, should be excluded before giving iron replacement. Prophylaxis with iron salts in pregnancy should be given to women who have additional factors for iron-deficiency; low-dose iron and folic acid preparations are used for the prophylaxis of megalob - lastic anaemia in pregnancy. Ferrous salts should be given orally wherever possible. They differ only marginally in efficiency of absorption and thus the choice of preparation is usually decided by incidence of adverse effects and cost. Ferric salts are much less well absorbed. The oral dose of elemental iron for treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia in adults should be 100-200 mg daily with meals. The approximate elemental iron content of various ferrous salts is- ferrous fumarate 200 mg (65 mg iron), ferrous gluco-nate 300 mg (35 mg iron), ferrous succinate 100 mg (35 mg iron), ferrous sulphate 300 mg (60 mg iron) and dried ferrous sulphate 200 mg (65 mg iron). The haemoglobin concentration should rise by about 100-200 mg/100 ml per day or 2 g/100 ml over 3-4 weeks. After the haemoglobin has risen to normal, treatment should be continued for a further 3 months to replenish the iron stores. Iron intake in the evening has been reported to improve its absorption. Iron intake with meals may reduce bioavailability but improve tolerability and adherence. If adverse effects arise with one salt, dosage can be reduced or a change made to an alternative iron salt but an improvement in tolerance may be due to lower content of elemental iron. Gastrointestinal irritation may occur with iron salts. Nausea and epigastric pain are dose-related. Iron preparations taken orally may be constipating, particularly in the elderly, occa-sionally leading to faecal impaction. Oral iron may exacerbate diarrhoea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease but care is also needed in patients with intestinal strictures and diverticula. Iron as iron dextran (a complex of ferric hydroxide with dextrans) should be given parenterally only if the patient cannot tolerate oral iron, or does not take it reliably or there is 615 NFI-2011Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs continuing severe blood loss or malabsorption. Many patients with chronic renal failure who are receiving haemodialysis (and some on peritoneal dialysis) require intravenous iron on a regular basis. Parenteral iron may cause more harm than benefit. With the exception of patients on haemodialysis the haemoglobin response is not significantly faster with the parenteral route than the oral route. Megaloblastic Anaemia: Megaloblastic anaemias result from a lack of either vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) or folate or both. The clinical features of folate-deficient megaloblastic anaemia are similar to those of vitamin B12 deficiency except that the accompanying severe neuropathy does not occur; it is essential to establish the underlying cause in every case. Hydroxocobalamin is used to treat vitamin B 12 deficiency whether due to dietary defi- ciency or malabsorption including pernicious anaemia (due to a lack of intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B 12 absorption). Folate deficiency due to poor nutrition, pregnancy, antiepilep - tics or malabsorption is treated with folic acid but this should never be administered without vitamin B12 in undiagnosed megaloblastic anaemia because of the risk of precipitating neurological changes due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Preparations containing a ferrous salt and folic acid are used for the prevention of megaloblastic anaemia in pregnancy. The low doses of folic acid in these preparations are inadequate for the treatment of megaloblastic anaemias. Prevention of Neural Tube Defects: An adequate intake of folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects in babies. Therefore, women planning a pregnancy should receive sufficient folic acid before conception and in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; folic acid may be given as a food or a medicinal supplement in a dose of 400-500 \u00b5g daily. A woman who has not received supplementary folic acid and suspects that she might be pregnant should start taking folic acid at once and continue until 12 th week of pregnancy. Women at increased risk of giving birth to a baby with neural tube defects (for example history of neural tube defect in a previous child) should receive a higher dose of folic acid of approximately 5 mg daily, starting before conception and continuing for 12 weeks after conception. Women taking antiepileptic medication should be counselled by their doctor before starting folic acid.616 NFI-2011Vitamins, diabetic neuropathy; medicine related or alcoholic neuropathy.

Appendix 14: Storage of ................................. Antimicrobial Resistance Development and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is commonly due to overuse, misuse, and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials by doctors, nurses and pharmacists, non- compliance and self medication by patients and use in animal husbandry and agriculture. It is estimated that 70-80% of prescriptions for antimicrobials are probably advised unnec-essarily by the health professionals. Inspite of the fact that most common colds and diarrhoeal episodes are viral in origin, yet, antimicrobials are used indiscriminately. Reasons for over prescribing are often lack of confidence, peer pres-sure, patient pressure and pharmaceutical company pressure. Antimicrobial use is a key driver of the resistance. Poverty and inadequate access to antibiotics constitute a major factor in the development of resistance. Another common cause of developing resistance is improper diagnosis. In many instances death of an adequately equipped diagnostic laboratory in the vicinity compels the physician to prescribe antibiotics empiri-cally, thus, increasing the likelihood of the patient receiving a wrong antibiotic. Furthermore, ready availability of antibi - otics over-the-counter and sales promotion schemes by the pharmaceutical manufacturers also leads to the promotion of indiscriminate use, thus, increasing the likelihood of devel-opment of resistance. Counterfeit drugs are also a problem contributing to development of resistance. These contain either the wrong ingredient, or lesser amount of the active ingredient. In some instances, the medication poisons are capable of causing disability or even death. The impact of the media has also contributed to the development of resist - ance. Patients often demand antibiotics for their ailment on the basis of advertisements read or seen. Unwitting use of more active drugs at sub therapeutic doses leads directly to the development of multi drug resistance. Irrational use of antimicrobials is widespread throughout the world. This is harmful in terms of increased cost of therapy, unnecessary adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, reduced quality of care and worst of it is AMR. The bacterial infections which contribute most to human mortality and morbidity are also those in which emerging antimicrobial resistance is most obvious: diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, meningitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and hospital-acquired infections. Some The development of resistance to drugs commonly used to treat P . falciparum malaria is of particular concern, as is the emerging resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Established mechanisms of AMR For an antibiotic to be effective, it must reach the target site in an active form, bind to the target, and interfere with its func - tion. Thus, bacterial resistance to an antimicrobial agent can occur due to three general mechanisms: The drug does not reach its target In Gram negative bacteria, many antibiotics enter the cell through protein channels called porins. Mutations or loss of these channels can prevent/slow the rate of antibiotic entry into a cell, effectively reducing drug concentration at the target site. If the drug target is intracellular and the drug requires active transport across the cell membrane, a mutation that interferes with the transport mechanism can confer resist - ance e.g. aminoglycosides . Bacteria can also transport antimi- crobial drugs out of the cell through efflux pumps. Resistance to numerous drugs, including fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and beta lactam antibiotics, is mediated by this mechanism. The drug is inactivated Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides can be due to a plasmid encoded aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Simi - larly, -lactamase production is the most common mechanism of resistance to penicillins and other -lactam drugs. Many hundreds of different -lactamases have now been identified. A variation of this mechanism is failure of the bacterial cell to activate a prodrug e.g. loss of ability of M. tuberculosis to activate isoniazid (INH). The target site is altered This may be due to mutations in drug binding region of target enzyme e.g. fluoroquinolones, target modification e.g. ribos - omal protection type of resistance to macrolides and acquire - ment of a resistant form of the susceptible target e.g., methi - cillin resistance in Staphylococcus Spp. due to production of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP).Appendix 1627 NFI-2011Strategies to prevent AMR in healthcare settings Prudent antibiotic use: Antibiotics should be used only when they improve patient outcome. Not all infections need anti-biotic treatment e.g. in patients with sore throat, benefit from antimicrobial therapy is small and is counterbalanced by the risk of adverse events like rash. Narrow spectrum agents should be used whenever possible. Broad spectrum agents should not be used as a cover for lack of diagnostic precision. Antibiotics should be prescribed in optimal doses, regimens, and should be stopped when the infection is treated. Restrict the use of last line antibiotics for serious infections and only when simpler agents are likely to be ineffective. Whenever used for prophylaxis, antibiotics should be used for short courses and at appropriate times (e.g. during surgical prophy - laxis, antibiotics should be given within an hour prior to inci - sion). Prevention of infection: Use of antimicrobials can also be reduced if infections are prevented in the first place. This can be achieved by improved use of vaccines and improved hygiene and infection control practices like compliance with hand washing protocols and aseptic techniques for catheteri-zation. Catheters and drains should be removed when no longer needed. Clinicians should be familiar with local antibiotic sensitivity profiles and should comply with the local antibiotic guide-lines. A hospital antibiotic policy should be formulated based on local antimicrobial resistance data. Prescribers should be educated about the use of antibiotics, when not to use them and also the infection control strategies. Hospitals should carry out surveillance of resistance patterns- how much, where, in which organisms and to what antibi - otics. Similarly antibiotic use pattern can be studied and these data can be used to devise targeted interventions to minimize antimicrobial use. The intent of giving this write up in the formulary is to encourage rational prescribing of antimicrobials and minimize the development of resistance to antimicrobials.Appendix 1628 NFI-2011Appendix 2: Calculation of Electrolytes Milliequivalents The milliequivalent is related to the total number of ionic charges in solution and it takes note of the valency of the ions. In other words, it is a unit of measurement of the amount of chemical activity of an electrolyte. The total concentration of cations always equals the total concentration of anions. A milliequivalent (mEq) weight is 1/1000 of the equivalent weight. An equivalent weight of an element is the atomic weight expressed in grams, divided by its valency. 1mEq =atomic weight in mg valency e.g. 1 = 23 mg 1 1 mEq Cl- =35.5 = 35.5 mg 1 Thus, a solution containing 1 mEq of Sodium per litre contains 23 mg Sodium. A solution containing 1 mEq of Sodium Chlo - ride contains 23 mg Na+ and 35.5 mg Cl-, i.e. 58.5 mg Sodium Chloride per litre. In a salt containing ions of different valencies, Weight of a salt containing 1 mEq of specified ion=Sum of the atomic weights (valency of the specified ion) x no. of speci-fied ions in molecule e.g. Weight of magnesium chloride ( mgCl 2.6H2O) required to prepare a solution containing 1 mEq of magnesium per litre. 24.3 + (2 x 35.5) + 6[(2 x 1) + 16] = 101.7 mg mgCl2.6H2O 2 x 1 For the conversion of grams per 100 ml (percentage) of a solution to mEq/litre, the following formula may be used. mEq per litre =percentage strength x 10000 mg of salt containing 1 mEq of specified ions e.g. Number of mEq of Na+ per litre contained in Sodium Chlo - ride injection 0.9% (1mEq Sodium is contained in 58.5 mg Sodium litre of Na+ in Sodium Chloride = 154 approximately 58.5 =Wt (g) mEq weight (g) e.g. mEq weight =5 = 67 0.0746 To convert mg per 100 ml ( mg%) to mEq per litre, the following formula is used : mg. per 100 ml. x 10 x valency = mEq. per litre atomic weight In the case of gases (i.e. carbon dioxide) the volume per cent of the gas is multiplied by 10 and divided by 22.4, the later figure being the volume in litres occupied by a molecular weight of a gas. The results are expressed in millimoles per litre. vol. percent x 10 = mM. per litre 22.4 To convert mg per 100 ml ( mg%) to milliosmoles: mg. per 100 ml x 10 = mOsm per litre molecular weight Table 1: Atomic weight, Valency, and Normal Ranges of the Common Electrolytes Normal Ranges, Plasma or Serum ElectrolyteAtomic WeightValency mg. per 2.1-2.6 Table 2: mg of a salt containing 1 mEq of a specified ion Ion weight of mEq in mgSalt mg of saltc o n t a i n i n g 1 mEq of the specified ion Ca ++20.0 Sodium 131 neutralising lactic acid with sodium hydroxide: 1.0 ml of 1 M sodium contains the equivalent of 112 mg.Appendix 2632 NFI-2011Appendix 3: Common Laboratory Parameters S.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Leukocytes - Total less than 5 cells/cu mm Disposal of Unused/ Expired Pharmaceutical Products Shelf life of a drug is defined as the time interval within which it remains physically, chemically and/ or biologically stable as well as safe and effective for human consumption if stored under the label specified conditions and it is in the original container closure system. Shelf life can be determined by the accelerated stability testing method. Expiry/expiration date is the actual date placed on the label/container indicating the time during which a batch of drug product is expected to remain with the approved shelf life specifications if stored under defined conditions and after which it should not be used. Expired medicines lose their potency and are capable of producing toxins, causing serious reaction or failure of therapy. Thus disposal of unused/expired pharmaceutical products is required for every pharmacy - retail and wholesale, clinic, dispensary, hospital, manufacturing unit and testing labora-tory. Indiscriminate disposal of drugs is likely to pollute the environment resulting in contamination of vegetables, fruits, fish and other aquatic life and even drinking water. Pharma - ceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCP) have been found present as pollutant in water and environment and this poses a serious issue of ecological imbalance due to indiscriminate disposal of expired pharmaceutical products. With increasing awareness of pollution and their effect on human beings, animals and environment, it is imperative to assure Regulatory compliance by Individuals, Retail and Wholesale Chemists, Clinics, Hospitals, Manufacturers of PPCP , Clinical Research Organizations conducting Biostudies, Analytical Testing Laboratories and other organizations involved in drug distribution (in the event of any disaster) to augment Government efforts. Managing Disposal of PPCP: Mass awareness, at every level, of impact of casual approach in such disposal of unwanted and expired PPCP is very much desirable. Following steps are suggested for safe disposal of unused/not required/expired PPCP: 1. Expired or near expiry or unused/not required PPCP in large quantity should be returned by Retail Chem-ists and Druggists/Pharmacies/Clinics/Hospitals/NGO involved in drug distribution to Wholesalers or stockists 638 NFI-2011of manufacturer(s) who in turn will return the same to the location of the manufacturer where the products were manufactured, for proper disposal. 2. Expired/short expiry PPCP are received at the segregated area for Expired Goods/Market Returns in the Finished Goods Warehouse of the manufacturing location with proper documentation in compliance with Regulatory requirements under i) Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945 and amendments therein, ii) Central Excise/State Excise Laws- as applicable and iii) Local authority of Pollution Control Board of the State before under taking disposal of PPCP . Short expiry PPCP should be analyzed and if found satisfactory, could be used for treatment ensuring that it is consumed before expiration. 3. In the event of expired goods returned from overseas customers, appropriate documentation for disposal of PPCP should be provided to the custom authority at the importing port for Bill of Entry. 4. Finished Goods Warehouse receiving the PPCP shall inform Quality System/Quality Assurance authority of the organization for verification and appropriate documenta-tion before undertaking disposal. 5. For small quantity of expired products in Clinics, Hospitals, Health Care Centers and Dispensaries, Pharmacist at the location should be assigned responsibility for disposal of PPCP . He/she should be trained for proper documentation and disposals as indicated below. 6. Disposal of expired retention samples of API, Excipients and that of Pharmaceutical dosage forms in the manufac- turing unit or Testing laboratories should be assigned to a responsible Quality control person under supervision of Quality System/Quality Assurance ensuring appropriate documentation. 7. After compliance to administrative control procedure, the expired PPCP should be transferred to a segregated area under the control of Safety, Health and Environment department in the manufacturing location for undertaking disposal. Disposal Methods of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products Sorting of Materials: Materials to be disposed off should be segregated. Different methods are employed depending on Appendix 4639 NFI-2011i) Type of dosage forms- Tablets, Capsules, Creams, Ointments, Liquids, Ampoules, Vials, Intra- venous Antineoplastics/Anticancer, -Lactams, Hormones, Steroids, Anti-infective, Narcotics, Antiseptics and Psychotropic substances etc. Tertiary (Printed/Labelled Corrugated Boxes) and Secondary (Printed Cartons/Paper box) packaging materials are removed and destroyed with the help of heavy duty paper shredder. The methods of disposal of various pharmaceu-tical dosage forms and that of specific category medicines are mentioned below. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 1. Tablets/Capsules: Up to 50 tablets or capsules soak in about 100 ml of water and collect the same in a polyethylene bag containing used Tea/Coffee grind. Seal the bag and put in trash. Big quan - tity - Pulverize using heavy duty crusher. Collect in a poly bag and seal. Dispose it in high temperature incinerator (Temp. 850C to 1200C)/approved site for solid waste disposal by the Pollution Control Board of the State. 2. Injectables - ampoules/vials: Up to 50 Ampoules/Vials (up to 10 ml)-break ampoules/ open vials and collect liquid in a polyethylene bag containing used Tea/Coffee grind. Seal the bag and put in trash. For bigger quantity, use heavy duty crusher to separate liquid and dilute it with water and transfer it to Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) of the manufacturing unit. Broken glass/vials (after removal of label), rubber stop - pers and seals should be disposed off as scrap. Powder Injectables (in Vials/Ampoules) to be disposed off in an incinerator as indicated above. 3. Oral liquids and Intravenous fluids: Small quantity - Dilute the liquid with water and drain it. For bigger quantity, dilute collected liquid with water and transfer it to ETP of the manufacturing unit.Liquids with high solid contents to be disposed off in an incinerator as indicated above. 4. Semi solids: Small quantity, mix it with used Tea/Coffee grind in a polyethylene bag. Seal the bag and put in a trash. Deshape the containers/remove the label and discard the containers. Semisolids in bigger quantity to be disposed off in an incinerator mentioned earlier. Appendix 4640 NFI-2011Containers - Tubes to be deshaped and remove the label from glass/plastic container before disposal as a scrap. Specific categories: 1. Anti-infectives--lactams: Small quantity of all -lactam antibiotics to be destroyed by soaking in 1N Sodium Hydroxide for 30 mins or 1% Hydroxylamine in Water for 10 mins and trash. Bigger quantity to be disposed off in an incinerator (Temp. 850C to 1200C) indicated above. 2. Anti-infectives - others: Tetracyclines- Small quantity to be soaked in 10% of Calcium Hydroxide/any other Calcium salt in Water for 30 mins and trash. Macrolides- (Erythromycin, Clarithro- mycin etc.)-Small glycosides ( Gentamycin, Amikacin etc.) - Small quantity dilute with large volume of water and drain it. Bigger quantity of all the above anti-infective should be disposed of in an incinerator as mentioned above. 3. Steroids: Small quantity- Soak in 1N Sodium Hydroxide for 30 mins and trash. Bigger quantity- all dosage forms (taken out from the primary packing materials) to be incinerated at the temperature range indicated above. 4. Hormones: Small quantity- Aqueous solution to be exposed to UV for 20 minutes and trash. Estrogens- small quantity in aqueous solution should be exposed to ultrasound at 0.6 and 2 kw in a sonicator for 60 mins. and trash. Bigger quantity- all solid dosage forms (taken out from primary packaging materials) to be incinerated as indicated above. 5. Disinfectants: Small quantity- use it. Bigger quantity- Not more than 50L. Dilute with enough quantity of water to ensure dilution with loss of activity and drain it in ETP . 6. Controlled substances: Small quantity- Flush down the toilet to avoid misuse. Bigger quantity- All dosage forms (take out from primary packaging material) to be incinerated as mentioned above. Disposal by incineration is preferred over chemical inactiva-tion for all dosage forms/APIs.Appendix 4641 NFI-2011Cost of Disposal of Pharmaceutical Products: In India Solid Waste Disposal of PPCP at an approved solid waste disposal site by the local Pollution Control Board works out to Rs. 15 to 25 per kg. Disposal of PPCP by incineration requires about 5% of the fuel feed to that of the total quan- tity to be disposed of. Total cost of such disposal works out to about 0.5 % to 2% of the total sales. There is an urgent need to minimize this wastage on account of disposal of Unused/Expired Pharmaceutical products. This not only involves huge cost but also danger of contaminating water bodies, rivers, sea, air, land and aquatic lives, which ulti - mately get recycled and comes back to human beings, animals and vegetation in one or the other form. Reuse of Expired Pharmaceutical Products: In the event of Emergency situation, Regulatory Agencies do allow Revalidation, after Analysis of Expired Pharmaceu - tical Drug Products, if found satisfactory, for Human/Animal consumption. Reduction in Level of Disposal: Reduced level of disposal of PPCP can help significantly. If recovery of API (Active Pharmaceutical I ngredient) and purifi - cation there of, out of near expiry/expired PPCP be attempted and regulated, it will reduce the level of PPCP disposal. This will be a challenging task for pharmaceutical professionals, which will help industry in reducing quantum of disposal. Education and Training: Continuing education and training at every level is desirable to generate awareness of hazards associated with indiscrimi - nate disposal of unused/expired pharmaceutical products - an emerging environmental issue. It is expected that awareness of the stakeholders with system - atic preventive and corrective actions in time will ensure the safe disposal of unused/expired pharmaceutical products.Appendix 4642 NFI-2011Appendix 5: Drugs and Poisons Information Centres in India S.

The interactions may be potentiation or antagonism of one drug by another or occasionally some other effect. Drug interactions may be of pharmacokinetic or phar - macodynamic type. The pharmacokinetic interactions can be because of absorption mechanism, competition of two drugs at the protein binding sites, metabolizing enzyme system or excretion. When two or more drugs are concomitantly administered there is always a possibility of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction. The pharmacodynamic interactions can be at the receptor level for competition at same drug target (enzyme/receptor) acting synergistically or antagonizing the effect of each other. The drugs which have narrow therapeutic window have greater potential to cause unexpected adverse effect when their pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics is altered. In such situation, the following precautions are advisable: 1. Concomitant administration of drugs should possibly be avoided. 2. When unavoidable, care should be taken and TDM is recommended. 3. When TDM is not possible logistically, clinical symptoma-tology be done. 4. Careful dose titration (upward/downward) be done to get optimum dose modification. The following drug categories are considered as drugs of narrow therapeutic window: Antiepileptics, anticoagulants, anticancers, xanthenes, antide- pressants, antiarrhythmics relevant drug-drug interactions are listed below: ABCIXIMAB Anticoagulants Increased risk of bleeding Antiplatelet agents Increased risk of bleeding ACETAZOLAMIDE Carbamazepine Increased risk of hyponatraemia; acetazolamide increases toxicity of Increased risk of hypokalaemia Enhanced Phenytoin Increased risk of osteomalacia ACET y LSALIC y LIC ACID Corticosteroids Increased risk gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration; corticosteroids excretion of methotrexate (increased toxicity) Warfarin Increased risk of bleeding due to antiplatelet effect AL ENDRONATE Calcium supplements Reduced absorption of alendronate Antacids Reduced absorption of alendronate ALLOPURINOL Azathioprine Effects of azathioprine enhanced with increased toxicity; reduce dose when given with allopurinol Mercaptopurine Effects of 6-mercaptopurine enhanced with increased toxicity; reduce when given Warfarin, Antiplatelet agents Increased risk of NSAIDs of GI bleedingAppendix 6c650 NFI-2011AMILORIDE disturbance occurs Cisplatin Increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity Cyclosporine Increased risk of hyperkalaemia Enalapril of of of aminophylline.

These foods must be avoided.Appendix 6d701 NFI-2011Appendix 7a: Hepatic Impairment Dosing considerations in hepatic system plays an important role in the interac- tions between drugs and the body. Liver diseases can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs. However there has to be moderate to severe hepatic impair - ment to significantly alter the response to drugs as liver has a large reserve capacity. Hepatic impairment may alter response to drugs not only because of its role in metabolism of drugs but it also affects their absorption and distribution. Looking at the importance of liver in dealing with the drug, knowledge of a patient's hepatic function is required for the safe prescribing of many drugs. Unlike renal disease, where estimation of renal function based on creatinine clearance can fairly help in knowing the drug elimination and hence dose adjustment, there is no endogenous marker for hepatic clearance that can be used as a guide for drug dosing. Hepatic impairment can lead to altered response to drugs due to all or some of the following reasons: Metabolism of many drugs depend on adequate liver function. Generally, metabolism result in the loss of pharmacological activity and therefore reduced metabolism in case of impaired liver function can lead to the accumulation of drug in the body to the toxic level at the normal dose. However in some cases drugs are metabolised to the active form and in these drugs normal dose may not be able to achieve desired response. For drugs with low bioavailability (high hepatic extrac- tion), bioavailability increases and hepatic clearance decreases in cirrhotic patients. If such drug is to be administered orally to cirrhotic patients, their initial dose has to be reduced according to their hepatic extraction. For drugs with low bioavailability (low hepatic extraction), hepatic clearance may be affected due to impaired metabolism. For such drugs only the maintenance dose has to be adjusted according to esti-mated decrease in their hepatic metabolism. Portal hypertensive gastropathy and ulcers of upper gastrointestinal tract, frequently seen in cirrhotic patients may alter the absorption of orally adminis - tered drugs. Absorption of drugs may be increased because of high intestinal permeability in patients 702 NFI-2011with portal hypertension. Impaired gastrointestinal motility seen in cirrhotic patients can lead to delayed drug absorption Volume of distribution of hydrophilic drugs is increased due to presence of oedema and/or ascitis. Hence, loading dose of these drugs may have to be increased if a rapid action is required. On the other hand increase in volume of distribution is associated with an increase in the elimination half life of such drugs. Impaired elimination of drugs which are excreted in the bile can lead to their accumulation in the body. Impaired albumin production can lead to decreased protein binding and increased toxicity of highly plasma protein bound drugs. High percentage of drugs may reach systemic circu- lation without passing through liver due to develop - ment of portosystemic shunts in cirrhotic patients. Cirrhotic patients can often have impaired renal func - tion and in these cases dosage of the drugs have to be carefully adjusted. The use of certain drugs in patients with cirrhosis may increase the risk of hepatic decompensation. In patients with impaired liver function dose related hepatotoxic reaction may occur at lower doses. Drugs that cause fluid retention (for example, prednisolone, ibuprofen, dexamethasone etc.) may exacerbate oedema and ascitis in chronic liver disease. Sensitivity of brain to depressant action of some drugs( for example, morphine and barbiturates) is markedly increased in cirrhotic patients and can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy at normal doses. As evident from above, there is a complex interactions between the drugs and liver function. Absence of any endog-enous marker for hepatic clearance makes it highly difficult to accurately adjust the dose of various drugs in hepatic impairment. Therefore, if no immediate pharmacological effect is needed, drug therapy should be started cautiously in these patients and titrated individually until desired effect is achieved or toxicity appears. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic range and low hepatic extraction for e.g. theophylline are the most dangerous drugs. If such drugs are administered orally, both loading dose and maintenance doses have to be reduced by 50% of the normal dose, depending on the severity of hepatic impairment. The following table contains information to help prescribing Appendix 7a703 NFI-2011common drugs in hepatic impairment. The table provided is not exhaustive and abscence from this table does not imply safety of drug, it is therefore important to refer to the indi - vidual drug entries.Appendix 7a704 NFI-2011Drug Status in hepatic impairmentAvoid in moderate hepatic impairment unless essential Acetylsalicylic acid Avoid in severe hepatic impairmentIncreased risk of Gastrointestinal bleeding Allopurinol Reduce hepatic encephalopathy by causing constipation.

Some drugs inhibit lactation (for example, estrogens). Toxicity to the infant can occur if the drug enters the milk in pharmacologically significant quantities. The concentration in milk of some drugs (for example, iodides) may exceed that in the maternal plasma so that therapeutic doses in the mother may cause toxicity to the infant. Some drugs inhibit the infant's sucking reflex (for example, phenobarbital). Drugs in breast milk may, at least theoretically, cause hypersensitivity in the infant even when the concentration is too low for a pharma-cological effect. The following table lists drugs: which should be used with caution or which are contrain - dicated in lactation for the reasons given above; which are not known to be harmful to the infant although they are present in milk in significant amounts.For many drugs insufficient evidence is available to provide guidance and it is advisable to administer only drugs essential to a mother during lactation. Because of the inadequacy of information on drugs in breast milk the following table should be used only as a guide; absence from the table does not imply safety.711 NFI-2011Drug Comment Abacavir Lactation recommended during first 6 months if no safe alternative to breast milk Acetylsalicylic acid Short course safe in usual dosage;

It is important to remember this when prescribing for a woman of childbearing age. However, irrational fear of using drugs during pregnancy can also result in harm. This includes untreated illness, impaired maternal compliance, suboptimal treatment and treatment failures. Major congenital malformations occur in 2-4% of all live births, 15% of all diagnosed pregnancies will result in fetal loss. During the first trimester drugs may produce congenital malformations (teratogenesis), and the greater risk is from third to the eleventh week of pregnancy. During the second and third trimester, drugs may affect the growth and functional development of the fetus or have toxic effects on fetal tissues. Drugs given shortly before term or during labor may have adverse effects on labor or on the neonate after delivery. Few drugs have been shown conclusively to be teratogenic in man but no drug is safe beyond all doubt in early pregnancy. Screening procedures are available where there is a known risk of certain defects. Prescribing in Pregnancy Since, approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned and rest 50% are planned, if possible, counseling of women before a planned pregnancy should be carried out including discussion of risks associated with specific therapeutic agents, traditional drugs (alternative medicines), over the counter drugs and substances of abuse such as opioids, smoking, alcohol etc. Drugs should be prescribed in pregnancy only if the expected benefits to the mother are thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus. All drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester. Drugs which have been used extensively in pregnancy and appear to be usually safe should be prescribed in preference to new or untried drugs and the smallest effective dose should be used. Keeping in view the prevalence of irrational polypharmacy, emphasis should be laid on promoting the use of well known single component drugs to multicomponent drugs. Since, there does appear to be an association of very potent topical corticosteroids with low birth weight, even the dermatological drug products being used should be cautiously selected and used. The pronounced and progressive change in drug disposition that occurs during pregnancy is another major reason which calls for attention. Major physiological changes which influence drug disposition in mother and fetus are: S. No Physiologic changes Effects 1. Plasma albumin concentration of mother is reducedDrug protein binding alteration 2. Increased body fat in motherDistribution of drug is effected 3. Increased hepatic metabolism in motherFaster hepatic clearance721 NFI-20114. Increased cardiac output in motherIncreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration and hence, increased elimination of drug 5. Presence of placental barrierSelectivity of drug permeation based on its hydrophobicity or molecular weight of drug 6. Drug metabolizing enzymes activity in fetal liver is very lowSlow elimination of drugs by fetus Though maternal medication carry the risk of increase in the incidence of abortion, stillbirths, fetal death, premature or delayed labor or create perinatal problems; but certain medications like folic acid are recommended for all pregnant women to reduce the rate of congenital anomalies specifically, the neural tube defect. The Food and Drug Administration has categorized the drug risks to the fetus that runs from: \"Category A\" (safest) to \"Category X\" (known danger--do not use!) Category A Controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), and the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. Category B Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters). Category C Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Category D There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective). Category X Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities, or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.Appendix 7c722 NFI-2011Appendix 7d: Renal Impairment Dosing considerations in renal impairment The number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reduced renal function have been inexorably increasing. Reduced renal function may need adjustment in drug therapy as kidney plays a major role in the pharmacokinetics of a large number of drugs. Renal insufficiency frequently alters drug distribution volume. Edema and ascites increase the apparent volume of distribution of highly water-soluble or protein-bound drugs. Usual doses of such drugs given to edematous patients result in inadequate, low plasma levels. The alteration of plasma protein binding in patients with renal insufficiency is an important factor affecting both efficacy and toxicity. In patients with uremia the unbound fraction of several acidic drugs is substan-tially increased which may lead to serious toxicity. Although renal insufficiency is thought to affect primarily the renal elimination of drugs or metabo - lites, renal failure substantially affects drug biotrans- formation. Uremia slows the rate of reduction and hydrolysis reactions. Many active or toxic metabolites are produced during drug metabolism. Many of these metabolites depend on the kidneys for their removal from the body. The accumulation of active metabolites can explain in part the high incidence of ADRs seen in renal failure. A few points should be kept in mind while prescribing; Renal function declines with age so that by the age of 80 it is half that in healthy young subjects. It is advisable to determine renal function not only before but also during the period of treatment and adjust the maintenance dose as necessary. One should try to keep drug prescription to minimum. Nephrotoxic drugs should, if possible, be avoided in all patients with renal disease because the nephrotox - icity is more likely to be serious.723 NFI-2011One should stay alert for unexpected ADRs. The recommendations in the table below are meant only as a guide and do not imply efficacy or safety of a recommended dose in an individual patient. A loading dose equivalent to the usual dose in patients with normal renal function should be considered for drugs with a particularly long half-life. The table below gives the common drugs where in renal impairment dose adjustment is required. When the dose method (D) is suggested, the percentage of the dose for normal renal function is given and when the interval method (I) is suggested, the actual dose interval is provided.

This could be due to: (a) Single mutant gene or genetic polymorphism. (b) Polygenic influence. However the later is not of much significance in Clinical Prac- tice. Variations in drug responses amongst fraternal twins (dizygotic) may be relatively wide when compared to identical (monozygotic) twins. Importance of Pharmacogenetics lies in the development of new drugs from information available from human genome project. It aims at individualizing and improving precision of pharmacotherapy. When polymorphic DNA sequence variation occurs in the coding region or regulatory regions of genes, it causes varia-tion in gene product through alteration of activity, function or level of expression. The variation to drug response can also be brought about by: Metabolic variation Idiosyncratic reaction As an example metabolic variation can be best explained by the varied metabolic response exhibited to the antitubercular drug Isoniazid due to the presence of two different pheno - types in a population. These varied phenotypes are expressed as larger or smaller amount of enzyme N- acetylase in liver, and the population being termed as rapid acetylators and slow acetylators respectively.

The programme is being coordinated by the Indian Pharma - copoeia Commission, Ghaziabad as a National Coordination Centre (NCC). The mission of the programme is to ensure that the benefits of use of medicine outweigh the risk and thus safeguard the health of the Indian population. The PvPI has the following objectives : Monitoring Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in Indian popu - lation Creating awareness amongst health care professionals about the importance of ADR reporting in India Monitoring benefit-risk profile of medicines To generate independent, evidence-based recommenda-tions on the safety of medicines Support the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) for formulating safety related regulatory decisions for medicines. The PvPI is being supported by ADRs Monitoring Centres from across the country. This programme is on expansion mode by enabling more centres to join the reporting of ADRs to NCC and in turn to be linked up to Uppsala Monitoring Centre, WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring, Uppsala, Sweden. All stakeholders using this formulary are encouraged to report ADRs by downloading the Form (Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Form) either from the website of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (www.cdsco. nic.in) or the Indian Phar - macopoeia Commission (www.ipc. gov.in). Integrated efforts from the regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical industry and healthcare workers are necessary for the success and effec - tiveness of this programme. Therefore the active participa - tion of the all concerned in this programme will not only be useful for Indian health care system but also facilitate rational prescribing globally. A specimen form is attached at the end of the book.733 NFI-20117. 4 times a day 8. Take when needed 9. Take on empty stomach 10. Dispensed 11.

They may need to repeatedly refer to the instructions and they may still need help. For taking care of such patients, use of pictorial labe-ling is recommended. While there has not been any national standard of pictorial label adopted so far, based on a project by Delhi Pharmaceutical Trust, in collaboration with Apothecaries Foundation the following pictorial labels that were developed and used and found appropriate,are recommended for use. Such labels can be pre-printed using self-adhesive sticker label and made available in Pharmacies. Pharmacists should paste relevant pictorial label either on the bottle/pack of the drugs dispensed or on the prescription sheet against each drugs prescribed. Based on the most commonly needed instructions, 11 types of messages were identified and pictorial labels have been developed. More instructions if required can be added to this list and additional labels need to be developed. Pictorial Labels 1. Once Daily 2. 3 Times daily 3. Take at bed time 4. Take with meals 5.

Dosing considerations for the pediatric patient Determination of a safe and effective drug dose for the pedi - atric patient is essential for the treating physician. Doses and dosing intervals in children differ from that of an adult because of age-related variations in drug absorption, distri- bution, metabolism, and elimination. Oral drug absorption matures by four to five months of age. Drugs like phenytoin and chloramphenicol are absorbed slowly and erratically whereas penicillin and ampicillin are absorbed more effi- ciently than in the adults because of a higher gastric pH in the neonates. Most drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed at low levels at birth followed by postnatal induction of specific isoenzymes. For most drugs including phenytoin, barbiturates, digoxin and analgesics the plasma half lives are 2-3 times longer in neonates as compared to adults. Renal elimination of drugs is also reduced in the neonates. As a result, neonatal dosing regimens for a number of drugs must be reduced to avoid toxicity. Drug pharmacodynamics may also be different in children, for e.g. antihistamines and barbiturates that are generally sedative in adults may be excitatory in pediatric age group. Similarly, specific drug toxicities may be unique to this age group as evident in case of tetracyclines affecting teeth and glucocorticoids reducing linear growth of bones. Because of these maturational differences in infants and chil - dren, simple proportionate reduction in the adult dose may not be adequate to determine an optimal pediatric dose. The most reliable dose information is usually the one provided by the drug manufacturer in the package insert or pediatric doses listed in the formulary. However, such information is not avail - able for the majority of drugs since proper dose optimization studies are often not performed in the pediatric age range. Consequently, initial doses are derived by scaling down the dosages used in adults and then titrating according to clinical response. In the absence of specific pediatric dose recommendations, an estimate can be made by any of several methods based on age, weight, or surface area. 735 NFI-2011Age- based rules: Various rules of dosage in which the pediatric dose is a frac- tion of adult dose based on relative age have been used. Two of these are mentioned below. Young's rule (for children 2 years and older) Child's dose (approx.) =Age (years) x Adult dose Age(years) + 12 Fried's rule (for children up to 2 years old) Child's dose (approx.) =Age (months) x Adult dose 150 Weight based rule: Because of large variability in weight among children of same age group, estimation of drug dosage for children on the basis of body weight is considered more reliable than that based solely on age. A rule proposed by Professor A. J. Clark ( known as the Clark's rule) introduced weight proportional regimen for drug therapy. Child's dose (approx.) =Weight ( kg) x Adult dose 70 Body surface area based rule: The most dependable methods for calculation of pediatric drug doses are those based on body surface area (BSA). Rate of metabolism and redistribution of drug, organ size, blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, renal blood flow and assays of blood concentration of drugs correlate closely with the BSA. Child's dose (approx.) =Weight ( kg) x Adult dose 1.73 m2 For calculation of doses based on BSA, standard nomogram which includes both body weight and height as factors deter - mining BSA should be used. To calculate a child's BSA, draw a straight line from the height column to the weight column. The point at which the line intersects the surface area (SA) column is the BSA (m 2). If the child is of roughly normal proportion, BSA can be calculated from the weight alone (in the enclosed area).Appendix 13736 NFI-2011901.3080 701.20 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15Weight (lb) Surface area (square meters) 0.10 1.01.52.02.53.04.05.06.07.08.09.01015202530405060 24090180 160 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 18 16 14 12 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 32.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.180 70 60 50 40 30 20 15 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2220 200 190 180 170160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 3085 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 30 28 26 24 22 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12Height SA WeightNOMOGRAM For children of normal height for weightcm in./m lb kg m2 The above mentioned rules are helpful in situations requiring the use of a drug that is unlicensed in children and for which no pediatric prescribing information is available. However, these rules are not precise and doses should not be calculated if it is possible to obtain the actual pediatric dose. Whatever be the method chosen to calculate the child's dose, it should never exceed that of the adult.Note: This nomogram was published in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 18th Edition, Richard E.

Dosing considerations for the geriatric patient Aging is a natural process of human development and is char - acterized by a progressive loss of physiologic and reproductive functions. Altered response to drugs with aging occurs at both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels. Pharmacokinetic changes occur with the age as a result of the inevitable anatomical and physiological changes which occur with time, such as loss of an organ's functional units (neph - rons, neurons) and distruption of some regulatory processes between cells and organs, resulting in decrease in function of body systems. For example, first pass metabolism decreases due to decrease in liver mass and blood flow, resulting in an increase in bioavailability of drugs which undergo extensive first pass metabolism, for example, propranolol. Another example of a pharmacokinetic change is the reduced clear - ance of renally-cleared drugs due to reduced renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration. This increases the potential for toxic effects particularly with those drugs where even marginal accumulation can have toxic effects, for example digoxin and lithium. Changes in body composition such as increase in body fat proportion and decrease in total body water result in a decreased volume of distribution for water soluble drugs such as digoxin, which increases their serum concentrations and potential for adverse effects. Geriatric patients are much more \"sensitive\" to the action of many drugs, implying a change in the pharmacodynamic inter - actions of the drugs with their receptors. Elderly are more sensitive to some sedative-hypnotics and analgesics. Certain homeostatic control mechanisms appear to be blunted in elderly. Since homeostatic responses are often important components of the total response to a drug, these physiolog - ical alterations may change the pattern or intensity of drug response. The age-related changes in the functions and composition of the human body require adjustments of drug selection and dosage for old individuals. Drug excretion via the kidneys declines with age, the elderly should therefore be treated as renally insufficient patients. A rough estimate of creatinine clearance can be obtained from the Cockcroft-Gault formula: Creatinine clearance = ( ml/min)(140 - Age) x serum creatinine in mg/dL Appendix 13738 NFI-2011For females, the result is multiplied by 0.85. The formula is applicable to patients between the age of 40 and 80. The metabolic clearance is primarily reduced with drugs that display high hepatic extraction ('blood flow-limited metabo - lism'), whereas the metabolism of drugs with low hepatic extraction ('capacity-limited metabolism') usually is not diminished. Reduction of metabolic drug elimination is more pronounced in malnourished or frail subjects. The water content of the aging body decreases, the fat content rises, hence the distribution volume of hydrophilic compounds is reduced in the elderly, whereas that of lipophilic drugs is increased. Intestinal absorption of most drugs is not altered in the elderly. Aside of these pharmacokinetic changes, one of the characteristics of old age is a progressive decline in counterregulatory (homeostatic) mechanisms. Therefore drug effects are mitigated less, the reactions are usually stronger than in younger subjects, the rate and intensity of adverse effects are higher. Examples of drug effects augmented in this manner are, postural hypotension with agents that lower blood pressure, dehydration, hypovolemia, and electrolyte disturbances in response to diuretics, bleeding complications with oral anticoagulants, hypoglycemia with antidiabetics, and gastrointestinal irritation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The brain is an especially sensitive drug target in old age. Psychotropic drugs but also anticonvulsants and centrally acting antihypertensives may impede intellectual functions and motor coordination. The antimuscarinic effects of some antidepressants and neuroleptic drugs may be responsible for agitation, confusion, and delirium in elderly. Hence drugs should be used very restrictively in geriatric patients. If drug therapy is absolutely necessary, the dosage should be titrated to a clearly defined clinical or biochemical therapeutic goal starting from a low initial dose.Appendix 13739 NFI-2011Appendix 14: Storage of Drugs 1. Definition and Concept 1.1. Storage The term used to describe the safe keeping of all finished drugs and pharmaceuticals awaiting dispatch. The term is also applied for safe stores in hospitals and dispensaries under the specified conditions, so as to maintain their quality and potency. 1.2. Storage Conditions The condition specified for storing the product e.g. tempera- ture, humidity, container etc. 1.3. Quality The ability of drug product to satisfy the users need. 1.4. Dosage Form Refers to the gross physical form in which a drug is adminis - tered to or used by a patient. 1.5. Drug Product A dosage form containing one or more active therapeutic ingredients along with other substance included during manu - facturing process. 1.6. Finished Product A medicinal product which has completed all stages of manu - facture including packaging. 1.7. Strength The concentration of the drug substance (for example weight/weight, weight/volume or unit dose/volume basis) and the potency i.e. the therapeutic activity of the drug product as indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by adequately developed and controlled clinical data (expressed, for example in terms of units by reference to a standard). 1.8. Stability Degree of resistance to chemical and physical changes, the efficacy of the preparation must remain constant or change only within the limit specified by official compendia. 1.9. Expiration Date The date placed on the immediate container label of a drug product that designates the date through which the product is expected to remain within specifications. Kinetically it is the 740 NFI-2011time required for 10 % of the material to disappear. 2. Storage Procedure and Instructions Drugs must be stored under conditions which minimize dete - rioration, contamination or damage. They must be stored under conditions compatible with their recommended storage requirements of temperature and humidity and where neces - sary to comply with legal requirements, under secured or segregated conditions. Appropriate storage conditions are: Temperature or humidity controlled environment must be equipped with suitable indicators, recorders and/or failure warning devices which must be checked at appropriate inter - vals and the results are coded. Recording thermometers should be used. Temperature in uncontrolled storage prod - ucts should also be monitored. Temperature should be measured at different levels in the warehouse and if necessary storage of sensitive drugs should be restricted to locations in the warehouse where they will be protected from extreme conditions. Temperatures of the refrigerators, deep freezers, and Relative Humidity in humidity control area as well as general areas of storage at room temperature should be recorded on a daily basis. Storage conditions not related to temperature are indicated in following terms: Drug storage should be regularly checked for cleanliness and good order and for misplaced/deteriorated/out dated stock. All stocks should be checked regularly for obsolescence and degradation. Drugs with expired shelf life should be destroyed unless an extension of shelf life is granted following the satis-factory results or re-analysis. All due precautions should be observed to preclude issues of outdated Drugs. Some categories of supplies require special storage condi - tions which include vaccines, narcotics, and combustibles e.g. vaccines require both refrigerator and freezers. Narcotics and other controlled substances should be kept in secure locking rooms with only one entrance. The keys should be kept in a secure place, preferably a safe. Only the ware - house director and one another person should have access to them. 3. Inspection for Deterioration Pharmacists should be aware that deterioration of drug product may happen even before their expiration. This may occur perhaps due to improper storage or the fact that the product may require critical storage conditions not stated on Appendix 14741 NFI-2011the label. Hence inspection should include frequent product examination to detect signs of product deterioration which differ according to dosage form. Some examples, where deterioration may be physically detected are given here. The Pharmacists in the Stores should prepare an exhaustive list of following deterioration/spoilage indicators and keep them. 3.1. Liquid Dosage Forms Slight gradual discolouration, Swirly precipitation, Whickering: pin hole at ampoule tip that leaks solution which precipitate or crystalline solid matter, clouding, fading of colour, Cake sedimentation (suspension), Creaming and cracking (emul- sion), suppositories -Change in consist - ency and feel to touch, Phase separation, Discolouration, Surface crystal growth 3.3. Solid Dosage Forms Surface chipping or pitting (plain tablets), Deformation (capsules), Increased hardness, Discolouration, Colour fading (coloured tablets), Chipping of coat (coated tablets). Most vitamins, hormones enzymes are highly sensitive to oxidation and photo decomposition. The integrity of packaging of dosage form is one of the impor - tant tasks of inspection for pharmacist as these protect the drug in a tailored fashion. After each inspection, products showing any signs of instability should be subjected to sample analysis to ensure quality.Appendix 14742 NFI-20114. Drug Products Requiring Special Storage Conditions 4.1. Aerosols Aerosols should be stored in a clean separate area away from heat and sunlight because the container contents are under pressure, filled containers must be checked for weight loss over the expiration dating period, for contents under pres- sure. The label should display \"Do not expose to heat or store at a temperature above 40C, keep out of reach of children\". 4.2. Creams Creams can be destroyed under extreme temperature fluctua - tions hence they should be stored at temperature above 10oC and not exceeding 30C. If the creams are opened and diluted they should not be kept for more than 14 days to avoid micro- bial contamination. 4.3. Ophthalmic Solutions and Drops They should be stored according to the conditions specified on the label. After opening they should not be used for more than one month at home and not more than 15 days in hospitals. 4.4. Capsules Extremes of humidity and temperature should be avoided. High humidity (> 60% RH) at 21C to 24C produce more lasting effects. Capsules become softer, tackier and blotted. If temperature is increased the capsule shells may melt and fuse together. High temperature (>40C) in dry place may cause cracking of capsule shell therefore capsules should be stored in air-conditioned area in which the humidity does not exceed 45% RH at 21 to 24C. 4.5. Suppositories Suppositories should be protected from heat and preferably stored in the refrigerator. Polyethylene glycol supposito-ries and suppositories enclosed in solid shell are less prone to distortion at temperature slightly above body tempera- ture. Glycerinated gelatin suppositories should be protected from heat, moisture and dry air by packaging in well sealed containers and storing in a cold place. 4.6. Vaccines Liquid vaccines are to be stored between 2 - 8C and should not be frozen. All lyophilized vaccines should be stored between 2 - 8C and for long term storage can be kept at or below -20C or otherwise as specified in the individual mono - graphs. Oral polio should be stored in a freezer -2 to -18C. Appendix 14743 NFI-20115. Communicating the Prescription to the Patient It is important that the drugs reach the patient in good and potent conditions and the patient should know and under - stand fully how to keep them till they are consumed. It is equally important that the patient should know the way each medicine is used. This will improve compliance and health outcome desired by the physician. Communicating how and where to store the drugs to the Patient: The following table may be used to guide and provide infor - mation on the way to store the drugs when they are dispensed to the patients. This is based on the recommended storage conditions as given on the labels of the drug products and Indian Pharmacopoeial notes in the General Chapters. On the label Meaning Tell the Patient/ Representative of the Patient Do not store over 8CTo be stored in refrigerator (from +2C to +8C Keep in the General Compartment of the refrigerator and do not keep in the place where you make Ice. Do not store over 30 C To be stored at room temperature (from +2C to +30C)Keep in any part of the house, except in Bath room/Kitchen. Do not keep near or in the window area. Do not freezeTo be kept in refrigerator (from +2C to +8C but not in the freezer chamber)Keep in the General Compartment of the refrigerator and do not keep in the place where you make Ice. Protect from moistureTo be stored in normal humidity at room temperature (RH less than 60%); to be provided by the manufacturer in a moisture-resistant containerThe manufacturer would have provided such products in a moisture-resistant container/or packages. Keep in any part of the house, except in Bath room/Kitchen. Do not keep near or in the window area. Appendix 14744 NFI-2011Protect from lightTo be stored in a light-resistant cupboard/drawer; to be provided by the manufacturer in a light-resistant container.The manufacturer would have provided such drug products in a light-resistant container/package. Keep in a cupboard/drawer or in a box with lid closed, in any part of the house, except in Bath room/Kitchen or near or in the window area. Transit period care and Use of Cool Packs: It is equally important to ensure that patients who carry drugs requiring special storage conditions like anti-cancer drugs, several types of insulins, vaccines, sera, toxoids, would need to carry them in cold conditions till they reach the place where they will keep for some time before usage or to another hospital/nursing home till it is administered. In such cases during transit they need to be packed in \"Thermo cool boxes with lid\", (#) with the drug product packs kept surrounded by adequate number of \"Cool Packs\".(#) \"Cool Packs are avail - able which come ready filled with such special liquid in sealed bags or plastic packs, which on keeping overnight in freezer compartment of a refrigerator becomes solid ice. Such packs help in keeping the drug products in the box retain tempera-tures below 8C for as much as 8 to 10 hours, which is gener - ally adequate for transit protection. In case such cool packs are not available, it is recommended to use normal \"Hot cases\" (#) that people use to carry food, but stuffing the inside of the hot case boxes with sufficient ice cubes surrounding the drug packs kept inside, and the hot case suitably closed and sealed with sealing tapes. Cool packs can also be made by packing sufficient ice cubes into suitable sized self sealing polybags. (#) Several Pharmacists are known to innovate this way and they do serve for short transit times of up to one to two hours.Appendix 14745 NFI-2011Appendix 15: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is defined as measure - ment of drug levels in the biological fluids usually blood (serum or plasma). It has been carried out in saliva, urine, sweat, tear fluids etc also. It is carried out for specific drugs at various time intervals in order to maintain a relatively constant concentra-tion of the particular drug in the bloodstream and to optimize drug therapy. The main focus of TDM is on drugs with narrow therapeutic range. Apart from this, it also plays a significant role for drugs having large inter-individual variations; rela-tively toxic drugs used in concomitant disease conditions, for escalation of dose, drugs showing wide variation in their metabolism, major organ failure, poisoning cases, failure of therapeutic response, to enhance patient compliance, etc. It is very important in such situations in which the drugs are to be taken on chronic or life long basis (chronic disease conditions such as bipolar disorder, organ transplant rejection, neurolog - ical disorders etc.). The timing and frequency of blood collec - tion after the medication and correct interpretation of results of analysis and their correlation with clinical features ensures the best therapeutic outcome. Indications for drug monitoring: Drugs whose efficacy is difficult to establish clinically, like Phenytoin. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Examples: Lithium, phenytoin, digoxin. Patients who have impaired clearance of a drug with a narrow therapeutic index. Example: Patients with renal failure have decreased clearance of digoxin and therefore are at a higher risk of toxicity. Drugs whose toxicity is difficult to distinguish from a patient's underlying disease. Example: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with theophylline. When not to do TDM 1. Drugs whose pharmacological effects can easily be used to dose titration, like oral hypoglycemic agents, anti-hypertensive drugs. 2. When easier and/or cheaper methods/alternatives to TDM are available to titrate the drug like International normalized ratio(INR) for warfarin.746 NFI-2011Time of sample collection 1. Sample should be collected after steady state has been reached (5 half lives), unless TDM is intended to predict toxicity after single dose. 2. Usually \"trough\" concentrations are measured by taking the sample just before the subsequent dose. 3. Drugs whose half-lives are much shorter than the dosing interval, the peak and trough levels may be indicated to evaluate the dosage of drugs. Example: Gentamicin TDM could be affected because of one or more of the factors relating to pharmacokinetics of the drug, or drug administra-tion, or sample collection. Renal and hepatic alterations to half-life must also be considered. Laboratory variations also affect the TDM. The folowing table summarizes the therapeutic concentration range of various drugs Table: Important drugs requiring therapeutic monitoring S. NoPharmacological categoryDrugs Therapeutic drug conc. range 1. Drugs acting on information regarding individual variations in drug utilization patterns as a consequence of altered physiological state or disease process and thus provides the clinician a better insight into the factors determining the patient's response to drug therapy.Appendix 15748 NFI-2011Index A 661, 4, 239, 281, 317, 643, 698 Actinomycin D 248 Activated Charcoal 84 Acute bronchitis 147
