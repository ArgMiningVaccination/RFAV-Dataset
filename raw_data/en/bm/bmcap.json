To make vaccination recommendations, healthcare providers should: - Determine needed vaccines based on age ( [Table 1](#birth-15)) - Determine appropriate intervals for catch-up, if needed ( [Table 2](/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/catchup.html)) - Assess for medical conditions and other indications ( [Table 3](/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html)) - Review special situations ( [Vaccination and precautions to [Appendix](#appendix)) Parent-friendly schedules [Vaccines your child may need](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/childquiz/): Get a personalized list of recommended vaccines Legend |Range of recommended ages for all children||Range of recommended ages | for catch-up vaccination |Range of recommended ages for certain high-risk groups||Recommended vaccination can begin in this age group||Recommended vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making||No recommendation/Not Years |Vaccines||18 | mos |19-23 | mos |2-3 | yrs |4-6 | yrs |7-10 | yrs |11-12 | yrs |13-15 | yrs |16 | yrs |17-18 Administer recommended vaccines if immunization history is incomplete or unknown. Do not restart or add doses to vaccine series for extended intervals between doses. When a vaccine is not administered at the recommended age, administer at a subsequent visit. The use of trade names is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the ACIP or CDC. Notes For vaccination recommendations for persons ages 19 years or older, see the [Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule](/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html), 2023. Additional information - Consult relevant ACIP statements for detailed [recommendations](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/). - For calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days. Intervals of 4 months are determined by calendar months. - Within a number range (e.g., 12-18), a dash (-) should be read as \"through.\" - Vaccine doses administered 4 days before the minimum age or interval are considered valid. Doses of any vaccine administered 5 days earlier than the minimum age or minimum interval should not be counted as valid and should be repeated as age-appropriate. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval. For further details, see [Table 3-2](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html#t-02), Recommended and minimum ages and intervals between vaccine doses, in [General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html). - Information on travel vaccination requirements and recommendations is available at [https://www.cdc.gov/travel/](https://www.cdc.gov/travel/). - For vaccination of persons with immunodeficiencies, see [Table 8-1](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/immunocompetence.html#t-01), Vaccination of persons with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, in [General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/immunocompetence.html), Immunization in Special Clinical Circumstances (In: Kimberlin DW, Barnett ED, Lynfield Ruth, Sawyer MH, eds.

Itasca, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics; 2021:72-86). - For information about vaccination in the setting of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak, contact your state or local health department. - The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a no-fault alternative to the traditional legal system for resolving vaccine injury claims. All vaccines included in the child and adolescent vaccine schedule are covered by VICP except for dengue, PPSV23 and COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized or approved by the FDA are covered by the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP).
