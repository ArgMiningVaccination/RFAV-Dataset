We seek to nourish a love of learning, a creative spirit, and an informed and responsible engagement with an ever-changing world. To promote these qualities, the College challenges all of its students to work with their advisors to devise an educational program that fosters: Intellectual Curiosity and Flexibility \u2014 examining facts, phenomena and issues in depth, and from a variety of perspectives, and having the courage to revise beliefs and outlooks in light of new evidence Analytic Discernment \u2014 analyzing information, patterns, connections, arguments, ideas, and views quantitatively and symbolically Aesthetic Discernment \u2014 evaluating quality and value in a variety of artistic and other intellectual domains Disciplinary Practice \u2014 engaging in the focused and sustained practice of disciplinary techniques and methodologies in order to acquire mastery of a specific ability or craft Creativity \u2014 imagining and developing original ideas, approaches, works and interpretations, and solving problems resourcefully Communication and Expression \u2014 expressing oneself with clarity and eloquence, in both traditional and contemporary media, through writing and speaking, and through visual, aural, gestural and other modalities Understanding of Cultural Diversity \u2014 critically engaging with multiple cultural traditions and perspectives, and with interpersonal situations that enhance understanding of different identities and foster the ability to work and live productively and harmoniously with others Ethical, Informed and Engaged Citizenship \u2014 developing an awareness of the challenges and responsibilities of local, national and global citizenship, and the ability to meet such challenges and fulfill such responsibilities by exercising sound and informed judgment in accordance with just principles In pursuing these goals, students should progress meaningfully along a path toward fulfilling their potential for being thoughtful, responsible and purposeful individuals with the capacity to make a positive difference in the world. A Liberal Arts Education at Hamilton College I. Foundations The faculty expects that students will attain a high level of engagement early in their studies and will develop as creative and critical thinkers, writers and speakers. To achieve these aims, the College requires students to complete the Writing and Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning programs. The Writing Program: Students must pass at least three writing-intensive courses. The Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning Program: Every student must pass at least one designated quantitative and symbolic reasoning course. This requirement should be completed by the end of the second year. 4 The Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies Requirement: Beginning with the Class of 2020, every student must complete a concentration requirement that will focus on an understanding of structural and institutional hierarchies based on one or more of the social categories of race, class, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexuality, age, and abilities/disabilities. In addition, the College encourages students to participate in the First-Year Course and Proseminar programs. The First-Year Course Program: First-year courses are a special set of small courses or sections of courses open only to first-year students. These courses are designed to address students' academic transition to college and to provide an introduction to a liberal arts education. They also offer an opportunity for close interaction and the development of strong relationships among first-year students and instructors. Each first-year course will be a Writing Intensive (WI), Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) or Speaking Intensive (SI) course. The Proseminar Program: Proseminars emphasize active participation and engagement in learning. Proseminars offer intensive interaction among students, and between students and instructors, through emphasis on writing, speaking, and discussion, and other approaches to inquiry and expression that demand such intensive interaction. Descriptions of proseminars are available in the online Catalogue. II. Breadth in the Liberal Arts As a liberal arts college, Hamilton expects students to undertake coursework in a wide variety of disciplines, to explore areas unfamiliar to them and to make connections across courses and disciplines. A liberally educated person studies in the traditional academic divisions of the arts, foreign languages, the humanities, mathematics, the sciences and the social sciences. Hamilton also emphasizes cultural analysis, including the study of non-western traditions and of diversity in the United States. Students will work with their advisors to determine how best to achieve this intellectual balance. III. Concentration Each student must meet the requirements for a concentration, including a requirement that will help students gain an understanding of structural and institutional hierarchies based on one or more of the social categories of race, class, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexuality, age, and abilities/disabilities. IV. Senior Program All students are required to complete the Senior Program in their concentrations as a means of demonstrating an appropriate level of mastery of the content and methods of a discipline. Each department and program of concentration has designed a senior program that serves as an integrating and culminating experience for the concentration. Building on their courses and showing their increasing ability to work independently in terms of both motivation and subject matter, seniors are required to produce a significant synthesis of knowledge by means of one of the following: a research project leading to a written, aural or visual creation; a seminar for concentrators, including a major presentation and research paper by each student; or comprehensive examinations ideally involving both written and aural components. Students make progress toward meeting these goals by studying broadly across diverse areas of inquiry, guided by their advisors, and investigating a particular area of study more thoroughly by completing a concentration of their choosing. A faculty advisor assigned to each student provides information, advice and dialogue about choice of courses as the student strives to meet these goals. For many faculty members and students, this relationship will be as important as any they form. As the primary intellectual guide, the faculty determines the fundamental structure and the basic requirements of the curriculum in light of the liberal arts tradition and its appropriate adaptation to the contemporary world. In sum, our mission is to provide an educational experience that emphasizes academic excellence and the development of students as human beings, as we prepare them to make choices and accept the responsibilities of citizenship in a democratic world of intellect and diversity. 5 Academic Information The College Year The College's calendar consists of two 14-week semesters. Students will normally elect four full-credit courses each semester to meet the minimum graduation requirement of 32 credits. Academic Advising The College relies heavily on a system of academic advising to assist students as they establish their academic goals and select courses. Each advisor is a member of the faculty with a term of service beyond one year. Although students ultimately decide which courses to take, their advisors help them determine the level and sequence of courses appropriate to their needs and guide them in planning a balanced four-year program. Each first-year student is assigned a faculty advisor who provides guidance during the first and second years. In the second semester of the second year, students elect their concentration, after which time advising becomes the responsibility of a faculty member in the student's field of study. Concentrations Among the requirements for graduation is the successful completion of a concentration (major) offered by several departments and programs of instruction. The number of courses comprising a concentration normally ranges from eight to 10. Every student is required to complete a senior program as defined by his or her concentration. Areas of Study Africana Studies American Studies Anthropology Arabic** Art Art History Asian Studies Astronomy* Biochemistry/Molecular Biology Biology Chemical Physics Chemistry Chinese Cinema and Media Studies Classics Communication* Computer Science Creative Writing Dance and Movement Studies Digital Arts* Economics Education Studies* English Environmental Studies Foreign Languages French and Francophone Studies Geoarchaeology Geosciences German Studies Government Greek: See Classics Hebrew** Hispanic Studies 6 History Interdisciplinary Concentration Italian** Japanese* Jurisprudence, Law, and Justice Studies* Latin: See Classics Latin American Studies* Linguistics* Literature and Creative Writing Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies* Middle East and Islamic World Studies* Music Neuroscience Philosophy Physics Psychology Public Policy Religious Studies Russian Studies Sociology Spanish Theatre Women's and Gender Studies World Politics * Minor only ** Not offered as a major or minor Senior Program All students are required to complete the Senior Program in their concentrations. Each department and program of concentration has designed a senior program that serves as an integrating and culminating experience for the concentration. Students use the methodology and knowledge gained in their first three years of study. Building on their courses and showing their increasing ability to work independently in terms of both motivation and subject matter, seniors are required to produce a significant synthesis of knowledge by means of one of the following: a research project leading to a written, oral or visual creation; a seminar for concentrators, including a major presentation and research paper by each student; or comprehensive examinations ideally involving both written and oral components. This requirement allows seniors to demonstrate at an appropriate level their mastery of content and the methods of the discipline. Senior Fellowship Program Each spring, the vice president for academic affairs/dean of faculty designates up to seven academically outstanding members of the junior class as senior fellows. Students in the junior year may become candidates by submitting a proposal for a senior year of independent study. Senior fellows are exempt from taking a normal course load in the conventional curriculum, and they need not complete concentration requirements; they may take such courses as are appropriate to their fellowship projects and their educational goals. A written thesis is required at the close of the fellowship year, along with a public lecture to the College community. Evaluation is made by the advisors and an examination committee. Study Abroad Programs Hamilton students may gain approval to study abroad in their junior year, though occasionally students are allowed to study abroad in the spring of the sophomore year or fall of the senior year. The College sponsors or is affiliated with its own study abroad programs in China, France, Spain and India. In addition, students may also select from more than 100 programs throughout the world. Hamilton's programs in the Adirondacks, New York City, Washington, D.C., and at the New England Center for Children in Boston provide students with 7 opportunities to combine rigorous academic preparation with practical experience within the United States. (See individual webpages on the hamilton.edu site for more information on those programs underlined above.) Cooperative and Affiliated Programs Hamilton has established cooperative arrangements with several institutions to expand educational opportunities for students. Several instances are described below. Students enrolled in cooperative programs receive a Hamilton degree only upon demonstrating to the department in which they concentrate that they have fulfilled concentration requirements and have satisfied the goals of the College. If the concentration requirements have not been met by the end of the junior year, they may, with the approval of the department, be completed at the cooperative institution. American Council of Teachers of Russian Undergraduate Program \u2014 Hamilton has been designated as a host institution for students from the Russian Federation and other nations of the former Soviet Union. Each academic year, one or more Russian students will have the opportunity to study at Hamilton. In the past the College has hosted students from Kazan, Voronezh, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Almaty, Everan, and numerous other cities in the New Independent States (NIS). The program is funded by the United States Information Agency and the governments of the NIS. Assurance of Admission: Master of Arts in Teaching \u2014 As a result of an agreement with Union Graduate College, well qualified Hamilton students can gain assurance of admission to Union Graduate College's Master of Arts in Teaching Program. The M.A.T. degree will normally require two summers and one academic year in residence at Union College, and carries with it secondary school teaching certification. Students interested in pursuing this option should contact Chaise Ladousa, chair of the Education Studies Program Committee, preferably no later than the fall semester of their junior year. Cooperative Engineering Program \u2014 Liberal arts-engineering (3-2) plans are in effect with Columbia University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Washington University in St. Louis, whereby the student spends three years at Hamilton and then two years at the cooperating engineering school. At the end of this period, the student earns an A.B. from Hamilton and a B.S. from the engineering school. Hamilton also offers access to a combined plan at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. This program is on a 2-1-1-1 schedule. The student completes two years at Hamilton, the junior year as a visiting student at Dartmouth and returns to Hamilton to complete the senior year and to earn the A.B. The student then returns to Dartmouth to finish the second year of engineering studies and to receive a degree in engineering. Admission to these programs in the traditional divisions of chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, and now many others such as biomedical, computer and environmental engineering, is based on obtaining a G.P.A. of 3.0, or a B average, and the positive recommendation of the Department of Physics. Various 4-2 plans lead to different degree options. For details, consult with the engineering advisor, Professor Gordon Jones, in the Department of Physics. Cooperative Law Program \u2014 The Hamilton cooperative law program permits highly qualified students to enter the Columbia University School of Law after completion of their junior year. The program in Accelerated Interdisciplinary Legal Education permits these students to earn both the Hamilton baccalaureate degree and the Columbia juris doctor degree after three years of study at each institution. Interested students should consult Douglas Ambrose in the Department of History no later than the first semester of their junior year. Direct Admission MBA Program \u2014 Under a direct admission agreement with the William E. Simon School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester, Hamilton will recommend students who are especially well prepared to proceed directly to the MBA program upon earning their undergraduate degree. Drawing on the College's recommendations, the Simon School will select candidates, preferably by the end of their Hamilton junior year, who have demonstrated above average maturity and strong academic preparation, regardless of undergraduate major. The Simon School will evaluate candidates through a priority interview with a Simon School graduate or a member of the admissions committee. The application fee will be waived. Hamilton students admitted to the Simon School by direct admission should complete business-related summer internships or work experience, or both, during their undergraduate years. The Simon School will provide 8 counseling and support to identify pre-MBA internships and offers merit-based support. For more information about direct admission with the Simon School, see Ann Owen in the Economics Department. Early Assurance Program in Medicine \u2014 A handful of medical schools in New York State allow highly qualified students to submit an application after their sophomore year, gaining assurance of a place in a specific medical school after they graduate from Hamilton. In recent years, Hamilton students have submitted early assurance applications to Albany Medical College, University of Buffalo School of Medicine and Upstate Medical University College of Medicine. Students who intend to apply through the early assurance program complete six of the eight semesters of required science courses by the end of the sophomore year and submit a record of strong standardized testing from high school in lieu of the MCAT. The early assurance option is intended for students who have thoroughly explored their career choices and whose undergraduate plans include foreign study or other educational opportunities that will enhance personal development but preclude the more typical premedical calendar. Although the early assurance program may reduce the pressure that premedical students sometimes experience, its primary purpose is to allow students to access the wide-ranging educational opportunities offered by Hamilton. Additional information may be obtained from Leslie Bell, health professions advisor. MBL Semester in Environmental Science \u2014 Hamilton is an affiliated institution with the Semester in Environmental Science of the Marine Biological Laboratory Ecosystem Center in Woods Hole. Participants engage in a 14-week program of rigorous field and laboratory work, lectures and independent research in environmental and ecosystem science. For additional information, contact Todd Rayne in the Environmental Studies Program. SEA Education Association \u2014 Hamilton is an affiliated institution of the SEA semester program in Woods Hole, Mass. The shore component includes courses in oceanography, nautical science and maritime studies. The sea component includes six weeks aboard ship learning skills and conducting research. A student may receive a maximum of four Hamilton units of transferred credit for participation in the SEA program. Each award is conditional on the student's earning a grade of C or higher. Study at Neighboring Institutions \u2014 With appropriate approval (see \"Transfer of Credit\" under \"Academic Regulations\"), a Hamilton student may take coursework toward the baccalaureate degree at neighboring institutions during the fall and spring semesters. In recent years students have enrolled at Colgate University and Utica College. Usually one course is taken at a neighboring institution while the rest of the work is done at Hamilton. Students with Disabilities Students with learning disabilities may request special arrangements for academic activities. These students must provide to the Associate Dean of Students for Multicultural Affairs and Accessibility (\"Associate Dean\") with recent documentation from a qualified professional with expertise in the appropriate field. The documentation should include a specific diagnosis, information regarding onset, longevity and severity of symptoms, evidence of how the disability and/or related medications and treatments interfere with or limit any major life activity (for example, participation in the courses, programs and activities of the College), recommended accommodations, and an explanation regarding why the recommended accommodations are needed. The associate dean will use the information provided and consult with faculty and qualified professionals, as needed, to help student develop a system of support \u2014 appropriate to his/her needs. Requests for accommodations should be made in advance of the start of each semester (by July 1st for fall enrollment and January 1st for spring enrollment). To notify the College of a disability and request accommodations, contact the Associate Dean of Students for Multicultural Affairs and Accessibility Services, Hamilton College, Clinton, NY, 13323 (phone: 315-859-4021). 9 Academic Regulations Requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree To qualify for the baccalaureate degree, a student must meet the degree requirements established by the faculty for the class in which he or she has matriculated. Honor Code Matriculation at Hamilton is contingent upon a student's written acceptance of the Honor Code regulations. The code covers all coursework and course examinations at Hamilton during a student's college career. Complaints alleging violations of the Honor Code shall be submitted in writing by instructors or students to the chair of the Honor Court or to the associate dean of students (academics). Course Units The number of full-credit courses (or the equivalent) required for graduation is 32. They must be completed with passing grades; a grade of C- or higher must be achieved in at least one-half of the courses taken at Hamilton. No more than 15 course credits in a single department earned after entering the College, including transferred credits, may be counted toward the courses required for graduation. Each unit of credit is equivalent to four semester hours. Residence A student must complete at least one-half of the courses required for graduation while in residence at Hamilton and be in residence for the final semester of study. Residence means enrollment in programs conducted by the College, on or off campus. Time for Completion of the Degree The normal pattern for earning the baccalaureate degree is four consecutive years of study. The requirements must be completed within seven calendar years from the date of matriculation. Concentration A student must complete the requirements for a regular concentration, a double concentration or an interdisciplinary concentration with a cumulative average of at least 1.7 in all courses taken at Hamilton that are approved for the concentration. Seniors must take at least one course each semester in their concentrations unless granted an exemption by the department or program chair. All students must complete the Senior Program in their concentrations. Each student elects a concentration in the second semester of the sophomore year. For each student the requirements for the concentration elected are those specified in the edition of the College Catalogue published for that student's sophomore year. Regular Concentration \u2014 Students declare their concentrations in the spring of their second year, before preregistration for fall semester courses. By the end of the second year, a student must have completed at least two courses in the department or program of concentration, and must have received a cumulative average of 1.7 or higher for all work taken in that department or program. The concentration is listed on the official transcript. A student may change from one concentration to another only with the approval of the departments or programs involved and the Committee on Academic Standing. Double Concentration \u2014 While students normally declare a single concentration, it is possible for a student to complete and gain recognition for concentrations in two departments or programs, provided that approval to elect a double concentration is granted by the department or program chairs involved. A student may not count a course as part of the concentration requirements in more than one department or program. When approved, both concentrations are listed on the official transcript. Those who have been granted permission for a double concentration may drop one of them at any time by informing the appropriate department chair and the registrar. A student who declares a double concentration may not also declare a minor. 10 Interdisciplinary Concentration \u2014 A student may design and declare an interdisciplinary concentration involving two or more departments. After consulting with and gaining approval from the appropriate department chairs, the student must submit the proposed interdisciplinary concentration in writing for approval by the Committee on Academic Standing, which will evaluate the proposal according to standards similar to those for a regular concentration. The student must have a cumulative average of at least 1.7 in all courses approved for the concentration. The student must specify a Senior Program that meets the approval of the committee. Regular Concentration with Option of One or Two Minors \u2014 A student with a concentration in a single department or program may declare a minor in one or two other departments or programs that offer a minor, or in an interdisciplinary minor program previously approved by the Committee on Academic Policy. Students declaring a minor must consult with and gain the written approval of the appropriate department or program chair. Declaration of a minor in the same department or program as the student's concentration requires approval of the Committee on Academic Standing. To enter a minor, a student must have completed at least one course in the discipline and must have earned a cumulative average of at least 1.7 in all courses counting toward the minor. This average must be maintained if the minor is to be listed along with the concentration on the official transcript. A minor consists of five courses as approved by the department, program or committee under which the work is undertaken. A student may not count any course as part of both a concentration and a minor, or as part of two minors. See \"Hamilton College Calendar\" for deadlines to declare a minor. Senior Program All students must complete a Senior Program in their concentrations. Standards for Written Work The College requires satisfactory standards of correctness in all written work. Students are encouraged to take writing-intensive courses, which are offered by most departments and programs. Writing-intensive courses include any so designated by the Committee on Academic Policy. The description of each course indicates whether it is writing-intensive. The Writing Program requires that every student pass at least three writing-intensive courses, each taken in a different semester. One must be taken during the first year of study and a second completed by the end of the second year. This requirement should be completed by the end of the junior year. Writing-intensive courses in mathematics or courses in which assignments are written in a language other than English may count for no more than one of the three required courses. In exceptional circumstances, the Committee on Academic Standing will allow a student to earn no more than one writing-intensive credit by completing a suitably constructed independent study. At least one course must be outside the student's area of concentration. Standards for Oral Communication The College requires effective use of public and academic discourse as defined and appraised by the faculty and the College community. Many courses across the curriculum, including proseminars and seminars, require class participation through discussion, performance and debate, as well as through individual or group presentations. Most departments require a public presentation of their concentrators' Senior Projects. Students may develop their speaking abilities and public presence through courses designated as \"Speaking Intensive\" (SI). Course descriptions found in the online catalogue include \"Oral Presentation\" if an instructor has designated a course as such. Students who experience difficulty in meeting the College's expectations for effective oral communication are encouraged to pursue a plan for progress in consultation with their instructors, advisor and/or associate dean of students (academic). Standards for Quantitative Work Hamilton expects that every student will demonstrate facility in quantitative and symbolic reasoning by completing one or more courses in at least one of the following three categories: 1. Statistical Analysis. The use of statistical analysis to describe data and to make inferences. 11 2. Mathematical Representation. The use of mathematical models such as those based on graphs, equations and geometric objects to represent patterns, relationships and forms. 3. Logic and Symbolic Reasoning. The use of formal logic or symbolic reasoning such as in the following examples: the proper construction of a computer program or a formal proof; the analysis of language in linguistics; or the study of music theory. Courses across the curriculum that fulfill this requirement are described as Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning courses under Courses of Instruction. They are also listed online in Web Advisor and in the printed course schedule booklet distributed before each registration period. The College offers tutoring in the area of quantitative and symbolic reasoning through the Quantitative & Symbolic Reasoning Center and the Peer Tutoring Program. This requirement should be fulfilled by the end of the second year at Hamilton. Physical Education Requirement Every student must participate in the program of instruction offered by the Physical Education Department. Each student is required to pass tests in swimming and physical fitness. A complete specification of the requirement is stated in the \"Physical Education\" section. Instruction is available in badminton, fitness, golf, jogging, lifeguard training, power walking, racquetball, skating, squash, swimming, tennis, toning, volleyball and yoga. Except under unusual circumstances, it is expected that the requirement will be completed in the first year. All students must complete the physical education requirement by the beginning of Spring Break of the sophomore year and before studying away. Transfer students and January admits should register for a physical education course upon matriculation and consult with the department chair about completion of the requirement. Prior instruction may be applicable to Hamilton requirements Conferral of Degrees All qualified students receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts, which is conferred once a year at the graduation ceremony. The degrees are conferred only upon students who have completed all the baccalaureate requirements described above, who have no outstanding bills at the College and who are present to receive their diplomas (unless they have requested and received authorization from the Committee on Academic Standing for conferral in absentia). Only students who have completed all the requirements for the degree may participate in the graduation ceremony. Course Election and Exams Course Election Both Hamilton's commitment to excellence and its need to operate within its resources have implications for course enrollment policy. Except for independent studies and courses with limited enrollments, a student shall be free to elect, during the calendar periods for registration, any course for which the prerequisites have been met. However, a senior who desires to elect a 100-level course must first obtain permission from the instructor. Full-time students normally elect courses equal to four credits during both the fall and spring semesters. During each of these semesters, students may carry no more than five, and no fewer than three, full-credit courses. Any exception must be approved by the Committee on Academic Standing. Part-time study at Hamilton is available only to special students and to those participating in the Hamilton Horizons Program. Course Changes for Fall and Spring Semesters A student may change (add or drop) courses during the first five calendar days of the fall and spring semesters after consultation with the advisor. An add/drop form must be completed and returned to the Registrar's Office within the five-day period. Classes may not be added after the first week without permission of the Committee on Academic Standing. After the first five calendar days of either semester, a student who is taking four or more courses may drop a 12 course up to one week after midterm, after consulting with the advisor and the instructor of the course. The dropped course counts as one of the 37 courses that a student can elect without extra charge. After the drop deadline, a student may drop a course without the penalty of failure only with approval from the Committee on Academic Standing. Only extraordinary circumstances warrant the committee's approval of such a request. Independent Study After the first semester of study, a student may engage in independent study during the school year in place of a regular course. The student's independent study proposal must receive the approval of the faculty supervisor, the appropriate department chair, the student's faculty advisor and the Committee on Academic Standing. Normally, arrangements are completed in the semester preceding that of the independent study; late petitions may be denied. Independent study requires discipline and responsibility, and therefore the faculty takes into account the maturity of the student and the level of his or her knowledge and academic background when it considers proposals for independent study. A student normally will not engage in more than one independent study in any one semester, and may not engage in more than two independent studies in any one academic year. Independent study may take many forms, but normally it consists of the study of material unavailable in the formal College curriculum, of laboratory or field research, or of the creation of some body of work in the creative arts, such as poetry, fiction, musical composition or visual art. Independent Coverage of Coursework Under certain circumstances, a student may cover a course independently and receive credit on the basis of demonstrated proficiency. The course covered in this manner must be one that is normally offered in a regular semester. Such study is ordinarily undertaken during the summer recess and permits the student to move rapidly into advanced courses for which there are prerequisites, or to make up a course failed during a preceding semester. A student wishing to cover a course independently must obtain the approval of a faculty supervisor, the appropriate department chair, the faculty advisor and the Committee on Academic Standing. Internships The College recognizes that off-campus internship and apprenticeship experiences can be a valuable supplement to a student's academic program. Students beyond the first year (eight courses) who are in good academic standing are eligible to engage in such internships and apprenticeships. Students may seek to earn academic credit based on an internship or apprenticeship experience in one of two ways. First, students may apply to the Committee on Academic Standing, prior to beginning an internship or apprenticeship, for approval to earn 1/4 credit (using the credit/no credit option only). The committee's determination to award credit/no credit is based on a letter of evaluation submitted by the project supervisor and, at the discretion of the committee, an interview with the student conducted by the associate dean of students (academic). The Office of the Dean of Students will place the project supervisor's letter of evaluation in the student's permanent file. Students may not apply credits earned for internships in this manner toward the requirements for their degree, including the regulation requiring the completion of a minimum of 32 credits. Second, under the direction of a regular member of the faculty, and with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing, students pursuing approved off-campus internships and apprenticeships may use their off-campus experience as the basis for a 1/2-credit or one-credit independent study conducted during a regular semester once the student returns to the College. Such an independent study will be governed by the same policies that apply to all independent studies. Reading Period and Final Examinations The reading period shall comprise three days, with the final examination period beginning on the night of the third day and extending for four additional days. The final examination period has three scheduled examination sessions per full day. If a student is scheduled to take more than one examination in a single session, or if a student is scheduled to take three examinations in a single day, the student should ask an instructor to reschedule one final examination. If the rescheduling presents a problem for the student or the instructor, the 13 student should consult the Office of the Dean of Students. A student shall not be required to take three examinations in a single day. Other reasons for rescheduling will be evaluated by the instructor, who must approve the time change. Academic Performance and Expectations Grades A student's academic performance is graded by the instructor at the close of the semester with one of 13 grades. Each of these grades is used to determine a student's average and class standing, according to the table below. The lowest passing mark is D-. The letter grades with their numerical equivalents are shown below: EXCELLENT A+ (4.3) A (4.0) A- (3.7) GOOD B+ (3.3) B (3.0) B- (2.7) SATISFACTORY C+ (2.3) C (2.0) C- (1.7) POOR D+ (1.3) D (1.0) D- (0.7) FAILURE F (0) The foregoing numerical equivalents of the letter grades are established to enable the registrar to construct students' grade point averages and class ranks, which are necessarily numerical. An instructor assigns a letter grade to indicate his or her qualitative (not numerical) assessment of a student's work. Thus, for example, an instructor would assign \"C+,\" \"C\" or \"C-\" to indicate assessments of \"satisfactory,\" and the instructor may use any information he or she considers appropriate, including, but not limited to, numerical information to decide whether a student's work is \"satisfactory.\" The registrar's conversion of the instructor's letter grade into an element of a student's grade point average is a separate matter. Evaluation of performance in a course is represented by a single grade which combines grades for work in the course and for the final examination in a ratio determined by the instructor. When a student elects to take a course on a credit/no credit basis, standing in the course is represented by the notation of Cr, NC, or F (see \"Credit/No Credit Option\"). When an independent study or an appropriately designated course is carried for two semesters, the grade reported at the end of the first semester is tentative. The grade assigned by the instructor at the end of the second semester becomes the final mark for both semesters. Failure in a Course \u2014 Students who fail a course may repeat that course; if the failed course is repeated, however, both grades will be included both on the permanent transcript and in the cumulative average. A failed course may not be counted toward the course credits required for graduation, but it is counted toward the 37 courses that a student may elect without extra charge. After the drop period, and following a warning to the student, an instructor may request the Committee on Academic Standing to remove from the course a student who is willfully and consistently neglectful of assigned work or other course obligations. If the committee concurs, a grade of F will be entered on the student's permanent transcript. 14 Grades of Incomplete and Grade Changes \u2014 Any grade of incomplete reported by an instructor must first be approved by the Committee on Academic Standing. Such approval is given rarely and only in circumstances beyond a student's control, such as a medical or family emergency. Approval permits the student to complete the required work for the course by a deadline set by the instructor and the chairperson of the Committee on Academic Standing. Normally this deadline will be no later than four weeks from the end of the semester for which the grade of incomplete was assigned unless completing the work requires being on campus. If all remaining work is not submitted by the deadline specified when the incomplete is granted, the grade will automatically be changed to F. An instructor may not change a grade, other than the removal of an incomplete within the deadline, without the approval of the chair of the Committee on Academic Standing. Credit/No Credit Option \u2014 To encourage greater breadth in course election, the faculty has adopted a rule that allows a student to elect four courses over the four-year period on a credit/no credit option. No more than one such option may be exercised in any given semester. Graduate and professional schools generally look with disfavor on the use of this option in coursework considered crucial to the graduate field. The credit/no credit option is subject to the following rules: 1. No first-year student is permitted to use the credit/no credit option in the first semester. 2. Unless the instructor asks, he or she will not be informed which students are taking a course on the credit/no credit option. 3. The student must inform the registrar of his or her intention to use the credit/no credit option no later than the fourth Friday of the fall semester and the third Friday of the spring semester. 4. No junior or senior may exercise the credit/no credit option in the department of concentration or minor. 5. To qualify for a credit (Cr), a student must earn a C- or better. The grade will not enter into the computation of the overall average. 6. If a student earns a grade of D+, D or D-, the transcript will show the designation NC. The grade will not enter into the computation of the overall average. 7. If a student earns a failing grade, the transcript will show an F, and the grade will enter into the computation of the overall average. In certain courses, students may be evaluated \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfactory.\" The online description of the course will include the notation \"Evaluated Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,\" which will apply to all students registered for the course. The recorded evaluation (S or U) will under no circumstances be convertible to a conventional grade. Under this option, full-credit courses that are evaluated satisfactory/unsatisfactory may be counted, but may not be required, for the concentration or minor, and they may not be elected by students in their first semester. The combined number of full-credit satisfactory/unsatisfactory and credit/no credit courses that a student may elect is four. Grade Point Average (GPA) \u2014 Based on grades submitted by instructors, a numerical academic average is determined for each student for each semester and cumulatively for all work taken at Hamilton. This information is available to the student and to those parties authorized by the student to receive it. Grades in courses accepted for transferred credit are excluded from the student's average. Grades earned in courses taken by independent coverage are included in the cumulative average. Grades for the Hamilton Junior Year in France Program, the Academic Year in Spain Program, the Associated Colleges in China Program, the Hamilton Program in New York City, the Hamilton Term in Washington, the New York State Independent College Consortium for Study in India and The New England Center for Children Cooperative Learning Program are included in the cumulative average. 15 Class Attendance Every student is expected to attend class regularly. A student who must be absent because of medical or family emergency should notify the Office of the Dean of Students and his or her instructors. Absence for any reason does not remove the student's responsibility for learning the material covered during the absence, for turning in assignments, for obtaining materials distributed in class and for knowledge of the next assignment. Instructors may drop students from a limited-enrollment course if they are absent at any time during the first week of classes. When an instructor believes that lack of attendance is affecting a student's academic performance, the instructor may warn the student or ask the Committee on Academic Standing to do so. The committee may drop from the course a student who fails to heed such a notice. If the committee drops the student, a grade of F will be recorded. Students who are indisposed by illness that might inhibit their academic work should contact their instructors before assignments are due. The instructors will determine whatever alternative arrangements, if any, will be available to the student. Except for confinement to bed upon the order of the College physician or nurse, the Health Center will not excuse a student from academic obligations. Academic Standing The faculty assumes that every student admitted to Hamilton will be able to qualify for graduation. However, the opportunity to continue at Hamilton is a privilege that a student must earn by academic achievement. A student separated from the College for academic deficiency (see below) is not in good academic standing. A student on academic probation (see below) is not in good academic standing but remains eligible for financial aid. Hamilton reserves the right, at any time, to suspend for any period or to separate from the College any student whose academic performance or personal conduct on or off campus is, in the sole judgment of the College, unsatisfactory or detrimental to the best interests of the College. Neither the College, nor any of its trustees, officers, faculty or administrative staff shall be subject to any liability whatsoever on account of such suspension or separation. A student who is separated or suspended from the College or who withdraws is required to leave campus within 48 hours, unless permission to remain longer is granted by the dean of students. Academic Warnings \u2014 Instructors may at any time during the term submit written reports for all students whose standing in a course is unsatisfactory (borderline or failing). Students and their advisors receive copies of these warnings. A student who receives two or more such warnings in the same semester must consult with the associate dean of students (academic). Class Status \u2014 The Registrar's Office determines class status by the number of courses a student has completed satisfactorily. Academic Risk \u2014 The Committee on Academic Standing will deem a student to be at academic risk for the succeeding semester who, in his/her first semester in residence at Hamilton, earns a GPA of less than 2.0. Students deemed to be at academic risk will be subject to the restrictions that apply to academic probation, described below. Academic Probation \u2014 The Committee on Academic Standing will place on academic probation for the succeeding semester a student who has completed at least two semesters at Hamilton and whose GPA for the most recent semester is below 2.0. A student who is on academic probation is ineligible for study abroad. The Committee on Academic Standing may also prevent or limit participation by students on academic probation in prize competitions, intercollegiate athletics and other extracurricular activities, including the holding of offices in chartered undergraduate organizations. 16 The Committee on Academic Standing will normally recommend that a student's degree be withheld for one year if a senior's record during the final semester at Hamilton would have resulted in probation. Suspension from the College for Academic Deficiency \u2014 The Committee on Academic Standing will normally suspend from the College for a period of one year a student who has: 1. a GPA for the prior semester of less than 1.0, or 2. incurred a third academic probation. A student suspended for academic deficiency will be notified in writing of the committee's decision, the reasons for the suspension, the length of the suspension and the conditions under which he or she will be considered for readmission to the College. A student readmitted from a suspension for academic deficiency will be placed on academic probation for the semester immediately following readmission. Expulsion from the College for Academic Deficiency \u2014 The Committee on Academic Standing will normally expel from the College any student who is readmitted from an academic suspension and whose record subsequent to readmission makes him or her subject to academic probation or to another suspension. Expulsion is permanent dismissal from the College. A student who is expelled may not be readmitted and will have no further opportunity to qualify for a degree from Hamilton. Permanent Record \u2014 A student who is suspended or expelled from the College as a consequence of an action taken by the Committee on Academic Standing (academic failure), the Judicial Board (social infractions) or the Honor Court (academic dishonesty) will have recorded on his or her permanent transcript a note explaining the reason or reasons for the suspension or expulsion as follows: \"suspended (or expelled) from the College on (date)_______________ for the reason of _______________.\" Study Away from Hamilton Transfer of Credit to Hamilton for Study Away With faculty approval, qualified students may spend one to three semesters of study in an approved program overseas or at another American institution, or may receive credit for part-time study while on personal leave or during summers. The College tries to be responsive to the needs of students seeking diverse educational settings or courses not offered at Hamilton. At the same time, transferred credit can have a significant effect on the meaning and value of the Hamilton degree and thus must represent work that meets Hamilton's standards. The College considers the opportunity to earn transferred credit a privilege, rather than a right, and evaluates carefully the merits of all transferred credit petitions. Every student intending to study away from Hamilton should prepare by taking the appropriate foundation courses. Consultation with the appropriate department chairs and the associate dean of students for study abroad early in the sophomore year is advised. The conditions for transferred credit are as follows: 1. Students planning to study away from Hamilton must register their intentions with the Dean of Students Office by the published deadlines. They must complete the transferred credit petition and receive the approval of their advisor and/or the appropriate department chairs before they begin the course of study away. Students who change their programs after leaving campus should discuss substitutions with the associate dean of students for off-campus/international study by email or telephone. 2. Courses must be taken at an accredited institution and must be considered by the faculty at Hamilton to be in the liberal arts. Students are encouraged to study at four-year institutions. Students who have earned 14 or more Hamilton units (including units earned by all forms of transferred credit) may present for transferred credit only courses taken at a four-year institution. 17 3. Each course must be approved by the chair of the Hamilton department or program that would offer the course at the College. To obtain approval, students must provide a copy of the catalogue description of each course. If a course is not clearly within the purview of a Hamilton department or program, the Committee on Academic Standing will determine its acceptability. The appropriate chair should indicate if a course will apply toward a student's concentration or minor. 4. Online courses are not normally acceptable for transferred credit. 5. Courses in which a substantial portion of the enrollment consists of high school students are not acceptable for transferred credit, even if they are college-level courses taught by a university-approved instructor or visiting professor. 6. Grades must be the equivalent of C or higher. 7. Students who carry out independent studies at another college or university in the United States must submit a separate form indicating that a Hamilton faculty member has evaluated and approved the completed project. 8. Transferred credits may account for no more than one-half of the total graduation credits. No more than two course credits will be granted for study during a summer. 9. Seniors must take their final semester at Hamilton College. Matriculated students may spend no more than three semesters studying away from Hamilton. 10. The quantity of transferred credit that a student may earn toward a Hamilton degree for work done at another school is determined by a proportionality between the 32 Hamilton units required for a Hamilton degree and the number of units required at the other school to earn a degree. For example, if a school requires 120 semester-hours for a degree, a course worth three semester-hours at that school is .025 of the total work required for a degree at that school. By proportionality, that three semester-hour course would generate .8 of a Hamilton unit, because (.025)(32) = .8. The registrar will use this rule to evaluate the totality of a student's transferred credit for a given semester or summer. 11. The Committee on Academic Standing grants final approval of all transferred credit petitions. Any requests for exceptions to the above conditions must be submitted to the committee. Transferred credit, including summer school and advanced placement credit, is counted toward the courses required for a degree. Such credit is entered on the transcript. The grade, however, is not included in the student's average and, therefore, does not affect class rank, which is determined solely on the basis of grades awarded for courses taken in Hamilton programs. Once transferred credit has been entered on a student's transcript, that credit may not be removed from the transcript without approval of the Committee on Academic Standing. Foreign students who enter Hamilton as first-year students and desire transferred credit for work done at a foreign college or university should consult the associate dean of students (academic) during their first year. Study Abroad Students planning to study in a foreign country must follow and complete the procedures specified above for off-campus study and transferred credit. (These provisions do not apply to the Hamilton programs in China, France, Spain or the Hamilton-affiliated program in India. See the appropriate departments for the relevant information.) All students planning to study away must discuss their plans with the associate dean of students for off-campus/international study (located in the Dean of Students Office) by the published deadlines. Only students in good academic and social standing at the College may receive an approved leave of absence for foreign study. As in the case of other off-campus programs, final approval of foreign study programs and transfer of foreign study credit is granted by the Committee on Academic Standing. Upon returning to Hamilton, the student must have an official transcript sent to the Office of the Registrar documenting completion of the approved program. No credit will be approved for courses taken credit/no credit. Students must receive letter grades or equivalents from off-campus programs. 18 To earn credit toward a Hamilton degree for study abroad, a student must: 1. earn a grade point average of 2.7 or higher during the two consecutive semesters at Hamilton immediately preceding the student's last semester at Hamilton before leaving for the study abroad. 2. receive no final grades of F in the semester immediately preceding the proposed period of study abroad. Students applying to the Hamilton programs in China, France or Spain, or the Hamilton-affiliated program in India may, with the support of the appropriate program director and the concentration advisor, apply to the Committee on Academic Standing for a waiver of the 82 average rule. To earn credit toward a Hamilton degree by work transferred from study abroad in a country whose language is not English, a student must meet the following requirements: 1. prior to studying abroad, pass a course (or otherwise demonstrate proficiency) in the language of that country at: a.) the fourth-semester level for French, German, Russian and Spanish; b.) the second-semester level for Italian, Chinese and Japanese; c.) the second-semester level, if the Critical Language Program at Hamilton offers instruction in that language regularly. 2. while studying abroad, undertake for credit work that is either conducted in the language of that country or that increases the student's proficiency in that language. The student must earn a grade of C or higher, and the work must be worth at least one-fifth of the total work presented for transferred credit from that study abroad. The Committee on Academic Standing may, upon the recommendation of an academic department at Hamilton, modify these requirements for specific students or programs of study abroad. Evaluation of Credit for Transfer Students Transcripts of college work to date will be reviewed by the registrar, in consultation with the Committee on Academic Standing, to determine the courses that will be accepted for transfer. (See the preceding section for the criteria used.) Transfer students must complete at least half of their undergraduate program at Hamilton to receive a Hamilton College degree. When the transcript has been evaluated, the registrar will send the transfer student a statement of accepted courses and an estimate of the Hamilton credit equivalency, and upon matriculation will enter the courses and grades on the student's Hamilton record. The registrar will assign a class year based on the number of credits accepted for transfer. A transfer student is governed by the academic regulations that pertain to the class in which he or she has been placed. All transfer students must take the quantitative skills proficiency examination. They must consult with the Physical Education Department regarding completion of the physical education requirement. If awarded junior standing, a transfer student must declare a concentration upon matriculation. Courses taken elsewhere may be counted toward the concentration if approved by the appropriate department. Changes to the Four-Year Schedule for Completion of Degree Acceleration Acceleration permits students to graduate one full year ahead of the normal date of graduation. Students wishing to accelerate must apply to the Committee on Academic Standing for permission to do so no later than the end of the first semester of the sophomore year. The committee will consider both the advisability of acceleration and the means of achieving it. Approval will be granted only to those students whose academic ability and personal maturity are judged adequate. Leaves of Absence 19 A student may request from the associate dean of students (academic) an academic or personal leave of absence. A student may request from the dean of students a medical or psychological leave. Students should consult with their academic advisor and the appropriate dean prior to requesting leave. Leaves of absence may be granted for a specified period of time, normally one or two semesters. Students on leave are expected to return to Hamilton at the conclusion of the approved leave. While on leave, students will be informed of preregistration at the appropriate time in the semester preceding their return, and are responsible for meeting the same deadlines as currently enrolled students. Arrangements for housing must be completed before students leave campus. In order to do this, students must complete a proxy form and register it with the Office of Residential Life. Students who fail to preregister or who leave Hamilton without formally being granted a leave of absence will be withdrawn and must reapply to the dean of students. A request for a change in a student's leave, or cancellation, must be made to the appropriate dean. Should the dean approve the request to cancel a leave, the student must pay the continuation fee and then may exercise his or her own on-campus options, to the extent that the College schedule allows. All requests for a leave of absence must be received by the published deadlines. Students with an approved leave do not pay the registration fee, preregister or participate in the housing or meal plan lotteries. The registration fee is refundable until May 1; after that date it is forfeited. Students may occasionally need to arrange a leave of absence after the spring or fall deadlines for reasons beyond their control. These students should apply to the dean of students, who may allow financial and other regulations to be waived. When a leave is granted, the dean of students may also specify special conditions for the student's readmission to Hamilton. Academic Leave of Absence \u2014 Students intending to pursue an academic program at another institution, either at an American college or in a foreign study program, must request in writing an academic leave from the associate dean of students (academic). Personal Leave of Absence \u2014 Students may request in writing a leave for personal or financial reasons from the associate dean of students (academic). Medical or Psychological Leave of Absence \u2014 Students who have a professionally diagnosed medical or psychological condition that interferes with their academic or social life at Hamilton may request from the dean of students a medical or psychological leave of absence. For such a leave to be considered, the student must authorize the director of Student Health Services and/or the director of Counseling and Psychological Services, as appropriate, to provide confirmation of the presence and severity of the condition to the dean of students. In extraordinary circumstances when a student is unable or unwilling to take a voluntary leave of absence, the dean of students or a designee may place a student on an involuntary leave of absence if it is determined that the student's actions pose a direct threat to the safety of others or disrupt the learning environment for other students. Before an involuntary leave is considered, the dean of students will consult with the student and his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) and encourage a voluntary leave of absence. Prior to placing a student on an involuntary leave, the dean of students or a designee will meet with the student and explain the reasons why it is under consideration. The student will have an opportunity to respond. In determining whether an involuntary leave is necessary, the dean of students will confer with campus officials who can help evaluate whether a student's behavior poses a direct threat to the safety of others or disrupts the learning environment for other students. The dean of students or designee may require an assessment by health care professionals who can assist in making an informed decision. In all cases, reasonable accommodations that would mitigate the need for an involuntary leave will be considered. In a case where a student's behavior is judged by the dean of students or designee to pose an immediate and substantial disruption or threat to the safety of others, the dean or designee may take immediate action to place the student on an involuntary leave, providing the student an opportunity to respond to the action in a reasonable period of time. 20 Students who take a leave during a semester will normally be on leave for the remainder of that semester plus the subsequent semester. Students who have been on medical or psychological leave of absence must apply to the dean of students to return. Normally this request should be made 30 days in advance of the proposed date of return. Requests will be granted only after the director of Student Health Services and/or the director of Counseling and Psychological Services informs the dean of students that he or she is satisfied that the student is ready to return; this will normally require the student to supply documentation from appropriate professionals confirming that the condition leading to the leave has been resolved. Suspension, Withdrawal and Readmission Academic Suspension A student suspended for academic deficiency will be notified in writing of the decision of the Committee on Academic Standing, the reasons for suspension, the length of the suspension and the conditions under which he or she will be considered for readmission to the College. A student readmitted from a suspension for academic deficiency will be placed on academic probation for the semester immediately following readmission. Disciplinary and Honor Code Suspension \u2014 Students may be suspended from the College for disciplinary reasons or for violating the Honor Code. Readmission to the College after a suspension is not automatic, but requires application to the dean of students. A student readmitted from suspension for disciplinary reasons will normally be placed on disciplinary probation for the semester immediately following readmission. Readmission will normally be denied if the conditions specified at the time of suspension have not been met. Hamilton reserves the right to defer readmission if space is not available. Withdrawal Students who leave Hamilton while a semester is in progress or at the end of the semester, and who do not wish to return at a future date, are required to formally withdraw from the College by meeting with the associate dean of students (academic) and following the proper exit procedures. Readmission Former students or students who have completed withdrawal procedures may apply to the dean of admission for readmission to the College. Applications for readmission are to be submitted at least one month prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student wishes to return. Continuation at Hamilton Registration Fee A registration fee of $500, deductible from the fall tuition bill, is required of all students who intend to continue at Hamilton. This fee is due by April 1 of each year. It may be refunded up to May 1; after that date it is forfeited. Preregistration Preregistration is held in November for the following spring semester and in April for the following fall semester. In order to preregister for the fall semester, students must have paid the registration fee. Students who have not preregistered may be withdrawn from the College. Housing Lottery In order to continue in college housing, returning students select their rooms for the next academic year through the housing lottery at the end of the spring semester. In order to be eligible, students must have paid the registration fee, have their accounts clear and have preregistered for classes for the fall semester. The housing lottery information booklet, published in the middle of the spring semester, contains additional requirements pertaining to the process and student eligibility. 21 Students wishing to live off campus must participate in a separate process which is normally offered only to rising seniors. Any permission to live off campus is granted on a yearly basis only. Students are advised to not sign a lease until they have been granted permission to move off campus by the College during the spring. Meal Plan Placement Each student must participate in a meal plan while classes are in session. All first-year and sophomore students must participate in the 21-meal plan. Most junior and senior students will participate in the 7-, 14- or 21-meal plan, depending on where they live. Certain housing locations permit students to take fewer meals in the dining halls. However, all students (including off-campus residents), at a minimum, must participate in the seven-meal plan. Students with medical restrictions need to consult with the director of residential life. 22 Advanced Placement Policies In order to receive A.P. credit, a student must take a departmentally approved Hamilton course and pass with the minimum grade stipulated by the department. Students must take one of the courses listed below as their first course in the department, unless otherwise designated. If a department does NOT state explicitly that they give credit, a student cannot get credit for the A.P. test in that field. ART General, Drawing and Art 2D Design: Students having obtained a 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of Art 104 or 160 with a minimum grade of a B in the course. ART HISTORY Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of any 200-level Art History course with a minimum grade of B in the course. BIOLOGY For all classes up to and including the Class of 2021: Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the Biology AP exam may receive 1 college credit after completion of either Biology 101, 102, or 115 with a minimum grade of B- or better. The credit is for exemption from one semester of introductory college-level biology and to allow students to proceed in our curriculum (AP credit may not be applied to the concentration requirements). Students will not receive a college AP credit if they choose to take both Biology 101 and 102. Beginning with the Class of 2022: Students having obtained a 5 on the Biology AP exam may receive 1 college credit after completion of Biology 100 with a minimum grade of B or better (AP credit may not be applied to the concentration requirements). CHINESE Students having obtained a 4 or 5 in AP Chinese Language and Culture will receive 1 credit upon completion of Chinese 140 or a higher level Chinese language course with a minimum grade of a B- in the course. Placement is based on the placement exam. The AP credit will be awarded after completion of 140, regardless of what level a student initially places into. CHEMISTRY Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of Chemistry 125 or 190 as their first course in Chemistry with a minimum grade of C-. COMPUTER SCIENCE Students are placed by the Computer Science Department on the basis of AP scores and a departmental placement exam. Normally, students without programming experience enroll in Computer Science 110 followed by 111. The Computer Science Department does not award credit for AP courses or exams. ECONOMICS This policy applies to students in Class of 2021 and earlier: Students who achieve a score of 5 in the AP Microeconomics exam can place out of Economics 101. Students who subsequently achieve a grade or B- or better in Economics 275 will also receive Hamilton course credit for 101 and can apply this toward the major or minor in Economics. Similarly, a top score on the Macroeconomics AP permits a student to place out of Economics 102. Students who subsequently achieve a grade of B- or better in Economics 285 will also receive course credit for 102 and can apply this toward the major or minor in Economics. Entering students who feel that they have a strong background in economics but have not achieved a qualifying score to pursue credit toward the major as specified above should talk to their advisors about whether it would be appropriate to skip an introductory course and enroll in an intermediate level course. However, a student 23 who places out of Economics 101 or 102 without receiving credit toward the major cannot count this course as one of the 9 required for the major. For students in the Class of 2022: Students who receive a score of 5 in the AP Microeconomics exam and Macroeconomics exam can place out of Economics 100. Students who subsequently receive a grade of B- or better in Economics 166 will also receive Hamilton course credit for 100 and can apply this toward the major or minor in Economics. Entering students who feel that they have a strong background in economics but have not achieved a qualifying score to pursue credit toward the major as specified above should talk to their advisors about whether it would be appropriate to skip Economics 100 and enroll in 166. However, a student who places out of 100 without receiving credit toward the major cannot count this course as one of the 9 required for the major. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES Students who complete Environmental Studies 210 with a B+ or better can apply their Environmental Science AP toward college credit at Hamilton if they received a 4 or 5 on the AP exam. However, AP scores do not count toward completion of the Environmental Studies concentration. 210 is taken during the second semester of the student's sophomore year. FRENCH LITERATURE & LANGUAGE Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP French Language and Culture exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of French 200 with a minimum grade of a B in the course. GERMAN Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of German 200W or another 200-level German course taught in German with a minimum grade of B- in the course. Students must complete the 200-level course in their first year at Hamilton to receive the AP credit. GOVERNMENT & WORLD POLITICS United States: Students with a score of 5 on the AP exam may enter any 200-level American Politics course without taking the prerequisite. Upon completion of the 200-level course with a grade of B or better, the student will receive 1 credit for Government 116. Comparative: Students with a score of 5 on the AP exam may enter any 200-level Comparative Politics course without taking the prerequisite. Upon completion of the 200-level course with a grade of B or better, the student will receive 1 credit for Government 112. Alternatively, students may take 116 and/or 112 if they so choose, but they thereby forfeit the potential credit from their AP score; to be eligible for these courses, such students must contact the Registrar's Office and request the removal of the AP scores from their records. HISTORY Students who receive a 4 or 5 on a European, American, and/or World History AP examination will receive 1 credit toward general graduation requirements upon completion of a Writing Intensive 100-level History course with a minimum grade of C-. 200- and 300-level History courses do not meet this requirement. AP credits do not count toward the History concentration or minor. Students can only receive a total of 1 unit of credit for AP European, American, and World History. HUMAN GEOGRAPHY Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon successful completion of Anthropology 113 with a minimum grade of B- in the course. ITALIAN Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the AP exam will receive 1 credit upon successful completion of Italian 130 with a minimum grade of B- in the course. The AP credit will be awarded after completion of 130, regardless of what level a student initially places into. JAPANESE 24 Students having obtained a 4 or 5 on the Japanese AP exam will receive 1 credit upon completion of Japanese 140 with a minimum grade of a B- in the course. The initial placement is based on a placement exam by the Japanese Program. Students may be placed into Japanese 130 and still receive AP credit upon completion of 140. LATIN Students having obtained a 4 or 5 in AP Latin will receive 1 credit upon completion of a 300-level Latin course with a minimum grade of B- in the course. Students having obtained a 3 will receive 1 credit upon completion of Latin 210 with a minimum grade of B- in the course. LITERATURE & CREATIVE WRITING Students earning a score of 4 or 5 on either or both of the AP examinations in Literature and/or Language may place directly into one of several 200-level courses in Literature. Students earning a 5 on the AP exam and who earn a minimum grade of B- in a 100-level or 200-level writing-intensive course in the Literature Department during their first two years at Hamilton will receive 1 additional course credit. Students earning scores of 4 or 5 on the AP exam who do not take a 100-level Literature class must take 204 before they enroll in 215. Students can only receive a total of 1 unit of credit from either the AP English Language and Composition or AP English Literature and Composition. This credit will not count toward the concentration. MATHEMATICS Students are placed by the department on the basis of AP scores and a departmental placement exam. Students who complete Math 116 with a grade of C- or better without having taken Math 113, will receive credit for 113. This credit does not count toward the concentration or minor. Students who complete Math 216 with a grade of C- or better without having taken Math 116, will receive credit for 116. The Mathematics Department does not award credit for AP Statistics, but students earning a score of 4 or 5 on this exam may place directly into Math 254. MUSIC THEORY Students who receive a 5 on the AP exam in Music Theory are placed into Music 211 and will receive 0.5 AP credit upon completion of the course with a B or better, in addition to the 0.5 course credit for Music 211. Students who receive a 4 on the AP exam in Music Theory should consult with the department about placement and credit. PHYSICS Physics 1 and Physics 2 (algebra based): Students with scores for AP 1 or 2 should consult with the department about placement but will not receive course credit. Physics C (calculus based): Students having obtained a 5 in both Mechanics and E&M will receive 2 credits upon successful completion of Physics 290, assuming that they have not completed any courses in an introductory sequence. Students having obtained a 5 in Mechanics, independent of their score in E&M, will receive 1 credit upon successful completion of Physics 195 or 205, assuming that they have not completed any of the first-semester courses of the introductory sequence.

The maximum adjusted taxable income for TAP eligibility for dependent applicants is $80,000. Awards range from $500 to $5,165 per year, depending on income and the year in which the first award was received.

They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. Students should submit, to the registrar, dean of students, academic department head or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the College to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. a. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College throughout in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the College discloses education records without consent to officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. b. Another exception that permits disclosure without consent is the disclosure of directory information, which the law and the College define to include the following: a student's name, home and campus addresses, email address, telephone listing, parents' name and address(es), date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, photograph and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended. This information is generally disclosed only for College purposes, such as news releases and athletic programs, and not to outside vendors. This exception is subject to the right of the student to object to the designation of any or all of the types of information listed above as directory information in his or her case, by giving notice to the dean of students on or before September 15 of any year. If such an objection is not received, the College will release directory information when appropriate. c. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: 71 Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-4605 d. Questions regarding FERPA and the procedures followed by the College to comply with the act may be referred to the dean of students or the registrar. "}
