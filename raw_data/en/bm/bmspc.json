Linda Darin Energy Healer NYC The Darin Method\u00ae ABOUT ME Energy Healer RN, BSN, MS, MSW | Intuitive Guide | Spiritual Healing | Educator My younger sister used to run to my bed at night for comfort, knowing that the dark spiritual energy that terrified her didn't faze me. She always fell peacefully asleep, and I was happy to be a channel of light in her life. I grew up in the Catholic religion, where Jesus was the focus of my spiritual life. I had a strong faith in God even as a very young child. In my late twenties, after experiencing a traumatic life event, a spiritual awakening came to me and I began my own journey of emotional healing through meditation and learned how to listen to the powerful voice within. Energy & Chakra Healing Services The Darin Method\u00ae The Darin Method\u00ae combines Eastern and Western healing methods through intuitive counsel, invitation, invocation and permission to provide spiritual and holistic healing services. Linda evaluates emotional blockages, dysfunctional energy patterns, and how they are affecting the physical body. This clearing work promotes healing of emotional, mental, spiritual and many physical challenges. Statement of Faith As a child, I was never afraid of dark energy. From a young age, I could feel light and dark energy emanating from other people in a room, and I accepted this as a natural part of life. I remember challenging those dark feelings with my spiritual energy, telling them they could not hurt me! Without knowing I would later become a spiritual healing mentor and guide for others, I was already a warrior of the light.

Darin Transformations Reviews We're not the only ones who are excited, see what our clients are saying. I have been in counseling sessions with Linda for several months now. She has been an integral part of my recovery journey from childhood trauma. Her spiritual approach brings me peace and true healing. Linda helped me to understand and get completely over a betrayal. Through continued sessions and group work I am also finally gaining a stronger relationship with God. Linda helps to get to the root cause of issues and will help you to move forward in life. I reached out to Linda in a very stressful moment, my husband had asked for a divorce, and I initially sought therapy for myself to process this part of my life. She responded immediately and during our session she discussed the option of couples therapy. My husband was open to couples therapy and we began with the topic of money. We have had 2 months of energy healing towards money, understanding our beliefs about money, how to budget, and this has created a shift in our marriage and finances for the better. Divorce is no longer on the table. We will now continue our journey working towards Chakra healing as a couple. I look forward to continuing therapy and the fruits of our labor. This is work but well worth it. I encourage anyone seeking therapy, counseling, and energy healing to reach out to Linda Darin. I describe Linda as loving, insightful, a navigator, delivering, and an amazing woman. She is like a pilot to a plane, a captain to a ship. Linda Is a guide to the Lord. Working with Linda in one year has brought me an honesty within me that I've never known. The numbness of day-to-day living doesn't consume me anymore. I am alive and present because of her persistence with my resistance to change. I am transforming into a new creation. What an exciting time, what an amazing woman! Thank you, Linda! Linda Darin is a gifted and intuitive healer. She guides the individual in exploring issues with compassion and integrity. Linda utilizes her extensive knowledge and experience to assist the individual in experiencing personal growth and establishing inner balance. \"I met Linda May 2010 and I was addicted to alcohol for over 40 years. I am now sober for 16 months. I just went to my son's wedding sober and realized for the first time I did not have to hide or question what I did the night before. I felt a strength within myself for the first time. Linda allowed me to break through my denials and see the truth of my disease. I am aware of my anxiety that wants me to fix, save and rescue my children. I like Frank Kelly and feel at ease in my own body. I am grateful for her patience.\" Transformational Treatment- Linda Darin has helped me in more ways than I expected or originally intended. I went to her for help healing from the passing of my father, who was my closest ally. Immediately, Linda asked me questions no one has ever asked before. She gets straight to the point, and gets to the root of all issues. After my first visit I instantly felt lighter, after struggling with mediocre grief counselors for months. Beyond grief therapy, Linda has also helped me heal many unresolved issues I have collected throughout my 30 years of life. She analyzes events, dreams and situations with exact precision and has made me much more aware. She links things that are not typically understood by the person experiencing the situations. She understands people and more importantly, goes beyond the surface. She has a unique depth, and skills that are very uncommon in most. She is warm, comforting, perceptive, and does not sugar coat. I have already recommended Linda to many family and friends, and would be happy to give additional recommendation to anyone interested in her services. They are well worth the time, and the value for what you get is beyond fair. Thank you Linda for everything, you have transformed my life and brought much light out of a very dark situation. Linda Darin is like no other human being I've met in this lifetime. I was truly blessed when I began working with her in 2010 and thankful each day that I have been given the opportunity to continue to work with her. When I met Linda, to say that I was lost, damaged and a shell of me would be putting it lightly. As I began my work, I immediately recognized a difference from any other treatments and therapies I had tried in the past. Linda has a unique ability to provide a balance of gentleness, nurturing, encouragement and the added 'push' needed to grow and get to the next level. With her assistance, I was able to identify and examine the beliefs and patterns that no longer served me and through releasement, I better understand who I was and closer to accepting and loving myself. Linda's whole heart is so clearly in the work that she does. She gives all of herself and her passion for helping others get where they want to be, free of judgement, is so evident. With her intuitive, healing abilities, spiritual guidance, wisdom and The Darin Method I began the journey back to myself and I am eternally grateful to her for that. Growing up in a culture that viewed counseling as a frivolous expense and gave word \"therapy\" somewhat of a shameful connotation, it was challenging for me to start seeing Linda. I firmly believed that my situation was so special that no other person but myself could see it clearly, let alone help me. Linda took me back to my childhood and, by exploring my family patterns, helped me understand why I behaved a certain way, why I kept finding myself in certain life circumstances, and what I could do to brake those patterns. Linda opened my eyes up to the importance of emotional intelligence, value of staying calm and not reacting. Linda has introduced me to the spiritual world, guided me through a very difficult time of my mother's death. Linda continues to be a powerful source of strength, motivation and empowerment as I learn to love and accept myself, combat my fears and insecurities, stay true to myself. One thing that sets Linda apart in my opinion is her action-oriented approach. She will not only listen to your problem and analyze it, but will also suggest steps to take, books to read, people to talk to - anything and everything to provide tangible and immediate help in your situation. Linda is a wealth of knowledge - medical, spiritual, and just \"life knowledge\" in general. I admire and value Linda's gentle honesty, authenticity and passion for her work. I am very thankful for Linda Darin, I have gained and grew so much since meeting her. I highly recommend Linda's services. Empowering, uplifting, and an answer to my prayers would be some of the words I would use to describe Linda Darin. I have been working with Linda for about four years now. Although I have been down this path of holistic healing before, I have never met someone like Linda. Her experience in the medical field along with her life experience and the blessing of a true gift has made her the person she is today. An individual who has changed my life as well as my entire family's life for the better. It doesn't matter if you see her in person or on Skype, the feelings are the same. She is a caring person who takes her work seriously. If you want to change your life for the better and are willing to work on yourself, then she is it. Written with much love and appreciation - Denise C - Long Island NY Linda is truly an amazing person. She has helped my whole family get through some of the hardest times in our lives. Linda makes you truly become the best version of yourself. I could never thank her enough for everything she has done. She has given me confidence in myself to follow my heart and live an authentic life. I came to Linda to refocus my life. I had been working too much and neglected myself and as a result, narrowed my opportunities in starting a family. It was a stressful time that left me feeling sad and depleted. Linda helped me refocus my life so that the my issues and goals weren't primary. I discovered who I am at my core, what I believe, what experiences and people have shaped my beliefs both positive and negative. Linda helped change my life and help me learn about me. Letting go of the negativity healed my mind, spirit and body. Today, my energy is balanced. The process of healing has allowed space for me and my husband to have our own family and enjoy every moment being parents. I hope that others find and work with Linda because my personal transformation has by far been the best thing that I have done in my life. I am eternally grateful to Linda for opening my eyes, my mind, and my energy. I began seeing Linda a little under 5 months ago, and both my inner (and as a result my outer) life has changed drastically for the positive ever since. She's given me the tools I was lacking and so needed which help me address my depression and anxiety on a daily basis. I like her straightforward no non sense practical approach to spiritual matters . You get what you put in to it, she gives you the guidance and the tools, but its up to you to take your healing further by putting in the time and effort each week, outside of sessions, and its well worth it. I could not have gotten where I am now, without her guidance. I am truly a more balanced and grounded person today. I'm very grateful for Linda and would highly recommend her to anyone. My energy has shifted dramatically after working with Linda. I now have Overall less negativity, and more positive energy in the physical body. So much easier to go through my days without worries, tension, and anxiety. She's truly a miracle worker! I learned a lot in life and religion, which calmed my mind and emotions down. Linda has tapped into all 7 chakras, which was key to my transformation. Linda has definitely changed my life with her healing hands, along with her knowledge, and I'm forever thankful I highly recommend her. Linda has been such a positive support in my life. I came to her five months ago because I was feeling disconnected to people and things. I didn't realize it, but I was depressed. I was putting all my energy into my job and not finding much joy in other parts of my life. My physical body was not in the best of health, my social connections were stagnant and I didn't feel any spiritual presence within me. Through the chakra work with Linda, I have developed an awareness of myself in all areas - physical, emotional, social and spiritual. Linda has given me the tools to work through my fears, traumas and shame (things I didn't know existed). I can now use these tools to help me get through challenging times and help bring balance into my life. With these tools and Linda's healings, I feel more positive, awake and open to love and life. Linda is an incredible healer. She has given me such amazing gifts during the course of the past 6 months. Before I met her, I was probably at the lowest point in my life battling depression, financial issues, and anxiety. I was skeptical of the type of healing and beliefs she had, but became a firm believer about half way in. She has a connection to forces and energy that I can't explain and her questions alone cut directly to the core issues of an individual, provoking the needed thought and self-realization to get better. She attacks issues you are struggling with from all angles, gives hope, and empowers you to change. Words can't express my gratitude for her in helping my transformation. I went to Linda as I was struggling with grief. She has helped me enormously through this painful experience and has given me the tools to accept and understand. Although tough at times, she has guided me back to where I need to be. I have learned so much through my sessions with her. I would highly recommend her services. \"Linda Darin is a miracle worker. I called her one evening after viewing her website. I was drawn to her holistic practice and felt she might be a good match for my 20-year old daughter going to school in New York City. I knew my sensitive daughter would only commit to seeing someone who she genuinely connected with. Linda answered the phone that evening. She immediately engaged with me, and set up a session with my daughter. Not only was there a connection, but the trust and care that my daughter feels under Linda's care is simply magical. I know my daughter is safe.\" My life had been a mess for the last couple of years and I knew I needed to get help to get out of a really bad cycle of self-destruction. I was feeling depressed, anxious, angry and full of resentments toward the world. I was certainly not in a good place physically, psychologically or spiritually. I was browsing the internet for therapists in the NYC area and found Linda's web site. I was interested in her holistic healing approach. Since I had already tried psychotherapy many times in the past, I decided to give the Darin Method a try. I have to admit that in the beginning I had my reservations. As we started with the sessions I began to shift gradually from a place of anger, sadness and self-destruction to a state of relative peace, hope, acceptance and contentment. My anger and sadness decreased significantly. I became better at taking care of myself and that love reached others. I particularly liked learning and healing the chakras. Linda was able to successfully address old issues and symptoms which had been causing me distress most of my life. The biggest transformation that I have experienced was getting rid of issues of shame and moving towards a more self-empowering, self-accepting and self-loving attitude. As someone who has gone through years of psychotherapy, I would highly recommend Linda's innovative and effective Holistic Healing Method. Linda is seeing my 21 year old daughter, I have seen more positive changes in my daughter after 6 months of therapy with Linda than her previous 6 years of traditional counselling. When I first came into Linda's office three years ago my life was in disarray and I barely knew it. My relationship, job and social life were all dark and dead-end. Working with Linda has been a journey to self love and self acceptance that I don't believe would have been possible without her. Linda patiently walked me through and helped me realize that I was able to change and improve these areas of my life. She provided much-needed honesty, support, references, guides, tools and healings that removed the veils I was hiding behind. Through our work I have been able to finally embrace changes that once would've paralyzed me in fear. I have a sense of self, self respect and self awareness. I have been able to move forward and excel in my career. I have been able to move on from destructive relationships and reconcile with family. I've been able to focus on my personal health and well-being to combat unhealthy addictions and behaviors. Linda's unique approach and method is intuitive and tailored to my life, my experiences and my needs. She's been a constant champion for me and been the light when I had to walk through dark times. I am grateful for our continued work and would highly recommend her services. \"Linda has a rare ability to foster real personal transformation by combining intuitive counseling with incredibly powerful energy healing techniques. I worked with several classical therapists before I met Linda, but could never make any meaningful progress beyond intellectualizing my issues. Linda's holistic approach was so much more effective, and for the first time, allowed me to really heal.\" Linda...thank you so, so much! Your energy work is nothing less than miraculous. My head is still clear from our last session 10 days ago, which to me was unexpected, not to mention a major blessing, as I can function again! As you know, I had horrific dizziness/vertigo from pre- and post-emergency surgery drugs and procedures, (in addition to the aftermath of general anesthesia) and I had been so foggy and miserable for the past 6 weeks that I was pretty much good for nothing. During our session you probably did all of 5 minutes hands-on energy work and I guess I wasn't expecting those amazing skills of yours to do all that they did for me. I can see straight, walk straight and function...and it's seriously an amazing feeling to have that dark cloud lifted! I am ever so grateful! You truly have many incredible gifts, and I feel particularly blessed that you went in the direction you chose to with me, as you 'freed' me! Needless to say, I am now a huge believer in energy healing; well, energy healing from the right practitioner! Looking forward to working with you again and again. I had no hesitations working with Linda and was actively looking for a spiritual approach to intuitive counseling. I had worked with a conventional therapist for three years prior to Linda and I now wanted to integrate a more holistic approach to dealing with unresolved trauma. My sessions with Linda have been life-changing. Besides the counseling, which feels like a classroom for my soul I have greatly benefited from the energy healing, books, journaling and purification methods. With Linda's guidance, I am learning to recognize lifelong negative thoughts and patterns, to confront my co-dependency issues, to listen to and speak my own truth and to live with a greater sense of joy and peace! I would highly recommend Linda and her work to anyone looking for a holistic and spiritual approach to therapy. She is a truly caring, sincere and honest individual whose gifts as a therapist have helped me to heal, grow and approach life from a more loving and self-aware place. Anyone who works with Linda is truly getting a blessing from God. Before I started working with Linda, I felt so lost emotionally and spiritually. I had seen several therapists many different times throughout my life that I didn't know if there was anyone out there that could help me. I couldn't tell you how I was feeling at any point in time, and I didn't love or appreciate myself. She has given me so many tools and so much knowledge that now I feel like a completely different person from the one who walked through her door a couple of years ago. She made me realize my patterns in relationships, how my family DNA has affected me, and how I can change it all to create the awesome life that I deserve. She has helped me find and love my inner and outer self. I'm not sure where I would be today without her help, but I do know that I have changed for the better. I know myself more than I ever have before and I'm learning to love who I am more and more every day. Linda is a very intuitive, spiritual therapist who integrates practical advice for dealing with life's issues. I highly recommend her. Linda helped me lift myself out of grief, move through my past, evaluate my present, and discover the future I want to build to live my best life. I offer the highest recommendation for her work, and the results we have achieved together. \"Linda is a healer who heals with words. I am able to develop awareness and clarity in a space of truth and non-judgment. Linda helped me resolve issues of trauma, anxiety, low self-esteem and connect with my life's purpose. I am grateful for the past six years.\" She has helped me get healthy and grow and her sessions are emotional at times but her honesty and truthfulness is outstanding. I've worked with Linda for 4 years now and have learned so many useful tools and practices that have aided me tremendously. I am grateful for the wisdom and care in each of the sessions and recommend her for healing work for those who may not know where to begin. Linda is amazing. Her session was thorough and helped me immensely. It felt as though a huge weight has been lifted from me. I still feel great weeks later. She even emailed some documents afterwards that help as well! Highly recommend! I am writing this review to say that I have had a great experience with Linda, who worked with me to clear negative energy and negative attachments. Linda knew exactly what questions to ask me, and how to respond to my issues. I have already decided to purchase a $9.95 session in advance of any future hour long sessions. To be frank, Linda is kind, caring, and personable. She worked quickly and effectively to heal me. I am in awe of her gift from God, and I cannot say enough kind words about her gift. She is highly recommended by me. I plan to share her contact information with others who are in need of energy healing, because this is no gimmick! God Bless you Linda Darin! I was going through a really dark period with my son struggles with mental health illnesses and Linda open a pathway to healing for him. I'm currently in the Experiencing God Group every Saturday morning, partake in her Spiritual Healing services. My personal and spiritual life is now aligning with Gods plans for me to reach my destiny. Thank you Linda! She is an amazing healer. I remembered making an appointment in 2015 right after an a spiritual awakening, then cancel and again in 2016 and cancelled. I just didn't believe it would help. Yet she kept popping up on my news feed. Years after going through mental health therapy. I find myself still looking to balance out my chakra. In 2022, I was searching for one, she was again, this time she popped up in my email for the $9 special healing I tried it twice. I realize I need to go for the hour energy therapy sessions. I did finally. Wow, just amazing, first session and I slept without taking any sleeping pill. Three weeks now and still haven't taken any sleeping pill. I feel fantastic by the way. More confident, more zest for life. I can't way for next one hour session. Everyone around me has seen my glow up. Yes, my mental health therapist did help which give me the confidence to go for my energy session. Yes, Holistic healing is an absolute blessing. I am crying writing this, because I've never though I could've felt this much home and passion for life. Thank you Linda Linda none of my story would have been possible, if God didn't connect me to you and if you would not have connected me to God. I had no idea of all that would eventually unfold in my life just from meeting you on December 27, 2019. I deeply appreciate you and your work even when you explained the truths, I did not want to hear. I now realize that you cared enough to do so. I have learned so much, yet have much more to still grasp. I so highly recommend you. Thank you, thank you! With love My husband and I, desperate, and with little hope that our marriage would be sustainable, sought Linda out for guidance. After a number of extremely difficult circumstances within the marriage, we met for what turned out to be a very powerful session that shifted both of our focuses, provided understanding and clarity, allowed for forgiveness and in turn, a new start. We were both amazed at the transformation in ourselves and the relationship after the first session. We were able to better understand what was not working in the relationship and by incorporating the mind, body and spirit; this enabled us to utilize the strengths that we both had to make this marriage work. The session restored the hope and connectedness that we had lost in the chaos of our lives. There are times that my husband and I talk about how far we've come and how Linda's work, is at times, a mystery to us. She has the ability to enhance all that is positive and assists us in making sense of what seems so confusing. It is my hope that other couples, who might be struggling and skeptical, seek Linda's guidance, in an attempt to find clarity and peace within themselves and their relationship. Working with Linda has been a truly eye-opening experience helping me to bridge my inside thoughts and emotions to the outside world. Her spiritual teachings have given me the guidance to live each day with a purpose. By using the Darin Method along with tools and daily practices I am more aware and present than ever before. After years of traditional therapy I feel this was a great place to turn. I am now removing all of my negative energy and thought patterns and replacing them with positive, motivating actions with Linda's help. Linda is really able to read my energy and guide me. Her homework has been so helpful to maintain my progress in each session. It has been almost a year and I can honestly say the change has been drastic. I know Linda has played a very large role in my transformation. I can't thank her enough! \"Linda's method of counseling mixes spirituality with successful corporate techniques that motivate you to make changes in your life.\" I met Linda Darin who was referred to me by another shaman healer. I just had brain surgery in 2009 after having been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2007. After my brain surgery, I felt petrified for myself and my family. I attended weekly sessions with Linda that helped me uncover the reasons for my physical manifestations of my cancer. Linda created an environment where I felt safe and secure to open up and find my true self. I needed to heal my past to move forward. Through compassion I learned to forgive family, friends and my husband for past resentments. The healings I have received from Linda have offered me a mental and physical release from stress, fear of my cancer, fear of failure and fear of dying. Since my diagnosis with cancer I have experienced people projecting a death sentence on to me. Linda Darin has been the light at the end of my tunnel! Linda has helped my husband with his own struggles. I was convinced that I needed guidance. One major issue for me was intrusive negative thoughts. I worked with Linda for 6 sessions concerning my DNA core beliefs and family patterns. I also used her tools and did the homework that was advised. By the 7th session, I experienced a shamanic healing that was powerful and an amazing energy release! I now have no intrusive thoughts. My husband and I will continue learning from Linda since it has made us a very strong family unit. I highly recommend Linda's Holistic Method. When I found Linda, I hit the jackpot as they say! It has been a blessing each and every time I see her. I am now living in my own truth and I am able to move forward in a powerful way. I see things more clearly and feel confident on how to meet the challenges that come my way. It is priceless to me that Linda has always been accessible when I needed her and that she cares so deeply and genuinely about our work. I think Linda is a rare professional in that she honestly works to empower her clients. Linda Darin is a gifted and intuitive healer. She guides the individual in exploring issues with compassion and integrity. Linda utilizes her extensive knowledge and experience to assist the individual in experiencing personal growth and establishing inner balance. Linda continually amazes me in each of our sessions. Her in-depth knowledge of holistic healing practices has proven incredibly beneficial as she helps me explore, learn from and release my negative feelings. She has truly led me on a path toward the person I want to become. The Darin Method gives me the tools to advance my mind-body-soul connection by leaps and bounds. Linda is amazingly intuitive. She has helped me see just how programmed I was and gave me practical ways to approach life differently and with an open heart. She has helped me get much more in touch with my spiritual side and I feel I have developed into a much better and stronger person in less than six months. At nine years old, my once charming, carefree and adorable son began to manifest serious problems. It started with tantrums. He was diagnosed with Depression and ADHD. It was soon obvious that his issues were much more complicated than that. Over the course of three years he was treated by multiple psychiatrists, therapists, a nutritionist and a hypnotherapist. He was on eight different medications and still his issues worsened. He was aggressive and violent at home and provoking fights at school. He was lying, stealing, hoarding food and binging. He became increasingly irrational and talked about wanting to kill himself. He was hospitalized four times in six months. When we met Linda we were desperate. After working with Linda for three to four months, she assisted us with decreasing the medications that were causing him more harm than good. He currently takes only three medications. My son is far more self-aware and able to identify and manage his feelings. Our home is far more peaceful and I've been able to see glimpses of my son's sweet nature again. At the same time that Linda is very no-nonsense-tell-it-like-it-is, she is also very loving and my son made a significant connection to her. He opened up to her more than with any previous therapist and her love and concern for him is genuine. She has offered tremendous support to me as well and I hope that as we continue to work with her that our entire family will benefit. If you would have asked me 2 years ago if I thought I could be a good mother, I would have told you no way. I am a drug addict and have a drinking problem. I was born into a family of alcoholics and the home was always in chaos. I did not have good role models to teach me self-respect, to love others or to have healthy boundaries. I have been seeing Linda for almost two years now and I am changing into a better person. I am not indulging in my drug of choice or drinking anymore. I have just completed my college degree in business. I am learning how to set boundaries for myself and my new family. Yes... I just gave birth to my first son!! I know I am not perfect but I have made a conscious decision that I will always try to move forward and not let my past stand in the way. This is not an easy task because I battle with it every day. I look back 2 years ago {before Linda} and I think to myself...my life is so much better now that I have opened myself up to the help. Linda is the perfect fit for me. Linda guides and teaches me but she always lets me make my own decisions. The work is yours to do, so get working!!! Last year, I was going through a rough time. I felt so stressed out. I was always angry at my children and family. I was looking through websites, and I stumbled across Linda Drain. I sent her an email to set up an appointment. I'm so glad that I had a chance to talk to her. On my first day, I was so comfortable and relaxed. As I began to speak with her, I discovered my childhood wounds, which I have never shared\u2014sharing my sexual abuse at eleven. I am from Bangladesh. We're are not supposed to talk about this since the people would shame my family. Linda uses the Darin Method \u00ae to explore patterns, beliefs, and root causes that allowed me to talk about my past painful experiences and heal my inner childhood wound. I never thought that keeping my past life hidden might affect my current situation. I didn't trust men. My relationship with my ex-husband was also affected. Because of Linda, I feel so much better. My relationship with my children and my family is better. I feel more comfortable with men. I have faith in God, and I read the Bible every day. She has helped build my self-esteem and self-love, and I have so many tools. I highly recommend Linda Darin. She has healed me mentally, and I am now so energetic and healthy! Linda is truly an amazing person. She has helped my whole family get through some of the hardest times in our lives. Linda makes you truly become the best version of yourself. I could never thank her enough for everything she has done. She has given me confidence in myself to follow my heart and live an authentic life. I originally began seeing Linda after my brother passed away in 2015. Since then, I have grown so much as an individual and learned about my self in a way I never thought possible. Linda has helped me identify my thought patterns and belief systems that have been holding me back from experiencing life in a positive and productive way. She is supportive, caring and gives you that extra 'push' when you need it. I look forward to continuing my work with Linda and growing as a person. She is truly a gift. I thank Linda for clearing my chakras. After my healing session, I feel a weight has been lifted off my head, stomach, and heart. I had been feeling stuck in a few areas of my life for an extended period of time. But after my cleansing I am feeling alive, aspiring and looking forward to my future. It was a blessing to meet someone so compassionate about the well-being of others. I am beyond thankful and eager for our next session together. Linda is the most insightful therapist I've ever worked with. She very quickly identifies the areas that need healing and comes up with a plan that will improve your overall health and outlook on life. She has brought such light, happiness and clarity into my life. She is kind and compassionate with a direct, no-nonsense approach that works. I highly recommend her services. Linda is an incredibly knowledgeable healer and pulls from a wide-range of methods in her practice. I went to Linda specifically to learn more about chakra alignment and her guidance exceeded my expectations. I have concluded my sessions with Linda, but the tools she has left me with (and they are abundant!) will stick with me for the rest of my life. She is always punctual and I highly recommend her! I am very grateful for all of her help. She is so amazing. She listen patiently and takes her time. At my first session with her I felt so much better. She gives so much positive advises and tools to work with. Thank you so much. Linda truly has a gift! I began searching for something to do in conjunction with my outpatient Rehab program that I was going for my addiction; but I wanted something that went beyond spiritually and regular therapy. That is exactly what I got and more. In the three short months I have worked with Linda she has helped me how to find my own power, self-confidence and how to love my self. Each session you just don't talk, you learn how to identify your feelings and through energy healing and tools that you leave with in each sessions you incorporate these coping skills which truly helped me with my fear based anxiousness and insecurities. At first I thought all this must be happening to quickly but when my family noticed the difference and the trust was found again I knew her methods were truly working. I was finally finding myself and not only my family noticed the difference my Rehab center also asked what I was doing different as they saw the change in me and the worthiness I felt in myself in such a short period of time. All I know is this time around I wanted to stay clean and feel truly good about myself and I can't thank Linda enough for helping me out on this journey. I have been sober since June 2019 and not felt this happy in about 20 years. There is no simple way to describe my sessions with Linda Darin. Her approach to healing is spiritual, professional, educational, and euphoric. She examined my physical and emotional state and was able to relate it to issues in my past that continue to affect all aspects of my life. In order to bring balance and healing to my body and soul, Linda probed specific ailments affecting my physical and emotional health and their corresponding Chakra's to begin the healing process. She discovered that most of my issues were manifested by fear and guilt as they pertained to money, family, lifestyle, and personal and business relationships. Having reached middle age, it was clear to see that there were many issues and events during the course of my life that I had never come to terms with, that built up inside me and negatively affected my ability to think clearly and function. Linda has begun the healing process, and I am finally coming face to face with the demons within me. I left Linda's last session in a state of euphoria, feeling like I just shed a 100 pound bag of cement that I have been carrying with me for some time. Linda Darin is an amazing teacher and healer, you will feel immediate gratification and more importantly you will understand how and why certain aspects of our lives linger with us for ages, and how to guard against them in the future. Linda has invited me on a spiritual journey to my soul; your life will be changed forever. Life's about sharing so I wanted to take the time to share what I've experienced coming to see Linda. Several years ago in my life several shifts happened to me that affected my MIND BODY and Spirit and it threw me off alignment and made me sick and confused ????? Now finding alternative medicine of healing she has helped me to release energies that where stuck in me. A safe place with caring and kindness for me to connect to my higher self I feel that a beautiful healing has transported me to a place clarity, peace, empowering my spirit to be lifted and FREE . Thu some tears and honesty with self I can say I am grateful that there's a place that resonates with me that has to do with sound therapy to raise my vibration to ground me . Thank you from a place of gratitude Linda is truly a wonderful therapist. She has been helping me battle my struggles with anxiety by getting to the root of the cause, while also helping me with issues that come up day to day. She is the perfect balance of western and eastern practices. I feel so light after our healing sessions when she clears all of my chakras. I've noticed such a positive shift in my moods, and have found a strength from within after seeing her. Linda is wonderful! She is insightful, smart, caring and has a deep type of wisdom I've never come across before. I have been dealing with deep issues for most of my life, which I have sporadically sought counselling for in the past 15 years but with Linda, I'm learning about myself in ways I never thought possible. This clarity is helping to identify what the issues are, why I do the things I do and now, how to make the necessary changes and work on these issues. It is an enormous relief to know and understand what is ticking away beneath the surface. I feel safe with Linda and highly recommend her for her spiritual guidance and healing. Linda has an incredible way of approaching healing with both gentleness and honesty. Since starting with Linda, I have noticed significant changes in my life in all areas, for the better! Linda is very action oriented and has a method that works. She is knowledgable and informed and has a deep understanding of how to help others. I am very grateful for her. \"I've always felt something was 'missing' from my experience with conventional therapists, and that missing link was...results. With Linda, the results are clear and have been from the beginning-healing old wounds and overcoming that which stands in my way from living the fullest life I can. Linda is warm, caring, insightful, and highly intuitive. She knows just the right way to create a safe space to help her clients through the journey. I'm so grateful to have her as a guide these past two years. She has brought a great deal of light into my life and continues to do so with each visit.\" Before I found Linda Darin I tried so many therapists after problems of miscarriage and a rough divorce. I felt like all I did was say my problems with no advice for change. I was in a chaotic life. Until Thank God, I found Linda, who dramatically assisted me to change and give meaning to life. Through Linda I have learned how to shift to positive energy and make amazing changes almost immediately. Her specialty gave me the knowledge and the energy to reach my goals and take the steps I needed in order to live a happy life again. I have grown as a person, and become aware of myself, being intentional with my thoughts and actions. The Darin Method has made me realize, my past problems, patterns and belief systems and how not to attract that anymore. Linda is very intuitive and with all her services, I have grown spiritually to levels I've never dreamed of. I have been a client of Linda's for 7 months and continue to work with her to help me become a better person daily, obtain my goals, and further my awareness of being in this world. I recommend everyone to Linda! I truly believe that everyone can benefit from her in their life because it is a true awakening to a life that can be chaotic to all. Linda is not like your typical therapist and is very gifted in her approach on how she works with her clients. She is able to pinpoint the root causes of what is troubling you and works with you to change your patterns and belief systems using her Darin Method. It's a lot of hard work but it is a very transformational and rewarding process. The incorporation of spirituality into her practice is the key link to moving her clients forward. Linda has been a catalyst for change in my life. A friend of mine recommended I see Linda and I saw her a handful of times. When my grandmother passed away I slipped into a depression that had remained dormant within me for some time, then I started seeing Linda on a weekly basis. Linda not only helped me cope with my loss, she helped me understand how and why I felt that way. When I got over most of my grieving, Linda helped me uncover other issues I had locked up within me and overcome them. I learned that my grandmothers death wasn't the cause of my depression and that I had a lot of deep rooted fear, shame and guilt within me which was holding me back from being happy and moving forward with my life, personal growth, career and relationships. Her weekly sessions created a safe place for me where I could also establish a routine and make space and time for myself to heal. Make no mistake, you do not sit and talk to linda for an hour and get fixed. She provides an array of resources, techniques and readings for you to take with you on your journey and learn how to apply them in your day to day life. It takes a lot of commitment and honesty towards Linda and mostly towards yourself to see a change; and trust me when you finally commit to it, you will grow. Linda has been a teacher, a mentor, a healer, a confidante, a presence of hope and peace, and a mother to me. I have learned more about myself and the life I had and the life I want to lead during her care than i could have imagined. She is honest, truthful, insightful and very serious when it comes to her clients and makes you feel like you are important and worth her time. If you want to change your life, your thought patterns, your outlook, relationships and yourself I highly recommend Linda. I will never be the same since the moment I connected with her. I have been seeing Linda for a year now because I had two heroin addicts living in my home. My life had become as unmanageable as the two addicts. With Linda's help great things are possible!!! Thank you Linda. Linda is amazingly intuitive. She has helped me see just how programmed I was and gave me practical ways to approach life differently and with an open heart. She has helped me get much more in touch with my spiritual side and I feel I have developed into a much better and stronger person in less than six months. \"The Darin Transformations course was outstanding.
