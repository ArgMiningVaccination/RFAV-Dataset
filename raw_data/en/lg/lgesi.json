BARDA provides medical countermeasures to ma n-made and natural threats including chemical, biological, radiological, and nu clear threats, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA meets this mission by supporting product innovation, advanced development, acquisition and stockpiling, and building manufacturing infrastructure. Dr. Robinson previously served from 2005-2008 as the Director for the Influenza & Emerging Disease Program for the Office of the Biomedical Advanced Research & Development Authority (BARDA ) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Respon se (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Dr. Robinson joined HHS from th e vaccine industry in May 2 004 to establish a program with scientific and technical experts to implement the strategic plans and policies for medical countermeasures outlined in the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Nov. 2005). These tactical measures included development, acquisition and establishment of national stockpiles, and expansion of domestic manufacturing surge capacities for influenza vaccine s, antiviral drugs, rapid diagnos tics, and non-pharmaceutical counter- measures including respiratory devices. Dr. Robinson received a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Millsaps College, a Doctoral degree from the University of Mississippi Medical School in medical microbiology with a dissertation on herpesvirus oncogenesis, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship with the State University of New York at Stony Brook in molecular oncology and virology with studies on p53 tumor suppressor gene and SV40 cellular gene activation. While on faculty in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, his laboratory investigated the molecular pathogenesis of herpesviruses and HIV gene expression. Later at the NIH National Cancer In stitute, he studied the regulation of negative repressor factors on HIV replication. As Vaccine Director at Novavax, Inc., he deve loped platform vaccine technologies including virus-like pa rticles and subunit protein vaccines fo r human pathogens including influenza virus and tumor vaccines incl uding prostate cancer. Dr. Robinson also serves on World Health Organization (WHO) international expe rt teams on pandemic influenza vacci nes. Additionally, he continues to serve as an editorial board member and reviewer for several professional scientific and technical journals on virology, vaccines, public he alth, and biotechnology. "}
