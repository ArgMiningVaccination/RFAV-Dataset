Figures show that the poultry industry of Maine produces an annual volume of about $100 million. Maine's isolated geographical situation and the fact that the poul\u00ad try farms are located at rather great distances from each other creates an almost unique situation in regard to the epizootiology of the com\u00ad mon infectious avian diseases. The climate, with its long cold winters, forces the poultryman to build poultryhouses that are well insulated and can be heated economically. A three-story house either with windows for ventila\u00ad tion, or the modern windowless house with controlled environment has proved to be most practical under the circumstances. This hous\u00ad ing situation further decreases the spread of infectious diseases. Avian diseases such as Salmonella pullorum, fowl typhoid (Sal\u00ad monella gallinarum), infectious laryngo tracheitis (ILT) and fowl pox have for a long time been unknown in Maine. The quarantining of ILT and fowl pox infected farms together with strict regulations for the use of live vaccines have made eradica\u00ad tion of these diseases possible. Vaccinations against ILT and fowl pox are no longer necessary. Maine has been free of pullorum-typhoid for a number of years. Pullorum-typhoid testing, using the tube agglutina\u00ad tion test, has been performed at the University of Maine for 43 years, and at present about 2 million breeding hens are tested annually for pullorum-typhoid and no reactors have been found since 1961. Aside from producing many table eggs for the large population centers such as the Boston and New York area, Maine is one of the leading broiler producing states along the east coast of the U. S., with an annual production of about 50 million broilers, which is a little over 3% of the total U. S. production (approx. 1.5 billion broilers per year). The broilers are generally kept to 9-9 Vi weeks of age, when they weigh 3.5-4 lbs. When compulsory poultry meat inspection was initiated by the Agricultural Marketing Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1959, the disease problems of the broiler industry were considerably accentuated. During 1960-1961, more than 178 million pounds of poultry meat in Maine were graded and inspected, and of this amount ap\u00ad proximately 6 million pounds were condemned, mainly for chronic respiratory disease (CRD). (Chute et al, 1965) Chute (1964) devised a program with the cooperation of State 4 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 3-story broilerhouse in Maine. 3-story layinghouse for table-egg production in Maine. and Federal veterinary officials, for the elimination of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), at that time designated as S6PPLO, the major cause of CRD. The program consisted of 2 main points: 1. The serological examination of all basic breeder and broiler- breeder flocks for MG-antibodies. Due to the large volume of MG tests, the serum plate agglu\u00ad tination test appeared not to be satisfactory. In 1962, the FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 5 tube agglutination test was adopted in the pullorum laboratory of the department of animal pathology at the University of Maine. Most of the blood samples that arrived for the pullo- rum-typhoid tube agglutination test were tested simultaneously for MG. In this manner, approximately 500,000 agglutination tests were performed annually between 1962 and 1969. The first MG-free flocks were probably obtained by coinci\u00ad dence, although tests with egg dipping and chick inoculations with erythromycin were performed by Chute et al. (1965) From there on, it was not very difficult to reproduce many thousands of birds free from MG. The strict isolation procedures for established MG-free flocks. A specific pathogen free (SPF) program was initiated by Chute (1964) on a number of broiler farms. Twenty-eight strict sanitation rules virtually eliminated any contact of MG- free birds with possible sources of infection. It then appeared that most infectious avian diseases and parasites could b; eliminated in this manner. Feed conversion and condemnation rates were favorably influenced on SPF broiler farms: (Chute, 1964) Flock with PPLO and Infectious Bronchitis SPF Flock Av. Feed Conversion during 2Vi years of operation 2.78 2.18 Av. Condemnation 4.75% 1.01% However, certain infectious poultry diseases such as coccidiosis, Marek's disease, infectious bronchitis and avian encephalomyelitis have been proven to be almost impossible to eradicate, even under optimum conditions for disease prevention in regard to hygiene and isolation. The incidence of avian encephalomyelitis (AE) or epidemic tremor in young chickens has sharply decreased through the widespread use of live and killed AE vaccines in breeder flocks in Maine. The birds are usually vaccinated against AE between 14-18 weeks of age. How\u00ad ever, it appears that the acquired immunity of the breeder hens does not always give adequate protection during the whole laying period and AE outbreaks do occur in vaccinated breeder flocks. In these flocks, the only clinical symptom is a drop in egg production, following a spe- \\ 6 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPIRIMINT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 cine pattern, and subsequent clinical AE symptoms in the hatched progeny. In table-egg producing flocks, which are often not vaccinated against AE, the drop in egg production is the only symptom of AE in\u00ad fection that can be observed. These AE outbreaks tend to spread among most of the flocks that are serviced by the same egg collector. The joint use of the same egg boxes, which are not disinfected regularly, ap\u00ad parently is an effective method of transmission of the AE virus. In the diagnostic laboratory at the University of Maine, the following diagnos\u00ad tic tests have been routinely performed to establish an AE diagnosis: 1. Histological examination of hematoxylin proventriculus and pan\u00ad creas) from suspected animals. Histopathological examination is a fairly reliable method. In most cases of AE infection in young and mature birds, some specific microscopic AE lesions can be found. 2. Embryo susceptibility testing of fertile eggs from breeder flocks to test immunity status (unfit for table-egg producing flocks). Immunity challenge of embryonated eggs is usually performed by the inoculation of 10 20 EID, 0 of the egg-adapted \"van Roekel\" strain of AEV. It does not produce quantitative results as to immunity levels. In the course of the herein described investigations, three other diagnostic methods have been introduced: 3. Serum neutralization (SN) testing of bloodsamples. Using the SN test, attempts are made to demonstrate an increase in the neutralizing titer during a 2-week interval. Single bloodsamples from AE-vaccinated flocks are often not conclusive for the proper diagnosis of an AE outbreak. 4. Virus isolation from tissues of suspected birds by inoculation of embryonated AE susceptible chicken eggs and/or day-old chicks. Virus isolation attempts are successful only in a limited number of cases, especially when mature birds are involved. 5. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of frozen tissue sections from suspected chickens. The fluorescent antibody technique (FAT), which is reliable for the diagnosis of many avian respiratory virus infections such as infectious bronchitis, New\u00ad castle disease and infectious laryngotracheitis, often fails to be positive in the case of AE infections. In field outbreaks of AE in young chickens, only a limited number of cases showed FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 7 positive FAT reactions, and to date it has not been possible to diagnose AE in mature birds with this method. The widespread use of two commercial live AE vaccines, both of which have the Calnek strain AE virus as active ingredient, will un\u00ad doubtedly have caused the abundant presence of this virus strain among poultry populations in Maine. It has been observed in the diagnostic laboratory, that various cases of AE infections in the field in young chicks showed only minor histo- pathological lesions in routinely examined tissues, and it was difficult to diagnose such cases as AE. Examination of these tissues with direct FAT gave negative results usually. In view of the above mentioned factors it seemed purposeful to study the tissues of chickens experimentally infected with Calnek strain AE virus by comparative examination with FAT and histopathology. An investigation was conducted which compared the efficiency of the dif\u00ad ferent diagnostic methods used for the detection of AE infections, with special emphasis on the fluorescent antibody technique, as one of the quickest tests available for AE diagnosis. Also, methods were investigated to improve the reliability of this latter technique for the diagnosis of AE infection in mature chickens. Finally, the in vitro assay of AE virus in tissue cultures was investigated. SECTION 2 LITERATURE REVIEW A. Description of the Disease. Van Roekel (1965) described avian encephalomyelitis (AE) as an infectious virus disease of poultry, which in young chickens is charac\u00ad terized by symptoms of the central nervous system such as ataxia, in\u00ad coordination, paralysis or rapid tremors of head and neck. The mor\u00ad bidity is high, the mortality can vary and is usually caused by the af\u00ad fected chicks being unable to reach the feeders and being trampled by their less unfortunate penmates. AE also affects mature poultry, but most flocks show no signs of disease other than a possible drop in egg production. (Calnek et al., 1960-2, Taylor et al, 1955). The name epidemic tremor was given to the disease by Dr. Eliza\u00ad beth Jones (1932) who first observed the condition in 1930 in nine birds from Massachusetts and described it in detail. Van Roekel et al. (1936, 1937) studied the disease extensively and in 1938 he proposed 8 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 the name avian encephalomyelitis (Van Roekel et al., 1938-2) In 1939 the name avian encephalomyelitis (AE) was officially adopted for this disease by the special committee on poultry diseases of the AVMA (Beach, 1939). B. Geographical Distribution. The first cases of AE in chickens were found in the northeastern area of the United States. It has already been mentioned, that Jones (1932, 1934) found her first cases of AE in birds in Massachusetts. More epizootics followed in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut. (Van Roekel et al., 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941). Jungherr et al. (1942) described the increasing occurrence of AE in Connecticut between 1935 and 1941 and first reported AE cases out\u00ad side the New England area, notably New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, Indiana, (Doyle, 1939), Colorado, Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida. Later Feibel et al. (1952) reported the increased importance of AE in Arkansas, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio and West Virginia. It was concluded by Feibel et al. (1952) that the disease had spread gen\u00ad erally through the United States. Outside the USA, the incidence of AE was reported from Australia by Hart (1940) and Ranby (1959) and from Tasmania by Hardy (1961). From Japan, AE was reported by Iwai (1967) and from Korea by Lee (1958). In South America, AE was reported from Argentina by Smitsaart (1965) and from Brazil by Bueno (1964) and Soares (1968). Coles (1956) and Deom (1954) reported the disease from South Africa, and Zamberg (1966) from Israel. In Europe, the disease was first reported in England by Markson et al. (1955) and again by Markson et al. (1958) and Hemsley (1964), In France, AE was reported by Lucas et al. (1957) and later by Brion et al. (1959) and Guillon (1961-1). Van Meirhaege (1958) re\u00ad ported on AE in Belgium. In Spain, it was Aparici et al. (1961) who reported the occurrence of AE in imported chickens. Quaglio et al. (1962) and Papparella (1962) described AE outbreaks in Italy. In Scandinavia, the disease was reported first in Sweden by Lind- gren et al. (1957). From Finland, a report of an AE outbreak was published by Rislakki (1959) and Estola (1961). Badstue et al. (1959) reported on the disease in Denmark. In the Netherlands, cases of AE were already observed as early as 1948 (Roepke, 1948). Smits (1956) was the first, who transmitted FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 9 AE virus experimentally in the Netherlands. Hoekstra (1960) published the first report on AE in the Netherlands. About the same time, reports on AE came in from Austria (Guarda et al., 1959; Burtscher, 1960) and from Germany (Groth et al., 1961 and Dorn et al., 1963, 1964). Marek (1966) first reported AE in Poland. Further reports on AE came from Switzerland by Fankhauser (1961). Herceg et al. (1967) and Kralj et al. (1968) observed epizo\u00ad otics of AE in chicks in Yugoslavia. Malik (1969) reported on AE in Hungary. Generally, the above mentioned authors based their diagnosis of AE outbreaks on clinical symptoms, the histopathological lesions, some on the successful isolation of the virus and the demonstration of immunity by serology and the embryo susceptibility test. C. Incidence of AE in other Species. AE has been reported in other species besides chickens. Hill and Raymond (1962) found coturnix quail hens naturally infected with AE. Mathey (1955) and Hofstad (1958) reported the occurrence of AE in Mongolian pheasants. Turkeys and quail were reported susceptible to experimental inoculation with AE virus by Mohanty and West (1968-1). These workers also performed mouse inoculations with AE virus. The mice did not show clinical symptoms, but slight histopathological lesions were observed. Markson and Blaxland (1958) succeeded in causing histopathological lesions in the CNS of rabbits and mice after intra\u00ad cerebral inoculation of AE virus. Taylor (1957) propagated AE virus in turkey embryos. Olitsky (1939) found mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys re\u00ad tractile to AE virus; he tested only the clinical response. Van Roekel et al. (1940) reported the susceptibility upon inoculation of AE virus of turkey poults and ducklings. The same author reported white mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, mature pheasants and sparrows refractory for AE infection. Helmboldt et al. (1955) were unable to provide clinical or histopathological lesions in calves after intrathecal and intracerebral inoculation of AE virus. D. Seasonal Incidence. AE was observed during the winter months, mainly from January until June by Jungherr and Minard (1942). A marked seasonal incidence was reported by Markson and Blaxland (1958), who found most out\u00ad breaks occurring in hatched progeny from pullets which started produc\u00ad tion in late autumn. Schaaf (1958-2) observed a two year cycle of AE before 1949- 1950 in the large poultry company where he worked. Feibel et al. (1952) showed the monthly incidence of AE in Connecticut for three years which shows minor prevalence of the disease in the fall and an upsurge \\ 10 MMNE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 in the spring months. Manquat (1961) reported a maximum of AE out\u00ad breaks in the cold season in France. E. Vaccination against AE. Live Virus Vaccine. The fact that artificial exposure to AE virus might actually provide protection against subsequent challenge by intracerebral inoculation with AE virus was first recognized by Jungherr and Minard (1942), Schaaf and Lamoreux (1955) reported the first successful field control of AE. They observed after the severe AE outbreak of 1949-1950, that the progeny of a flock of old hens that had recovered were protected against the disease. From then on they ignored the recommendation to dispose of the affected breeders and vaccinated their prospective breeder flocks with the wing stab method, using a field isolate live virus vaccine (Schaaf, 1960). The vaccinated birds, when challenged with a heavy overdose of approx. 250 CLD. of AE virus intracerebrally, showed a mortality less than half of that in the unvaccinated control group. In later studies Schaaf (1958-1, 1960) investigated different methods of administration of his live virus vaccine and concluded that the intra\u00ad muscular route gave the best protection. When 100 CLD 30 were inocu\u00ad lated at 14-18 weeks of age, the losses were generally less than 1%. Oral administration of live vaccine gave reasonable immunity (Schaaf, 1958-1; Taylor, 1958; Von Bulow, 1965). Taylor (1958) evaluated oral administration of live AE virus through the drinking water and called it a promising method. It was Calnek and his co-workers (Calnek and de\u00ad veloped a suitable live virus vaccine for oral administration. They ad\u00ad vocated that oral vaccination of 1 % of the birds with approx. 100 MID was sufficient; once an infection is established within a susceptible flock, it runs its course as if it were a natural infection. Drinking water vacci\u00ad nation of all the birds was equally satisfactory. Hoekstra (1964) com\u00ad pared an endogenous Dutch strain of AE virus with the Calnek strain (strain 1143) and the van Roekel strain AE virus and he found no serological difference between the Dutch strain (H.A. strain) and the American strains. The H.A. strain appeared to be excellent for use as a live vaccine. Oral administration of the vaccine to 5-10% of a flock was found to give good immunity. (0.5 ml. per bird, the vaccine contained approx. 10 40 EID, per ml.). Von Bulow (1965) titrated two non egg-adapted AE vaccine strains and found the method of Hoekstra (1964) of inoculating chicken embryos and letting them hatch very satisfactory. Virus concentrations in whole embryos were at least as high as in embryo brain alone. When kept at 20-22 C. the virus titer dropped about 10-\u00b0 15 per week, FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 11 Lyophilization with 10% glucose added was possible but reduced the titer to one tenth. Inactivated Virus Vaccines. To eliminate the vaccination losses altogether, Schaaf (1959) de\u00ad veloped a beta propiolactone (BPL) inactivated vaccine. This vaccine stayed effective for 14 months at 4 :C. The best protection was obtained with a vaccine with pH. 7.4 and containing AL (OH),, 6.25% and 12.5% brain tissue; the best dosage was approx. 10 6-2 CLD-,, AE virus. Calnek and Taylor (1960-1) reported on vaccination with a BPL inactivated van Roekel strain AE virus vaccine. They obtained good results with two injections of approx. 4 x 10 5 EID, 0 killed virus, 5 weeks apart. They did not see any better results from adding AL(OH), to the vaccine, as Schaaf (1959) had found. Butterfield et al. (1961) reported good immunity in 16 weeks old pullets after intramuscular vaccination with BPL inactivated van Roekel strain AE vaccine. When 10 4-9 EID,, was injected the resulting immunity was just as good as when 10 5-6 EID, 0 was injected. A BPL inactivated van Roekel strain AE vaccine was prepared in England by Macleod (1965) from whole embryo harvest, which showed a high virus content (10 67 EID, (1). One dose of 10 56 EID 50 protected over 90% of the chickens. Butterfield et al. (1961) were the first to harvest whole embryos instead of just brain material as Schaaf (1959) and Calnek and Taylor (1960-1) had done. F. Classification of AE virus. Olitsky and Bauer (1939) defined the viral particle size of AE virus to be in the range of 20-30 m^. Wilner (1969) defined AE virus as an unclassified avian virus, which although incompletely characterized, appears to possess proper\u00ad ties of the enteroviruses. The following characteristics of AE virus were defined by Butter\u00ad field et al. (1969-2): Resistant to chloroform. Acid-stable, when held for 3 hours at pH 2.8. Resistant to pepsin and DNAse. Slightly sensitive to RNAse (titer drop from 10 62 per ml. to 10 5-5 per ml.) Specific gravity 1.33. Heat-stabilization by IM Mg CI,. Slight heat-inactivation (titer losses of 10 00 to 10 13 when at 56\u00b0 C for 1 hour). The size was found to be in the range from 16.5 to 25.0 m,a. On the basis of these characteristics, it was concluded that AE virus was an 12 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 enterovirus, belonging to the Picorna virus group. (Butterfield et al. (1969-2) according to the classification schemes of Cooper (1961) and Hamparian et al. (1963). SECTION 3 A. Clinical Symptoms. Methods for the Diagnosis of Avian Encephalomyelitis. Over the years, a number of diagnostic methods have been devised to detect an AE infection. Jones (1932) described the nervous symptoms of AE in the form of a pronounced and rapid tremor of the head and neck with, in some cases, an associated ataxia. Jones (1934) stated in her second report that this tremor becomes aggravated when the birds are handled or when the flock is excited, and that the tremor disappears in sleeping birds. Jungherr (1939) stated that only 53.6% of histologically positive cases of AE showed tremors with or without ataxia, while 36.9% showed only ataxia (9.2% showed no clinical symptoms at all). Jungherr and Minard (1942) again stressed the fact that clinical trembling occurs only in about one half of the cases, while the majority of the affected birds show ataxia (with or without trembling). Van Roekel (1938-2) observed that the course of the disease can be so rapid that the chick may appear normal one day, and exhibit a semi-comatose condition the next day. It is important to recognize the occurrence of the uncomplicated paretic form in flock outbreaks, be\u00ad cause such cases are likely to be incorrectly diagnosed (Jungherr and Minard, 1942). Cataract-formation is a frequently occurring feature of AE Infection. Van Roekel (1936, 1937) first drew attention to the incidence of blindness as a symptom of \"epidemic tremors\", following an opacity and bluish discoloration of the lens of one or both eyes. The eye ball ap\u00ad peared enlarged and the pupil seemed to be fixed. Peckham (1957) gave a detailed report of the histological lesions in 3-4 month old birds with cataracts. It included epithelial prolifera\u00ad tion of the lens and iridocyclitis. These birds had gone through an AE infection when they were two weeks old. Intraocular injection of eye material in healthy chicks failed to provoke the condition. Zander (1957) reported on the numerous cases of blindness in chickens of 8- 12 weeks old, which had been through an outbreak of AE when they were 3-4 weeks old. This blindness continued into the laying stage. It was possible to invoke AE symptoms in chicks after intracerebral in\u00ad oculation of ocular material. FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 13 Flowers et al. (1958) observed cataracts in birds as early as three weeks of age and as late as six months of age. Some of these birds had been through an AE infection at early age, but virus isolation procedures in chickens and chick embryos failed to prove an AE infection to be involved. Later, Bridges and Flowers (1958) reported that they had found sufficient clinical and histopathological evidence of AE infection in the chickens with blindness that were submitted to their laboratory; the in\u00ad cidence of cataract varied from 15% to 19% and the cataracts were accompanied by iridocyclitis. Brion et al. (1960) found cataracts associated with AE infection in chickens in France. Watson (1969) observed cataracts in cockerels in Australia after AE vaccination with a rather virulent strain. Barber and Blow (1963) studied the genetic susceptibility for AE-cataract formation and found positive evidence of a higher incidence in certain crosses. Halpin (1967-2) found cataracts in 41% of the chickens in a flock in England after an outbreak of AE. Cataracts in chickens from causes other than AE are mentioned by Bridges and Flowers (1958). They included Newcastle disease, influenza, and the ocular form of Marek's disease. In an excellent review, Mustaffa-Babjee (1969) re\u00ad ported on a great number of eye conditions in poultry. Cataract forma\u00ad tion was listed as caused by toxoplasmosis, leucocytozoon, influenza A virus, Newcastle disease, ocular lymphomatosis (Marek's Salmonella typhimurium; also dietary addition of 0.2% dinitrophenol (DNP); vitamin E deficiencies in parentbirds caused cataracts in turkey- embryos. CLINICAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS. The clinical symptoms of AE are not specific for this disease. Other diseases with a clinical picture resembling AE were reported by several workers. Jungherr (1936) observed that paralysis of chicks could also be caused by gout, crazy chick disease (vitamin E deficiency), A avita- minosis, G avitaminosis, neurolymphomatosis, and field encephalomal\u00ad acia. Dorn et al. (1964) stated that paralysis in AE contact infected birds was difficult to distinguish from Marek's disease paralysis. Pappenheimer et al., (1931. 1939) described the clinical behavior of chicks suffering from \"nutritional encephalomalacia\" (vitamin E deficiency); many birds became incoordinate and ataxic before they were completely prostrated, and chronic spasms of the legs and some\u00ad times coarse tremors were observed. Fritzsche (1952) mentioned the ataxia in encephalomalacia with turned heads and forcible movements 14 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 but without complete paralysis of legs and wings. In the end, the birds sit down with their heads between their legs. Dunlap (1932) observed ataxia in chicks with nephritis. The symptoms were the same as described by Pappenheimer and Goettsch (1931), and changes in kidneys and proventriculus were noted, grossly and microscopically. The uric acid content of the blood was increased, indicating impairment of the nitrogenous metabolism. Jungherr and Minard (1944) reported the similarity of clinical symptoms between avian pneumoencephalitis (Newcastle disease) and AE. Cottral (1952) reported on cases of \"jitters\" in germ-free chicks which showed the same symptoms as in AE, but it could not be observed in a contaminated control group of chicks and it could not be produced in these chicks by inoculation. Riboflavin deficiency (curled toe paralysis) in young chicks showed symptoms similar to AE, reported Zander (1959); adminis\u00ad tration of riboflavin cured this syndrome in 24 hours. In an earlier re\u00ad port, Zander (1957) drew attention to the differential diagnosis of poly\u00ad neuritis by Vitamin Bl deficiency and the nerve phase of Newcastle disease with AE infection. Badstue and Veiling (1959) also included perosis and rickets as a differential diagnosis. Cooperman et al. (1946) found an inconsistent influence of dietary thiamine levels on the suscepti\u00ad bility of chicks to AE infection. Zander (1959) reported on the transient paralysis syndrome which was occurring in several states of the U.S.A. This paralysis occurred in growing chickens between 6 to 12 weeks of age, sometimes up to 20 weeks of age. The legs or the neck appeared paralyzed, resembling botulism and AE. However, mouse and chick inoculations ruled out botulism and AE. Affected birds usually recover dramatically in 24 to 30 hours without recurrence of the condition and without any apparent abnormal after effect. Willemart (1966) and Willemart et al. (1967) described the same transient paralysis as occurring in France since 1962 and called it transi\u00ad tory paralysis. The paralysis was of very short duration, sometimes only a few hours. Recuperation was also spontaneous and complete. The con\u00ad siderable histological lesions were not in agreement with the mild symptoms. Atypical encephalomyelitis, as described by Willemart (1966) oc\u00ad curs at a later age than transient paralysis and the spastic leg paralysis appears more gradually. Morbidity and mortality are high, up to 20 and 10% respectively in a flock with atypical encephalomyelitis. The histological lesions, which are described in the next paragraph, resembled those of AE, encephalomalacia and Marek's disease. Equine Encephalitis (EE), a virus disease affecting equines and FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 15 birds, showed clinical resemblance to AE according to Van Roekel and Clarke (1939-2) in a pheasant flock. Olitsky (1939) however, observed specific differences with AE in the clinical picture of experimental EE in chicks. Dougherty and Price (1960) described the characteristic paraly\u00ad sis, sometimes accompanied by opisthotonus in ducklings with EE. B. Histopathology. The histopathological lesions of AE, which can be found in the central nervous system and visceral tissues of AE-affected chickens or mature poultry, are microscopical in nature. Gross lesions of AE have been reported by Jacquette (1961), as pinpoint whitish foci in the giz\u00ad zard muscle of some AE infected birds. Mohanty and West (1968-2) observed hydrocephalus and atrophy of the muscles in a few AE-infected chicks. Several authors have described the microscopic lesions of AE. These lesions are rather typical in appearance, although a differential diagnosis, as described below, should be considered. Lesions of AE in the Central Nervous System (CNS). 1. Nerve Cell Degeneration in the brain and spinal cord of chick\u00ad ens with AE has first been reported by Jones (1932). The neuronal degeneration resembles the \"axon reaction\" (Olitsky 1939), that is the type of neuronal degeneration which follows section of the axon. It can be found all through the CNS, but more extensively in the pons medulla and in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, espe\u00ad cially in the lumbosacral enlargement (Olitsky 1939). It can also be found in the mesencephalon and seldom in the diencephalon (nucleus ovoidalis). (Maas and Helmboldt, 1962). Jungherr and Minard (1942) and Van Roekel (1959) also described this \"axonar type of neuronal degeneration which is con\u00ad sidered the first and striking feature of AE infection. Swelling of the nerve cell body and the nucleus, nuclear eccentricity, tigrolysis and eosinophilia were observed (Jungherr and Minard, 1942). It can be found in the CNS even before other inflammatory lesions appear. Olitsky (1939) mentioned that some of the cells exhibit a bright red, round mass which is not the nucleus or nucleolus. This might be the same type of reaction as noted by Burtscher (1960) who reported that in acute cases of AE, the neurons may show condensation of Nissl substance with re\u00ad sulting eosinophilic enhancement. Purkinje cell degeneration in the cerebellum, first described by Jones (1934) was also reported by Markson and Blaxland (1958) and was considered an important feature of AE in chickens by Simpson (1957). On the other hand, Springer and Schmittle (1968) seldom saw Purkinje cell necrosis in AE. 16 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 2. Gliosis. Proliferation of microglia cells was first described by Jones (1934) as being a striking feature of AE histopathology in the CNS; also Tyzzer and Sellards (1941) stressed the diagnostic importance of these collec\u00ad tions of neuroglial cells. This opinion was later opposed by Olitsky (1939) and Jungherr and Minard (1942) who emphasized that the neuronal degeneration is more striking for AE than the gliosis. Jungherr (1939) and trocytosis and intervascular neuroglial proliferation, but they reported that most of the infiltrating cells failed to show neuroglial processes, and are most likely hyperplastic endothelial and adventitial cells, together with lymphocytic infiltration. Olitsky (1939) mentioned the occasional occurrence of small groups of glia cells, especially in chronic AE. Even satellitosis was some\u00ad times found where neuronal degeneration existed; Springer Schmittle found satellitosis neuronal degen\u00ad eration, unlike Mohanty and West (1968-2) who did not find satellitosis, A fociform proliferation of mixed glia cells is mentioned by Burtscher (1960, 1961) occurring mainly in the medulla and grey matter of the spinal cord, but also in the brainstem and in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. A diffuse or foci form gliosis in the nucleus dentatus of the cere\u00ad bellum appears to be specific for AE, more so than a diffuse gliosis in the molecular layer of the cerebellum which is not specific for AE. (Maas, Helmboldt, 1962) 3. Vascular and Perivascular Lesions. Perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells was first described by Jones (1934) and further reported by Jungherr (1939) as mural and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. Jungherr and Minard (1942) reported that even small lesions show mononuclear infiltration of the walls and the Virchow-Robin spaces of the capillaries. Olitsky (1939) saw the perivascular lymphocytic in\u00ad filtrations sometimes primarily in the brain, while the spinal cord was free from it. No lesions have been observed in the peripheral nerves by most authors. Jungherr (1939) found occasionally myelin degeneration in the sciatic nerves. Markson and Blaxland (1958) described degeneration of peripheral nerves, probably following the destruction of central neurons. Visceral Histopathological lesions of AE. Microscopic foci of hyperplastic infiltration with lymphoid cells in visceral tissues of AE-infected chickens was first described by Jones FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 17 (1932, 1934). It must be borne in mind however, that lymphoid follicles can be found in visceral tissues of normal chickens, because chickens have no topographically defined lymphatic system as mammals do. The hyperplastic foci are of two types: one rounded and sometimes sharply circumscribed and encapsulated by a delicate, capillarized, connective tissue membrane, the other more irregular with undefined boundaries. (Jungherr and Minard, 1942) The circumscribed lesions are considered more characteristic for AE. The pancreas may normally contain two or three irregular follicles in a section of about one-half inch in length, but the occurrence of num\u00ad erous sharply circumscribed follicles in AE is (Jung\u00ad herr and Minard, 1942) Lymphoid follicles in the muscular tissues of gizzard and proventri- culus are considered to be of diagnostic significance, because these or\u00ad gans are normally free of lymphfollicles. (Jungherr and Minard, 1942). In the myocardium, the foci were described as infiltrative by Jones (1934), pushing away the muscle fibers. Jungherr and Minard (1942 stated, that the lymphoid infiltrations in the heart muscle should be de\u00ad finite follicles to be of any diagnostic value. It was their opinion, that visceral lesions alone are not considered to be diagnostic for AE, unless accompanied by specific lesions in the central nervous system. They report that in experimental cases the visceral lesions are less pronounced than the spontaneous cases. Many times they are even ab\u00ad sent. It has been concluded generally by widespread experience that his- topathological examination of brain, pancreas and proventriculus can adequately substantiate the diagnosis of AE. Examination of the lumbosacral part of the spinal cord and pan\u00ad creas without further examination of other tissues as suggested by Mark- son and Blaxland (1958) must be considered inadequate (Maas and Helmboldt, 1962). HISTOPATHOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF AE. The histopathological lesions which are described above are, al\u00ad though very suggestive of AE, not exclusive or pathognomonic for the disease. Jones (1934) already pointed out, that lymphoid cell infiltrations of a similar nature as in AE are encountered in many pathological condi\u00ad tions in chickens, although she considered the infiltration in the pancreas in AE unusual. Olitsky (1939) mentioned that the neuronal degeneration in AE resembles the axon reaction which follows section of the axon, but is 18 MMNE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 also observed after anesthesia or a toxic action and in cases of neuritis, even after mechanical stimulation. Tyzzer and Sellards (1941 ) considered the gliosis as an important feature of AE to distinguish it from Marek's disease, but this was later denied as not holding true by Jungherr and Minard (1942). In an excellent report, Maas and Helmboldt (1962) reviewed the histopathological differential diagnosis of AE with other clinically related diseases such as encephalomalacia, Newcastle disease, and \"Edema in Chickens\", and also with two histopathologically related diseases, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Marek's disease. Encephalomalacia (crazy chick disease), which is mainly caused by Vitamin E deficiency in young chicks bears a striking resemblance clinically with AE, yet the histopathological lesions are different from those in AE infection. Pappenheimer and Goettsch (1931) and Pappenheimer et al, (1939) reported that the lesions of encephalomalacia were essentially found in the cerebellum and consisted of: Edema with separation and disruption of cellular and fibrillar elements. Furthermore degeneration and necrosis of the Purkinje cells was observed with loss of Nissl's substance and pycnosis of the small cells which make up the granular layer of the cerebellum. A characteristic feature were the small hemorrhages scattered through the central white matter or in the central zone. Hyaline thrombi were observed in the capillary blood vessels in the necrotic areas. The cerebellum also showed gross lesions, such as swelling, softening and reddish or brownish discoloration. Chronic cases of encephalomalacia show a fibrosis of the cere\u00ad bellum, especially in the molecular layer (Jungherr, 1949). This fibrosis may already occur in early cases of encephalomalacia and this led Jungherr to suspect that the deficiency is already present in the parent birds and is passed on in the egg (Jungherr, 1936-2). Wolf and Pappenheimer (1931) observed the early stages and the fibrosis in the cerebellum of the same birds and assumed that the brain was subjected to repeated or continued insult. Typical for encephalomalacia seems to be an increase in blood vessels with adventitial proliferation and intervascular gliosis. This phenomena has been found especially in the deeper parts of the corpus striatum, the medulla, mesencephalon, and the thalamus. (Jungherr, 1949) FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 19 Newcastle Disease. Besides the respiratory involvement of Newcastle disease (ND) which distinguishes this ailment from AE, the microscopic brain lesions were also distinctly different from those of AE (Jungherr and Minard, 1944). The central nervous myelin localized meningitis, \"endotheliosis\", neuronal changes The neuronal changes were not of the \"axonal\" type but much more of the \"peripheral neuritis\" type, with disintegration of the cytoplasm, vacuolization and even coarse irregular fibrillation. Furthermore, Jungherr and Minard (1944) reported that the lesions of ND were found mainly in the spinal cord, medulla, cerebellum, and thalamus, in contrast with those of AE, which are often found in the optic lobes and the cerebral hemispheres. Jungherr and Minard (1944) emphasized that the glia foci which were considered typical for AE by Jones (1934) appeared not to be as important as the perivascular mononuclear infiltrations. Alimentary Toxemia or Chicken-edema. Maas and Helmboldt (1962) reported that a condition which is known as \"edema in chickens\" disease or alimentary toxemia showed a strong resemblance clinically with AE, at least at the onset of the disease. Hydropericardium and hydroperitoneum, swollen liver and kidneys were the necropsy findings of Schmittle et al. (1958) in this disease. They indicated that a toxic substance in a certain fat caused the condition. Sanger et al. (1958) reported about alimentary toxemia in chickens, which showed gasping followed by a wobbly and unsteady gait, followed by the above described gross lesions, of which the ascites could amount up to 500 ml. of fluid. Sanger et al. (1958) reported on the histopathological lesions of this condition and mentioned degeneration of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum as one of the findings. However, the striking gross pathology will probably not cause serious difficulty distinguishing alimentary toxemia from AE. Marek's Disease. The basic difference histopathologically between Marek's disease and AE from a diagnostic standpoint is the presence of lymphoid cell proliferation in the peripheral nervous system in Marek's disease. In the brains, vascular infiltrations primarily of lymphocytes were described by Maas and Helmboldt (1962). They reported also on the histopa\u00ad thological features of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection in chickens; meningoencephalitis was seen with edema and an increasing 20 MAiNt AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 number of histiocytes and lymphocytes in the meninges. The meningeal capillaries show an increase in size. In the brain, enlarged blood vessels can be found, caused by endothelial hyperplasia, and perivascular lym\u00ad phoid infiltration was present in many cases. As has been mentioned above, Willemart (1966) described two diseases in chickens which show a resemblance with AE. The first was transitory paralysis, which showed a spectacular paralysis which lasted only for a few hours in most cases: Recovery was spontaneous and com\u00ad plete. Considerable perivascular mononuclear infiltrations in the brain existed, the foci were sometimes so big that they could be seen with the naked eye. They were found in the grey as well as in the white matter of the brain, and were accompanied by some neuronal degeneration. The cause is still obscure. The second condition was atypical encephalomyelitis, where the paralytic stage appeared more gradually than in transitory paralysis, and lasted longer, usually a few days. Histopathologically, a capillary con\u00ad gestion with hyperplasia of wall was observed. Perivas\u00ad cular mononuclear \"cuffing\" was present and often some edema in the Purkinje cell layer of a few cerebellar convolutions. Neuronal tigrolysis was observed. The peripheral nervous sysytem also showed perivascular \"'cuffing\" as well as the liver and the gizzard musculature. Willemart (1966) con\u00ad sidered the microscopic lesions of these two conditions similar to those found in encephalomalacia, AE and Marek's disease. Virus isolation attempts did not give any results. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis has been described in poultry by Siller and Wight (1965). A perivascular reaction was ob\u00ad served after injection of adjuvant and other allergens. Lipton and Steigman (1961) also produced allergic encephalomy\u00ad elitis in chickens by subcutaneous inoculation of spinal cord tissue. The chickens showed ataxia and paralysis and histological lesions included mononuclear cell foci and gliosis in the supporting tissues of the brain and spinal cord. Equine Encephalitis. Equine encephalitis (EE), has been reported in birds, including chickens, in different parts of the United States (Luginbuhl et al., 1958; Karstad et al., 1957, Roekel and Clarke, 1939-2; 1958). EE has been compared with AE by Olitsky (1939) and Van Roekel and Clarke (1939-2). Olitsky (1939) found the viruses of eastern EE and AE to be entirely different agents although their virus size was about the same (20-30 nty). EE was found to induce typical encephalitic lesions in pheasants with necro- FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 21 sis primarily in the rostral portions of the brain, distinctive from experi\u00ad mental EE in chicks (Jungherr and Wallis, 1958). Simpson et al. (1959) reported EE in pheasants, found encephalitis with lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, thickening of the walls of blood vessels, lepto- meningeal infiltration with lymphocytes and neuronal degeneration. Dougherty and Price (1960) described the histological lesions of EE in ducklings. The most consistent lesion was edema of the white matter in the spinal cord. Lymphocytic leptomeningitis was occasionally found in cerebrum or cerebellum. A mild gliosis was usually present. An exact diagnosis of EE in birds showing nervous symptoms was generally made by virus isolation and serum neutralization, as has been described by Van Roekel and Clarke (1939-2), Kissling (1958), Karstad et al. (1959), and Dougherty and Price (1960). C. Serology. Olitsky (1939) first demonstrated AE antibodies in the blood serum of chickens that recovered from an AE infection. This serum neutralization (SN) test was conducted by intracerebral inoculation of virus serum mixtures into AE susceptible chicks. Jungherr and Minard (1942) successfully used the same method of inoculation in a SN-test. Complement-fixation by Jungherr (1942) failed to give positive results. A hemagglutination inhibition test could not be developed by Halpin (1966-1) because AE virus failed to show hemagglutination (HA) activity as enteroviruses of other species do (Kern and Rosen, 1964). Chick embryo adaptation of AE virus would simplify the serum neutral\u00ad ization testing. Feibel et al. (1951, 1952 ) had already tried unsuccessfully to adapt the 135th chick passage van Roekel strain AE virus to chick embryo by yolk sac, chorio-allantoic membrane, allantoic and intra-amniotic inoc\u00ad ulation. This strain of AE virus was isolated by van Roekel (1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942) and was passed 125 times in chicks by van Roekel in 1942. Jungherr at al. (1956) first reported the successful chicken em\u00ad bryo adaptation of the van Roekel strain of AE virus using the intra\u00ad ocular route. Serological use of this strain of AE virus was then developed by Sumner et al. (1957-1) also using the intraocular route. This van Roekel strain of AEV showed specific changes upon intraocular inoculation in the chicken embryos in the first passage, and in 15 subsequent embryo passages the same pattern of embryo changes was seen. To standardize the reading of the test, Sumner et al. (1957-1) 22 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 recognized three degrees of embryonic involvement at 7-10 days post- inoculation (after inoculation of 9-11 day old embryos): a. Sluggishness, if the embryo could not move its legs but could still swallow; b. Inactivity, if it could not move at all but was still alive as deter\u00ad mined by persistent heart beat; c. Death, if no chorioallantoic veins were visible on candling. Virus neutralizing substances were demonstrated in adult serum, egg yolk, and in serum of progeny from a flock whose embryos gave low virus titers of 10-1-8 or lower. (Sumner et al., 1957-1) Wills and Moulthrop (1956) were successful using the yolk sac inoculation method of chick embryos for the propagation of a field strain of AE virus. Calnek and Jehnich (1957) used this simplified inocula\u00ad tion method for egg adaptation of the van Roekel strain of AE virus. With this method, a serum neutralization (SN) test was successfully developed by Calnek and Jehnich (1959-1). They obtained virus titers exceeding 10 5 EID rj. They found that an average neutralization index of 2.6 after vaccination of birds corresponded with a sufficient protec\u00ad tion so intracerebral challenge with 10,000 EID )0 AE virus. Hutson (1964) reported that the SN test for AE has been used with variable results and is not considered sufficiently accurate for routine diagnosis. Moore and Flowers (1959) developed an embryo lethal strain of AE virus after 20 embryo passages. They stated that such a strain simpli\u00ad fied the SN test considerably because embryo mortality was easier to read than dwarfing or embryo lesions. Gentry (1970) observed discrepancies between serum neutraliza\u00ad tion titers in flocks and their actual protection against challenge. D. Embryo susceptibility test. When Jungherr et al. (1956) and Sumner et al. (1957-1) egg- adapted the van Roekel strain of AE virus by the intraocular route of infection, they noticed varying titration results depending on the source of eggs. They concluded the possibility of AE immunity of the flock from which the eggs yielded a low virus titration. In their second report, Sumner et al. (1957-2) showed that in the eggs of certain flocks, the development of embryo resistance to AE virus coincided with a drop in egg production in these flocks and the hatching of AE infected chicks from the eggs. This important finding was the basis for the embryo susceptibility test for AE. A disappointing feature of their work was the high number of \"ac\u00ad cidental survivals and deaths\" when titers were low. (Sumner et al., 1957-2). FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 23 Taylor and Schelling (1960) simplified the embryo susceptibility test by using the yolk sac method of inoculation and one standard dose of AE virus, (10 35 EID,, per embryo rather than a series of ten-fold dilutions). Calnek et al. 1961-1) used a lower dose of 100 EID,,, per embryo. Since then, this embryo susceptibility test has been extensively used to examine breeder flocks for AE immunity. Chute et al. (1962) used the test in a survey of AE status in breeder flocks in Maine. When AE immunity prevails in a flock, the egg-adapted AE virus is neutralized by the antibodies in the yolks of the eggs of such flocks, thereby providing a test which does not necessitate the drawing of blood samples (Calnek et al., 1961-1; Taylor et al., 1960). The egg-adapted van Roekel strain of AEV shows a fairly constant titer. MacLeod et al., (1965) used 10 25 EID,,, instead of the dosage of 10 35 EID, devised by Taylor and Schelling (1960). Dorn and Kronthaler (1963) titrated the AE test virus in their em\u00ad bryo susceptibility test from 10 2 to 10 6. Their brain material had a titer of 10 62-1064 EID-. Therefore they preferably considered a titer-range between ICH-'-lO\" 4-5 for the determination of embryo susceptibility, rather than fixing the susceptibility immunity threshold at 10-3-5 (100 EID-,, per 0.2 ml.) which was recommended at the AE control com\u00ad mittee meeting by Calnek et al., (1961-1). Calnek et al., (1961-1) had suggested this on the basis of their fairly constant AE test virus titer of 10\" 55. But, as mentioned above, Dorn and Kronthaler (1963) found a much higher titer (10 6-2 to 10 6-4 EID-, n per 0.2 ml.) in their AE test virus, and so did many other workers. Burke et al. (1965) found a titer of 10 6-4 EID S0 using the van Roekel strain. In our laboratory the van Roekel strain usually has a titer of 106-2- 106-5 EID 5 per 0.2 ml. Limitations of the Embryo Susceptibility Test: Greuel (1963) advocated a titration of the test virus instead of the inoculation of a standard dose because inoculation of a relatively high dilution might lead to false results of the embryo susceptibility test. This author also advised to titrate the test virus frequently in AE susceptible eggs to establish the exact titer of the virus. Halpin (1966-1) considered the disadvantages of the embryo susceptibility test to be, that it takes some days to perform and during this time the immune status of the flocks being tested may have altered because of intercurrent infection with AE. Also, he considered it a cum\u00ad bersome test which needs a great deal of incubator space. The key problem however is considered by Halpin (1961-1) to be the requirement of AE susceptible eggs as controls, which are not always obtainable. 24 MAINH AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 AE susceptible flocks have appeared to become infected very easily with AE because of the ubiquity of the virus and the ease of entrance of infection even under fairly strict quarantine conditions. E. Virus Isolation. Suspected field cases of AE can be diagnosed by attempting to isolate AE virus from suspected chickens. Jones (1932) and Olitsky (1939) first used experimental intra\u00ad cerebral inoculation of susceptible chickens for this purpose. The chickens were observed for the development of clinical symptoms of AE after inoculation. Feibel and Jungherr (1951) developed a technique for virus preparation from brain material. It consisted of shaking the brain ma\u00ad terial with glass beads for two hours followed by centrifugation. Oral administration of infected droppings into susceptible day-old chicks was successfully used by Calnek et al. (1960-2). He also used intracerebral inoculation of susceptible day-old chicks to isolate AE virus from brains of AE-infected chickens for diagnostic purpose. Hoekstra (1964) used this method at first, but changed to yolk sac inoculation of susceptible 5-day incubated chicken eggs, after which the chicks were hatched and then observed for clinical symptoms which appeared generally before 10 days of age, in some cases even in the first few days. Therefore, this author considered it necessary to determine the ID. at 10 days post inf. at the latest. Van Roekel (1941-2) found clinical evidence of AE immediately upon hatching in a few chicks hatched from AE-inoculated eggs. The majority of the chickens showed symptoms by the 8th day after hatching. It must be mentioned here that Yates et al. (1960) found nervous symptoms in chicks, hatched from eggs, which were inoculated with adeno (CELO) virus. This might be especially confusing when virus isolation is attempted from birds which show a drop in egg production, as this symptom may also be caused by adenovirus (Berry, 1969). Calnek (1960-2) considered the possibility of clinical symptoms of AE in contact-infected chicks after 11 days post infection. Other workers (Osborne, 1969) measure the ID r, at the mo\u00ad ment when the inoculated birds show good clinical symptoms and the contact controls are still negative. With some strains of AE virus, this point will be reached at 12-15 days post-infection; Markson et al. (1958) found an incubation period of 2-4 weeks after day-old intracerebral inoculation of chicks with brain material from field cases. The isolation of AE virus from suspected chicken tissues as a diag\u00ad nostic means was reported to be difficult by Simpson (1958). The major problem appeared to be to harvest adequate quantities FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 25 of virus from the tissues of naturally occurring cases. Intracerebral inoc\u00ad ulation into susceptible chicks with a suspension of suspected infective material produced gross evidence of disease only in 1 to 71% of the cases. Schaaf (1957) reported the often disappointing results with virus isolation by the inoculation of healthy young chickens. He advocated good success with brain material from early cases that have been down for only two or three days. The demonstration of chicken embryo pathogenecity is not always successful with AE virus-isolates. Jungherr and Minard (1942) found that out of 19 virus isolations in 9-15 day incubated chicken embryos, only 11 showed embryo patho\u00ad genecity in the first passage, while only five could be passed serially. As stated above, Jungherr et al. (1956) later successfully adapted an AEV strain by intraocular infection of chicken embryos. Calnek (1960-2) re\u00ad ported two isolates which did not produce any lesions in infected em\u00ad bryos after 4-8 passages in chicken embryos. Feibel et al. (1952) could not adapt their AE virus-strain to chick embryos after 11 chick to embryo zig-zag passages. Later, Jungherr et al. (i956) successfully adapted an AE field isolate using the intraocular infection of chicken embryos. Butterfield et al. (1969-2) stated that an average of 12 passages was necessary to adapt 19 field isolates of AEV to produce lesions in chicken embryos. Wills and Moulthrop (1956) successfully adapted a field strain of AEV in 12 serial passages using yolk sac inoculation. This method was also used by Calnek and Jehnich (1957) to egg-adapt the van Roekel strain of AEV, as has been mentioned under paragraph C. Moore and Flowers (1959) found dwarfing already in the second passage of their field isolate in chicken embryos. Unfortunately, other viruses do show embryonic changes when inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs. CELO virus appears to be a major difficulty in this context (Yates et al., 1957). CELO virus can be distinguished from AE virus by virus neutralization tests with specific antisera. (Chomiak et al., 1960) F Fluorescent Antibody Technique. The fluorescent antibody technique (FAT), as developed by Coons et al. (1942), has been applied to study a number of infectious poultry diseases, such as Newcastle disease (Burnstein and Bang, 1958; Corst- vet and Sadler, 1964; Maestrone and Coffin, 1964), bronchitis (Mohanty et al., 1964) and infectious laryngotracheitis (Braune and Gentry, 1965; Van Der Heide et al., 1967). The demonstration of AE antigen in the tissues of AE-infected 26 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 chickens was first reported by Cheville and Monlux (1966) who com\u00ad pared histopathologic and FAT examination procedures to study the cerebellar lesions of AE infected chickens receiving a Vitamin E de\u00ad ficient diet. They found the earliest detectable fluorescence in the cyto\u00ad plasm of the Purkinje cells. It was observed by them that the develop\u00ad ment of the AE infection was not enhanced in chicks when Vitamin E deficient diets were fed, but rather was AE infection inhibited by such a diet. Mohanty and West (1968-2) correlated the histopathological changes in the central nervous system of experimentally infected chicks and the multiplication and spread of the virus as demonstrated by FAT. They inoculated a mixture of van Roekel and Schaaf strains intra- cerebrally, which is reflected in their results: They found positive FAT reactions in the brain cells until 18 days post-infection, the first fluo\u00ad rescence was observed in the cytoplasm of the neurons in the inoculated cerebral hemisphere at 24 hours after inoculation. The distribution and intensity of the fluorescence were correlated mainly with severity of the neuronal degeneration, but not with gliosis, perivascular cuffing or mononuclear cell infiltration. Braune and Rothenbacher (1969) reported on the use of the FAT for the study of the pathogenesis of an experimental AE virus infection in chicken embryos and day-old chicks. It appeared that infected chicken embryos gave negative FAT results until they were hatched, after which the tissues of the hatched chicks yielded positive immunofluorescent reactions. Moulton and Coggins (1968) described FAT results with African swine fever (ASF) where tissues from mature pigs which were experi\u00ad mentally infected with ASF virus did not show positive FAT reactions, while the tissues from ASF infected young piglets gave positive immuno\u00ad fluorescence with anti-ASF conjugates. Colgrove et al. (1969) could not detect specific immunofluores\u00ad cence in tissues from pigs infected with African swine fever, until rela\u00ad tively high titers of virus were found in the tissues. No reports have been found in the literature regarding the immunofluorescent reactions in tis\u00ad sues from mature AE-infected poultry. FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 27 SECTION 4 Egg-Production Losses During AE Outbreaks in Poultry Flocks A. Introduction. [Literature]. Taylor et al. (1955) drew attention to a sharp decline in egg pro\u00ad duction in mature breeding hens in connection with AE infection. Eggs produced just before and during the period of depressed egg production showed decreased hatchability and an increased embryonic mortality during the last three days of incubation. AE virus was recovered from the chicks hatched. The average length of egg laying pause of 324 trap- nested hens was 5.9 days. Sumner et al. (1957-2) noticed the decreased susceptibility for AE virus of eggs from a flock which experienced a drop in egg production. AE virus titers of 10- 4 or higher were obtained in sus\u00ad ceptible eggs, while eggs from \"decreased production\" flocks did not titer higher than 10\"1-8. They observed a rather long period of production de\u00ad crease of about 4 weeks length. Dorn et al. (1964) observed a quickly decreasing egg production which was under the normal level for about 11-13 days with an absolute minimum of only one day. One flock had a drop in production from 62 to 209c. Willemart (1965-1) observed egg production drops in an AE-in- fected flock which decreased in about two weeks from 46 to 37%, then increased very slowly and never came back to a normal level. The whole crisis took about five weeks. Another flock dropped in two weeks from 66 to 58.5% egg pro\u00ad duction, then came back to normal in eight weeks time. For this flock of 3150 hens, Willemart estimated the egg loss at approximately 114,000 eggs. Halpin (1967-1) reported an average drop in egg production of 18% during an AE outbreak in six breeder flocks. The average num\u00ad ber of eggs lost per hen was 2.6. A prodromal period of five days in which the production dropped an average of 6% was followed by a sharp dip of five days, to an absolute minimum at about the 13th day. Then a sharp rise brought the production back almost to normal (80%) in one week. Total duration of production drop was about two weeks. The \"pro\u00ad dromal\" period appeared to be of importance in the control of outbreaks of AE among the chicks hatched from the eggs. Hemsley (1964) reported a 10% fall in egg production in 10 flocks and a 5% fall in hatchability. He also noted an increase in the propor\u00ad tion of small eggs, a fall in fertility, and an increase in the proportion of cull chicks. Average loss per hen was calculated at 0.9 egg. Ousterhout et al. (1963) reported a precipitous drop in egg pro- 28 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 duction in two flocks with AE (64% and 46% drop respectively) with recovery in two weeks. Likewise, Richey (1962) observed a 50% drop due to AE in a flock with recovery in two to three weeks. He concluded that by the time the AE infection shows up in the hatched progeny, (after three weeks incubation), the eggs then being laid by the hens are no longer infected, Zander (1959) came to the same conclusions; he reported that when the drop in egg production is not marked, the AE infection is apparently spreading through the flock much more slowly and there may be a pro\u00ad longed egg transmission period. B. Case Studies. During the early part of 1969, a widespread occurrence of egg pro\u00ad duction losses was reported from Washington County in Maine. In a group of approximately 15 table egg producers, at least 10 flocks showed a drop in egg production without any clinical disease symptoms. In September 1969, another group of egg producers around Port\u00ad land, Maine observed a drop in egg production in their flocks. In both instances, the egg producers involved shared a common egg collector. The empty egg boxes were returned to the poultry houses without ster\u00ad ilization or disinfection. Most of the houses had a floor operation, al\u00ad though a few of them had the laying birds in cages. A typical example of an outbreak in one of the floor operated table egg producing flocks is represented in fig. 1 and table 1, where the pro\u00ad duction data of this flock are depicted. This flock of about 3450 birds was housed on two floors of a poul\u00ad try house, which were connected with a wooden staircase. Each floor was divided in two pens. Figure 1 shows that pens 1 and 2 on the top floor had the AE outbreak at the same time and pens 3 and 4 on the Table 1 Normal Avg.

No explanation could be found for the fact that the top floor showed the outbreak first. The owner always entered the house downstairs, so a beginning of the outbreak would have been expected at the bottom floor. The total number of eggs lost during the AE outbreak in this flock was calculated at approximately 7850 eggs. The egg price in January, 1969 was approximately 50c per dozen, consequently the owner lost about $327.00 due to this AE outbreak. In cage layer operations, the production data showed a different pattern. The AE infection apparently spread at a slower rate and conse\u00ad quently the production losses seemed to be less spectacular at first glance, although the total amount of eggs lost was about the same as in the above described floor operated flock. 30 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 According to one owner, during and after the decrease in egg pro\u00ad duction was observed, a large number of thin shelled eggs were collected Diagnostic Procedures: Four birds were taken from the previously described flock, showing the typical pattern of decrease in egg production. In the diagnostic lab\u00ad oratory, two birds were killed after a blood sample was taken, and the other birds were bled and left alive. The following tests were performed on the two killed birds: 1. Direct fluorescent antibody technique on frozen cryostat sec\u00ad tions from brains, proventriculus and pancreas. (For methods, see Section 5 C.) 2. Histopathological examination of formalin-fixed paraffin-em\u00ad bedded sections of the same tissues as under 1., stained with hematoxylin eosin. 3. Virus isolation attempts in AE susceptible chicken embryos and day old chicks of brain material from the killed hens. 4. From the bloodsamples of all four hens, which were collected with heparin, plasma was separated by centrifugation and ex\u00ad amined with a serum neutralization test, using the egg-adapted van Roekel strain of AEV. Two weeks later, the remaining two birds were killed after a blood sample was drawn from each, and the same four tests were performed on these two hens. The results of the four tests are represented in table 2: Table 2 Two hens killed on arrival Two hens killed 14 days later 1. Direct Fluorescent Antibody neg. neg. neg. neg. 2.

FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 31 The AE test-virus for the serum neutralization test was proven to be free of CELO virus. This ensured that no CELO antibodies in the tested hens would be incriminated as anti AE antibodies. Virus isolation from pooled brain material by inoculation of 6-day embryonated AE susceptible chicken eggs which were subsequently hatched and the chicks observed for the development of clinical signs of AE (Hoekstra, 1964) did not yield satisfactory results: out of 15 eggs inoculated, six chicks hatched. One chick showed slight ataxia at five days of age, but was negative histopathologically. The other five chicks were clinically AE negative at 14 days and also histopathologically and FAT negative. The tissues examined were brains, proventriculus and pancreas. Low hatchability with the above mentioned method has also been reported by Hoekstra (1964). The cause of death of the embryos is virtually impossible to establish as the tissues are readily autolysed and unfit for FAT or histopathological examination. The results can be sum\u00ad marized as follows: (1). An outbreak of AE has occurred in this flock as demonstrated by a rise in AE antibody titer; (2). The histopathological lesions were limited to perivascular mon\u00ad onuclear infiltration in sev\u00ad eral circumscribed lymphoid foci in the pancreas of another bird. These lesions were, although limited, indicative of an AE infec\u00ad tion; (3). Virus isolation from pancreas tissue in chicken embryos produced AE embryonic lesions in the first passage; virus isolation from brain material was unsuccessful. The positive embryos from the first pancreas passage did not yield any embryo lesions in seven subsequent passages in chicken embryos. It has been mentioned before that Jungherr and Minard (1942) also found positive em\u00ad bryo lesions upon AE virus isolation in the first passage in 11 out of 19 cases, but subsequent passages were only successful in five of these 11 cases. They concluded, that these results were prob\u00ad ably caused by low virus concentrations in the original material. (4). Virus isolation in chicken embryos, which were subsequently hatched, was unsuccessful. This method can be used well for test\u00ad ing of tissues from AE infected young chicks (Hoekstra, 1964), but has failed so far when tissues from mature AE infected chick\u00ad ens were tested. (5). The direct fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) yielded com\u00ad pletely negative results, using a standard anti van Roekel-strain AE conjugate. In order to investigate on the efficacy of the direct FA testing of 32 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 suspected tissues for AE diagnosis, a number of cases which came into the laboratory were tested with direct FAT and some other diagnostic methods. The FAT involved brain, proventriculus and pancreas. The results are given in table 3. Table 3 Diagnostic Sample FAT Histopath. Exam.

In six cases, a positive AE diagnosis was made by either histopatho- logical examination, virus isolation or serum neutralization tests, but could not be confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody procedures. It was not possible to produce a positive fluorescent antibody reaction with AE infected tissues from mature hens. C. Possible causes of negative immunofluorescence in AE infected poultry. The phenomena of negative immunofluorescence, when fluorescein conjugated antisera against the van Roekel strain AE virus are re\u00ad acted with tissues of AE infected mature poultry, might be associated with a number of factors: 1. Possible antigenic strain differences might exist among AE virus strains. This might make a standard anti-van Roekel- strain AE conjugate incompatible with serologically unrelated AE antigen in infected tissues, leading to negative FAT results. This factor is investigated and reported on in Section 5. 2. The AE virus might be present in tissues, which had not yet been examined routinely by the FAT. The fact that mature AE infected chickens do carry and shed AE virus in their feces and eggs, has been well documented (Calnek et al., 1960-2). Spe\u00ad cial emphasis should thus be placed on the FAT examination of the tissues involved with the intestinal function and also the FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 33 kidneys and the ovary for the presence of AE antigen, rather than only the routine FAT examination of brain, proventriculus and pancreas. Section 6 reports on an investigation into this matter. 3. The AE virus might be present in the infected tissues in such low quantities, that it is undetectable by direct FAT. Virus-infected cells will synthesize viral ribonucleic acid (RNA prior to the production of new virus particles (Holland and Hoyer, 1962). If it were possible to detect the intracellular viral RNA following AE infection by means of specific anti-RNA fluorescein conjugated antisera, it might help to overcome the disappointing FAT results described above. An investigation into this matter would involve the isolation of RNA from AE virus and the production of anti-AE-RNA antisera in chickens. Phenol-extracted viral RNA was found to be high\u00ad ly immunogenic by Fishman and Adler (1967). If the RNA would act as an immunogenic template resulting in the formation of anti-RNA antibodies, this would offer a possibility of a successful FAT reaction. The preparation and testing for infectivity of RNA extracts from AE virus, preparation of anti-AE-RNA conjugates and their results in direct FAT are described in Section 7. SECTION 5 Investigations on the Existence of Serological Differences between A E virus Strains. The serological relationship between local field isolates of AE virus and the egg adapted van Roekel strain has been demonstrated by various authors. It has been generally held, that the Calnek strain AE virus would provide a fairly uniform protection against the danger of an AE in\u00ad fection in various parts of the world. However, AE outbreaks in vaccinated flocks have occurred regular\u00ad ly in Maine and the possibility of immunogenic strain differences in AE was again brought up by avian pathologists in Maine. Butterfield et al. (1969-2) neutralized 19 field isolates of AE virus with van Roekel strain antiserum and found no significant differences between the neutralization indices. However, all these field isolates originated from outbreaks in eastern Connecticut and might have had the same virus strain origin. The possibility that the negative FAT results with tissues of AE infected mature hens were caused by the existence of serologically un- 34 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 related AE virus strains seemed to justify a serological study of blood- samples from various field outbreaks of AE in Maine. A. Serum Neutralization Tests with Sera from Field Outbreaks. Pooled serum samples from birds of three different flocks which were not vaccinated against AE and that had been through an AE field outbreak were tested against three different AE virus strains. All three virus strains were egg adapted; one (strain 82) was isolated from an AE outbreak in Georgia, the second (UM) was present in the diagnostic laboratory of the University of Maine and the third was the egg adapted van Roekel strain AE virus (originating from the University of Connecti\u00ad cut). The results of the serum neutralization tests are given in table 4), No significant differences could be found between these three AE virus strains, or between the \"recovered\" antisera. B.

Forty bird-doses (manufacturers directions) were administered in one gallon of drinking water to the 20 birds. The birds were bled at seven weeks post vaccination and the serum tested with the serum neutralization test against the van Roekel strain and the 82 virus strain AE virus in susceptible chicken embryos and against the Calnek strain of AE virus in AE susceptible day-old chicks (intracerebral inoculation). In the chicks, the serum neutralization titers were read at 12 days post inoculation, when the chicks that were inoculated with tenfold virus dilutions showed overt clinical symptoms of AE, while negative controls in the same pen were still clinically negative. The results are given in FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 35 table 5. The results indicate, that there is no significant difference in neutralization effect of the anti-Calnek-strain antiserum upon the three AE virus strains used.

Fluorescent Antibody Technique in Experimentally AE In\u00ad fected Day-old Chicks. In order to compare the fluorescent antibody reactions between tissues infected with different AE virus strains when reacted with anti van Roekel strain fluorescein conjugated antisera, the 100 day-old AE susceptible white-mountain chicks (NI of five samples was < 1) were treated as follows: Group I: 25 chicks inoculated orally with approx. 10 5-2 CID 50 AE virus, Calnek strain, in 0.5 ml. Group II: 25 chicks infected intracerebrally with approx. 10 4-2 AE virus, Calnek strain in 0.05 ml. Group chicks inoculated intracerebrally with approx. 2.104 EID- AE virus, van Roekel strain in 0.05 ml. Group IV: 25 chicks uninfected controls. Group I and II were housed in separate pens in the same isolation unit while group III and IV were each placed in separate isolation-units. 36 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 Starting at four days post-infection, one chick was taken from each of the four groups, and the following tissues taken for examination: pan\u00ad creas, proventriculus, ventriculus, thigh muscle, heart, brain and spinal cord. The tissues were examined with direct fluorescent antibody tech\u00ad nique (FAT) of frozen sections using fluorescein conjugated anti-AE globulins (obtained from Dr. M. O. and histopathological stained with hematoxylin eosin. For examination with the direct FAT, the tissues were sectioned frozen using an international cryostat microtome, the sections were mounted on glass slides and air dried. After air drying, the slides were fixed in acetone for 10 minutes at -20\u00b0 C and then air-dried again. A drop of specific anti-AE conjugate was applied to the section and re\u00ad acted for Vi hour in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C. Then the slides were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 minutes and rinsed in distilled water for one minute. (For formula PBS, see page 66.) The slides were then covered with a coverslip, using glycerol in PBS (7:3 ratio) as a mounting fluid. They were examined with an American-optical UV microscope, using a HbO 200 mercury vapor light source, a UG 1 exciter filter, an OG 1 barrier filter and an immersion dark-field condenser. The FA re\u00ad sults are represented in tables 6, 7, and 8. The FA results show, that conjugates against the van Roekel strain of AE virus react well with homologous antigen in infected tissues as well as with the Calnek strain antigen. Tables 6 and 7 indicate that oral or intracerebral infection of day-old chicks with Calnek strain AE virus does not cause any major difference in the distribution of AE antigen in the tissues. Two features were apparent: 1. The FA reactions appeared early, well before clinical symp\u00ad toms started, while they were mainly negative during the period of clinical AE infection. This is important from a standpoint of diagnostic value of the FAT. 2. The chicks infected with the Calnek strain AE virus showed the majority of specific fluorescence in the visceral tissues, such as pancreas, proventriculus, ventriculus and heart. Whether this AE virus strain was inoculated intra-cerebrally or ad\u00ad ministered orally, the viscerotropic character of the Calnek strain AE virus was equally apparent (table 7 shows a little more fluorescence in the brain than table 6, probably due to the intracerebral route of inoculation). The van Roekel strain of AE virus showed a much more profound reaction in the central nervous system and less immunofluorescence in FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 37 Table 6 GROUP I: 25 day-old chicks each orally infected with approx. 10 5-2 CID. 0 of Calnek- strain AE virus.

This finding correlated with the clinical symptoms in the experimental groups:! Groups I and II (Calnek strain-AE infected) showed less severe ataxia and incoordination than Group III (van Roekel strain-AE infected). After 11 days post-infection (p. i.), the tissues of the Calnek strain infected chicks remained negative with the FAT until the end of the investigation at 21 days p. i. However, the chicks showed ataxia and in\u00ad coordination until the end of the investigational period. Also at 20 and 21 days p. i. AE virus could still be isolated from their brains (demon\u00ad strated by intracerebral inoculation of brain material into day-old AE susceptible chicks which caused clinical symptoms of AE in these chicks). The tissues of the negative control chicks remained FA negative during the entire period of investigation. Results of Histopathological Examination. The occurrence of histopathological lesions in the chicks in groups I, II and III is represented in Tables 9, 10 and 11: FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 39 AE immunofluorescence in Purkinje cell of cerebellum after infection with Calnek strain AE virus.

AE immunofluorescence in pancreas of chick after oral infection with Calnek strain AE virus. When the histopathological lesion pattern is compared with the FA results, it can be observed, that the appearance of AE antigen in the various tissues, as demonstrated with the FAT, usually preceded the histopathological lesions, notably the perivascular mononuclear infiltra\u00ad tions. These infiltrations are usually considered the \"footprints\" of a 40 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 AE immunofluorescence in inner longilu- Mononuclear infiltration of tudinal layer of in the proven- after oral infection with Calnek strain triculus of AE-infected chick, 13 days pi AE virus) Immunofluorescent reaction in the pancreas of AE- crcas of AE-infected chick, 6 days p.i. infected chick, days p.i.

Guillon (1961-2) described this effect as the elimination of the virus by the encephalitic reaction. The chicks in groups I and II (Calnek strain infected) generally showed a more pronounced visceral lesion-pattern than the chicks in group IH (van Roekel strain infected). The chicks of group III clearly exhibited FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 41 the neurotropic properties of the van Roekel strain AE virus, with the main lesions in the central nervous system.

One prominent histopathological feature however, showed up in all three infected groups: an abundance of degenerated neurons in the lum\u00ad bar region of the spinal cord. Starting at seven days p. i., neuronal degeneration was observed main\u00ad ly in the motor nerve cells in the ventral horns of the spinal cord. This phenomena has been described by various authors (Burtscher, 1961; Markson and Blaxland, 1958; Mohanty and West, 1968-2); but these authors observed the spinal cord lesions mainly in connec\u00ad tion with similar lesions in the cerebrum-cerebellum. In the chicks of groups I and II (Calnek strain infected) however, the spinal cord lesions were generally pronounced, while the lesions in the cerebrum-cere\u00ad bellum were minimal (occasional perivascular lymphoid infiltrations, in mesencephalon and medulla ob\u00ad longata; gliosis in the molecular layer of the cerebellum). In the diagnostic laboratory, many field cases of AE have been presented lately, where routine examination of brains, proventriculus and pancreas show minimal lesions indicative of AE. In view of the above mentioned results it might be advisable to include the lumbar portion of the spinal cord in the routine histopathological examination for the diagnosis of AE. The neuronal degeneration consisted of swelling of the nerve cell, margination of the Nissl substance and the nucleus and subsequent \"hyaline\" degeneration and ghost-cell appearance. Early pycnosis of nerve cells with increased chromatin density and clumping of Nissl substance, as reported by Burtscher (1961) was not observed. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations and gliacell-accumula- (satellitosis) gradually started to accompany the neuronal degen\u00ad eration, and after 17 days p. i. only the latter two lesions could be ob\u00ad served in the spinal cord until the end of the investigation in groups I and II (group III not studied beyond 12 days p. i.). The visceral lesions that were observed consisted of: 1. An increased number of lymphoid foci, circumscribed and infiltra\u00ad tive, in the pancreas. More than two foci in a section with a diameter of VA \" was considered significant. The chicks in groups I and II (Calnek strain infected) showed 3 to 24 foci (average: 7 foci), mainly after seven days p. i., while in group III (van Roekel strain infected), 3 to 6 foci were observed (average: 4 foci) after 10 days p. i. 2. The proventriculus showed mononuclear infiltrations in the circular and inner longitudinal layer of the muscularis only in the chicks of FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 43 groups I and II (Calnek strain infected), and not in the chicks of group III (van Roekel strain infected). It was readily observed, that the first mononuclear infiltrations ap\u00ad peared in the internal longitudinal layer of the muscularis, and it was there, that the first immunofluorescent reactions also occurred.

The gizzard and heart musculature showed substantial mononuclear infiltration in both groups I and II (Calnek strain infected). The chicks of group III (van Roekel strain infected) showed only slight mononuclear infiltration in the heart muscle at five and six days p. i., but not reaction in the gizzard. The thigh muscle showed hardly any reaction in two of the three infected groups (I and II) and no re\u00ad action at all in group III. No histopathological lesions were observed in the negative control group other than an occasional single lymphoid follicle in the pancreas (never more than one in a cross section) and one or two perivascular \"cuffs\" in the cerebrum of a chick at 13, 15 and 17 days of age. These lesions were never accompanied by neuronal degeneration, gliosis or any other lesions in any tissue and might be attributed to the develop\u00ad ment of Marek's disease in the birds (another group of the same birds later developed Marek's disease). SECTION 6 FA Reactions with Various Tissues of AE-infected Mature Poultry. In Section 4, the possibility was suggested that AE antigen might be present in certain tissues of AE infected mature chickens which have not yet been examined routinely with FAT. A. A first experiment which was conducted with experimentally AE-infected mature hens showed that cerebrum, cerebellum, proventri- culus and pancreas, which tissues are routinely examined with FAT as diagnostic procedure, did not reveal any immunofluorescence during a 20-day period postinfection. This experiment involved three groups of AE susceptible hens (NI = 1.5 avg.) Group I: 35 three months old white leghorn pullets each infected orally with approx. 10 6-2 CID S0 Calnek strain AE virus. Group II: 15 nine months old white leghorn hens each infected orally with approx. 10 62 CID- 0 of Calnek strain AE virus. Group III: 19 two months-old white leghorn pullets as uninfected controls. Group I and II were housed in batteries in the same isolation-unit, group III was housed in a separate isolation-unit. Every day starting at one day p. i., one bird was taken from group I, and every other day one bird from group II and III. The birds were sacrificed and frozen sections of cerebrum, cere- FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 45 bellum, proventriculus and pancreas reacted with conjugate (for prepa\u00ad ration of the conjugate, see section 6 C.). Other parts of these tissues were fixed in formalin, paraffin-sectioned and the sections stained with hematoxylin eosin and examined for histopathological AE lesions. Al\u00ad though the tissues of birds in group I and II showed no immunofluores\u00ad cence during the entire investigational period of 20 days, the typical histopathological lesions of AE appeared in all four examined tissues of these birds as early as 11 days p. i. The lesions consisted of peri\u00ad vascular mononuclear infiltrations, mainly in the mesencephalon and the oblongata. Lymphoid infiltrations were found in the cir\u00ad cular and inner longitudinal layer of the muscularis of the proventriculus and in the pancreas numerous lymphoid follicles, both circumscribed and infiltrative, were found. No clinical symptoms of AE were observed. The egg production was very irregular in these birds and because of the small number of birds under study, no specific drop in egg production could be detected. It has been documented by Calnek et al. (1960-2) that mature hens which were orally infected with AE virus excreted AE virus in their feces and eggs. Therefore it was thought conceivable that AE virus might be detectable by FAT in the tissues involved with the intestinal function, the kidneys or in the ovaries. Hopefully one or more of these tissues might be useful for the FA diagnosis of AE infection in mature hens. B. This possibility was further investigated in the following ex\u00ad periment: Twenty-five 16-month-old AE susceptible White Leghorn hens (susceptibility tested with embryo susceptibility test of the eggs of this flock, titer 10\" 62) were divided into two groups: Group I: 17 birds were each infected orally with approx. 10 6-2 CID- 0 Calnek strain AE virus. Group II: 8 uninfected control birds. The two groups were housed in separate isolation units. Starting the second day p. i., one bird of group I was sacrificed daily and one bird of group II every other day. The following tissues were examined: Cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, proventriculus, ventriculus, liver, with lymphoid plexus, bursa of Fabricius remnant, and ovary. One half of the tissues was cryostat-sectioned and examined with direct FAT, using anti-AE conjugate. The other half of the tissues were fixed in formalin and hematoxylin eosin stained slides were examined for histopathological lesions of AE. 46 MUNI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 Results. No immunofluorescence was observed in any of the above men\u00ad tioned tissues during the entire period of investigation. Histopathological lesions were observed however. The lesions in the central nervous sys\u00ad tem consisted of perivascular mononuclear infiltrations; no neuronal degeneration was observed. The lesions in the proventriculus and pan\u00ad creas were minimal, and could be ignored; occasionally a lymphoid in\u00ad filtration couIJ be seen in these tissues. C. Fluorescein Conjugated Anti-AE antiserum (Anit-AE Conjugate). The anti-AE conjugates used in the above described and subsequent experiments were prepared following a modification of the methods of Coons et al. (1942) as described by Braune and Gentry (1965): Four 5-month-old birds were hyperimmunized by four weekly intramuscular inoculations with approx. 10 65 EID r of van Roekel strain AE virus with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. (For formula of incom\u00ad plete Freund's adjuvant, see page 67.) Fourteen days after the 4th in\u00ad oculation, the bircs were completely bled with the addition of 1 ml. 1% heparin per 40 ml. blood. After centrifugation of the blood, the plasma was harvested, pooled and stored at -20\u00b0C. A sample of the plasma pool was tested for antibody titers against AE, Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB), and CELO virus. After thawing of the plasma pool, an equal volume of cold saturated ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the plasma, while the suspenion was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer in an ice bath. The precipitate that formed was separated by centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge (International refrigerated centrifuge) at 12,000 G for 10 minutes, the supernatant was then decanted and the pellet resuspended in distilled water to the original plasma volume. Again equal volumes of cold saturated ammonium sulfate were added in the same manner as the first time; after centrifugation and re- suspending of the pellet, a third similar precipitation was carried out, the final pellet being resuspended in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, for formula see page 66). This solution which contained the gamma globulin fraction of the A\u00a3-antiserum and also ammonium sulfate, was dialysed for seven days against PBS in a dialysis membrane (dialysis membrane, Fisher Comp.) with daily changes of PBS. After seven days, no more sulfate-ions could be detected when Ba Cl drops were added to the dialysing PBS solution, after acidifying the PBS with 0-1N HC1. The gamma globulin solution was then examined for protein content FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 47 with the Bi-uret test (Unitest analyser, Bio Dynamics Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.) and the solution standardized at 5 mg. protein per ml. The pH was changed to 9.3 by adding carbonate bicarbonate buffer solution. (For formula see page 66.) Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was then added in a ratio of 0.035 mg. FITC per mg. protein, and the mixture magnetically stirred at 4' C for 12 hours. The unconjugated FITC was separated from the conjugated gam\u00ad ma globulins by passing the solution through a Sephadex Column (Sephadex G25 coarse, Pharmacia, Piscataway, N. J.) using PBS (pH 7.4) as an eluant. Finally, the working dilution of the conjugate was determined by reacting parallel cryostat sections with a series of two-fold dilutions 1 to 2 through 1 to 16. The dilution which can be used best will show adequate specific fluorescence {2-\\- to 4+) without background fluores\u00ad cence of the surrounding tissue. It should be added that the prepared conjugates were left refrigerated for two more weeks, during which precipitates would develop in the solutions. These were centrifuged at various intervals. When no more appreciable amounts of precipitate de\u00ad veloped, the conjugates were dispensed in 5 ml. amounts (concentrated) and stored at -20 : C. The SN tests showed the plasma to be free of antibodies against XD and CELO. A high anti-AE titer (neutralization index >6) was present, but also an anti-IB titer (neutralization index = 3.1). There\u00ad fore, whenever this anti-AE conjugate was used, parallel sections of the tissues under study were reacted with specific anti-IB conjugates to test absence of IB antiaens in these tissues. SECTION 7 Experiments With Nucleic Acid from AE Virus A. Introduction. (Literature) The virus of AE has been classified as an enterovirus by Butter- field et al. (1969-2) based on chemical and physical characteristics, as described in section 2 F, page 11. Enteroviruses contain ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their infectious genome; the treatment of AE virus with ribonuclease (RN ase) after it has been exposed to pepsin digestion led to a titer decrease from 10 6-2 EID 50 to 10 5-5 EID- j0/ml while desoxyri- AE virus titer (Butterfield, 1969-2). The separation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in its com\u00ad ponent parts, protein and infectious ribonucleic acid was effectuated with cold phenol by Gierer and Schramm (1956). 48 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 Schlegel (1960) isolated RNA from TMV infected tobacco leaves with phenol which was as much as 6.6 as infectious as extracts of similar leaves prepared without phenol. Isolation of infectious RNA from animal viruses was first reported by Colter et al. (1957) who extracted infectious RNA from polio virus-infected suckling hamster brains, and by Wecker and Schafer (1957) from eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mouse brains. In each instance the infectivity of the RNA was demon\u00ad strated in vivo. Alexander et al. (1958) described experiments in which infectious RNA extracted from polio virus produced a cyto-pathogenic effect in tissue cultures. Infectivity of extracted RNA, unlike that of ma\u00ad ture virus, was completely inactivited by RNase, but not by the globulin fraction of homologous antiserum. Schlegel (1960) also found that the isolated infectious RNA was 10-100 times more sensitive to RNase in- activation than virus in tissue homogenates. Wecker (1959) found that cold phenol treatment of cells infected with western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus yielded infectious RNA, but purified mature virus failed to yield RNA with this treatment. On the other hand, when mature virus was treated with phenol at 50\u00b0 C, in\u00ad fectious RNA was obtained from the virus. Wecker postulated that the lipid coat of mature WEE virus is resistant to cold phenol degradation, accounting for this difference between intra-cellular material and mature virus. However, Coxsackie viruses, which do not contain lipid, also ap\u00ad peared to be resistant to RNA extraction with cold phenol but were readily degrated by phenol at elevated temperatures (Mattern, 1962). This finding therefore cannot be interpreted at Wecker (1959) did (Schaffer, 1962). Unfortunately most workers found RNA to be much less infectious than whole virus. Gierer and Schramm (1956) found RNA extract of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to have less than 1% of the infectivity of the whole TMV virus. Alexander et al. (1958) reported that when the RNA extract of polio virus was diluted in hypertonic salt solution, rather than in isotonic salt solution, the infectivity for cell culture monolayers was greatly en\u00ad hanced. B. Host susceptibility of virus RNA [Literature] Polio virus-RNA was infectious to certain mice, which were not susceptible to the whole virus when inoculated intra-cerebrally (Sprunt etal., 1959). Virus could be harvested from the site of inoculation but could not be detected at other sites in the inoculated animals. The quantity of virus obtained was usually about 100 to 150 times the number of plaque forming units of RNA inoculated, which suggested a single cycle of growth in the foreign host animals. It was interesting to note that the FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 49 progeny virus was not able to infect the host in which it was produced. For intramuscular inoculations of viral RNA, Sprunt et al., (1959) favored hypertonic salt solutions (lM.NaCL) of RNA, because isotonic saline seemed to reduce the RNA titers considerably. Unfortunately, RNA in hypertonic salt solution was lethal to the mice when inoculated intracerebrally, so for this purpose isotonic salt solutions had to be used. Koch et al. (1960) postulated that hypertonic salt solutions and an alkaline pH of approximately 8 was optimal for a maximum infectivity of cell culture monolayers with polio virus RNA. C. Experimental design. In Section 4. the desirability has been expressed to demonstrate the intracellular viral RNA of AE by means of specific anti-RNA fluorescein conjugated globulins, although Alexander et al. (1958) had found, that globulins against whole virus did not inactivate infectious RNA. This seems logical because the viral nucleocapsid binding sites are removed or altered by the phenol treatment. Even if phenol-extracted RNA from AE virus would not be infectious, the RNA might still act as an immunogenic template. Butterfield et al. (1969-2) reported on the non-infectivity of cold- phenol-extracted RNA from AE virus for chicken embryos and day-old chicks. They did not mention however, how they arrived at that con\u00ad clusion. A study was undertaken to determine if RNA extracted from AE virus with hot and cold phenol and in isotonic resp. hypertonic saline would be infectious, and then, in the case of non-infectivity, if the AE- RNA would act as antigenic agent, leading to the formation of anti- AE-RNA IgG antibodies upon its inoculation in mature chickens. D. Preparation of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) from AE virus. AE-RNA was prepared by a modification of the cold phenol ex\u00ad traction method of Gierer and Schramm (1956) and Alexander et al. (1958) as described by Smull and Ludwig (1962). A small quantity (approx. 10 ml.) of van Roekel strain AE virus suspension (infected chicken embryo brain suspension) was mixed with an equal volume of water-saturated phenol (Merck reagent-grade phenol 500 grams added to 200 ml. distilled water) in a screw cap test tube and shaken by hand for four minutes. Chilled materials and equipment were used. The mixture was then centrifuged for three to five minutes at 800 G to separate the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was then removed, mixed with another equal volume of water-saturated phe\u00ad nol, shaken for one minute and again centrifuged. A third extraction was carried out the same way as the second one. The final aqueous layer was extracted five times with more than equal volumes of ether, in order to remove traces of phenol. Residual ether was removed by 50 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 bubbling pure nitrogen gas through the final aqueous solution for approx. 10 minutes. Half of the RNA preparation was diluted 1:5 with sterile isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS, for formula see page 66), the other half was diluted 1:5 in sterile hypertonic phosphate buffered saline (1 M. NaCl + 0.04 M. Na,,HPO pH 7.2), as described by Alexander et al. (1958). AE-RNA extracts were also prepared with hot phenol (at 50\u00b0C). All manipulations in this extraction were done at room tempera\u00ad ture instead of in the cold, but the same methods were used as described above. The final RNA solutions were also made 1:5 in isotonic and hypertonic phosphate buffered saline solutions. Ultraviolet absorption rates were determined for the isotonic RNA solutions extracted with hot and cold phenol, using the Beckmann DB Spectrophotometer. The results are represented in table 12 and fig. 2. Table 12 Ultra Violet light absorption rates for RNA solutions in isotonic Phosphate Buffered Saline. Wave length Cold phenol extracted Warm phenol extracted in m u RNA absorption rates RNA absorption rates Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 Dilution 1 3 Dilution 1:5 0.54 0.50 0.48 290 0.25 0.25 0.25 300 0.10 0.12 0.15 Wecker (1959) described that UV absorption curves of RNA ex\u00ad tract from western equine encephalitis virus was characteristic of RNA, having a 258-280 m^i ratio of about two. Table 12 shows that the 260:280 m^ ratio is approximately two for all three RNA samples. Therefore it can be concluded that the UV absorption curves of the three samples are characteristic of RNA. E. Testing for inactivity of RNA from AE virus (AE-RNA) for day-old chicks. EI. In an initial experiment, 30 one-day old AE susceptible (NI = 1.2) White Mountain chicks were inoculated intracerebrally with a cold phenol extracted RNA solution from a van Roekel strain AE infected chicken embryo brain suspension. This RNA extract had showed a UV absorption rate with a 260-280 m/u ratio of 2, characteristic of RNA. FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 51 2\"0 250 260 270 280 290 300 WAVELENGTH OF U.V. LIGHT IN m/x FIGURE 2, UV ABSORPTION CURVES OF PHENOL EXTRACTED RNA FRCM/M VIRUS Another group of 30 day-old chicks was held as negative con\u00ad trols in another pen in the same isolation unit. At 9, 13, and 21 days post-infection, bloodsamples were SN tested for AE antibody titers and brains, proventriculus and pancreas of a few (3-4) chicks examined for histopathological lesions of AE. No clinical symptoms of AE were observed during the 21 day period of investigation. The bloodsamples showed no antibody titer increases against AE virus (NI = 2). However, slight microscopic lesions were observed in the chicks killed at J3 days post-infection, that were similar to AE lesions and could not be found in the control group. The ob\u00ad served lesions were perivascular mononuclear infiltrations mainly in mesencephalon and medulla oblongata and several lymphoid foci in the pancreas. E2. It was further investigated how the difference in infectivity of AE-RNA for day-old chicks would be between extracts made with \"hot\" and \"cold\" phenol and between final RNA dilutions 1:5 in isotonic hypertonic salt and \"hyper.\") Seventy-three day-old AE-susceptible 0.4) were treated as follows: 52 MAIN^ AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 Number of chicks II 5 4 13 3 5 4 8 4 2 2 4 2 6 RNase Route of inoculation (i.m. = intramuscular, i.c. = intracerebrally) i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. i.m. i.m. i.m. i.m. i.m. i.e. amount Ribonuclease (Nutritional Biochem.

Corp.) added at 100 ug/ml at room temperature for Vi hour before inoculation. The chicks were housed in two pens in the same isolation unit. Results At 0 days post-inoculation (p. i.) the tissues from several chicks were negative histopathologically. At 10 days p. i. several chicks showed faint symptoms of ataxia; although all were able to walk around, they seemed to lose balance when standing. These chicks were bled and brains, proventriculus, pan\u00ad creas and spinal cord were examined histopathologically; and the same tissues from some other chicks examined with FAT and brain-material inoculated into AE-susceptible six day-embryonated chicken eggs. Thirty-one chicks were examined histopathologically. representing all the major RNA preparation and dilution methods. All were com\u00ad pletely negative in all the tissues examined. The FAT and virus-isola\u00ad tion methods gave also negative results. It must be concluded therefore, that RNA-extracts from AE virus are not infectious for day-old AE-susceptible chicks. The results of section 7, El must have been non-specific and the clinical symptoms in the last experiment might have been caused by the inoculation trauma. F. Testing for Infectivity of AE-RNA for chicken embryos. Fl. In an initial experiment, 0.2 ml. of RNA-extract from van Roekel-strain AE virus was inoculated route (YS) 10 six-day embryonated AE-susceptible chicken eggs, then further incubated and the embryos examined for lesions of AE at 17 days incu\u00ad bation (11 days post-inoculation). A few embryos showed a slight decrease in movement (sluggish\u00ad ness) and a pinkish discoloration. F2. In a second experiment, 60 six-day embryonated AE-suscep\u00ad tible chicken eggs were divided into four groups: FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 53 Group I: 15 eggs inoculated via YS route with 0.2 ml. AE- RNA (cold phenol-extracted); Group II: 15 eggs inoculated via YS route with 0.2 ml. AE- RNA (cold phenol-extracted), which was pretreated with ribonuclease 1 mg/ml. for 30 min. at room temperature; Group III: 15 eggs inoculated via YS route with 0.2 ml. AE- RNA (cold phenol extracted), which was pretreated with desoxyribonuclease 800 fig/ ml. for 30 min. at room temperature; Group IV: 15 eggs inoculated via YS route with 0.2 ml. PBS (negative control group). At 11 days post-inoculation the embryos were examined and found normal of movements, size and color. F3. In order to further investigate the difference in infectivity between AE-RNA extracts prepared with hot and cold phenol and be\u00ad tween final RNA dilutions in designated as \"hyper\" and \"iso,\" the following experiment was conducted: 12 groups of 9 six-day embryonated AE- susceptible chicken eggs were inoculated via the YS route with 0.2 ml. of RNA \"hot-hyper\", RNA \"hot-iso\" RNA \"cold-hyper\" and RNA \"cold-iso\" and with samples of these four types of extract pretreated with RNase or DNase (added at 100 ^g/ml. for 30 min. at room tempera\u00ad ture before inoculation). Two groups of eggs (6 each) were inoculated with 0.2 ml. PBS and hypertonic saline respectively. At 17 days incubation (10 days post-inoculation) the embryos were examined for lesions of AE. None of the embryos showed evi\u00ad dence of AE-infection. It is therefore concluded, that RNA extracts from AE virus, whether they are extracted with phenol at 4\u00b0C. or 50\u00b0C., or whether they are diluted in hypertonic (1 M.NaCl) or isotonic saline solution before inoculation, are not infectious for chicken embryos or day-old chicks. If the RNA extracts can act as an immunogenic template upon ino\u00ad culation in mature chickens, the production of an anti AE-RNA conju\u00ad gate for use in the detection of intracellular viral RNA by FAT would be feasible. G. Preparation of Fluorescein Conjugated anti AE-RNA anti\u00ad serum. Four 20 week-old White Mountain hens were given four weekly intramuscular inoculations with 1 ml. RNA solution undiluted with 1 ml. incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Fourteen days after the fourth inoculation, the birds were com\u00ad pletely exsanguinated with the addition of 1 ml. heparin 1% per 40 54 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 ml. blood. After centrifugation, the plasma was harvested and tested as described in section 6 C. One of the birds showed perivascular lym\u00ad phocytic infiltrations in the cerebrum, suggestive of AE, but these lesions could have been caused by the incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The serum-neutralization test revealed virtually no antibodies against AE virus (NI was 1.5), and an antibody titer against IB (NI was 3.6), Therefore, in subsequent experiments where this anti AE-RNA conju\u00ad gate was used, parallel slides were reacted with specific anti-IB conju\u00ad gates to demonstrate the absence of IB antigen in these tissues. The preparation of the conjugates was accomplished with the same method as described in section 6 C. In two subsequent experiments, the anti AE-RNA conjugate was tested with tissues of day-old chicks and mature birds experimentally AE infected. H. FA Reactions with Anti AE-RNA Conjugate in AE-Infected day-old chicks, as compared with Anti AE-Conjugate Reactions. In this experiment, 90 day-old Red Rock sex linked chicks were divided into three groups. Group I: 30 day-old chicks inoculated intramuscularly with approx. 10 4-7 EID 50 van Roekel strain AE virus in 0.2 ml. Group II: 30 day-old chicks infected orally with approx. 10 53 CID50 Calnek strain AE virus in 0.2 ml. Group III: 30 day-old chicks uninfected as negative controls, The chicks showed some maternal antibodies against AE (NI was 2.0). All three groups were held in separate isolation units. Starting at one day post-infection (p. i.), one chick was taken each day until 19 days p. i., sacrificed and cerebrum, cerebellum, proventriculus and pan\u00ad creas examined by anti-AE conjugate and anti AE- RNA conjugate. Portions of the same tissues were formalin-fixed and paraffin sec\u00ad tions stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological examination. Results Probably because of the presence of maternal antibodies against AE in the chicks used in this experiment, the clinical symptoms started later in the two infected groups (I and II) than in experiment 5 C. There was also much variation in the moment of onset of clinical symp\u00ad toms. From seven days post-infection, every day one or two chicks started showing clinical symptoms and it was from those chicks, that one was taken each day and examined with direct FAT and histopath- ologically. This had a notable effect on the results of the FA reactions with FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 55 anti-AE conjugates as can be seen in tables 13 and 14. It seems in the results in tables 13 and 14. that the immunofluorescent reactions occur after the clinical symptoms have started and not before that moment as was observed in experiment 5 C, where fully AE-susceptible chicks were used. Table 13 Group I: 30 chicks infected intramusc. with van Roekel-strain AE virus (104-7EID.)

(* Degree of fluorescence, see table 6 at page 37). When the period of variation in clinical onset was over, which was at 12 days p. i. in Group I and at 14 days p. i. in Group II, the FA reactions were generally negative while most of the chicks showed clinical symptoms (ataxia and incoordination). In Group I, at 14, 15 and 17 days p. i., probably a chick was sacrificed and examined, that had just started to show clinical symp\u00ad toms and was therefore still showing positive immunofluorescence in its tissues. The striking feature in the positive reactions in both infected groups was the bright fluorescence in the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (especially in Group I, van Roekel strain infected) and an abundance of fluorescence in the pancreas, (especially in Group II, Calnek strain infected). Positive fluorescence in the cerebral nerve cells and the muscularis of the proventriculus was relatively seldom seen in this experiment. In the molecular layer of the cerebellum, loose fluorescent particles 56 MAINI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 could also be observed, but intmcytoplasmic fluorescence, like in thi Purkinje cells, is always of more diagnostic value than loose fluorescen particles. In Group I generally 1 out of 10 Purkinje cells showed immuno fluorescence, which sometimes extended into the axon. In Group I only 1 out of 40 Purkinje cells showed a positive reaction. This phenom\u00ad ena again illustrated the neurotropic properties of the van Roekel straii AE virus. Equally illustrative was the massive immunofluorescent re action in the pancreas of the chicks of Group II for the viscerotropi< characteristics of the Calnek strain AE virus. No immunofluorescence was found in the control group. The anti AE-RNA conjugate did not show any specific reaction ir target cells such as the cerebellar Purkinje cells or pancreatic cells. Faini fluorescence was observed on 7, 10 and 12 days p. i. in the pancreas ol the chicks in Group I, in cells with the appearance of lymphocytes. Nor\u00ad mally this happens more often with standard anti-AE conjugates, but ir this case the anti-AE conjugate did not show any reaction. This phenom\u00ad ena needs further investigation. It might be a reaction of the anti AE- RNA globulins with specific antigenic RNA in the lymphocytes. Fish- man and Adler (1967) proved, that after a virus infection is established specific RNA is incorporated in the lymphocytes by the macrophages The lymphocytes would then start to produce specific IgG antibodies. Although of scientific interest, the results with the anti AE-RNA conjugate were not of such nature as to warrant its use as a diagnostic tool; the conjugates against whole AE virus are far superior for the de\u00ad tection of AE infection in young chicks, provided that chicks are exam\u00ad ined from a suspected flock, that have just come down with symptoms The histopathological lesion pattern of the tissues examined in this experiment is represented in tables 15 and 16 for each of the infectec groups I and II. Considerable mononuclear infiltration, especially in the pancreas of chicks in GROUP II (Calnek strain infected) occurred simultaneousl) with the appearance of immunofluorescent AE antigen in the tissues This observation is in contrast with the results of 5 C, where AE-sus- ceptible chicks showed immunofluorescence generally well before the ap\u00ad pearance of mass mononuclear infiltrations. It might be concluded from this observation, that the maternal anti\u00ad bodies that are present in the chicks are capable of quickly mobilizing large numbers of lymphoid cells to the sites of antigenic activity. Jerne (1955) postulated in his selective hypothesis that an antigei introduced into the body reacts in the bloodstream with specific natura antibodies. This antigen-antibody complex is then removed from the cir culation by cells capable of producing the specific antibody; these cell: FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 57 Table 15 Group I: 30 chicks infected intramusc. with van Roekel-strain AE virus. tissues Days post-infection: examined: 0 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 cerebrum _ - H h+ + + + + + + + + + + -(- cerebell. o h + + H L. _ + + + + + orally with Calnek-strain AE virus. tissues Days post-infection: examined: 0 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 cerebrum _ -| L. + _jT~ + + + _L. + + cerebell. oo h + + + + + + + + + proventr. __--_--_--|-- \u2014 -f- \u2014H \u2014 \u2014(\u2014 \u2014|\u2014 \u2014 pancreas h - -+ + + + +- + - ++ + are thus selected and will produce the antibodies. If we compare the results from 5 C with those from 7 H (chicks with maternal antibodies), Jerne's theory would explain the phenomena of such rapid mobilization of mononuclear cells in 7 H: it would be the amount of antibody present at the moment of infection, which determines the number of specific anti\u00ad body producing cells that will be mobilized and show up almost immedi\u00ad ately at the principal sites of antigenic activity. 1. FA reactions with anti AE-RNA conjugate in Experimentally AE-infected Mature Hens. This experiment has been described in Section 6 A (page 44) insofar as the FA-reactions of the infected tissue with anti-AE virus conjugates are concerned. In addition to the completely negative results with the anti-AE virus conjugates, the FA reactions with anti-AE-RNA conjugates were also completely negative with all examined tissues during the entire investiga\u00ad tional period. However, the birds went through an actual infection with AE virus, as was proven by the occurrence of histopathological lesions of AE in brains, proventriculus and pancreas, which were absent in the negative control birds. 58 MUNI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 SECTION 8 The in vitro assay of AE virus. A. Introduction [Literature] The in vitro assay of AE virus would have distinct advantages ova the present in vivo methods. One would not be dependent anymore or the use of great quantities of AE-susceptible chickens and chicken em\u00ad bryos for titrations and serum neutralization tests. AE-susceptible fertile eggs are sometimes difficult to procure anc are relatively expensive. Furthermore, adequate isolation facilities an expensive. When tissue cultures can be used, relatively few AE-susceptible fertile eggs would be required for the production of many cell cultures Several attempts have been made to develop the in vitro assay oi AE virus. Kligler and Olitsky (1940) first demonstrated that chicken embryc cell cultures supported the growth of AE virus. Hwang et al. (1959-1 and 1959-2) observed a cytopathogenic effect (CPE) when AE virus was grown in chick kidney cell cultures. A plaque counting method en\u00ad abled these workers to perform serum neutralization tests (Hwang a al., 1960-1) and they were also able to isolate AE virus in a cell culture system (Hwang et al., 1960-2). Unfortunately, it later appeared thai a contaminating CELO virus caused the above mentioned CPE, anc not the AE virus under study (Hwang et al., 1960-2). CELO virus contamination of cell culture was also reported by Yates et al. (1962) Halpin (1966-2) described a virus that he isolated from brains of chickens showing clinical signs and histopathological lesions whicr were indistinguishable from AE. This virus produced a CPE in monkej kidney cell cultures and it was neutralized by van Roekel strain Ar antiserum. Mancini and Yates (1967) were able to demonstrate multiplicatior of AE virus in chicken embryo neuroglial cell cultures by showing in\u00ad creasing AE virus titers in the supernatant medium during consecutive days. Later, the same authors showed the multiplication of AE virus ii chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures (Mancini and Yates, 1968 1 ) and in chicken embryo kidney cell cultures (Mancini and Yates 1968-2). No CPE was observed however in either of the infected cell systems. Abe (1968) did not observe CPE after infecting 27 different type: of cell cultures of chicken, monkey, calf, pig and human origin with Al virus. He proved AE growth only in chicken embryo brain cell cultures His fluorescent antibody tests did not reveal any viral antigen of AE ii his cell cultures. FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 59 Butterfield (1969-2) reported no growth of AE virus in Bovine kidney, chick kidney and chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. McConnell et al. (1964) described the demonstration of CPE of a neurotropic entero virus from rats (MHG virus) in rat kidney cell cul\u00ad tures, when the cultures were petreated with cortisone. No CPE was ob\u00ad served in infected cell cultures without pretreatment. These conflicting reports left enough doubt about the possibility of a CPE in AE-infected cell cultures to warrant further study into the matter. B. Investigation on development of CPE by AE virus in cell cultures. In order to investigate a possible CPE of AE virus in chicken em\u00ad bryo with cortisone, lowing experiment was performed: Secondary chicken embryo fibroblast cultures were prepared by removing 11-day old chicken embryos (AE-susceptible) from the egg. The head, extremities and viscera were discarded. After washing twice in tris saline (for formula see page 67), the bodies were minced and then mixed with 0.25% trypsin solution in tris saline prewarmed to 37\u00b0 C. This mixture was stirred for one half hour at room temperature, after which the suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 200 G. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml. growth medium and then filtered through eight layers of gauze. The filtrate was seeded in 75 cm 2 Falcon plastic tissue culture flasks (Falcon Plastics) with approx. 20 ml. growth medium added to each flask. After incubation for approx. 20 hours at 37\u00b0 C, a monolayer was established in the flasks. The medium was then decanted, the monolayers trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min. at 37\u00b0 C. and after centrifugation of the pooled suspension for 10 min. at 200 G. and resuspension of the pellet in 10 ml. growth medium (for formula of growth medium, see page 66), the cells were counted with a Levy cell-counting chamber. Sixty mm. plastic tissue culture Petri dishes (Falcon Plastics) and 150 mm. glass Leighton tubes (Bellco Glass) were then seeded with approx. 1.2 million cells, after which 5 ml. of growth medium was added to the Petri dishes and 2.5 ml. of medium to the Leighton tubes. After 24 hours incubation at 37\u00b0 C in a humidified CCX-incubator, cortisone was added to the monolayers in the Petri dishes in the follow\u00ad ing manner: To two cultures: Prednisolone (Sterane, Pfizer & Co.) 0.2 mg. per ml. of medium 60 MAINF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 To four cultures: Triamcinolone acetonide (Vetalog, Squibb & Sons 0.2 mg. per ml. of medium; Four cultures were left untreated. The cortisone was removed from the cultures after 24 hours b' washing the monolayers twice with medium. Then half of the treatei and untreated cell cultures were infected with approx. 10 4-2 EID 50 vai Roekel strain AE virus. The other half of the cultures were left a negative controls. The AE virus was allowed to absorb for two hours, then washei off by twice washing the cultures with medium. Then maintenance medium was added (for formula see page 66), 5 ml. per Petri dish Every two days the maintenance medium was changed, and the cul tures were observed daily for the development of a cytopathogenii effect. (CPE) In spite of the cortisone pretreatment, no CPE was observed ii the AE-infected CEF cultures during 14 days following infection Leighton tube CEF cultures were also infected with approx. 10 20 ELD. van Roekel strain AE virus for two hours, then washed twice and thei maintenance medium added to the tubes, 2.5 ml. per tube. Coverslips with AE-infected and negative control monolayers wen taken out daily, the coverslips fixed in acetone at -20\u00b0 C for 10 minutes then airdried and reacted with anti-AE conjugates and anti-AE-RN/ conjugates. No immunofluorescence was observed in any of the cover slips with either one of the conjugates. In a previous experiment it has been demonstrated that simila CEF cultures supported the growth of AE virus. Increasing titers of AI virus could be found in the supernatant medium of such cell culture: during consecutive days: Culture A: Sample 1: 10075 EID sfl* per 0.2 ml. medium (van Roekel strain) Sample 2 (2 days later): 10 30 EID 50 per 0.2 ml. medium Culture B: Sample 1: 10 10 EID r per 0.2 ml. medium (strain 82) Sample 2 (3 days later): 102-49 EID 50 per 0.2 ml. medium \"Fifty percent endpoints calculated according to Reed and Muench (1938). No CPE was observed in these AE-infected cell cultures durini 14 days observation (with change of maintenance medium every othe day after the titration was completed). Parallel cultures were serial! passaged four times which did not cause the development of any CPE Other parallel cultures were overlaid with agar (for formula see pag FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 61 67), and the cultures observed daily for plaque formation, with regular adding of maintenance-medium on the agar-layer. No plaque forma\u00ad tion was observed. The following cell cultures were also infected with AE-virus (van Roekel strain) and observed for the development of CPE: Duck embryo fibroblast cultures, Duck kidney cell cultures, African green monkey kidney cell cultures Baby hamster kidney cell cultures, Duck brain cell cultures. These were infected with van Roekel and Calnek strain AE virus and supernatant medium was titrated with a two day interval in AE- susceptible chicken embryos (van Roekel strain) and in day-old AE- susceptible chicks (Calnek strain) No CPE could be observed in any of the above mentioned culture systems, nor could AE virus multiplication be observed in the duck brain cell cultures with either one of the AE virus strains. C. Electron microscopic studies of AE virus in infected cell cul\u00ad tures. Besides the demonstration of a rising AE virus titer in the super\u00ad natant medium of infected chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures after two and three day intervals as proof of the multiplication of AE virus in these CEF cultures, electron microscopy was used to see whether virus particles could be detected in the cytoplasm of such cells. It is known, that entero viruses develop in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Wilner, 1969). Materials and Methods. Through the cooperation of Dr. J. Haynes, Dept. of Zoology at the University of Maine, ultra thin sections were prepared as follows: Monolayers of CEF, three days after infection with 10 4-3 EID 50 van Roekel strain or 10 6-3 CID- 0 Calnek strain AE virus were scraped from the Falcon plastic culture flasks and flooded with a cold 4% glutaraldehyde solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7.6, 0.1 M.) and fixed for one hour. Postfixation was carried out for one hour in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. The cells were rapidly dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, dealcoholized with two changes of propylene oxide and embedded in araldite. Ultra thin sections were cut on a Huxley ultramicrotome and mounted on uncoated copper grids. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate or with only one of these stains. The specimens were observed with an RCA EMU-3G electron microscope. 62 M UNI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT SIATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 Results Intracytoplasmic virus particles were observed in the infected cell cultu res, the virions together in groups of 50 to 100 enclosed in cytoplasmic vesicles, which were not observed in any of the negative control specimens. Such vesicles have been described by various authors for cell cul\u00ad tures infected with polio and encephalomyocarditis virus, both of which are also entero viruses (Fenner, 1968). *v AE infected Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts virn.\\-like particles, (approx. 20 m^J (23,500 X) FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 63 SECTION 9 Summary and Conclusions 1. A sudden drop in egg production in large numbers of table-egg producing flocks in Maine without any other clinical symptoms, was demonstrated to be caused by AE infection. 2. The diagnostic methods that were used to detect AE infection included: (1) clinical symptomatology. (2) histopathological examination of target tissues, such as cerebrum, cerebellum, pancreas and proventriculus. (3) serum neutralization testing of paired blood samples (14 day interval). (4) virus isolation using AE susceptible chicken embryos (observed for embryo lesions or clinical symptoms after hatching). (5) fluorescent antibody testing of the tissues mentioned un\u00ad der (2). The embryo susceptibility test could not be used (infertile eggs). 3. Of the diagnostic methods that are available for AE diagnosis, the fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) is by far the quick\u00ad est and is relatively easy to perform. The direct FAT was used in various comparative experiments with experimentally AE-infected chicks and mature birds. It appeared that the use of anti-AE virus conjugates in a direct FA test is a reliable diagnostic method for the detection of AE infection in young chicks, provided that those chicks are ex\u00ad amined out of a suspected flock, that has just started to show the clinical symptoms. Soon after the clinical symptoms appeared the FA reactions were negative for the rest of the experiments, which lasted up to 21 days post-infection. Clinical symptoms started from 6-8 days post-infection, when AE susceptible chicks were used and from 7-10 days post-infection when chicks were used, that had some degree of maternal immunity. The AE antigen was most prevalent in the Purkinje cells and in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and also in the muscular layers of the proventriculus (circular and inner longitudinal layer) and in the pancreas. The gizzard showed good immunofluorescence in some chicks. 4. In several experiments with experimentally AE-infected mature chickens of 3, 9, and 16 months of age, the direct FAT was com\u00ad pletely negative during the entire investigational period, which ranged from 17 to 20 days post-infection, even if special emphasis was put on the examination of the tissues that are involved in MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 the intestinal function, the kidneys and the ovary. It has been well documented, that excretion of AE virus occurs in AE-infectec mature poultry through eggs and feces. The impossibility of detecting AE antigen by direct FAT in the tissues of infected mature poultry had already been noticed in the diagnostic laboratory, where several cases of AE in laying flocks had never yielded any positive FA reactions. It is concluded that the direct FA test cannot be used for the detection of AE infection w mature poultry. Several factors were investigated that might have caused the above mentioned negative results. The existence of serological strain differ\u00ad ences among various AE virus strains and several chicken sera from field cases and AE-vaccinated flocks was not observed in serum neutralization tests. Fluorescein conjugated anti AE IgG van Roekel strain AE virus reacted equal\u00ad ly well in a direct FA test with homologous antigen in infected tissues as with tissues from Calnek strain AE-infected chicks. This is considered important as there are indications that many fielc outbreaks of AE may be caused by Calnek strain type AE virus which is generally used in commercial AE vaccines. The histopathological lesions observed in young chicks and ma\u00ad ture birds that were experimentally infected with Calnek straii AE virus were quite similar to the pattern in diagnostic fieldcases: often minimal lesions were present in the cerebrum and cerebellum However, in the lumbar portion of the spinal cord consistent lesions could be found in young chicks (abundance of neuronal degenera\u00ad tion, gliosis and birds (only perivascular mononuclear infiltrations) In view of the above mentioned factors, it might be recommendabk to include the lumbar portion of the spinal cord in the routine histo\u00ad pathological examination for AE in the diagnostic laboratory. In an attempt to remedy the disappointing FA results in AE-in fected mature poultry the possibility was investigated to detec viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) that will exist in AE-infected tissui cells. The extraction of RNA from RNA viruses has been demon strated by several workers for various animal viruses of the enterc group. Phenol extraction of RNA from AE virus was effectuate! using cold phenol (4\u00b0 C.) and also hot phenol (50\u00b0 C). Thesi extracts did not exhibit any infectivity for chicken embryos o day-old chicks, whether the RNA extracts were diluted in hyper tonic (1 M. NaCl) or in isotonic saline solutions. These extract were then repeatedly inoculated in mature chickens. If an immuno FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE 65 genie activity could be expected from the RNA extracts, the inocu\u00ad lations would result in the formation of anti-AE-RNA IgG anti\u00ad bodies. The repeatedly inoculated birds were bled and the IgG fraction of the sera conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. These conju\u00ad gates failed to show immunofluorescence in the tissues of mature AE infected birds. In AE infected chicks faint immunofluorescence was observed in cells in the pancreas with a lymphocytic appear\u00ad ance. This phenomena needs further investigation, and might be a reaction with virus specific intralymphocytic RNA, which is in\u00ad corporated into the lymphocytes by the macrophages upon virus infection (Fishman and Adler, 1967). Nevertheless, from a diag\u00ad nostic standpoint the conjugates prepared against whole AE virus are superior to detect an early AE infection. 9. The observation that day-old chicks with some maternal immu\u00ad nity against AE showed a much quicker and more massive mono\u00ad nuclear infiltration response than AE-susceptible chicks upon in\u00ad fection with AE virus has reflections on the selective hypothesis of Jerne (1955). It would indicate that it is the amount of anti\u00ad body present at the moment of infection that determines how many of the already present specific lymphoid cells will be mobilized. These appropriate cells, according to Jerne, will then be induced to produce more specific antibodies. 10. The in vitro assay of AE virus by demonstration of a cytopatho- genic effect (CPE) was unsuccessful, even when the chicken em\u00ad bryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures that were used were pretreated with cortisone, a method that had been described as being suc\u00ad cessful in resulting in the development of CPE in cellcultures infected with an enterovirus (McConnell et al., 1964). The AE-infected cell cultures were demonstrated to support the multiplication of AE virus by a rising titer of AE virus in the supernatant medium of such cultures during 2 and 3 day time intervals. Moreover electronmicroscopy revealed intracytoplasmic virus parti\u00ad cles in groups of 50-100 enclosed in cytoplasmic vesicles, which were not seen in the negative control cultures. Such intracytoplas\u00ad mic vesicles have also been described by various authors for polio and encephalomyocarditis virus-infected cell cultures (Fenner, 1968). It may be concluded that AE virus multiplies in tissue cultures of CEF without the formation of a CPE. 11. The possibility exists that many cases of AE infection in the field are caused by vaccine type AE virus, notably the Calnek strain. 66 MAINE AGRICULTURAL EXPI RIMENT STATION TECHNICAL BULLETIN 44 The frequent use of commercial live AE vaccines, which have the Calnek strain AE virus as their active ingredient, in poultry in Maine and the above mentioned similarity between the his- topathological lesion pattern in field cases of AE and experi\u00ad mental Calnek strain AE infections in young and mature poul\u00ad try strongly suggest this possibility. In view of this the recommendations made in regard to the di\u00ad rect FAT testing and histopathological examination of tissues, as described under items 3 and 7 of this summary, will be relevant for the diagnostic laboratory for the accurate detection of AE in\u00ad fections.
