But 10 alums tell the story of how they made it, thanks in part to their UW educationOF WASHINGTON WHITMAN MISSION Whitman Mission The site of the Whitman Mission near Walla Walla is isolated and quiet, but in the 1840s it was alive with early settlers. Thousands poured through on their way across the Oregon Trail to nd their fortunes in the West. The story of the mission, which operated between 1836 and 1847, is fraught with mis - understandings and conflict and culminates in an attack on the settlement that left the two missionaries and 11 others dead. In \"Unsettled Ground: The Whitman Massacre and Its Shifting Legacy in The American West,\" historian Cassandra Tate, '86, '88, '95, oers a deeper look into the actions and mo - tivations of Marcus and Narcissa Whitman as well as their troubled relationship with the Native Americans that they had come to sup - port. What was to be an outreach mission instead became a means for more settlers to move into the territory. The white pioneers took land and resources and brought dis - ease\u2014measles wiped out nearly half of the Cayuse tribe. The massacre, which took place in 1847, was not unprovoked. For more than a century, the Whitmans were cast as heroes. But starting in the 1960s, the story of the mission evolved to include the points of view of Indians. Tate reveals the missionaries as neither noble heroes nor full villains. They were \"idealistic but culturally arrogant, courageous but inflexible,\" she writes. The attack was a turning point for the West. It prompted the passage of a bill es - tablishing the Territory of Oregon\u2014which encompassed the lands that became Washington, Oregon, Idaho and portions of Montana and Wyoming.

I need darkness as much as I need light ... new life starts in the dark. \u2014BARBARA BROWN TAYLOR 2020 will be a year that many would like to forget. But with all of its challenges, crises and complexities, it will long be remembered. The question is: what will we have learned in this dark year that can light our way forward? The year\u2014with COVID-19, an awak - ening to systemic racism, elections, environmental crises and an ailing econ - omy\u2014is worthy of a course unto itself. This fall, we created a special, one-time Learning From Darkness class, 2020: The Course, in which faculty and alumni from all three of our campuses came together to reflect on bringing light to the year. They looked into their com - puter cameras and spoke of their work, lecturing from their kitchens and make - shift studies. Nearly 600 students in their own apartments, residence halls and family homes from Bellevue to Beijing joined in the work of nding light and meaning in a year when many of us have stumbled in the darkness. We learned that a pandemic can force us to break from the security of habits and patterns and allow us to reenvision what constitutes safety, shelter and com - munity as we seek a pathway between this year and the next.We saw racial conflict in our midst. Now we are learning to decide what to carry in our search for light. Do we carry our prejudice and hatred? Do we pack bias in our pockets? Or do we search for ways to leave this baggage behind? Now that the smoke has cleared from res up and down the West Coast, what do we see? Can we envision clear skies, clean rivers and healthy ecosystems? When COVID-19 darkened classrooms around the world, computer screens lit up for some, but not for everyone. Businesses, gyms and restaurants closed. Our streets grew silent. Our fear and de - termination delivered a sudden halt to our normal way of living. The unavoidable impact of colliding perspectives, values and lived experiences\u2014our collective reckoning\u2014has spared no one. In these waning days of a year like no other, our university community is called to reexamine foundational questions of purpose and identity. Whether we are students or alumni, we are all on a con - tinuum of learning, a lifelong process of thinking critically and engaging with ideas that might at rst make us uncomfortable. It is our shared civic responsibility. How should we\u2014as a community con - nected to the University, and through it, connected to each other\u2014respond to 2020? We should seek out and create signs of light. We must see how we are all connected to one another and how we are connected to the planet. We are a community that values truth; we are in need of reconcili - ation and repair. When we see and dene the pathways that bridge our divides, let us now move toward those who can help us to see the truth of our humanity and can share the stories that enable us to learn from 2020 and imagine ourselves in a new community, one that begins with each of us belonging. Those stories and other resources for us as lifelong learners can be found on the UW Alumni Association's Stronger Together website (www.uwalum.com/ strongertogether). The site also oers op - portunities to engage directly with students and fellow alums. Take a look. See where it might lead.

His impact is\u2014and will continue to be\u2014felt throughout Western Washington, and that is a tribute to his ambition to make this a better world. The Bremerton native was renowned for his intellect, compassion and optimism. Early in his career as a lawyer, he took on pro bono cases and volunteered his time on the board of the YMCA. Service to our community became a lifelong pursuit, whether as president of the board for United Way King County, a UW Regent (for 15 years), a leader in two major University campaigns or co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His decades of volunteering were imbued with his unwavering belief that the University was a cornerstone for our collective com - munity success. At a holiday party several years ago, he led the room in \"Bow Down to Washington,\" belting out the words (and a little astonished that not everyone knew the song by heart). This was his university, and ours, and he wanted to make sure we all knew how important it was that we give back to this place and guide it in its public mission. So much in this issue of our magazine connects to the person of Bill Gates Senior. He could have been the lead for our retir - ees-at-work story since his retirement in 1994 shifted even more of his eorts to service, whether welcoming Mary Gates Endowment scholars on campus or visiting Nelson Mandela in South Africa alongside President Jimmy Carter. Our cover story about former prisoners highlights issues of poverty, inequity and the role education has in changing lives\u2014all important pieces of his advocacy. Showing up, helping where you can, making an impact\u2014those were the values he was raised with and values he shared with his family and with all who knew him. We can best honor this incredible man by carrying on his legacy and caring for one another and our communities. As he once wrote: \"We are all in this life together, and we all need each other.\" He Taught Us How to Care Your urban oasis awaits.

However, it is missing a signicant period of Husky football suc - cess led by coach Jim Owens from 1959 to 1961. Coach Owens led the West Coast football renaissance with Rose Bowl vic - tories in 1960 and 1961. From 1947, when the Rose Bowl pact was signed with the Big Ten, the only West Coast victory was when USC beat Wisconsin in 1952. We were told we just couldn't compete with the Midwest teams. Coach Owens came to Seattle in 1957 from legendary coach Bear Bryant's coaching sta at Texas A&M and immediately changed the prevailing culture to one of hard-nosed football with intense training and a \"take no prisoners\" attitude. One of his drills was called the \"Death March,\" with few players standing afterward./uni00A0For both the 1960 and 1961 Rose Bowl games, we were big underdogs but badly beat Wisconsin in 1960, 44-8, and Minnesota, 17-7, in '61.

These Rose Bowl victories clearly demonstrated to all that we could not only compete with the Big Ten but could win big!/uni00A0I was fortunate to be part of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, where several football players resided.

She was teaching when I was a student in the Landscape Architecture Department at the UW. Many years later, I was encouraged by Professor David Streateld to apply for one of the Civita Institute's fellowships. I was fortunate enough to receive a one-month fellowship and live in Civita. I have returned to Civita every year since. I was also able to become familiar with the Rome Center as an aide to Professor Streateld in 2004 and 2006, teaching the drawing component of his Landscape Architecture in Rome program. Your article captured the genius of Astra, though nothing could compare with actually being in her presence.

Eileen O'Grady , ' 19, Bainbridge IslandIn celebration of the Seattle Japanese Garden's 60th birthday this summer, a number of local artists created works honoring the landscape and the people involved. Michelle Kumata's \"Northwest Nikkei\" series features the garden and the Nikkei community from the year the garden opened. The traditional Japanese garden was designed in the late 1950s by master de - signers from Japan and sits on 3 1/2 acres in a larger park then known as the University of Washington Arboretum, now Washington Park. The project was sup - ported with private funds and facilitated, in part, by the UW. One of Kumata's subjects, Richard Yamasaki, grew up in Seattle and ran a landscape business. He was hired to assist the master designers from Japan in build - ing the garden. Yamasaki honed his craft on the project, learning Japanese princi - ples directly from designer Juki Iida. He stayed connected to the garden through - out his life and in 1993, Yamasaki donated a Japanese black pine that his family had tended since the 1920s. Kumata studied graphic design at the UW before obtaining a degree in illus - tration from the School of Visual Arts in New York. \"Yamasaki carries the black pine tree and rises beyond the trials of his family's history, \" she writes in her de - scription of the work. \"The pine represents endurance, adaptabil - ity, and a bright future. The monarch butter - fly represents rebirth and transformation. \" Our ways of responding to an outbreak are much the same as then. A Year to Remember While we may want move on from 2020, historians and information experts encourage us to preserve our memories and mementos so future generations might understand this exceptional time. By Hannelore Sudermann We'd all like to forget the challenges of a pandemic-lled 2020\u2014the empty store shelves, suddenly working from home or losing our jobs, the political unrest, not seeing our friends or family, the school closures, the smoke-lled weeks and the boarded-up buildings. But we shouldn't. History and information experts say we might learn from 1918, when another devastating pandemic swept the world. The world forgot. The Spanish flu ultimately infected 500 million people and killed 50 million. There are haunting similarities between then and now\u2014a national lack of preparedness, confusing propaganda, the disproportionate eect on people of color, and how dierent communities re - sponded to the outbreak at dierent times. Then, as now, groups of citizens disagreed with social distancing and masking, but those were and still are the best tools for slowing the spread of disease. And at the end of it all, in spite of the lives aected and lives lost, the country just wanted to move on. So much of that 1918 pandemic has been forgotten, notes iSchool professor Joseph Janes, that we don't know what people were doing or feeling from day to day. \"I think now we all understand that people in 1920 just didn't want to think about it anymore,\" he says. There are no monuments, and very few memoirs or novels, according to Nancy Bristow, who discussed the two pandemics in a UW History Department lecture this past summer. Bristow, who teaches at the University of Puget Sound, is one of the leading experts on the social and cultural effects of the Spanish flu, having re - searched primary sources like letters and journals for her book, \"American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic.\" Though it's more than a century later, our ways of responding to an outbreak and the tools at our disposal are much the same as then, she says. The strategies to stem the spread in 1918\u2014education, hy - giene, social distancing, quarantining, closures and masking\u2014are unchanged. The communities that took action early diminished their death tolls. Other com - munities fared worse. Cities like Spokane and San Francisco struggled to contain the flu because of disagreements between health ocials and local leaders. Seattle fared better thanks to a well-coordinated response, says Bristow. On Oct. 4, 1918, the Naval Training Station on the UW campus re - ported that one cadet had died and more than 700 people were ill. By the next day, the city health commissioner enacted the rst round of restrictions, and just two days later, he shut down all public gatherings, church services and public amusements. People were urged to stay home. By November, masks were required. History looks at that time as the end of World War I and the victorious role the U.S. played. But the pandemic essentially has been forgotten. Janes has the same concern with this year. \"My contention is when this is over, we're not going to talk about this,\" he says. Our instincts will be to get past this bizarre, dicult time in an eort to return to normal, he suggests. Also, today, far fewer people keep diaries or write letters detailing their experiences. Texts and emails will not likely endure, he says. So now, when our memories of the past several months are fresh, we should make the eort to hang on to them, he says. \"The future is going to want to know how we felt,\" says Janes. \"Just like we want to know how they felt in 1918.\" NATIONAL ARCHIVES WINTER 2020 13NEWS AND RESEARCH FROM THE UW 12 UW MAGAZINE STATE OF THE ART JAPANESE GARDEN Strong Roots, Strong Branches Before white settlement, the land where the University of Washington now sits was home to Coast Salish peoples. They included the ancestors of today's Northwest Native Americans. One of the closest villages to campus\u2014about where University Village is now\u2014was called , a word in the Lushootseed language that loosely translates to \"Little Canoe Channel.\" The name has been returned to the landscape in the form of a street sign along a small road that runs alongside \u2014Intellectual House, the long - house-style learning and gathering space for Native American students and the greater Indigenous community. \"This name change has been in the works for a very long time, \" says Iisaaksiichaa/uni00A0Ross Braine, '09, '15, the University's tribal liaison. He remembers as a student nearly 20 years ago taking part in dis - cussions about renaming roads on campus, including Whitman Court\u2014 the street that runs from the main campus arterial of E. Stevens Way N.E. past McMahon and Haggett Halls. The road was originally named for Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, mis - sionaries who settled along the Walla Walla River and helped establish the Oregon Trail. Because of cultural dif - ferences and an outbreak of the measles that killed about half of the Cayuse tribe, the Whitman Mission is a painful chapter for Indigenous people. The connection ended with a massacre of the missionaries and the burning of their buildings. \"It was not a good relationship,\" says Braine. Instead of ministering to the Indians through their mission, the Whitmans focused their eorts on white settlers traveling through on the Oregon Trail. The mission opened a pe - riod of erasure of Native culture and language in American history. The notion of renaming Whitman Court became more pronounced after the opening of in 2015. With the support of the Native American Advisory Board to the UW and the Oce of Minority Aairs & Diversity, Braine made the case for renaming the street to the Board of Regents in the spring of 2018. \"The UW is occupying territory of the Coast Salish,\" says Braine. \"It was good to say that on the record and have the Board of Regents agree.\" This is an issue of erasure, he explains. Every place the UW touches has a traditional name and a traditional meaning, and many of the original names have been changed or forgotten. The board wasted no time in unan - imously voting to rename the road, noting that it intends to do more to recognize Native place-names of the region to enrich the historical context of the campus. The new green street sign was cre - ated with the help of Tami Hohn, a member of the Puyallup tribe who teaches Southern Lushootseed at the UW. She provided guidance on the spelling, font and color of the sign, as she has done with projects for the City of Seattle and Washington state. It was installed in July, with little fanfare. \"It kind of surprised us,\" says Braine. But it was a good surprise. \"It's wonderful to see the language here on campus,\" he says. It is another step toward making Indigenous students and the greater Native American community feel wel - come at the UW. \"This is not erasing U.S. history,\" he explains. \"It's cele - brating Indigenous history as well.\" RESEARCH WINTER 2019 15 14 UW MAGAZINE Black Voices Viewpoint, the twice-yearly sister publi - cation to this magazine, focuses on stories of diversity at the University of Washington. The most recent issue features Black voices from our campus and alumni community. We asked our contributors to talk about the reverberations brought by the recent deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police, the ensuing protests and the broadening national awareness of Black Lives Matter. Sociology Professor Alexes Harris, '97, curated the issue and invited perspectives from people actively driving change at the UW and in our wider communities. One of our voices is graduate student Claire Gwayi-Chore, pictured here, who details the challenges of helping her department address and root out rac - ism and inequity while fulfilling her responsibilities as a Ph.D. student in Global Health.

If untreated, lead to long term complications and even death. After training at the UW, where he honed his interest in hepatology, and a fellowship at Georgetown University, Alter joined the NIH Clinical Center's Department of Trans - fusion Medicine. In the 1970s, he identied a new type of hepatitis virus that was clear - ly not types A or B. A few decades later, Houghton isolated the virus and Rice stud - ied its replication, which led to eective treatments. About 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to be living with hepati - tis C, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. and convey one message that is important to me, which is that masking, social dis - tancing and following public health guidelines are really essential, while sup - porting another message that conscious eorts toward anti-racism are also com - pletely essential,\" Kates says. When Kates arrived at the oce, she talked to a colleague, Dr. Rachel Bender Ignacio, '08, '14, '15, who had heard similar concerns. They came up with a plan to pen a letter in support of the protests, using their authority as infectious disease physicians\u2014along with the privilege they have because they are white\u2014to help In late May, Dr. Olivia Kates was riding the train to work at UW Medical Center Montlake. A passenger nearby approached and asked what she did for a living. George Floyd had just been killed, and activists across the country were protesting in sup - port of Black Lives Matter. When Kates explained that she was a senior fellow in infectious diseases, the passenger unloaded her concerns about the novel coronavi - rus\u2014not about immunity, transmission or vaccines, but criticism of the protests be - cause of claims that they would lead to an increase in coronavirus infections. \"I really struggled to steer that interaction change the narrative. The two doctors invited several colleagues from their time at the UW\u2014Dr. Abir Hussein, Dr. Jade Pagkas-Bather, '19, and two others\u2014to join them because they needed to add more voices to the project. Together, they crafted a letter calling for an anti-racist public health response to the protests. \"White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,\" the letter reads. \" ... Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.\" It also opposed the use of tear gas, called on police to wear masks and maintain social distancing, and gave recommendations on how to conduct protests safely. On May 30, the group sent the letter to a handful of colleagues and shared it on social media. By June 4, 1,288 infec - tious-disease experts, public health professionals and community stakeholders nationwide had signed it. Stories about the letter appeared in influential media like CNN, NPR, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and more. When they stopped taking signatures, 4,202 names were included. The letter was part of a wider movement throughout the medical community sup - porting the protests. The pandemic had laid bare society's racial inequities: If you are Black, you are more likely to be an essential worker who can't work from home, lack health insurance, have pre-existing conditions\u2014and become hospitalized for and die as a result of the coronavirus. You also are more likely to suer dispropor - tionately from disease, die in childbirth or have your infant die. In every corner of the country, medical workers called for racial justice through protests, op-eds, appearances on cable news and more. On June 6, approximately 10,000 health-care workers converged on Seattle to be part of the Doctors for Justice March, organized by UW Medicine's Dr. Estell Williams, '13, and Edwin Lindo, '12. \"We are going to find a vaccine for COVID-19. Racism has been here for cen - turies, and there is no vaccine,\" says Ali Mokdad, a professor at the UW Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. He says racism is a bigger threat to public health than the coronavirus. \"You can see just from the pandemic examples of how racism over centuries has built up in people's lives and made them more vulnerable and more likely to die. As public health professionals, it is our duty to look at the whole picture, not just the individual pieces.\" In June, the influential institute, known for its corona - virus projections, announced it would study Tackling the Other Pandemic: Racism UW doctors, students join to ght \"white supremacy as a lethal public health issue\" By Misty Shock Rulethe public health impacts of racism. While the medical community is bring - ing another voice to the ght for racial justice, it's also working to make up for a legacy of medicine used to enforce racism and white supremacy. Racial bias in med - icine and medical education became apparent to Naomi Nkinsi, a student in the UW School of Medicine, during her rst year of medical school. She was at - tending a class lecture about kidneys when the professor came to the last slide. It read that race is an important factor in deter - mining kidney function. Nkinsi was puzzled; she had never heard about a connection between kidneys and skin tone. Claims about physiological dif - ferences between dierent races had been disproven long ago.She learned that a widely used kidney test uses a race-based equation to report dierent results for Black and non-Black patients\u2014based on the outdated belief that Black people have more muscle mass. The outcome is that Black patients score higher for kidney function, leading to delays in getting treat - ment. The New England Journal of Medicine has identified seven other medical algorithms that are similarly tainted by racial bias and aect the quality of care Black patients receive. \"I knew that there was racism in med - icine, but I thought a lot of it was going to be interpersonal racism,\" says Nkinsi, who said she has experienced her share of racism in medical school as one of ve Black stu - dents in her class of around 100. \"I learned that it's built into algorithms that our bodies are dierent. It gave me a new sense of distrust in medical systems, because now I'm learning that every physician I've ever encountered is taught to see me as inferior.\" Nkinsi challenged the use of race in the kidney test in class, initially facing resis - tance from classmates and instructors. She went on to lead a two-year eort to ght the practice. On May 29, the UW School of Medicine announced it would stop using the race-based equation as part of the test. For Nkinsi, ghting racism in medicine is about using the power and privilege of her position as a medical professional. It goes back to why she wanted to become a doctor in the rst place: \"The white coat is a signier of my willingness to humbly serve other people and show them a radical sense of empathy.\" Empathy is at the heart of defeating both racism and the coronavirus. \"COVID is out of control for the same reasons that racism is out of control\u2014an individualist orientation that comes o as a lack of compassion for your fellow man,\" Kates says. \"We see that people may not universally be willing to correct their be - havior or attitudes to reduce transmission of COVID. But COVID will hopefully one day be corrected by science. Correcting your behavior and attitudes will be the only way to overcome white supremacy. Fighting racism intuitively must be big - ger.\"\u2014 Misty Shock Rule, '99, works in the UW Oce of News & Information Visit eraliving.com/joy or call (206) 333-0290 to learn more.Premier Residential Retirement Since 1987 University House at Wallingford and Issaquah are proud partners of Era Living retirement communities feature gardens ideal for outdoor gatherings, technology to help you connect, and a variety of stimulating virtual and distanced activities.Find connection and joy IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES Visit eraliving.com/joy or call (206) 333-0290 to learn more.Premier Residential Retirement Since 1987 University House at Wallingford and Issaquah are proud partners of Era Living retirement communities feature gardens ideal for outdoor gatherings, technology to help you connect, and a variety of stimulating virtual and distanced activities.Find connection and joy IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES Visit eraliving.com/joy or call (206) 333-0290 to learn more.Premier Residential Retirement Since 1987 University House at Wallingford and Issaquah are proud partners of Era Living retirement communities feature gardens ideal for outdoor gatherings, technology to help you connect, and a variety of stimulating virtual and distanced activities.Find connection and joyIN EXTRAORDINARY TIMESRacism has been here for centu - ries and there is no vaccine. WINTER 2019 17 16 UW MAGAZINEDAVID RYDER/GETTY INFOGRAPHIC FEELING GOODA Whale of a Tale Researching Gun Carrying Among Rural Teens By Hannelore Sudermann Looking positively prehistoric, the skel is now on per - manent display in the Burke Museum lobby. But this is no fossil. The whale washed ashore on a Washington beach in 2015. The Marine Mammal Stranding Network reached out to the Burke with news of the whale, and a team of students and curators was dispatched to the site. The UW team buried the carcass at the beach near where it was discovered and let nature do its work cleaning the bones. After about two years, the remains of whale were moved to the roof of the old Burke Museum, before being sent out to be articulated prior to installation at the new Burke Museum, which opened its doors to visitors last fall This skeleton, which can be seen from the street at 15th Ave. Northeast, is one of about 10 Baird's beaked whales in U.S. museum collections and oers insights into a species that is rarely seen or studied. The whale is posed to look like it is swimming and hunting. For the rst time in nearly three decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is funding research into gun use. The UW is one of the rst beneciaries, with a $1.5 million, three-year grant to research handgun carrying among rural adolescents. Firearm injuries are the second-leading cause of death for American teens, after vehicle accidents. While young people car - rying handguns and rearm violence are generally thought to be urban issues, a re - cently completed study of rural communities shows that's not the case. In communities from seven states across the country\u2014 Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, Kansas, and Maine\u2014UW researchers found that about one in three young males and one in 10 young females had carried a handgun. Many of them carried a handgun for the rst time in the sixth grade. Scientists and researchers are still de - veloping an understanding of the environmental and cultural influences on rearm use, says Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, associate professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health and co-di - rector of the Firearm Injury & Policy Research Program. While rural commu - nities have high levels of rearm access and mortality, especially due to suicide, their relationship with rearms, partic - ularly handguns, is understudied and underserved, he adds. If the new study can identify develop - mental patterns of handgun carrying through adolescence and into adulthood, it may inform ways to reduce rearm-re - lated injury in this population. Understanding that youth as young as 12 report carrying a handgun suggests that rearm injury prevention and safety promotion programs may need to be introduced at such early ages.The CDC stopped funding rearm re - search in 1996 because of the Dickey Amendment, which prohibited using fed - eral funding to promote gun control. A 2018 House spending bill claried that the prohibition did not include public health research. Now the CDC has di - rected $7.8 million to 16 projects, including the UW's. The awards herald an era in which rearm violence researchers are resourced to work with stakeholders and communities to reduce the burden of this major population health challenge, says Rowhani-Rahbar. \"This is a historic de - velopment and consequential milestone for the eld of public health in general, and the science of violence and injury prevention in particular.\" The new study will be conducted in collaboration with investigators from UW's Social Development Research Group, Washington State University, Arizona State University and Seattle Children's Research Institute.Baird's beaked whales, the largest members of the beaked whale family, are native to the North Pacic Ocean and the West Coast from Califor - nia to Alaska. This species prefers cold, deep ocean, but is sometimes found near shore along narrow continental shelves. WINTER 2019 19 18 UW MAGAZINE1.

Taking T esting to At-Risk Communities To overcome health inequities plaguing vulnerable communities, UW Medicine's COVID-19 mobile van testing program has reached out to South Seattle and South King County and served more than 15,000 people. \"We are one of the rst health-care teams that mobilized eorts to provide community testing for vulnerable populations in King County,\" says Dr. Lisa Chew, '96, '97, '02, '03, '09, associate professor of general internal medicine and associate medical director for ambulatory services at UW Medicine-Harborview. \"It's important to go to areas where we nd that there are high positivity rates so we can identify indi - viduals who are infected with the virus and isolate them quickly.\" Using two vans, UW Medicine provides access to testing in South King County and South Seattle, as well as for people experiencing homelessness. Language interpreting services are on site and those who are deaf and blind are welcome, too. There is no need for health insurance and people do not need to be patients of UW Medicine. Says Chew: \"People feel much more comfortable to get tested with the vans coming to their neighborhood.\"UW vs. COVID-19 Hold on: Hydroxychloroquine is Not a Panacea Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine was touted as a way to ward o COVID-19. But a UW Medicine study found that is not the case. UW researchers found that people who have had close contact with those with conrmed COVID-19 infections who took hydroxychloroquine were just as like to get COVID-19 as were those who received a placebo.

Sadly, we had to say goodbye to one of the most fabulous elm trees in the U District\u2014the majestic 65-footer outside Elm Hall along Northeast Campus Parkway. A nasty case of Dutch elm disease did in the tree despite the best eorts of University arborists. A new tree will be planted, says UW Arborist Sara Shores, but it won't be an elm. /T.althe soil still carries the disease. 20 UW MAGAZINEDENNIS WISE Blame it on the Beetles Elm Hall has lost its namesake elm. Two years ago, the nearly century-old tree on the north side of Northeast Campus Parkway started showing signs of Dutch elm disease. The University's arborists tried to prolong its life by pruning the infected branches and inoculating it against the beetle-borne infection. Alas, as is the case with most American elm trees, it could not be saved. Late this summer, with much ado, they took the 65-footer down. The student residence, Elm Hall, was built in 2012 and designed to accommodate the majestic tree. Another tree will go in to replace it, says UW Arborist Sara Shores, but denitely not another elm since the soil will still carry the disease. Not to worry: the campus still has plenty of trees\u2014about 9,000\u2014ranging from the Alaskan Yellow Cedar to the Zelkova (a member of the elm family with Dutch elm resistance).SCORECARD LIBERTY BRACKEN Grade A Performer What is your job? In my role, I oversee the academic team that works with our football program, as well as serve as academic adviser for foot - ball and men's soccer. How did you get into this eld? I've always been interested in education and athletics. When I came to the UW, I had a work-study scholarship and when I was looking for opportunities, I saw that there was a position in academic services in the athletic department. I applied, was interviewed and hired on the same day to work in the tutorial oce as an oce as - sistant. I got to see the support and resources that are available. I had no idea there was something that combined my love for education and athletics. What is the secret to getting student-ath - letes to succeed in the classroom? The secret is meeting players where they're at. Every student is so dierent. Something that motivates one person is not going to be the same for somebody else. You have to build relationships and get student-ath - letes to understand that we're here to support them. You're a passenger on their journey to get them where they want to be academically, athletically, and looking at their career goals after sports. Do you set goals for each school year, such as achieving a certain APR score? No, we don't. The 999 score last year was amazing\u2014a huge testament to academic excellence and its part in their mission. You go into the team room and look at their goals, and you try to achieve academic excellence. And we prove it year after year. The fact is we've been No. 1 in the Pac-12 three years in a row and have broken the NCAA APR record. Having the re - cord-breaking score of 999 this past year has been a huge accomplishment and is a testament to the commitment Coach Petersen, and now Coach Lake, have to academic excellence. With so many student-athletes on a football roster, how do you stay on top of everyone? It's a group eort. There are seven of us who meet weekly with student-athletes. Every freshman is assigned to meet with someone on a weekly basis for a year. After their freshman year, they will con - tinue to meet with us on a weekly basis, or they're moved to a dierent schedule. We come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with. The football team achieved a nation-best APR score last year. Can you repeat that? I've asked myself that question. But, rst, that's not our driving force, and second, it would be extremely challenging. Our plan is to continue supporting our student-ath - letes through collaboration with our coaches, teams and our sta. Does a team's performance on the eld aect its academic performance? It's a challenge to be a student-athlete. You have a lot of outside pressures. We want to make sure their focus is not just how they're doing athletically but on their men - tal health, too. Same thing when they feel condent and on top of the world.Liberty Bracken (above right) has a critical job in the UW athletic department: she helps student-athletes keep on top of their academics. Last year, the Husky football team earned an NCAA-record APR score of 999 (out of 1,000). Interview by Jim CapleHe Helped Us Bond With the Band Remembering legendary announcer Frazer Cook, '65, who spent nearly 60 years with the Husky Marching Band By Jon Marmor On a sunny summer afternoon in 2010, I was sitting in a University Village coee shop. A few people were scattered here and there, quietly sipping their lattes, en - tranced by their phones and computers. Then, coming up the stairs, a giant of a man appeared. \"You must be Jon,\" he said in a booming voice that caught everyone's attention. \"Pleased to meet you.\" That man was Husky royalty: Frazer Cook, the legendary announcer for the Husky Marching Band. For years, I had heard his voice ll up Husky Stadium on warm and cold Saturday afternoons, intro - ducing everyone's favorite marching band and every song it would play, from \"The Star Spangled Banner\" to \"Bow Down to Washington\" to \"That's the Way I Like It.\" Hearing his voice was as exciting and com - forting as the view of Lake Washington. Meeting him for the rst time, I could tell that he had worked in radio (he was a former CBS Radio newsman). His God- given authoritative voice was perfect for delivering the news and making us feel that we were OK\u2014just like Walter Cronkite. A 1965 graduate of the UW College of Arts & Sciences, he earned his degree in radio and television and went on to be the ocial voice for the Husky Marching Band for an astounding 57 years. The gig started when he was a 19-year-old UW sophomore. The Husky Marching Band was in the mar - ket for a new announcer, and Cook, who had little public speaking experience other than appearing in high school plays, was recruited from his dorm room to try out for the position at 9 a.m. one Saturday. (He learned then that a game was set to kick o three hours later.) Cook got the job. The match couldn't have been better \u2014between Cook and the Husky Marching Band and between Cook and Husky fans. Cook's love for the Huskies and his alma mater knew no bounds. Besides being a xture inside Husky Stadium, he was a good friend to the UW Alumni Association. A week after meeting Cook for coee, I accompanied him to empty Husky Stadium for a photo shoot on a gorgeous midweek day. As the photographer cap - tured him posing in dierent parts of the stadium, Cook recalled the 650 halftime and pregame band performances, how he spent the rst 33 years announcing from the eld, and the friendships he made. Cook's nal performance came on Sept. 8, 2018, when the Huskies hosted North Dakota. On this day\u2014declared Frazer Cook Day by King County Executive Dow Constantine, '85, '88, '92\u2014a group of Husky What an autumn it was for former Husky basketball star Sami Whitcomb, '10. Not only did she help the Seattle Storm capture its fourth WNBA championship, but she and her wife Kate welcomed their rst child. In her third season with the Storm, the California native was the team's backup sharp - shooter. Averaging a career-high 8.1 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists coming o the bench, she helped the Storm tie the Las Vegas Aces with a WNBA-best 18-4 record. She played in all three games of the 3-0 sweep of the Minnesota Lynx in the WNBA playo seminals but left the WNBA \"wubble\" in Bradenton, Florida, to return home to Australia for the birth of her rst child. Her on-court success is because \"We get the more open threes. I enjoy shooting threes,\" she says. A UW standout, Whitcomb scored 1,205 points in her career from 2006-10. After graduating, she worked for the team as a video coordinator and intern. \"The relationships I had with my teammates\u2014they are still some of my best friends,\" she says. \"Getting to com - pete in the Pac-10 was really special. And I just loved being in Seattle.\" After originally being drafted by the WNBA's Chicago Sky, Whitcomb played overseas for teams in Germany, France and Australia before joining the Storm in 2017. She helped the Storm win its third WNBA championship in 2018 and reach the playos in 2019. \"Getting to play with some of the best players in the world is really fun, \" Whitcomb says. \"Knowing that I get a chance to come in and give these starters a break is really motivating.\" After the Storm swept Minnesota to reach the championship series against Las Vegas, Whitcomb left for Australia. \"We were sad to have her go because she's had an impact on this team,\" Storm All-Star Breanna Stewart says. \"We love her energy. She is a competitor. She is loud and active whether she is in the game or on the bench.\"\u2014 Jim CapleWhitcomb's Y ear Marching Band alums created a \"tunnel\" for Cook to walk through. He didn't like the attention. \"I'm not part of the show. No one should notice me,\" he told me in 2010. He called his time with the Husky Marching Band \"an honor, a privilege and a pleasure.\" Husky fans everywhere felt the same way about him. Sadly, Cook died Sept. 23 at the age of 78. He may be gone but we will always be pleased that we had the chance to get to know him.The Husky Marching Band shows how it feels about its longtime announcer before a 2000 game in Husky Stadium.

But to his utter delight, alongside an enormous cake, his family served up a better idea that recognized his distinguished career as an attorney: ve public-service law scholarships in his name. The donation to support UW law students every year for the next 80 years might have been the perfect present. It honored Gates' professional pursuits, his appetite for community service and his belief in the UW as a leader for positive change. The William H. Gates Public Service Law Program\u2014funded with $33.3 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014has been a cornerstone in revolutionizing a new eld of law. Gates threw his considerable energy into helping the students become successful. \"He was hands-on in the best way possible,\" says Michele Storms, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington. For 10 years, she directed the Gates Public Service Law Program. \"He didn't try to run the program, but he was totally there to be present and engaged.\" When the students delivered formal presentations or had weeknight get-togethers, Gates, whose 6-foot-7 height was hard to miss, showed up at the law school and joined in. \"One night we were wrapping up a long week with takeout in a small con - ference room,\" says Colleen Melody, '04, '09, one of the rst Gates scholars. \"He dropped in, folded himself into a chair and took a paper plate of food, just making time to visit with us.\" He was interested in how the students were managing law school. Did they have any needs? Could they use any advice? Gates oered students two key pieces of advice: First, they were there to learn the law. \"He said, 'Don't be so busy trying to change the world that you don't get all the foundational material you need to know,'\" says Storms. \"He wanted them to learn to use the law to [in the words of John Lewis] 'make good trouble.'\" He also told the students to not just think about the work they want to do, but to think about the profession and how to be a leader to make all lawyers better. \"That was so important,\" adds Storms. \"All lawyers should be concerned about how we practice and the connection between ethics and access to justice.\" William Henry Gates II was born into what he once called \"a distinctly middle-class family.\" He grew up in Bremerton, where his dad owned a furniture store. The UW was his sole choice for college, and just as he was starting classes in 1943, he joined the Army Reserve, knowing he would be called up to serve in World War II his sophomore year. He returned home in 1946 in time to start fall quarter on the GI Bill. He met his future wife, Mary Maxwell, '50, at the UW, and they married in 1951. In 1964, Gates co-founded a Seattle law rm that later became Preston, Gates & Ellis (now K&L Gates). Known for his integrity and intellect, he was a force in Seattle's legal community. When Gates became president of the Seattle-King County Bar Association in 1970, he had a mission. At the time, Washington had only white judges and hardly any lawyers who were people of color. Gates knew those deciencies aected the trust clients from minority communities placed in the legal system, as well as the quality of representation they received. He turned to the UW for help, rst seeking to increase minority enrollment in the law school. Then he persuaded the bar association's board to create law-school scholarships for underrepresented students. The bar association now provides $150,000 a year to support underrep - resented minority law students at the UW and Seattle University. Gates' volunteer work included serving as president of the Washington State Bar Association as well as the United Way, Planned Parenthood and the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce among many other organizations. In the 1990s, he became a co-founder and co-chair of the William H. Gates Foundation, which merged with the Gates Learning Foundation in 2000 to become the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private philanthropic organization. He also gave thousands of hours to his alma mater, chairing a capital campaign and serving three terms as a UW Regent. For good reason, his family has been described as \"The First Family\" of the University. Starting in 1975, Mary served three terms on the Board of Regents. Later, their daughter Kristianne Blake, '75, a Spokane-based business owner and civic activist, served 12 years on the board. Now their youngest, daughter Libby Gates MacPhee, who completed a master's in social work in 2018, is serving a six-year term. And the entire Gates family, including Bill and Melinda Gates, has given time and tremendous support to the UW. This includes scholarships, endowments and funding to complete capital projects such as Gates Hall, which houses the law school, the Bill and Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering and the Hans Rosling Center for Population Health. When Storms wanted to expand the Gates Scholars program to provide resources to all law students, Gates was a champion. With his support, she increased the number of speakers, mentors and advisers. \"I said we need a stronger, broader program. And Bill believed in the vision and seeded $500,000 [in 2010] to get it going,\" she says. \"It allowed us to bring the public interest programing to a greater swath of students.\" The initial grant was followed with another $1 million in 2013. Today, the Gates program has created a network of talented lawyers in the Northwest and throughout the country. Out of the very rst class, Melody has become the founding director of the civil rights division in the state Attorney General's oce. She investigates discrimination and enforces state and federal anti-discrimination laws. She knew she wanted to pursue public service law. Her scholarship convinced her to stay at the UW. Last year, a fellow scholar, Vanessa Hernandez, '09, became the director of advocacy for the Northwest Justice Project, the state's largest publicly funded legal aid program. The Gates scholarship was the very reason Hernandez pursued law. \"I knew I wanted to transition from teaching, but I wasn't inter - ested in going to law school for law school's sake,\" she says. \"I wanted to go as part of a community really moving toward social justice and public interest.\" OAnother from their group, Emily Alvarado, '09, followed her interest in public service law without having to worry about landing a high-salary job to pay back student loans. Working in housing justice since law school, Alvarado is now the director of the Oce of Housing for the City of Seattle. She was also the rst law alum to serve on the Gates scholarship board, where she worked alongside Gates in selecting future scholars. \"I remember fondly his deep commitment to public service and how gracious he was,\" she says. \"He really cared about leadership development and about having more young lawyers come up who could be part of the solution.\" Their classmate, Michael Peters '09, a Paralympic athlete in soccer, came to law school from academia. After completing his degree, he landed a job as director of the C`ity of Seattle's Oce of Intergovernmental Relations before moving Germany in 2015 to work for the International Paralympic Committee, where he is now CEO. None of the students had expected the level of personal investment that Gates Sr. supplied. \"He was so well-known in the legal community and at the University,\" says Melody. \"He cared a lot about the program and that we would succeed in public interest law. It was a connection that I don't think you'd get with anyone else who was as busy and important as he was.\" Alvarado cherished Gates' vision of building a robust com - munity of lawyers working in public service. \"His vision is now a reality,\" she says. \"Now more than 10 years after nishing law school, I am inspired and challenged by my Gates peers. They are incredible. \"We see Mr. Gates as part of a generation of public service heroes. He worked tirelessly,\" she adds. \"I feel really honored to be part of a new generation of advocates for social justice that he helped to create. I hope to honor that legacy.\" Bill Gates Sr. stands with the inaugural recipients of the Gates Public Interest Law Scholarship at their 2009 graduation.

I got money, fancy cars, and up until the age of 21, a taste of a life I never thought was possible while growing up in crack houses, foster homes and homeless shelters throughout the Pacic Northwest. It was my rst oense, but the prosecutor wanted to give me decades in prison, charging me with 30 felonies with no plea agreements. I ended up being incarcerated for nearly two years, but the collateral consequences of my felony convictions would stick with me a lot longer. People warned me there would be no opportunities waiting for me on the other side, that a criminal record is something you can't come back from. But when I got out of prison, I flipped my GED into a master's degree, earning four degrees in all, including three from UW Tacoma. I have since become an educator, a public speaker and an author with a passion for working with youth aected by the criminal justice system. To set an example for my six kids, I have become a role model and a productive citizen. Despite the barriers that society has in place, and continues to rein - force, many of my friends and I are proof that there can be a positive life after prison. My graduate research and life experiences have led me to believe that education can be a powerful path to it. I've shared my per - sonal story at prisons, colleges, elementary schools, high schools, middle schools and other outlets. In this series of intimate interviews, I am sharing the stories of others like me who have survived the legal system in Washington state, and became Huskies on the other side. You're going to meet a professor, a social worker and a painter. You'll meet mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. This is not a story about any one exception; This is a collection of stories that prove that everyone in prison deserves a second chance, and when they come back to society, they need to come back to a welcoming society. As these conversations show, the University of Washington has played\u2014and will continue to play\u2014a major role in constructing a prison-to-college pipeline.EIGHT STORIES | PROOF THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE By OMARI AMILI Photography by MERON MENGHISTABBe/f.altore I became a student at the University o fWashington I went to prison, .

After a drawn-out tribunal process, he returned home\u2014only to be arrested and convicted on marijua - na-related charges. Now a UW Tacoma student and a painter, he nds meaning by working with youth and his community.A mother of three and a rst-generation college student, Burton has her sights on becoming an attorney working in public policy. Despite a trauma-lled upbringing that led to her being incarcerated multiple times, she has become a 2020 Truman Scholar, a highly competitive $30,000 graduate school scholarship.Q GINNY BURTONGINNY BUR TON Omari Amili You had parents who were addicted to drugs. When you were really young, they were doing robberies together, and this became a cycle for you later on. Can you speak a little bit about how these things are generational? Your child was incar - cerated, as well. Ginny Burton People function in patterns. If we don't have any kind of perspective to look at beyond our own, it's really easy to fall into the trap of teaching what we know. It's almost like having blinders on. I think my parents did the best they could with what they knew. There was denitely some mental illness there, and some addiction. I was taught the same thing that they knew, period. When my dad got out of prison, he never came back. But my mom and I, unfortunately, were using drugs together. We were in prison together two times. I think she taught me what she knew how to teach me. And so, I tried do the exact opposite, and not impact my kids with my lifestyle. And their lives were still impacted. My 28-year-old son served a prison sentence for something he did as a juvenile. They charged him as an adult. He doesn't have the same kind of issues, but stu happened in foster care because that's where they ended up growing up. So they were impacted. It's denitely a cyclical problem, which I'm currently trying to break with him. His sister is in active addiction, not to the extent that I was, but she's destructive to herself. So my lifestyle, even though she wasn't directly exposed, still impacted her, and she's dealing with things the same exact way. It's scary. I'll continue to assess that process as the years go by. Omari Amili We have a lot of similarities in our upbringings. I remember having drug busts at my house, police coming in there with guns drawn, and it's the scariest thing in the world for a little kid. In what ways do you think that impacted you, or the set the stage for things that would happen later? Ginny Burton It started to prepare me to be comfortable in that kind of environment. I had a gun held to my head by my dad's crime partner who came in to threaten my mom's life. I think that I just started to become accustomed to what living in the underbelly was, you know, having your life threatened in a number of dierent ways. And I think that was the beginning of my desensitization. Omari Amili You were a bright kid and you actually had a vision for your life despite all that, but obviously, there were some things that took place that led to using drugs. What happened? Ginny Burton My mom was the rst person to ever get high with me. There were seven kids in my family. She had this plan to smoke weed, her and my brothers. I really didn't want to because I knew my dad went to prison for drugs. I come from a family where people just aren't nice. And I was really sensitive as a kid and got picked on a lot, and I was pretty much harassed into it. They wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to tell, and so if I did it, too, the likelihood of me telling was a lot was a lot slimmer. I thought I had destroyed my opportunities to practice law in any kind of way. I started training dogs when I was in prison, from 1997 to 2000. And I really liked that. When I got out of prison that time I started managing a doggy daycare and boarding kennel. I was clean for a little while. When I was in prison, I was training dogs for people with physical disabilities. I knew I liked to be of service. Helping other people was really important to me. After I got out, though, I was doing private training for average people, and the allure of working with dogs was lost for me be - cause these were just people spending money. They didn't really care about what was going on with their dogs. I worked in the trades for a while. I was good at it, but that wasn't really where my heart was. When I got out in 2012 or 2013, I started working in social services. I quickly moved up into supervising a number of programs. When I started school, I didn't necessarily think that there was a potential for me to practice law. It wasn't until the last maybe nine months that I recognized that it was possible, and then I had people in my life that might be able to help make that happen. Omari Amili You said that by seven or eight years old, you wanted to be an attorney. What inspired you to nally pursue law as an adult? Ginny Burton I know Tarra Simmons, who was able to open a door that made me think that it might be possible for me (Editor's note: Simmons just became the rst formerly incarcerated person elected to the Washington state Legislature). I have a bunch of friends that are attorneys and one in particular, Amanda Dubois, consistently encourages me to shoot for the stars. She says, \"Don't worry about then, just worry about now. Take the steps to move forward.\" LESHAWN GAMBLE Omari Amili Tell me something that you're proud of that has nothing to do with incarceration. LeShawn Gamble I'm just glad I'm still alive, man. With everything that I've been through, I'm just happy to be alive because every day is a new adventure. And a lot of people don't think of that as an accomplishment. Remember: Getting up out of bed, sometimes that's harder than anything else. That's the biggest accomplish - ment I got. The rst month of being in my rst duty station in the military, I got attacked by a bunch of soldiers in my unit. That was just one traumatic experience after another. It was people who I thought were friends of mine. Then I had to go through this whole military tribunal. It was a horrible experience to be isolated in a place away from everybody who could have been my support system. I had this whole experience with the system and saw how it really ain't for minoritized people. It was my rst intro - duction to how the system not only places us against ourselves, but actually is built to grind us up. After I got out of the military and out of prison, I was still struggling to nd work. I would go hang out at the bar and sit there moping. You know, just f\u2014g miserable, man. I just didn't want to be in the house, but I didn't really want to be present in life. And so I'm sitting drinking a beer, waiting to get on a pool table, and this lady sits down next to me. She delivered it to me straight. She said, \"If you wanted to be like this, you should just stay home. You should be happy to be alive and that you have the ability to be here.\" I never had nobody give it to me straight like that in a very long time. Omari Amili With that intersection between you being a Black man and you also having a criminal history, how did those aspects of your identity impact your decisions? LeShawn Gamble When I went to Tacoma Community College, I wanted to go into medicine. The Veterans Administration (VA) pays for my school. The VA adviser at the time was like, \"That's noble, but we don't know how your licensure process is going to go.\" I stayed focused on the medical stu for about four quarters, and developed a plan in my mind. I was like, \"I'm going as far as I'm gonna go, and it ain't gonna be an AA. You're gonna pay for my doctorate.\" That was in my mindset the whole time. I trans - ferred to UW. It's an opportunity to get an education through a system that had habitually disenfranchised me. Omari Amili Life is a journey and our perspective of what our purpose is can change over time. Have you begun to identify what that is? LeShawn Gamble Initially, my purpose was just to keep the lights on and keep my stomach from growling. Then once I had a kid, it was like, I gotta make sure he stays fed and the lights stay on for him. And that's survival, that's not purpose. That's not any - thing other than primal animal instinct. And that's all a lot of us have. Now, I'm at the point where I'm eating good, but I want to make sure that the people around me start eating. You have to get out of the mindset of, \"I'm doing it, so damn every - body else.\" It's got to be the idea of Sankofa: looking back and bringing knowledge forward. You help those around you, the idea of umoja, which is unity. Despite the fact that I'm not African, that doesn't mean I can't instill these principles in my life and help those around me. Omari Amili Tell me about that about your organization, Renaissance 21, and the work that you do. LeShawn Gamble It was from prison that this thing was birthed. The goal has always been to take art and use it as a tool to share a dierent narrative of minoritized peoples, and to also show entrepreneurship and community in action. When I sell art at the events I do, the proceeds go into providing a space where children can create. And they use that creation to focus on challenging narratives, pulling these things out of their subconscious some - times and processing it. There is active catharsis in doing something with your hands in order to heal your mind. And that's the root of everything that I do, to heal the mind through action. CHRISTOPHER BEASLEY Omari Amili Tell us about the Husky Post-Prison Research Lab, which you started on the UW Tacoma campus. Christopher Beasley I imagine the lab as a space where formerly incarcerated people can come in and help study transitions from prison to college and get paid to do that. The goal of the lab is to better understand transitions from prison to college, and to eventually be able to help develop programs to support people's transitions. Omari Amili What are the gaps that you guys need to ll to really reach those goals? Christopher Beasley Money. I want to make sure that it supports formerly incarcerated scholars. When I was l doing my doctorate, I was really fortunate to be in a big lab. Three of us were formerly incarcerated doctoral students, and a bunch of us were in recovery. They invested in us. Omari Amili From your experience, what's the climate like for formerly incarcerated students, scholars and professors at the University of Washington? You said you were open about your background from the very rst interview. Christopher Beasley When I rst came in, faculty, sta and stu - dents were all interested and supportive. Some are going to be more supportive than others, particularly those that are social researchers, but I've gotten a lot of support from STEM faculty. It's mostly vocal support, but that kind of keeps you going. People cheering you on and stu is huge. I should say: While it's pretty supportive, to the students there might be dierent perspectives, but I think that's mostly because they don't see the structural changes happening. But they at least do have some faculty rallying behind them. Ana Mari Cauce supports it. She's actually mentored a couple formerly incarcerated students. Omari Amili Talk about some of the things that you have brought to UW since your time here. Christopher Beasley We had a leadership institute this summer, bringing together formerly incarcerated student leaders from across the state. We also had a hackathon where we brought in the tech community and people working on criminal justice reform, talking about using technology to help solve these prob - lems. We want to bring together communities that sometimes aren't working together. Last year we did a summit where I brought in some people from college initiatives in New York and California. That was to help us gure out what this thing is going to look like\u2014not to tell us how it's done, but to tell us how they're doing what they do, and why they do it. I think in this work, we don't have to reinvent the wheel. It doesn't mean we can't do it in our own way. It is inspiration, it is wisdom. Because the wisdom's not there in the literature, but we know people, and they have the wisdom. Q CYNTHIA BRADY 32 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 33Before earning a degree from the UW in Ethnic, Gender & Labor Studies, Brady lived a life of hardship that prepared her for a greater purpose: serving clients in her work as a chemical dependency professional.Beasley, a UW Tacoma professor who grew up in rural Illinois, served time in prison for charges related to manufacturing methamphetamine. He is the founder of the Formerly Incarcerated College Graduates Network, which has a thousand members across 43 states.Q CHRISTOPHER BEASLEYQ KURT MYERS 34 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 35An accidental shooting cost his friend his life and Myers his youth. Despite the tragic incident and the lengthy incarceration that followed, an educational journey that began inside of prison ultimately led him to the University of Washington Tacoma's Milgard School of Business.Taylor is a Tacoma native, but he never imagined attending a UW campus so close to home. He began his journey in education while serving a 20-year sentence. Upon his release, he started his bachelor's in psychology as a rst-generation college student in his 50s.Q THERON TAYLORCYNTHIA BRADY Omari Amili Do you think that getting into trouble and ending up in drug court was the catalyst for you wanting to study Human Services at Olympic College? Cynthia Brady I believe so\u2014getting into drug court and seeing counselors that look like me. My rst counselor in drug court was Black. My counselor when I was sent to Seadrunar Recovery Center was also Black. It was good to see some familiarity in that eld. But I also prayed to God about it, and I knew all of my life that I wanted to help people. I have been that type of person even in my addiction and selling drugs. On one hand, I was selling drugs, but in the same breath, I was turning around and taking the money and doing something for somebody else with it. I told my clients\u2014and they always laugh when I say this\u2014I said: \"At one point in my life I was sitting at the round table, pushing dope. Now today, I am sitting at a dierent type of round table, pushing hope.\" Omari Amili After learning your story and where you have been, some of them, I know they are like, \"Man, if she can do this after what she's been through, I can too.\" Cynthia Brady Yes, and that is exactly what I try to encourage them with. It is not as much about just talking about abstinence. That is the focus people keep talking about. But no, you want to really teach them about how to live, how to learn, how to love, how to have compassion\u2014and not just for other people, but for themselves. Omari Amili If there's a young girl and she's going to go through some things like what you went through, what is one lesson that you've learned that you would want to share? Cynthia Brady That change is inevitable. We change whether we want to grow or not. And we're going to keep changing, but stay resilient enough to come through it and keep going. No matter what, on the other side, there's always something more promising. I had to let go of a lot of hatred and a lot of pain that was going on inside me. I had to let go of them because they weren't serving me. I had a lot of anger with the judicial system, with police of - cers, with prejudiced people. But it wasn't beneting me to be angry about it. The only thing you can do to change that is to be the change you want to see. KURT MYERS Omari Amili You were a project coordinator at the UW Tacoma Post-Prison Education Research Lab. How did that go? Kurt Myers It was the rst strategic planning I had ever done. The term gets tossed around pretty frequently in our community, but I denitely did have imposter syndrome. You feel like you're acting like somebody that you're not. I'm at the very back of the hierarchy, and now I have a suit and tie on, and I'm telling folks to sit down, and telling people to stay on task, and stopping people in the middle of what they're saying, and saying, \"That's a great idea, but can we save it for later?\" It was helpful for me to start reimagining myself, not as a prisoner who's trying to act like a free person or a working pro - fessional, but as person who has this past who is a free, working professional out here in the world, and who really has some authority on what's being talked about because I know this so intimately. I'm probably the most well-versed person in this room when talking about what prison is like. Omari Amili I never knew at the time I graduated that there might have been multiple students at UWT with a similar path. We are at a point where it's comfortable for us to be able to admit this past and to come sit in a room and talk about it. Kurt Myers There's a ripple eect that has on the community: Now all these people are coming out and able to share their story. I'm glad that a spotlight is being shone on the success stories because Lord knows that as soon as I fail\u2014or if someone slips through the cracks and ends up reoending or whatever\u2014they're going to have news crews and everybody's going to be trying to get the scoop. And then that just means that next time there's a law being passed in Olympia, it's gonna get shot down because so and so reoended after he got out, and everyone gave him a bunch of shots. Omari Amili That's something that's been heavy on my mind since I started doing public speaking and wrote a book. If I was to get in trouble again, all of a sudden you see Omari Amili on the news. I know there are people just waiting for us to fail so that they could point to us and say, \"See, I told you so. Don't spend money on their education. Don't let them into these colleges.\" There's a lot of pressure, but at the same time, there's not a lot of pressure because we're good, decent human beings and the crimes we committed were not who we are. Kurt Myers It's not to say somebody is not going to make a mistake again in life. We're not static beings. We're constantly dynamic and constantly changing and growing. Some of the folks that I've seen have done really good, and then made a mistake. It's not necessarily like they went out and committed some heinous crime. But they made a mistake, right? You can easily shine the light on him and say, \"See, he's a failure.\" But that just means there's an opportunity for growth. That's just an opportunity to learn a new lesson and move on. We all do that in our own time. Fostering more of a sense of understanding and forgiveness as a society is going to be one of the primary things we need to do in order to make an impact on the mass incarceration problem. THERON TAYLOR Omari Amili What led you to continue your education following your release from prison? Theron Taylor Before I got out, one of my counselors told me that she saw my le and that I might be a candidate for a post-prison education program. I wanted to pursue more than just an A.A. degree, I just knew it wasn't gonna be enough. She said, \"Call these people and they'll help you.\" I did two quarters at Central Washington University. And while I was doing that, Ari Kohn, the director of the Post-Prison Education Program, gave me a call and said, \"Hey, I want you to graduate from UW.\" I'm like, \"What? UW? That's one of the most presti - gious colleges in the world, right?\" And he's like, \"I graduated from there, don't worry about it. I got somebody for you to talk to.\" Dr. Chris Beasley was my contact. And he's actually my best friend right now. A great friend and mentor. Omari Amili Did you ever imagine before your release that you'd be able to attend the University of Washington? Theron Taylor I would have never thought I would be here, or even have opportunities in my life to do better. Growing up in Tacoma, watching the Huskies play football, I had a friend and a neighbor who played football for the Huskies back in the '80s, so just to know that I am a Husky now\u2014the joy and greatness that comes along with it, these things are forever. Omari Amili What has kept you going along the way? Theron Taylor It's not about me, it's about other people. Earning my degree was a big accomplishment, but it was only because of what I wanted to do with it. And when I took my rst quarter at UW, it was a disaster. I couldn't understand it. I could have fallen in pieces right then, but they had support for me. They had psychologists that I could talk with, people I could sit with and let them know what was going on with me. They supported me and got me through. And I just never knew that there were so many people out there who wanted me to prosper. You can get in that prison mentality: \"You're not gonna be able to do that. You're not gonna get no job. How are you gonna be able to go to school? You ain't got no money.\" I didn't let that get to me. I know there's something that I have to do. I'm not just here to do nothing. And for all the things that I've done, up to this point, I pray that people have prospered because of me. That those who may come after me will see that it's possible to be at a place where you never thought you would be. This is for our brothers and sisters that are locked away. For those who do not believe it is possible. CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON Omari Amili You chose to do your photo shoot at a particular park in Spanaway, Washington. Why? Christopher Johnson I spent a lot of time with my friends at this park. And it's also the place where I was arrested, the last time I was arrested. The people in the picture with me are my friends Demetrius Rainey and Nikee Green. Omari Amili You studied a lot of music theory at UW. How did you become interested in that? Christopher Johnson Back in 2009, when I got arrested for a robbery case, I got into it with the correctional ocers and they put me in the hole for 30 days. I started singing and I heard the echo o the cell walls. It sounded beautiful. I was like, \"This is bringing me some joy right now. I'm listening to music.\" I'm on 23-hour lockdown and 99% of the time you're by yourself. And so, all of a sudden, I started to imagine life dierently. I started to imagine, What would it be like to be an author? What would it be like to be a reman? To do things that nobody I knew did? I started to imagine what it would be like to be a singer, you know, an artist, a musician. And then I had this vision that I went to UW and graduated with a music degree. AMANDA HENRITZE Omari Amili Once you got enrolled at Tacoma Community College and started pursuing an education, what was the impact on your lifestyle? How did it impact your vision for your life? Amanda Henritze The impact on my lifestyle was, I was tired. But for my vision, I think it just made me hungry to understand more, especially being in class with a bunch of high school students and seeing how much they know in comparison to how much I don't. I really needed to take this opportunity to try to learn as much as I can. To not only catch up, but just to be able to have intelligent conversations. To be able to have a conversation with my grandma about politics and understand it. It also started to make me see dierent things in the world. This has been my life for so long: crime, drugs and money. And now prison. I felt dened by that. But then after going to TCC, I met a lot of good professors that I spent a lot of time with. There was one the rst quarter who said, \"Don't ever sell yourself short. Who cares if you have a felony? Be the rst person that gets hired at some place. Be the exception.\" It just makes me want to go to school more. Omari Amili Before I enrolled in college, I'd probably call myself a felon. But after that, I was a college student, and I was working toward something positive. Did you see any impacts on your identity? Amanda Henritze Yeah, at barbecues with my girlfriend's family, people ask, 'How's it going?' Now I can actually be proud of something. It gave me a sense of accomplishment almost, even though I hadn't nished. I'm going to school to do something that is in a better direction. It made me start to think about what I want to do with my life, and exposed me to concepts I never knew. It has denitely/uni00A0shaped who I am and my identity./uni00A0 Omari Amili What are you hoping to achieve in the future? Amanda Henritze My endgame will probably be something like a project manager for an architecture company. But, you know, I'm still not sure yet how to get there. I just know, eventually, I will make my way. Q CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON After her release from prison, Henritze began working for Mod Pizza, an employer that is known for people second chances. She is studying Urban Design with the intention of making an impact on local communities.Q AMANDA HENRITZEBeing in the wrong place at the wrong time led to felony convictions and pris - on time for crimes he didn't commit. But despite losing years behind bars, Christopher Johnson's incarcer - ation was a catalyst for a new life. 36 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 37BY ERIN ROWLEY 38 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 39 THE FULFILLMENT FAC T OR Retiring from the UW doesn't end the story for faculty and staff. They are driven to serve their communities on a local or global scale Four years after retiring from the faculty of the UW School of Nursing, Sandra Motzer attended a class on emergency preparedness at the Lake City Library. There she learned her neighborhood lacked one of Seattle's new emergency communication hubs that were available elsewhere across the city. It didn't take long for Motzer, '75, '76, to realize that was a problem she wanted to solve. After attending meetings at the emergency operations center downtown and collaborating with a colleague to secure a Seattle Department of Neighborhoods matching fund grant, Motzer helped establish Lake City's own emer - gency communications hub in 2013. There she was, back to \"work\" ... in retirement. Motzer's story is not uncommon. Whether nding new inspiration after their full-time University careers are over, or expanding their previous service and work, UW retirees are making incredible contributions to our communities on local, national and global scales. Equity & Justice Adviser When Robert Crutcheld, who retired as a professor emeritus in 2016 after almost four decades in the Department of Sociology, was invited to join the Board of Commissioners for the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA), he couldn't say no. It was a full-circle moment. \"For me, it was pretty special be - cause I grew up in housing projects in Pittsburgh,\" he says. \"I was honored to be asked and happy to serve in the role. It was also a chance for me to bring what I knew from an academic setting in service to the community.\" The board's work is focused on sup - porting the SHA's executive sta and making decisions around budgets and investments. Its ultimate goal is to do everything it can to expand the amount of housing that is available for low-in - come people in Seattle. In addition to serving the local community, Crutcheld is the chair of the Committee on Law & Justice (CLAJ) for the National Academies of Science, Engineering & Medicine. CLAJ is an all-volunteer group of ac - ademic experts from across the country responsible for bringing sci - entic input to important government, federal and local policies on crime, law and justice. A longtime priority for the group is getting a study con - ducted on racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system and what can be done about it. \"Our job is to nd the people who are most knowledgeable in that area, Community Connector The inspiration to give back was in - stilled in Sandra Madrid at an early age. So it's no surprise that commit - ment continues in retirement. \"My mom's inspiration and the way she lived her life ingrained in me at an early age the value of serving and giving back to the community,\" she says. \"I've never let go of that.\" Madrid, '80, '82, '85, spent the ma - jority of her 28-year UW tenure as the assistant dean for students and com - munity development in the School of Law. Throughout that career, she served on more than 30 nonprofit community boards. Madrid continues that service today as a member of the board of directors who have the best thinking about what we should be doing, and get that in - formation to practitioners, policy makers and scholars,\" he says. Crutcheld is also on the steering committee for the Racial Democracy Crime & Justice Network, which pro - vides mentorship to young faculty members of color from across the country who are studying issues of race, crime and justice. It's a National Science Foundation-funded eort to continue to diversify the professoriate nationwide. \"I think staying involved and keep - ing a scholarly life alive and going gives me value, gives me something,\" Crutcheld says. \"I get as much as I give for a lot of these things.\" PHOTOS BY RON WURZER Robert Crutchfield Sandra Madrid40 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 41 Global Health Champion When he started to think about retire - ment, Jim LoGerfo, professor emeritus in global health and medicine, wanted to do global health work in a way he wasn't able to as a full-time faculty member. His 40-year UW career included stints as the medical director at Harborview Medical Center and asso - ciate dean of medicine. After traveling to Cambodia to learn what the country's needs were in the areas of public health care and health- care training, LoGerfo, '72, '74, decided that was where he wanted to focus his eorts. As with many lower-resourced countries, Cambodia had virtually no funding or emphasis on caring for chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. \"The compelling thing in Cambodia is they know the direction they need Lake City Advocate Motzer retired as an associate professor emerita in 2008 after a 30-year career in BioBehavioral Nursing and Health Systems. Her work to establish the emergency communications hub was just the beginning of her community advocacy. \"The bottom line is we want to im - prove the quality of life for everyone who is living and working in Lake City,\" she says. Motzer collaborated with UW N u r s i n g c o l l e a g u e S u s a n n a Cunningham to bring the national \"Stop the Bleed\" program to Lake City as well. Cunningham, '69, '78, and Motzer were trained at Harborview Medical Center and then certied as \"Stop the Bleed\" instructors, and Cunningham secured the grant to create \"Lake City Stops the Bleed.\" Since 2018, they've taught hundreds of Lake City residents how to stop life-threatening bleeding through free classes at community centers, churches and other community locations. \"Stop the Bleed\" kits are now available at the Lake City and Meadowbrook community centers. Through her work with the emer - gency communications hub, Motzer is also a member of the Lake City Neighborhood Alliance (LCNA). She chaired the board for four years and currently serves as its treasurer. LCNA is an advocacy group for funding a new Lake City community center and\u2014 among many other things\u2014partnered for the United Way of King County, the board of directors for the YWCA of Seattle/King/Snohomish Counties, the board of trustees for the Woodland Park Zoo, the Seattle Art Museum Education & Community Engagement Committee and the Seattle Colleges Chancellor's Advisory Council. Also near to her heart is the service she does to create networking and community connections for Latinx professionals and women of color. For 30 years, she's coordinated the annual Cinco de Mayo Reception, which con - venes Latinx professionals and community leaders for an evening of networking at the Columbia Tower. \"It's an opportunity for people to partner with someone or engage with a nonprot Latinx organization that they wouldn't otherwise have been aliated with,\" Madrid says. \"There are so many stories about how that one event can bring connections and make so many positive things happen in the community.\" For the past 15 years, she has facil - itated the Nordstrom Latina Summit, which brings together college-level and professional Latinas to network and build connections around the theme of empowerment. Last fall, she helped the Woodland Park Zoo hold its inaugural reception for Professional Women of Color. \"The connection to the community with your heart and soul brings im - mense satisfaction to a life fullled,\" she says. \"Wherever you are in your life, there is always a need to help and assist, no matter what your eld hap - pens to be.\" with the Children's Home Society of Washington to secure a grant called \"Build Lake City Together.\" The grant focuses on improving equity issues for residents such as housing, trac and pedestrian safety, crime and the environment. \"The continued inspiration [to do this work] comes from all these people that I've met,\" says Motzer. \"Not just in Lake City, but across the city. There are wonderful people out there who have been engaged in doing community activism for decades. I'm just a new - comer to all of this.\"to go, but they don't have a lot of re - sources,\" says LoGerfo, who travels there three to ve times a year. \"If you can gure out a good way to get some extra resources and get the right people together in the room, good things happen.\" LoGerfo worked with the Cambodian Ministry of Health and an NGO doing work in slums and rural areas to help them organize chronic disease treat - ment programs and secure funding. Improving Cambodia's medical teaching institutions is also a high pri - ority for LoGerfo. He has been connecting with experts from France, as a well as a group from Boston University, to expand clinical training eorts at the medical school and major teaching hospitals. \"You can't teach what you don't do very well, so it's been important to me to nd people who are focused on im - proving care, whether they are involved in teaching students or not, to make the training institutions better clinical institutions,\" he says. He's also collaborating with Tracy Harachi, associate professor in the UW School of Social Work, to expand the role of social workers in the medical system, as well as to address the enor - mous burden of mental health problems among Cambodia's population. Despite knowing it may take many years to see the impact of this work, LoGerfo's inspiration is unwavering. \"It's building relationships and see - ing programs take on a life of their own and doing good things for people,\" he says. \"That's why we become doctors. That's why we do public health.\" Sandra Motzer Jim LoGerfoThe connection to the community with your heart and soul brings immense satisfaction to a life fulfilled. \u2014SANDRA MOTZER''My mom's inspiration and the way she lived her life ingrained in me at an early age the value of serving and giving back to the community.

The rst Filipino-American to graduate from UW medical school, Fernando Vega helped open the path to alternative medicine in the U.S. By Sheila Farr Photo by Anil Kapahi 42 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 43It wasn't easy for a young Filipino-American man with a love of science and a passion for community service to dream big in the 1970s. As an under - graduate at the UW, Fernando Vega once brought home a glossy brochure about becoming a medical technician and showed it to his father. His dad was blunt: \"If you're going to do that, you might as well be a doctor.\" Vega, in his early 20s, began volunteering as a patient advocate and observed doctors as they gave their time to treat any ailment that came through the doors, from sexually transmitted dis - eases and drug problems to the flu and mental health issues. Vega thought, \"I could do that\u2014I'd like to do that, become someone like that.\" Even as a kid, Vega was fascinated by the way the physical world works and spent hours poring over the Time Life Science book series, intrigued by polymers. He loved going on eld trips with his father, who worked in quality control for various Alaska canneries. Born in Seattle, Vega spent most of his rst six years in the Philippines, where he spoke Tagalog and studied English from his father. Vega's school years were all in Seattle, where his mother taught in the public school system. But with roots in two cultures, Vega struggled to nd his identity. During his years at Gareld High School, Vega's community was mostly other kids of color. In those days, medical school was mostly the purview of white males, but the UW's Educational Opportunity Program offered Vega a way in. During his senior year at the UW, Vega was named \"Asian Scholar of the Year\" at the EOP Banquet. He majored in cell and molecular biology, his grades were good, not great, but his science scores on the Medical College Admission Test were higher than the class average. And, perhaps most important, his motivation was off the charts. Having grown up with community service values of the First Baptist Church, Vega was a rm be - liever in health care as a right. Vega attended medical school at the UW, where he was the only Filipino-American in the class. \"It was tough, \" he says. \"I had to learn to study, develop habits and discipline. I was nervous as hell. Here was this minority student who had the weight of expectations: I could not fail.\" He persevered and became the rst Filipino- American to graduate from the UW School of Medicine in 1978. One of the lifelong habits he developed there was working long hours, rst as a phlebotomist at UW Medical Center-Montlake, to help pay his medical school expenses; then, during his three- year residency in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he also worked after hours as an emergency room physician. Much as he loved ER work, Vega's goal was family practice. After returning to Seattle in 1981, he opened a private practice. During that time, a pivotal event in Vega's career occurred. An old church friend asked him if he would be willing to sponsor a traditional Chinese medical doctor at his clinic. At the time, acupuncturists were not licensed in Washington state, so Dr. Amy Chen, recently arrived in Seattle from China, was not able to practice independently. Having her at the oce drew a dierent type of patient to Vega's clinic, ones who were unsatised with the results of Western medicine or sought alternatives. As Vega witnessed the healing power of acupuncture and herbal remedies, his mind opened to other medical skills and philosophies. Vega had come out of medical school feeling like he knew everything. Now he wondered: \"What else is there?\" Soon other like-minded physicians joined the clinic, along with a naturopath and a physical therapist, and Seattle Healing Arts was born. Among Vega's patients in the early days was pioneering Seattle naturopath John Bastyr. A burgeoning alternative med - icine university, with campuses now in Kenmore and San Diego, would later be named for him. Known for his practical approach to healing, Bastyr graduated from a chiropractic college and completed a residency at a Seattle hospital before beginning his practice in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression. His skillful touch and keen observation helped him diagnose illness as a chiropractor. \"He saw things no one else did,\" Vega says. Bastyr grew up in North Dakota with a mother who was an herbalist and a father who was a pharmacist. He learned to work with whatever tools he had at hand\u2014physical manipulation, herbs, homeopathy. In the 1950s, Bastyr helped establish the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle. The school later moved to Portland. In the 1980s, the American Holistic Medical Association met in Seattle and brought innovative physicians such as Bernie Siegel and Christiane Northrup to town before they became well known. Deepak Chopra and Andrew Weil, then relatively new authors, were also featured. Learning about new ideas in medicine inspired Vega: Chopra for his spirituality, Weil for his practicality, Northrup and Siegel for thinking outside the box. Vega also videotaped long interviews with a dozen prominent physicians working outside the mainstream, beginning with John Bastyr in 1994. Still, Vega resists the arcane classications\u2014Alternative, Holistic, Integrative, Complementary\u2014each with dierent nuances of meaning. He is content to be considered a family doctor. \"Physicians ultimately learn the most from their practice with patients,\" Vega says. Each time a patient would tell him about a technique or method that got results\u2014osteopathy, visceral manipulation, vitamin infusions\u2014he would study it or consider training in it. And, he points out, many ideas considered far- fetched in the '80s are now widely acknowledged: the importance of gut flora, the eect of diet on inflammation, the use of Neti pots for sinus irrigation. \"Half of what we did 20 years ago was wrong,\" Vega says. \"Half of what I do today is wrong; I just don't know which half.\" Over the years, Vega has taught at the UW's School of Medicine and the School of Public Health. Medical students and residents still do rotations with him at Seattle Healing Arts. He and his second wife, Dr. Martina Koller, spend most of their time to - gether, caring for patients. Even on weekends, they often make house calls to longtime patients or family members who need assistance. Particularly this year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have donned protective gear to check in on patients who are housebound, sometimes delivering oxygen or taking nose swabs for testing, listening to lungs, doing whatever they can to keep people out of the hospital. In the decades since medical school, Vega has learned so much that now, at 69, he says it would be a waste of all that experience to simply retire. About ve years ago, he began thinking about how to transition from the responsibilities of running a clinic to seeing patients part time. As always, he wants to continue advo - cating for greater exploration of healing and medicine. \"That's the value of Seattle Healing Arts,\" Vega says. \"There are always rifts and arguments between dierent disciplines, but if you can get through the language barrier in the context of mutual intentions, real discoveries can happen.\"\u2014 Sheila Farr is a Seattle freelance writer and frequent contributor to University of Washington Magazine.SKETCHES PRIYA FRANK A new book by former Mayor Norman Rice shows the way to ending divisiveness By Jon MarmorCivic and Civil Engagement Norman B. Rice's timing couldn't have been better. His new book, \"Gaining Public Trust: A Prole of Civic Engagement,\" came out just when our already turned-upside-down world was getting even worse. For months now, Seattle has been an epicenter of pain and protest due to a rash of societal problems coalescing all at once: We saw the aftermath of the killings of Black citizens like Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, not to mention the many other senseless violent acts against people of color. Downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill in particular became the scenes of ongoing violent protests, shootings, and vandalism. Add to that the contentious relationship between the City Council Priya Frank Seattle Art Museum Director of Inclusion, Equity and Diversity and Mayor Jenny Durkan, '85, angry calls for defunding the police, the sudden retirement of Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best, and the economic crisis in the wake of COVID-19. Add it up, and you have a city in desperate need of some help. Thus, the autumn arrival of the book by Rice, '72, '74, the former two-term Seattle mayor and nationally known community builder, could not have been better. \"We need both civic and civil engagement,\" says Rice, who lectures at the UW Evans School of Public Policy & Governance. \"We [didn't] have a healer in chief, and there are a lot of people with pent-up feelings, and that has resulted in riots and no solutions.\" His book details what he experienced as mayor during partic - ularly trying times for the Emerald City. \"I was inspired to write about civic engagement because I believe that even under the most divisive and trying circumstances, people can be engaged to nd the common denominator that brings them together,\" he says. When Rice, a journalist before he went into politics, was elected to oce, Seattle was consumed with the most controversial issue in the city's history: using busing to achieve school deseg - regation. Walking into that highly charged atmosphere, Rice explains, \"We learned to engage citizens in a manner that respects diversity of opinion and we learned to bring them together in a way that was goal-oriented, not grievance-oriented. The process and how we developed solutions became a model for us in going forward to deal with many other issues facing the city.\" Given the teeth-gnashing issues the city\u2014and society\u2014is dealing with today, Rice identies healing as the action that needs to take place rst. \"Leaders like the members of the City Council are taking the side of the protesters when their job is to heal, \" says Rice, the rst Seattle mayor ever to become president of the United States Conference of Mayors. \"We don't know yet what the solution will be, but there has to be a better way than just letting anger out. I think we need a pause. How do you have an intelligent, respectful conversation? When you have less anger. Right now, nothing is moving forward because people are responding to anger instead of coming up with a plan. We need a big timeout.\" What Rice nds particularly disturbing is what is happening to downtown Seattle, where he and his wife, UW Regent Constance W. Rice, Ph.D., '70, '74 live. COVID-19 has caused many downtown stores to close, and downtown has become a focal point of angry, violent protests. \"It hurts my heart to see what is happening in downtown Seattle,\" Rice says. The former mayor remains justiably proud of his work rebuilding Seattle's decaying downtown when he was mayor from 1990 until 1998. And now it appears the same level of trouble has returned. \"I worry that downtown may not come back,\" he admits. \"Stores may be obsolete by the time the economy recovers. There may be too many changes.\" Rice, who in 2017 received the University of Washington's highest alumni honor, the Alumnus Summa Laude Dignatus, may not be in politics anymore. But his passion for his city and the lessons he learned during one of the city's most contentious times 30 years ago are just as relevant today. And we need to heed them. Proceeds from sales of the book, which is available at Amazon and Barnes and Noble, benet the Northwest African American Museum.

He served in Operation Desert Storm, worked as an arms-control negotiator with the Joint Chiefs of Sta, closed naval bases in California, helped search for the wreck - age of Korean Air Lines Flight #007, which was shot down by Russia, and commanded all naval activities in the Pacic Northwest. And that just scratches the surface of Bill Center's 35 years in the Navy. But his re - lationship with the University of Washington runs even longer\u201445 years, to be exact. The Dayton, Ohio, native came to the UW for graduate school in 1976 after he graduated from the United States Naval Academy and had served eight years at sea. The Navy gave him the opportunity to go\u2014all expenses paid\u2014to any university he wanted. Much to his colleagues' surprise, he bypassed Harvard and Stanford and chose the Evans School of Public Policy & Governance at UW. He was intent on coming to Seattle so he could learn from A Life of Leadership Retired Rear Admiral Bill Center has spent a lifetime serving his country and his university By Jon Marmor ANIL KAPAHI COURTESY BRITT EAST Bill Center, '78, credits his UW education with playing a key role in his long and suc - cessful Navy career.Brewster Denny, '45, the legendary found - ing dean of the Evans School. Center spent nearly two years at the UW, studying public policy and administration, with an emphasis on national security policy planning and organization development. His two-year program ended a bit early because he was such a voracious student that he took too many classes in other areas such as law, physics and anything else. He ended up with many more credits than he needed. \"I had a fantastic time with Brewster Denny and became good friends with Marc Lindenberg [another dean of the Evans School]. I learned so much and built great relationships with my classmates and pro - fessors. My UW education served me extremely well throughout my career in the Navy.\" For his service to our nation, the veteran community and the UW commu - nity, the UW is honoring Center with the 2020 Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award. His dream was to command at sea and he made good on it quickly. He was the youngest commanding ocer in the US Atlantic Fleet when he assumed command of the USS Exploit, a minesweeper. He later commanded USS Meyerkord, an an - ti-submarine frigate, and USS Reeves, a Japan-based guided missile cruiser that made three deployments to the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Desert Storm, though stationed in the Pentagon, Center was \"in the thick of things\" as the director of strike and amphibious warfare. That meant \"our shop played a role in all the naval bombs and missiles red at Iraq.\" Not long after the war, President Clinton nominated him for promotion to rear admiral. His sterling reputation earned him assignment as dep - uty director for international negotiations for the Joint Chiefs of Sta with special responsibilities for nuclear arms control, Growing up in the South during the 1980s, Britt East's family \"made it clear that ev - erything was wrong.\" He goes on: \"My family ... suered without wisdom, steeped in denial and immersed in cycles of intergenerational trauma. Addiction. Abuse. Suicide. It's a myth that all parents love their children, just something we like to tell ourselves.\" The struggles he faced left an indelible imprint on his psyche and serve as the impetus for his helpful and hopeful book, \"A Gay Man's Guide to Life,\" (Houndstooth Press).

The book\u2014part memoir, part develop - ment manual\u2014oers stories of empathy as well as no-nonsense approaches to living your best life: creating a family without merely mimicking the norms of a straight society, cultivating sus - tainable gay friendships, and nding lasting love in a world absorbed by hookup culture. \"Trying to expunge those parts of you resulting from years of sor - row and anguish is a losing game,\" East writes. \"But you can learn to trade your weapons for wisdom and alchemize your pain into loving kindness.\" \"Sometimes,\" East adds, \"it can seem like the cards are so stacked against us as gay men that the best we can hope for is just to make it through another day. We all have the capacity to take the world by storm. But for this to happen, most of us need a plan, a clear sense of mission, vision and values.\" East continues to maintain strong con - nections to the University.

She also writes the Pickles and Tea blog in collaboration with the Smithso - nian Asian Pacic American Center. In her latest cookbook, the communication alum oers fast and user-friendly recipes of global classics like Thai ba - sil chicken and green curry mussels and pairs them with mouth-watering photographs. All the recipes can be made in the popular multi-cooker (a combined pressure cooker and slow cooker).In her lm \"January 14th,\" La'Chris Jordan intended to tell a story honoring her parents' 35-year-long marriage. Made in 2019, the movie, which chronicles the death of a married Black man, is reaping honors at lm festivals from coast to coast because of the way it has touched a nerve. Jordan, '01, an award-winning screenwriter, playwright and novelist, has been moved by the reception her lm is receiving. \"I didn't know the timeliness of this piece when I made it,\" Jordan says of her rst lm. \"I was trying to write a lm about my parents' marriage. As we began to get into the story, I started going deeper into who this woman was, and how she navigates the new world she nds herself in. We had no idea that the lm was going to be so timely as it is right now. When you're African American, living in this space, you're constantly thinking of issues and social issues at a time when it's not in the headlines.\" Jordan, who holds a bachelor's degree in communication from the College of Arts & Sciences, took on double duty by writing and directing her lm. Her work has long been recognized for focusing on social justice, especially as women struggle for equality in a patriarchal society. With the high-prole killings of Black men and women, and violent acts carried out against other people of color, \"January 14th\" is resonating in a way few could have seen when Jordan made the lm. Made with a small cast and crew in just two days, \"January 14th\" started as Jordan's desire to tell a story about the loss of her mother in 2008. The film's title is her parents' wedding anniversary. Released shortly before the videotaped killing of George Floyd, the lm has aired in festivals across the country and stirred ev - eryone who has seen it. \"This lm doesn't belong to me anymore,\" Jordan says. That's for sure. The Los Angeles-based Jordan took a winding path to her station in life as writer and director to watch. Born in Oakland and raised in San Diego, she attended high school in New Orleans, then came to the UW for college. No matter where she has been, one constant remained. \"I've always loved words and was a writer. Plus, I read everything,\" she says. She wrote her rst play in junior high, and envisioned herself as a novelist. Wondering if she could make a living as a writer, she thought that that journalism might be the way to go. \"I wanted to be a Christiane Amanpour of CNN, a war reporter,\" she says. \"Carrying forward important stories. That was my goal.\" At the UW, she covered sports for The Daily, writing about swimming, football, and track and eld. Then she decided to switch to writing news. After graduating, she wrote for a magazine in Dubai, where she encountered some cultural challenges when she wrote a four-part series on divorce in the United Arab Emirates. \"It was a very sensitive topic, and I was told to stop talking to the locals. It was really scary,\" she recalls. She made her way back to the States, worked in public relations for a while, returned to Seattle, then headed down to Los Angeles for a job as an assistant at a major production studio. She has written TV pilots that deal with social justice in his - torical dramas. Then 2019 came along, and her drive to make \"January 14th.\" \"It was just something I needed to do to explore grief and loss,\" she says. Having gained experience as a theater director during her time in Seattle, she took on both writing and directing eorts. \"I go back to basics about storytelling,\" she explains. Watching \"January 14th,\" you see how quietly the picture unfolds, how the actors have the stage to tell their stories\u2014poi - gnantly, intelligently, and powerfully. Jordan, who has spent the past six months Zooming into lm festivals nationwide, is looking forward to making another lm in 2021. Her new story features only two characters\u2014a woman and her birth mother, who is a survivor of a World War II con - centration camp. \"What happens in a tragic moment?\" Jordan asks. \"From a woman's perspective, what is it like to experience those feelings?\" Finally, Black lms for the masses As she got deeper into the cinematic world, La'Chris Jordan was eager to connect with Black writers in Los Angeles. But despite living in the capital of the entertainment world, she had a real problem nding organizations or databases that listed Black writers or movies. So she decided to create her own. The result: Blackcinemadb.com. A labor of love, her database contains 700 Black lms. \"We need to celebrate this body of work. This is my way of celebrating that,\" she says. But Jordan is not to one to rest on her laurels.

COURTESY DORSEY & WHITNEY LLPT aking on Turkey A UW-trained human rights lawyer sues Turkey's government after a violent attack on a peaceful protest in the US By David VolkFor as long as he can remember, Josh Colangelo-Bryan has been ghting for the weak and downtrodden. As a UW law student, he loved working in law clinics where he could represent some - one in a small matter and help them win a case. He represented a number of un - documented people who were in the middle of an unconstitutional racial pro - filing suit against the New Haven, Connecticut, police force. And he helped six Bahrainis who were wrongly detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba gain their freedom. So it should not come as a big surprise that Colangelo-Bryan decided to sue Turkey. Yes, Turkey. As audacious as it sounds, the New York City attorney led a personal injury suit against the Republic of Turkey for its in - volvement in an attack on a peaceful protest in a Washington, D.C., park in 2017 that left 20 people with injuries ranging from concussions and emotional distress to head wounds and seizures. The incident occurred when protesters used a visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to speak out against the country's treatment of its Kurdish minority. According to the suit, the group of 15 were demonstrating in Sheridan Square, across the street from the Turkish Mission Chief's home, when employees of the Turkish Embassy and others twice broke through a police cordon and attacked the protesters, punching them, pushing them and kicking them after they fell. Video of the attack quickly went viral, showing up on national and international news broadcasts. The jerky footage shows a group of plainclothes security personnel rushing the small group and repeatedly hitting the unarmed civilians, many of them American. Instead of retreating when police pull the attackers away from individual victims, they can be seen moving on to others and resuming their brutal attacks. \"It was just emotionally and visually horrifying,\" Colangelo- Bryan recalls. Although he was disgusted by the video, he didn't seek involve - ment in the case. But a year later, human-rights advocates came calling, looking for someone to take the case. \"I remembered seeing the ar - rogance with which the attackers not only assaulted people, but utterly disregarded US law-en - forcement ocers. I thought this is exactly the kind of thing there needs to be a lawsuit about,\" he recalls. Colangelo-Bryan wasn't always so fo - cused on human rights. He might have been interested in righting wrongs when he attended the UW, but he thought em - ployment law was the way to go. All that changed when he volunteered for a hu - manitarian aid group in Kosovo between the time he took the bar exam and started working at Preston Gates & Ellis. He found the situation in the Balkan Peninsula coun - try as it emerged from war so compelling that he returned to Europe a year later to work with the United Nations on crimi - nal-justice issues ranging from prisoner transfers and cross-boundary concerns to war crimes and human trafficking. \"It sparked a passion for international human rights law,\" he says. In 2002, he joined Dorsey & Whitney LLP in New York City, and he has been focusing on white-collar criminal defense cases. He added a wrinkle to his practice in 2004, when he proposed having the rm represent six Bahrainis who had been sent to Guantanamo on the basis of what he believed was weak evidence. He even - tually secured their release in 2007, but it required so much eort on his part that the rm gave him the freedom to spend as much time as he needed on the case. The arrangement stuck and has allowed him to create an ongoing pro bono prac - tice focusing on human rights and civil rights matters. He still handles commer - cial litigation, but has the leeway to handle more pro bono cases than most typical attorneys. In the years since, he went up against the New York City Police Department for using excessive force on schoolchildren and represented a Sing Sing Prison inmate who was assaulted by a guard who wouldn't let the prisoner into the facility's law library. \"There's nothing better than taking a case for the sole reason that it's the right thing to do,\" he says. Colangelo-Bryan often uses what he calls his \"anger test\" to determine which cases he'll take on. If the way a powerless person is being treated makes him angry, it's a good t. The Turkey suit lists 25 defendants in - cluding three Canadians, two US citizens and 20 unnamed employees of the Turkish Embassy, most of whom have since left the country. Even if he doesn't win, he knows there will be another human-rights case waiting. There always is. \"The victims have such incredible wrong that's been done to them, and to be able to move the needle back in the right di - rection feels like one of the best things you can do with your life.\"NEWS FROM THE UWAA Good Books. Great Conversations. UW ALUMNI BOOK CLUB CREATES AN ONLINE HOME FOR READERS The idea was simple: create a digital learning space where Huskies could connect over a good book, no matter where they lived. It was also easy: Alumni could sign up at any time; read everything or skip a selection; follow or not follow reading timelines and questions to consider for the forum. In fall 2019, UWAA launched an online book club in partnership with UW Libraries. Curated titles would reflect timely topics and explore multiple genres\u2014ction and non-ction, memoir and history, emerging writers and established authors. Intermit- tently, the club could vote on what they wanted to read next. To date, more than 1,600 readers have joined, representing alumni from every college and school across all three campuses. Grad years range from 1947 to 2020, and more than one-third live outside of the Puget Sound. What drew them to the program? Marilyn Conover Watt, '76, '81: \"My husband and I joined for the opportunity to read, review and discuss interesting books with each other and our fellow Huskies... so often we think of reading as a solo activity, but with discussion it improves and elevates the experience.\" Three books and six months into the burgeoning Book Club and the pandemic changed the world. Suddenly, everyone was looking for ways to connect virtually and the Book Club expanded its conversa - tions. University Book Store was brought into the editorial planning mix. Zoom conver - sations with fellow readers, as well as deep dives with UW faculty and alumni on book themes, strengthened the readings while forging a stronger sense of community.Danielle Higa '07 echoed that sentiment. \"It connects people through important top - ics and stories. The discussion forums are extremely valuable and I appreciate the opportunity to vote for the next book, plus it was fun seeing what others like too.\" Over the past six months, topics explored have included an architect's reflection on the power of space and home (\" A Gentleman in Moscow\"), a historian's view on the Cold War front in Africa (\"American Spy\"), and a realtor's insight on redlining in Seattle (\"The Color of Law\"). Next up? UW experts tackle the science behind time travel and examine the eects of generational trauma in conjunction with our reading of \"Kindred.\" To quote Marilyn again, \"We've been surprised about how fun it is to read a book at the same time and discuss it at home with just each other, and even more so with sharing with the group. It adds so much to the reading experience. The book club ts perfectly with our desire for lifetime learning.\" There's always room for more readers. 2021 READING LIST CIRCE MADELINE MILLER HOW TO BE AN ANTIRACIST IBRAM X.

Center retired in 1999 after command - ing the naval activities of the Pacific Northwest. He stayed in Seattle, and turned his considerable skills and passions to serving his alma mater. While he did take on a post-Navy position as president of the Washington Council on International Trade, he was a beloved and frequent guest lecturer in the Evans School, served as the senior adviser for the school's Humphrey Fellows program and lectured at the Foster School. Center received the Evans School's Distinguished Alumni Award in 2011, and his voracious appetite for community service also led him to serve as president of the Seattle Rotary and volunteer to teach leadership at the Lighthouse for the Blind. \"Admiral Bill Center adores the UW, where he regularly volunteers as a speaker and a mentor to students and recent graduates,\" says Dorothy Bullitt, '76, '88, who lectures in the Evans School. \"He assists veterans and active-duty members of all of the service branches, both young and old. I know of no one more willing to mentor the young, nor more ready to encourage his fellow leaders.\" And, she adds, \"He stood out for his moral courage and kindness.\" \"I always felt at home on a ship,\" Center says. \"It was the adventure of a lifetime. It was a privilege to serve my country, and I would do it again. And my UW education has been with me every step of the way.\" Center believes it is possible to eliminate extreme global poverty and says he has no plans to fully retire. \"When you look at the problems in the world, they all come down to extreme global poverty.

At the bustling admit desk of Seattle's Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center, Dr. Danyelle Thomas, '07, picked up a patient's chart and was transported back to middle school. The chart was for a classmate she hadn't seen in years. It was a scene that would replay in various forms at this Central District clinic over Thomas' three-year residency. Sometimes it was the familiar face of a childhood friend in the hallway, or an aunt who stopped to say hello before an annual checkup. By Malavika Jagannathan Photos by Mark StoneOpposite: Dr. Danyelle Thomas, pictured here with her parents at her family home, returned to Seattle's Central District for her medical residency.

These disparities are the result of many factors, including sys - temic racism in and beyond health care. Studies show that Black patients ben - efit from having Black doctors like Thomas\u2014with higher levels of trust, shared decision-making and more. But Thomas is an outlier in her profession: Fewer than 5% of working physicians are African American, and even fewer are Black women. TO DO MORE AND BE MORE Thomas was the rst in her family to attend a four-year college and medical school, but she's not the rst to chart a pioneering course in health care. Her grandmother\u2014 \"a 5-foot, 6-inch force of nature\"\u2014moved to Seattle in the 1940s to become one of the area's few Black nurses. Her mother, too, is a retired nurse who worked at the same Beacon Hill clinic where Thomas now practices.inequity that frustrated and disappointed her\u2014but ultimately motivated her. \"If we know there's a huge population that can be helped, why aren't we doing more?\" she remembers wondering at the time. \"That's when I thought maybe I should be a doctor.\" Inspired to help both individuals and whole populations, she applied and was accepted to a four-year combined medicine and master's of public health program at the University of Miami. Even that process illuminated some of the barriers to diver - sifying the physician workforce. \"I didn't have a lot of the opportunities aorded to my peers,\" says Thomas, who worked full time while studying for the MCATs, while some of her peers had taken the summer o to prepare. \"There are many things that come with money and opportunities that the people we need to be doctors can't access.\" Throughout the grueling, often isolating years of medical school, Thomas' family and friends cheered her on from 3,000 miles away. She was overjoyed when she matched to the Swedish Family Medicine Residency Program at Carolyn Downs\u2014 about a mile from the house in which both she and her father had grown up. It meant being closer to her support group and back in the community she wanted to serve: her own. COMING HOME From the moment Thomas walked through the doors of the Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center, she felt at home. Founded by the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party, the clinic sits on the same Central District sidewalks she had walked in her youth on the way to church and to school at Gareld High. And the clinic's mission aligned with her own: to improve the whole community's health. On any given day, Thomas saw a broad spectrum of that community, from newborns to octogenarians. One of her goals is to help patients un - derstand their own health. She knows how vital it is that people have access to med - ical information in plain language. \"People should know what's going on,\" Thomas says. \"When somebody has high blood pressure, I get animated. I explain there's a medication to help lower your blood pressure, and that's important be - cause you're more likely to have this other problem if you don't [take it].\" Those messages are easier to deliver when patients can see themselves in their doctors. At her practice on Beacon Hill, Thomas is the only Black primary-care physician. When she walks into the exam room, her patients are excited and grateful to see her. For Thomas, a University of Washington alumna whose family roots run deep in Seattle's historic African American neigh - borhood, the residency was more than just an opportunity to hone her skills as a phy - sician\u2014it was a chance to improve the well-being of the community that made her who she is. \"There are so many communities that are marginalized to the point where people write them and their experiences o,\" says Thomas, who nished her residency in June and now practices at Pacic Medical Center \"We need physicians that look like the patients, so there's an inherent trust and bond there,\" says Thomas. \"We are the same, but I just happen to be the doctor. I think that's really important in the way I talk, explain and relate to patients.\" That's why representation matters to her. It's also why she spends a little extra time with her youngest patients, encour - aging them to try out her stethoscope or look in her ear before she looks in theirs. \"We have to start nurturing it early, before they even go to school, because high school is almost too late,\" Thomas says. Her goal is for Black doctors to be commonplace. \"My success would be in me not being that special.\"But Thomas didn't consider medicine until after she graduated from the UW, where she earned a degree in biochem - istry and a math minor, with the support of the Costco Diversity Scholarship. Given to high-achieving students from underrepresented communities, the schol - arship was a vote of condence that made Thomas \"want to do more and be more.\" While working for a Seattle pharmaceu - tical company testing a prostate cancer treatment, Thomas saw that African Americans made up a shockingly low percentage of the clinical-trial participants, despite being more likely than others to get and die from the cancer.

When you support scholarships like the Jonathan & Helen Louise Noyes Language Scholarship, you help prepare the next generation of global leaders. giving.uw.edu /language-gift Inspiring Intelligence By Nancy Joseph and Jamie Swenson As a Far Eastern and Slavic studies major in the late 1960s, Helen Louise Noyes was about to become the rst in her family to graduate from college. Her family was thrilled. But her next step was far from clear. Noyes, '69, had interviewed without success for numerous corporate manage - ment training programs. Most were resistant to hiring a woman. A recruiter from a European shipping company was completely frank: A woman would not be a good t, he told her, in the German busi - ness community. Rather than accept defeat, Noyes says, she began to \"think more broadly about what I might be able to tackle.\" A CIA recruiter was coming to campus, and Noyes signed up for an interview\u2014but she still had few expectations. Not only would Noyes land a job at the CIA, she would go on to climb the ranks in an unexpected career that brought the world to her. From her early days as an imagery analyst for foreign intelligence (and one of two women in a department of 150 people) to the culmination of her career as an agency executive, Noyes never wavered in using her sharp mind and nat - ural curiosity to move ahead in her career and encourage others along the way. CLIMBING THE RANKS The Seattle-born Noyes studied both German and Russian at the UW. But it wasn't just her language skills that caught the CIA recruiter's attention. That fateful morning, in a cramped oce barely large enough for its desk and two chairs, Noyes impressed the recruiter with her analysis of the aerial photos in the CIA brochure\u2014 and, she later learned, with how she turned the tables by interviewing him. \"I asked the recruiter if the photos were from the Cuban Missile Crisis, and he asked why I thought that,\" Noyes recalls. \"I proceeded to point out military vehicles, missiles and launch pads. He immediately wrote down that the imagery analysis component at the CIA should hire me.\" Imagery analysis involves extracting useful information from photos\u2014at that time, taken from satellites and reconnais - sance aircraft. After a follow-up interview in Washington, D.C., months of waiting for clearances, and a cross-country move to the nation's capital, Noyes took a step neither she nor her family had predicted by launching her career with the CIA. For her rst assignment, Noyes used satellite images to study the economic capabilities of countries closed to the U.S., assessing their ability to manufacture various products. A few years later, she was drawing from a wider variety of sources from across the intelligence, military and diplomatic communities to assess foreign economies and help inform trade negotiations. As a woman in an overwhelmingly male environment, Noyes faced an uphill battle. \"Some of the men were clearly less than enthused about having women in the of - fice,\" she recalls. \"I was asked lovely questions like, 'When are you going to quit and have kids?'\"The incredible impact of our Be Boundless campaign will be felt far into the future\u2014on our campuses; by our faculty, students and sta; and in the lives of those we serve. You can see this impact in students who can attend the UW because of scholar - ships, in the programs and hands-on learning that deepen their education, in endowed professors who tackle today's most sig - nicant problems and educate the leaders of tomorrow, and, most visibly, in the new and upgraded facilities where it all takes place. Over our decade-long campaign, your generosity enabled several new UW facilities where faculty and students can engage in teaching, learning and research at the highest level\u2014 from the new Burke Museum, to the Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering, to \u0842\u086b - Intellectual House. While our campaign closed in June, the impact of your philan - thropy during the Be Boundless campaign continues to build. Most recently, we completed construction of the Hans Rosling Center for Population Health, a hub for faculty, students and community partners working across disciplines to solve some of the most pressing issues of our time\u2014including poverty, equity, health-care access and climate change. Founders Hall, a new expansion underway at the Foster School of Business, will house state-of-the-art classrooms, student programs, career services and experiential learning centers. At historic Parrington Hall, home of the Evans School of Public Policy & Governance, much-needed renovations will provide modern, sustainable spaces for collaboration and active learning. As we move beyond our campaign, we continue to rely on both public and private support to create and upgrade the places where teaching, learning, research and healing will happen\u2014 including at our campuses in Bothell and Tacoma, our UW Medicine campus in South Lake Union, our health-sciences center in Spokane, and the many clinics and programs throughout our state. When you give to support new and improved educational facilities, research laboratories or medical clinics, you equip current and future leaders with the tools to do their very best. That matters now, and it will continue to matter as we foster curiosity, leadership and solutions for tomorrow. We look forward to when we can gather on campus again and see these beautiful, inspiring new spaces. Until then, our work may largely continue remotely. We will keep moving forward into a better future\u2014together.PHOTOS COURTESY OF HELEN NOYESBut her work spoke for itself. Noyes' next promotion was to branch chief, overseeing a dozen people focused on China's economy. She then became a deputy division chief and continued to climb the management ladder, nding even greater opportunities when imagery analysis and mapping merged, in the 1990s, as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. By the time Noyes retired in 2006, she was a senior intelligence service ocer. Over time, the CIA became much more diverse. Noyes notes, \"There are many, many, many capable female professionals at the CIA and elsewhere.\" While she was making strides in her own career, she was committed to supporting others as well. \"I love to mentor,\" Noyes says. \"A lot of people came into the agency who had never worked on intelligence issues, and the opportunity to teach them was exciting.\" That drive to encourage others led Noyes to contact the UW last year about creating the Jonathan & Helen Louise Noyes Language Scholarship in the Jackson School of International Studies. Through a generous blended gift of annual contributions and a bequest, the fund provides support for UW students studying challenging languages. Helen Noyes, who studied German and Russian at the UW, found an unexpected career in the CIA.Noyes spent decades climbing the ranks\u2014 and mentoring others\u2014in the CIA. Here, she pauses at the CIA Memorial Wall on the day of her retirement in 2006. GIVING BACK Two factors convinced Noyes to support language study at the UW. The rst was her own missed opportunity to study Russian in Moscow, travel that she couldn't aord as an undergrad. \"It ate at me for decades,\" she says. The other factor was the paucity of job candidates in the intelligence community For Helen Noyes, '69, a love of languages translated into a lifelong career with the CIA \"I proceeded to point out military vehicles, missiles and launch pads. He immediately wrote down that the imagery analysis component at the CIA should hire me. \"with language skills or an interest in pur - suing language study. Her own work in imagery analysis did not require foreign-language fluency, but Noyes' knowledge of Russian helped when she was stumped by an image. She was able to consult Russian-language news - papers and books for a better understanding of the industrial processes she was seeing. \"No one else there could do that,\" she recalls. \"It became clear that too few people knew the languages of the regions they were focused on. It didn't make sense to me.\" Noyes directed her gift to students studying languages categorized by the State Department as Level 3 or higher\u2014 the ones most dicult for native English speakers to learn. But an interest in the CIA or State Department is not required. Language prociency, Noyes believes, is vital in any eld involving communication across countries and cultures. \"Whether the speaker is employed by the U.S. government, an international business or a nongovernmental organiza - tion doing charitable work abroad, our nation will benet. I think better cross- cultural understanding would help foster world peace. We can't get along if we can't communicate with one another.\" 56 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 57Encourage exploration . When you provide scholarship and program support, you can give students like Louis Maliyam greater opportunities to pursue their passions\u2014or discover new ones . giving.uw.edu/ cse-and-dance Maliyam received the UW President's Medalist Award in recognition of his excellence in com- puter science and on the stage.By Lisa Walls Photo by Mark StoneThe software-design class ends, and Louis Maliyam pops out of his seat, grabs his bag and hurries through the crowded hallway. With just 10 minutes to get to the dance studios in Meany Hall, he has to walk fast, or he'll be late. Sometimes he runs. It's early 2020, before the pandemic will hit the U.S. Maliyam heads through Red Square, passing Suzzallo Library. The build - ing's imposing Gothic architecture made an impression when he rst visited campus. \"I felt like the place had a history, like something was waiting for me,\" he recalls. \"It was exciting to know I was going to spend four years at this place.\" He doesn't mind the rainy sprint to dance class; Seattle's drizzle is nothing compared to the heavy downpours of Samut Prakarn, Thailand, where he grew up. Maliyam would listen to the rain hammering on the roof of his parents' internet caf\u00e9, where he helped customers and as - sembled computers after school. \"I think it's fun to solve problems,\" he says. He took a programming class as a teen, and his talent for computers won him a full scholarship to study abroad. He nished high school in New Hampshire, where he took higher math classes to prepare for computer science\u2014and discovered musical theater. Maliyam continued both pursuits at the UW, entering as a computer science major and adding an acting class to his fall schedule. He continued to be recognized for his talents: in com - puter science, by earning the merit-based Eileen Bjorkman Endowed Scholarship in Computer Science & Engineering, and in performance, landing a role in the School of Drama's production of \"Anything Goes.\" And when a dance instructor came to work with the cast, Maliyam discovered a department he hadn't known about\u2014and a new passion. HUGS IN THE HALLWAYS In the UW dance studios, Maliyam felt instantly at home. Still, before he got to know the other dancers, he recalls, \"it could feel strange to look into their eyes or dance in front of them.\" Eventually his reluctance evaporated: \"The teacher helped us bring our own movement into the room. It made us more comfortable because it created space for failure.\" That safety, Maliyam says, helps the students be brave. \"We have sweat and tears, happiness and joy at the same time. We're vulnerable when we fail.\" The dancers' willingness to publicly stretch and challenge themselves fosters a culture he didn't know he was looking for. \"It's a strong connection we build from dance,\" he says. \"We say hi and hug.\" As Maliyam tackled more intricate computer science challenges, he pushed himself to open up in dance as well. Modern dance helps him level language barriers and communicate on a deeper level. It's \"a tool to tell a story,\" he notes. \"We can express what we feel in the moment.\" He had that opportunity last January in UW Dance Presents, a Department of Dance showcase for faculty choreographers. Maliyam and his fellow dancers, all in shades of pink, came to - gether and drew apart as they moved to an R&B song, voicelessly communicating about love, desire and relationships. \"There's this feeling that's unexpected, where you don't know what's going to happen next,\" Maliyam says. Last spring's dance majors concert was ultimately canceled amid rising coronavirus concerns\u2014but even in the preparation, Maliyam found confidence and community. \"Success is not in the outcome or the things we create,\" he says, \"but in the rehearsal process, along the way.\" THE POWER OF VULNERABILITY Maliyam brings the inclusive spirit of dance into his work as a teaching assistant in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE). \"The hard work is to make them feel that their worth is important,\" Maliyam says of his students, \"so they're not afraid to speak in front of their peers and create a community in which it's OK to fail.\" He makes himself approachable by sharing about his own life. \"I've seen students who need help, but they don't feel like they can talk to us,\" he says. \"Vulnerability closes the gap be - tween teacher and student.\" No matter where he ends up after graduation, there's little doubt Maliyam's professional career will mirror his academic one. As a sophomore, Maliyam received the UW President's Medalist Award\u2014a recognition given to only one student in each undergraduate class. The medal reflects his excellence in CSE classrooms and onstage. And when he received the Bjorkman scholarship, oering tuition support for a high-performing computer science student, Maliyam said, \"I felt that someone had seen my hard work. I feel really grateful\u2014it's allowed me to focus on the goals I've set for myself.\" Goals such as his summer internship at DocuSign. Computer science, Maliyam says, \"expands my horizons, while dance fullls my soul.\" 58 UW MAGAZINE WINTER 2020 59A titan of the law and a trailblazer on the bench, Judge Joseph Jerome Farris sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for 41 years, the rst African American to reach that position. Earlier in his career, Farris took pride in having only one decision reversed by the Supreme Court, but over time his court became the most reversed in the country. He dismissed critics who said that meant he was too liberal, oering instead that \"courts cannot determine right and wrong in an absolute sense, because the law is not absolute.\" Farris, who died July 23 at the age of 90, was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1930. He earned a degree in math from Morehouse College, then served two years in the Army Signal Corps. He added a master's in social work from Atlanta University before journeying to the Pacic Northwest to earn his law degree at the UW in 1958, working as a juvenile proba - tion ocer while in school. A decade of An Extraordinary Inspiration Trailblazing judge Joseph Jerome Farris inspired people of color to follow him into the law private practice followed, and in 1969, Farris landed on the Washington State Court of Appeals. His star rising, he was nominated to the Ninth Circuit by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Farris' service to the UW was varied and lifelong. A past president of the Board of Regents, he also led the Law School Student Body and later sat on the UW Law School Foundation. In an interview with the Seattle Times, Chief US District Judge Ricardo Martinez called Farris \"a true pioneer and an extraordinary inspiration to young law - yers of color everywhere.\" Martinez, '77, '80, says Farris was one of the reasons he pursued law school. Asked by a UWTV interviewer in 1989 if he ever agonizes over his rulings, Farris responded swiftly: \"Never. You can't. And by 'never' I mean absolutely never.\" With ve trials in a day and 25 in a week, \"you don't have time to agonize. We don't have to know, we have to listen.\"RECOGNITION TRIBUTE JEROME FARRIS, 1930/hyphen.case2020 SANDRA J.

Washington, who played Husky basketball as an under - graduate, discovered a passion for teaching and returned to the UW for his master's degree in special education. He strives to empower and engage his students during class and advocate for them beyond the classroom.ANTHONY WASHINGTON , '16, '19 \u0003F\u0003\u0003\u007f\u0003\u008c\u0003 ,\u0003\u00c0\u0003\u00c4,F\u0003\u00c4 he rst picture that students see in Juliet Sperling's survey of American art is a familiar one: George Washington stands aboard a small boat as a group of colonists paddle him across the Delaware River. But this isn't the version from your high school history book: Samurai have tagged in for the colonists, and a new face has found its way atop the pyramid of patriots: Roger Shimomura, a third-generation Japanese American, stands in for the rst president. He may not have beaten the British, but Shimomura has had more than 150 solo exhibitions since graduating from the University of Washington in 1961. \"Shimomura Crossing the Delaware\" was painted in 2010. The original, made by Emanuel Leutze nearly 70 years after the Revolutionary War, has also been remixed by artists like Jacob Lawrence (who taught at the UW for 16 years) and Robert Colescott (whose version is held by the Seattle Art Museum). It says a lot that Sperling would start a lower-level survey class by exposing her students to a picture like this, one in Assistant Professor Juliet Sperling chose to be depicted in this particular style, which was popular among traveling painters in America in the early to mid-1800s. This portrait was done by Miha Sarani, '15, '19, who earned his B.F.A. in painting and drawing and his M.A. in art history from the University of Washington.Twhich art is in conversation with art, racial and ethnic identity is foregrounded, and history is a moving target. Shimomura's picture is quintessentially U.S.A. without chanting \"U-S-A!, \" and while it may delight the viewer at rst, more than anything it sparks questions. \"I really care about how contemporary artists are remaking history and interrogat - ing it, \" says Sperling. \"Shimomura is ring on one of the most popular American paint - ings: As someone who doesn't look like George Washington, and who hasn't been represented the way George Washington has been throughout art history, he is in - serting himself into one of the most ultra-nationalistic, ultra-patriotic artworks from American history. \" Shimomura, who joined the Army after earning his degree at the UW, was interned in the Minidoka camp during World War II. His self-portrait as Washington inherits the paneled compo - sition of a Japanese wood-block print. Sperling joined the faculty of the School of Art + Art History + Design this fall as Assistant Professor and Allan and Mary Kollar Endowed Chair in American Art History. \"Shimomura Crossing the Delaware\" is one of 18 portraits she chose for a tour of American art history on the UW Magazine website.
