John Greenleaf Whttier sent a special poem for the dedication services on Jan. 10, 1864. King, himself, donated the organ. When the new church was dedicated, King estimated that the income of his church was $25,000 per year, contrasted to $30,000 per year that Henry Ward Beecher raised in his famous Brooklyn church, and Beecher's church was twice as large as King's. King said that based on membership, his church was the number one church financially in America. Any one of his labors would have been enough for one man, much less the outstand\u00ad ing success of all of them combined. With a new and prosperous church, the Sanitary Commission on a solid and func\u00ad tioning basis, and Union victories at Gettys\u00ad burg and Vicksburg sealing the doom of the South, he had every reason to sit back and relax. He was now also financially secure per\u00ad sonally. Stlll another of his parishioners, William c. Ralston, the great financier of the Comstock Lode, had given him solid advice on investments in Nevada silver mines. He was due a sabbatical. He could now look forward to rest, travel, and writing his book on the Sierras. Yet, as his congregation had deduced on the very first day, his health was never good. Only devotion to what he considered God's Will and \"being mad\" kept him going as long as they did. Now the He:-culean labors be\u00ad gan to take their toll. All along, there were indications he was driving himself too hard for his weak little body. Indeed, in 1861, he collapsed after speaking to the thunderous applause of 3,000 persons at a major Republican rally with Leland Stanford. When Bret Harte found him almost passed out on a sofa in the dressing room while the applause continued, Harte asked, \"What a triumph! How did you manage to get through the long last sentence?\" King feebly responded, \"I hardly know. I seemed quite unconscious of my surround\u00ad ings. My imagination beheld the scenes, my mind worked out the sentences moments be\u00ad fore I uttered them.\" Frequently his friends urged him to ease up. Yet, now that he had the chance and every right to take it easy, disaster struck. On Feb. 28, 1864, he was hit by diphtheria soon complicated by pneumonia. For two days, he clung tenuously to life. Then a second attack of pneumonia struck. A doctor was summoned. The doctor told him that he now had only a half hour to live. King glanced at the calendar. \"Today is the fourth of March,\" he sighed. \"Sad news will go over the wires today.\" Next, he dictated his will. Then he turned to his wife, \"Do not weep for me. I know it is all right. I wish I could make you feel so. I wish I could describe my feelings. It is strange. I see all the priv\u00ad ileges and greatness of the future. It already looks grand, beautiful. Tell them that I went lovingly, trustfully, peacefully.\" One by one across San Francisco the Amer\u00ad ican flags dropped to half mast. The city hall and all the state and federal offices im\u00ad mediately closed. Soon the foreign consu\u00ad lates and foreign ships in San Francisco harbor joined in dropping their flags to half mast. The State Legislature in Sacramento ad\u00ad journed for three days in mourning after passing a resolution that \"he had been a tower of strength to the cause of his coun\u00ad try.\" A mllitary honor guard was posted at his casket. His body lay wrapped in the Amer\u00ad ican flag in front of the altar of his church. Mrs. Fremont placed violets on his chest. As King lay in state, some 20,000 people came to pay tribute. Many broke into tears as they passed the coffin. Some kissed the flag that was his shroud. In the bay at Fort Alcatraz, in Union Square in downtown San Francisco, and at other federal mllitary installations, the can\u00ad nons boomed in memorial tribute. Bret Harte composed the eulogy, \"Reliev\u00ad ing Guard.\" \"A Star? There's nothing strange in that.\" \"No, nothing; but above the thicket Somehow it seemed to me that God Somewhere had just relieved a. picket.\" Such a mammoth outpouring of emotion and sorrow was not equaled on a national level until 99 years later with the murder of President John F. Kennedy. Services were conducted by the Masons, with ministers of the Methodists and Pres\u00ad byterian Churches joining in the rites. His body was buried in the front lawn of the church he had just completed build\u00ad ing. It still lies in a crypt in front of the church today at the corner of Franklin and Starr King streets. In the early 1960's, the state designated Starr King's church and tomb to be a. historical monument. In 1913, the State Legislature voted Starr King and the great Catholic missionary Fa\u00ad ther Junipero Serra to be the state's two greatest heroes. It appropriated $10,000 to erect a. bust in King's memory in the U.S. Capitol to stand with those of George Wash\u00ad ington and Robert E. Lee for Virginia. The statue was unveiled on March 1, 1931, by King's grandson, U.S. Navy Lt. Comdr. Thomas Starr King. In addition to the giant granite mountain in Yosemite National Park, one of the great trees that he admired in Yosemite is also named for him. There is another mountain 1n the White Hills of New Hampshire also named Mt. Starr King. California has many public schools and Masonic Lodges bearing his name. In Long Beach, there is even a Starr King Presby\u00ad terian Church. The Unitarians have named their major seminary the Starr King School of Theology. However, like his compatriot and admirer. Abraham Lincoln, his greatest monument is the dream he labored for, \"One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" SENATE-Tuesday, June 13, 1972 The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was called to order by Hon. GALE W. McGEE, a Senator from the State of Wyoming. PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Edward L. R. Elson, D.D., offered the following prayer: 0 God, whose mercies are new every morning, we raise to Thee our grateful praise. For the glory of sunrise and sunset, for shelter and raiment and daily bread, for work to do and good colleagues with whom to do it, for the blessings of fam\u00ad ily life and good neighbors and friends, we give Thee thanks. For joys that hearten and refresh us, for afitictions that bring new insights, for better understanding and compassion for trials whereby we are tested and for the power to triumph over disaster, we give Thee thanks. Above all, we thank Thee for Thyself, 0 Thou whose faithfulness is unto all generations. For the love which endures despite our neglect and ingratitude, for Thy guiding hand upon us and Thy watchful care over us, we give Thee thanks. Now accept the service which we offer here in Thy name that it may enhance the welfare of the Nation and advance Thy kingdom on earth. We pray in the Redeemer's name. Amen.

AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS TO PRINT THE REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYS\u00ad TEM Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, dur\u00ad ing the consideration of legislation to clarify the liability of national banks for certain taxes, the committee required in section 4 of Public Law 91-156 appendix December 24, 1969, that: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall make a. study to de\u00ad termine the probable impact on the banking systems and other economic effects of the changes in existing law to be made by sec\u00ad tion 2 of this act governing income taxes, intangible property taxes, so-called doing business taxes, and any other silnila.r taxes which are or ma.y be imposed on banks. Parts I and II of the report from the Board of Governors was received in May 1971 and were subsequently printed as a committee print by our committee. Later in December 1971, part m was re\u00ad ceived from the Board of Governors and it was also printed as a committee print by the committee. In December 1971, the President ap\u00ad proved a Joint Resolution of the Congress postponing for 1 year or until January 1, 1973, the effective date for certain changes in laws relating to state and local authority to tax national banks.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. AIKEN (for himself and Mr. TALMADGE) : S. 3699. A bill to establish a system of wild areas within the lands of the na\u00ad tional forest system. Referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, the distin\u00ad guished senior Senator from Georgia (Mr. TALMADGE) and I are today intro\u00ad ducing a bill to authorize the establish\u00ad ment of a system of primitive-type rec\u00ad reation areas in the Eastern United States within the national forest system. I am especially gratified to have the senior Senator from Georgia, who is chairman of the Committee on Agricul\u00ad ture and Forestry, join in sponsoring the bill. It is strictly nonpartisan. The need for this legislation has been apparent for some time. Citizens in heavily populated centers east of the Mississippi River need access to areas where they can enjoy the unique experience of solitude that only wilder\u00ad ness can provide. At present, nearly all of the major wilderness areas, defined as areas un\u00ad spoiled by man that are at least 5,000 acres in size, are in the West far from Eastern population centers. But in the national forests of the East, there are numerous areas of lesser size that are reverting to primitive conditions following abandonment by man. While these areas do not meet the strict criteria of the Wilderness Act of 1964, they do contain physical and scenic features that would enable outdoor\u00ad minded people to enjoy experiences which the wilderness provides. In order for these areas to be pro\u00ad tected, maintained, and managed for wilderness-type recreation it is desirable to identify and designate them formally in a wild areas system. This is the purpose of the proposal offered today for consideration of the Senate. This bill, which Senator TALMADGE and I are offering would- First. Provide present and future gen\u00ad erations with primitive recreation op\u00ad portunities in a spacious, scenic, natural, and wild setting removed from the activ\u00ad ities of man; Second. Create a system of wild areas designated by Congress within national forests east of the lOOth meridian to be administered by the Secretary of Agri\u00ad culture as a part of the national forest system; Third. Authorize public use consistent with the ability of the area to support such use; Fourth. Limit developments to those necessary for the health, safety, and well\u00ad being of the visiting public; Fifth. Limit use of motorized equip\u00ad ment to that necessary for administra\u00ad tion, protection, health, and safety; Sixth. Prohibit commercial harvesting of timber; Seventh. Authorize Federal acquisition of private inholdings by donation, pur\u00ad chase, gift, exchange or condemnation; Eighth. Withdraw federally owned lands from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws, except for exist\u00ad ing valid claims; Ninth. Permit hunting, fishing, and trapping in accordance with Federal and State laws; Tenth. Authorize the Secretary of Ag\u00ad riculture to make such rules and regula\u00ad tions as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the act. Mr. President, the bill Senator TAL\u00ad MADGE and I are introducing today is companion legislation to H.R. 14392, which was introduced in the House on April 17 by Mr. KYL of Iowa. I am glad to note that the other body is giving this problem serious attention and I should also point out, as part of the record, that earlier this year the admin\u00ad istration requested the establishment of additional wilderness areas in the East\u00ad ern United States. In line with this request, the Presi\u00ad dent directed that a study be made to determine potential wilderness areas in the East. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the attached report from the Forest Service on alternatives for pre\u00ad serving and managing our wild lands in the East be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ALTERNATIVES FOR PRESERVING AND MANAGING NATIONAL FOREST WILD LAND VALUES IN THE EAST In his February 8, 1972, message on the environment, the President directed that the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior accelerate the identification of areas in the eastern Und.ted States having Wilderness potential. In response to that direction, the Forest Service is inviting interested indi\u00ad viduals and organizations to consider pos\u00ad sible alternatives and offer advice which will answer this question: \"How can the Na\u00ad tional Forest System in the East and South meet those needs of people which are an\u00ad swered in the West by National Forest Wilderness?\" The need for the kind of solitude and spiritual refreshment found in primitive, scenic surroundings is most acute in the populous southern and eastern States. Op\u00ad portunities for meeting this need are very llmlted in this part of the country because the impact of civilization has drastically altered the original ecosystem of two cen\u00ad turies ago. While many aJfected areas have recovered some appearance of undisturbed nature, it is questionable whether these lands are comparable to those set aside as Wilderness in the West. In any event, oppor\u00ad tunities for restoring and preserving primi\u00ad tive values east of the 100th meridian are not abundant, and they w1ll diminish unless positive action is taken. Public lands also are relatively limited in the East and South. The National Forests are the most extensive of these, and contain some of the best remaining opportunities for the preservation and management of wild land values. The Forest Service is striving to find. the most workable alternative for realizing these opportunities. Although the criteria of the Wilderness Act do not appear to fit eastern conditions because of the obvious evidence of past land June I3, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20571 use by man, some proposals have been made that the classification of wild lands could be achieved under the Wllderness Act. Several other alternatives are avaUable. Some were suggested even before the 1971 Forest Service invitation to the public for discussion of possible solutions. These alter\u00ad natives can form the basis now for discus\u00ad sion and an ultimate decision. One array of alternatives deals with action through legislation: An amendment or supplement to the Wil\u00ad derness Act to define a. new category of wtld lands in the South and East could achieve the purposes of new basic legislation and at the same time bring eastern units into the Wllderness System. Provisions for acqulring mineral rights and land could be made, but other amendments are possible once the sub\u00ad ject is opened. New basic legislation to establish a system of wild lands managed to restore their natu\u00ad ral values is another possibility. It could au\u00ad thorize acquisition of lands and mineral rights to establish viable units for preserva\u00ad tion. Time might be consumed in the legisla\u00ad tive process, possibly delaying full protection. Individual legislative actions to establish units meriting management to preserve primitive values could achieve the same re\u00ad sult as new basic legislation. However, there is the possibility that these Acts could es\u00ad tablish diverse management conditions and the legislative process could be lengthy. Before the Wilderness Act became effective, the Forest Service established Wild and Wilderness Areas through administrative ac\u00ad tion. Several alternatives are still available through this procedure. All share the advan\u00ad tage of providing protection early because legislation is not required. On the other hand, they do not solve problems of land and min\u00ad eral ownership. There is also a concern that administrative actions can be too easlly re\u00ad versed in the future. Forest Service multiple use plan units can be established under existing authorities with the approval of Regional Foresters. Classification by the Secretary of Agri\u00ad culture or the Chief of the Forest Service would assure higher level consideration and public involvement at the national level. Executive Order classification represents the highest level of administrative action. It has been an effective device in the case of many National Monuments which have been long and effectively protected under these Presidential directives. Additional alternatives or modifications of those listed should be considered as they are identified. The ultimate solution should be that which best meets the needs of the American people which recognizes all of the resource values of the National Forests and which best overcomes some basic obstacles, such as the following: OWnership patterns are fragmented. Only about one-half of the land surface within the boundaries of the eastern National For\u00ad ests is in Federal ownership. Of lands where surface rights have been acquired, the Government holds only 50 per\u00ad cent of the mineral rights. Most waterways and water surfaces .are not owned or controlled by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment, even within the National Forests. The Forest Service ls seeking public in\u00ad volvement in considering the alternatives. Individuals and organizations are urged to assist in these considerations. Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Verm.ont to introduce the National Forest Wild Areas Act of 1972, a bill to establish natural and wild areas within the economic \u00b7means and commuting dis\u00ad tance of the population of the Eastern United States. It is no secret that despite efforts by some communities to limit their growth, we are paving a wall-to-wall city from Maine to Norfolk, Va., and beyond, and another one around the southern rim of the Great Lakes from Minneapolis-St. Paul to New York City. Our lives are seemingly governed by series of fiat, green signs along an In\u00ad terstate Highway System that moves us at a steadily slower pace from one urban sprawl to another, telling travelers the monotonous tale of how our Nation has compressed its people--without any plan\u00ad ning at all-into a bone-hard catacomb of steel and asphalt that only leads peo\u00ad ple to want to escape. It is an amazing commentary on the content of this modem civilization that it has become more perili)US and tense for today's Americans to drive to work in the morning than it was for the pioneers to troop out in their covered wagons from St. Louis to settle the West. Dimly we perceive that there is some\u00ad thing all wrong with the way we have put our resources together. Now along that Interstate System a new kind of vehicle can be seen lumbering along. People call them campers, but they are really an escape device--the means by which hun\u00ad dreds of thousands of people are :fleeing big city and suburban living for the sake of their sanity. Each weekend the newspapers urge the residents of our eastern cities to buy \"a little bit of heaven\" in the countryside. And the people are buying-seeking a place to hide from the pressures of what we unfortunately have .to call everyday living. These little bits of heaven, which thou\u00ad sands of people are buying, are in a way an ominous sign. In aggregate they amount to a big chunk of heaven that is being withdrawn from the last remaining natural areas in the Eastern portion of our Nation. Beautiful, forested areas are being di\u00ad vided into lots. Top soil and trees are often stripped from the earth to make way for get-away-from-it-all dream homes. Not all of this development is bad, but much of it is, making no provi\u00ad sions for maintaining the natural fea\u00ad tures of the land, and often making no provisions for sewage and pollution con\u00ad trol. Meanwhile, the suburbs continue to expand in a menacing proliferation of fancy-named subdivisions, shoving their bland, treeless parkways up to what was once lush wilderness. Clearly it is time to take action to save the wild and natural areas remain\u00ad ing east of the Mississippi River for the generations of children-100 million of them-who will be with us in America in the 30 or 40 years to come. Our highways may be filled with camp\u00ad ers, and the developers may be pleased with their profitable land sales, but there are hundreds of thousands of our people who do not have the financial means to use these forms of escape. More than half of the people in this country live in the Eastern portion of America, but only 2 percent of the land designated as wilderness area is in this part of the Nation. Under the regulations established for the wilderness system, most natural East. em areas do not qualify, because at one time or another they have been logged or cultivated or mined. But there are thousands of acres threatened by devel\u00ad opment, which have grown back to nearly their natural state, and they should be preserved for the careful use of the mid\u00ad dle-class American who needs to take his family and get away from the tensions of urban living. Just as we need to move a higher per\u00ad centage of economic development and growth to our rural areas to balance up our population distribution, so also do we need to provide the opportunity for both rural and nonrural people to visit and commune with our land in its natural state. If this Nation is to survive, I am con\u00ad vinced we need to spread out our popula\u00ad tion over our country through rural de\u00ad velopment, and to provide areas for the re-creation of mind, spirit, and body that comes by getting surcease from the crowded streets and teeming activity that accompanies modern life. The establishment of wild areas such as those proposed in the bill we are in\u00ad troducing today will provide that release from modern strains by utilizing lands within our Eastern States that are well suited to the wilderness-type experience, and are neither needed nor desirable for other forms of rural commuity develop\u00ad ment. In fact, the provision of these pro\u00ad posed wild and natural areas within com\u00ad muting distance of the millions of peo\u00ad ple living in the large cities of the East will itself have a beneficial effect upon the economic prosperity of our rural communities-raising business activity, local incomes, and the local tax base by more than the possible cost. Conservation leaders have long recog\u00ad nized a need in the Eastern United states for primitive recreation opportunities in a specious, scenic, and wild setting, re\u00ad moved from activities and highly de\u00ad veloped works of man. The need for such primitive recrea\u00ad tion opportunities in the East is so great because most of the people of the United States live in the East and most of the wilderness areas are in the Western States. We need to balance this situation if most of the residents of the Eastern States are to have an opportunity to benefit directly. Many areas in the Eastern national forests-although not having the quali\u00ad fications for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, have been or are being restored through na\u00ad ture's healing processes. Through further protection, these areas can offer the at\u00ad mosphere, solitude, and recreation op\u00ad portunities that approximates that of a true wilderness and is so urgently needed by the people of the East. The bill Senator AIKEN and I are in\u00ad troducing today represents one means to provide for the establishment and pro\u00ad tection of the needed Eastern wild areas. In fact, it would provide stronger, more complete protection than would the Wilderness Act in many ways. For in\u00ad stance, subject to existing valid claims, the areas would be withdrawn from pos-20572 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 sible mineral exploitation. The bill would provide condemnation authority to pro\u00ad tect these Eastern areas from noncon\u00ad forming, adverse interior development, and attendant access requirements. Sig\u00ad nificant as it is, the Wilderness Act of 1964 falls short in a few areas of provid\u00ad ing absolute protection. Our bill would, for the wild areas of the East and South, correct these shortcomings and give land managers the adequate tools they need to carry out their task of preserving and restoring these priceless lands. The National Forest Wild Areas Act will, as would several of the other alter\u00ad natives in varying degrees, recognize the special qualities of some of the lands within the eastern national forests and will provide the special mangement measures to maintain, restore or protect such areas for present and future gen\u00ad erations of Americans. Mr. Joe Penfold, conservation direc\u00ad tor of the Izaak Walton League of Amer\u00ad ica, recently wrote \"Wilderness East-a Dilemma\" for American Forests. I ask that this be inserted into the RECORD at this point in my remarks as a scholarly discussion of the philosophy of wild land preservation and its potential implemen\u00ad tation in the East and South. Senators will note that the bill we are introducing today provides for extensive and careful base touching with all in\u00ad terested groups, including the people who will use it, before a proposed wild area could be established. Not only would the Forest Service be required to hold public hearings on each proposed addition to the wild area system, but the bill alSO specifies careful and extensive prior notification concerning details of the proposal. Our bill makes specific provision for detailed intergovernmental coordina\u00ad tion-involving not only the Governors and State government but also the coun\u00ad ties, towns, municipalities, and the rela\u00ad tively new multijurisdictional general purpose planning and development dis\u00ad tricts and environmental councils. We do not consider the bill we are introducing as the final word in any sense. We want to hear what those most directly affected have to say. We also wish to hear the advice of experts in out\u00ad door recreation, and land management, in rural development and in urban af\u00ad fairs. Everyone in the Eastern and Southern United States will be affected by this pro\u00ad posal and by how it is implemented. I want to hear what the people of At\u00ad lanta want done about this; and I want to hear what our rural counties and de\u00ad velopment districts and their residents think of the idea and their advice of how to put the proposal into operation with the greatest advantage to the rural com\u00ad munity. We have made many mistakes in set\u00ad tling this great land of ours and building our crowded cities. Some of these our parents and grandparents have already paid for with bankruptcies and heart\u00ad aches. But the children of some of these people are still paying in drugs and crime and degradation. Our bodies and minds were formed and nutured in a relatively simple rural en-vironment. Today many of us are sub\u00ad jected to the traffic jams and noise, air, and water pollution and mental and emotional strains pressed upon us by an increasingly technological high-speed so\u00ad ciety. As a people we can take just so much of this without cracking up. To relieve the pressure we need to make more room in the country-more room to live, work and play. And we need to pro\u00ad vide relaxation and escape for those who cannot benefit from full-time rural living. We need to systematically provide land areas where people can get off by them\u00ad selves, away from the pressures of civilization and its mechanics. The sponsors of this bill feel it is de\u00ad signed to meet some of these needs. But we need to find how many other people would be interested in utilizing these wild areas, if they are provided. Before passing the legislation we need to determine what kind of land manage\u00ad ment practices are compatible with the wilderness experience that people-city people as well as rural residents-desire and will use. We need to study carefully the availability of land in our various States for this wilderness-type use. By extensive hearings and careful con\u00ad sideration by the committee on this pro\u00ad posal we can draft proposed legislation that will provide a positive impetus to both rural development and to a higher quality of life for both city and rural people. Despite the many ravages of men, there are still vast areas east of the Mississippi River where cathedrals of trees protect the moist green .ground cover from the rays of the summer sun. There are still unpolluted streams that trickle quietly past proud stands of hardwood that tenuously cling to life under the pres\u00ad sure of the Nation's growing demand for more lumber. These sylvan settings must be main\u00ad tained and protected for the millions of Americans in the eastern part of America who have not got the money for a down payment on their own little bit of heaven. They must be maintained to preserve a semblance of the ecological system that was here before our forefathers arrived. They must be protected and maintained as an investment in a greener, less hur\u00ad ried future for this land we all love so well. I ask unanimous consent that an article written by Mr. J. W. Penfold, conservation director of the Izaak Wal\u00ad ton League of America, be printed in the RECORD as a part of my remarks. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: Wn.n AREAS (By J. w. Penfold} The Wilderness Act of 1964 provided the administrative-legislative mechanism by which Primitive Areas of the national forests can be brought within a system to be pro\u00ad tected, preserved and managed as wilderness in perpetuity. The Act became law roughly a. half century after the wilderness concept first took meaningful form in the minds of a handful of visionaries-the Arthur Car\u00ad harts, the Aldo Leopolds. The concept became firmly rooted in 1924 by designation of the first Wilderness area, the Gila. in New Mex\u00ad ico and shortly ther~lfter by action to set aside for special protection and management the roa.dless areas of the canoe waters along the Minnesota-Canadian boundary. During the 1930's under the stimulus of Robert Marshall, many more wild and wilderness areas were created by executive action of the Chief of the Forest Service and the Secretary of Agriculture respectively. The Wilderness Act (which also provided for wilderness in the National Park and Na\u00ad tional Wildlife Refuge systems) came about for two principal reasons-to obtain the pro\u00ad tection and permanence offered by positive Congressional action, rather than leaving wilderness preservation solely to administra\u00ad tive discretion and determination, and, to establish the high standards and criteria in which wilderness would be established and managed. A crucial point is that every effort made by conservationists in the half century leading to the Wilderness Act was premised on obtaining recognition and acceptance of wilderness as a. natural ecosystem, untram\u00ad meled by man in the past and permitted to continue untrammeled and undisturbed by man's activities in the future. The Act es\u00ad tablished such standards and criteria, though, perhaps less strict than needed. But, the Wilderness Act, as it applies to national forests, has other shortcomings\u00ad geographic and demographic. The great bulk of national forest primitive areas eligible for inclusion in the wilderness system are lo\u00ad cated in the western states, while the bulk of the American population :ives east of the Mississippi. Curiously, in retrospect, this was used as a major argument against the Act by most of its principal opponents. The Wilderness Act, in addition to blan\u00ad keting into the system those areas already restudied and designated \"primitive\" by Exec\u00ad utive action, provided for the detailed study of the remaining areas previously designated. If they are found to meet the standards and criteria. of the Act, they are presented to Congress for specific inclusion in the system by legislation. A period of 10 years was pro\u00ad vided during which the operation was to be completed. As of this writing, Congress has taken action on 7, another 8 are awaiting Congressional action, 9 are in the final re\u00ad porting and recommendation stage, and 11 are in the study and field hearing pipeline. The Wilderness Act also provided authority to the Forest Service and Department of Ag\u00ad riculture to nominate additional areas, not having been designated before but meeting the standards and criteria of wilderness as provided in the Act. The number and loca\u00ad tion of such \"de facto\" areas are uncertain. Some have been identified by the Forest Service and/or citizen wilderness groups and some have received preliminary reconnais\u00ad sance study. One of these, the Scape Goat, awaits Congressional action. The Forest Serv\u00ad ice has been subject to extensive criticism from some quarters, however, for not mov\u00ad ing more aggressively and quickly to study, recommend and get \"de facto\" areas into the wilderness designation pipeline. Understand\u00ad ably, the Forest Service (and other federal agencies involved in definitive studies under the Act) has necessarily given first priority to the primitive areas specified for study un\u00ad der the Act. Meanwhile, citizen wilderness interests have also pushed hard for early inclusion in the wilderness system many other prime areas which retain a. high degree of wilder\u00ad ness character and offer the atmosphere and recreation opportunities of a near wilderness environment. Such areas, many of which are located in eastern national forests, may bear to a greater or lesser extent the heavy im\u00ad print af man's activities-logged, farmed, roaded, developed-but have been abandoned and to a. substantial degree have recovered or on the road to recovery, through natural processes. It is argued by some that such areas reversing to wilderness should be ell-June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20573 gible for inclusion in the wilderness system. They argue that the criteria and standards of wilderness established by the Act are suf\u00ad ficiently flexible now to embrace such areas; or, that the Wilderness Act should be amended to provide such flexiblUty. Others, including the writer, feel just as strongly that lowering wilderness standards by amendment of the Act or by its more liberal interpretation, in the long run, can only threaten the integrity of all designated wil\u00ad derness. Even 1f the line can be held rigorously against the invasion by commer\u00ad cial development---.a.nd pressures for such are unrelenting-there still remains the growing and nearly irresistible pressure of recreationists themselves who, with snow\u00ad mobile, outboard, ATV and other gadgetry, or sheer numbers lean their weight against every wilderness boundary. But, the wilderness preservation advocates are profoundly correct that there is need for more wilderness to meet the requirements of a growing population of outdoor minded citizens who have the right as well as the desire for the unique experience which only wilderness can provide. And, especially are such areas essential east of the Mississippi close to burgeoning metropolitan areas, where opportunities for classic wilderness are least. The question to be answered and the dilemma to be resolved are thus found to be rather simply stated: how can wilderness value and experience be provided close to populations living in the midwest, east and south without lowering Wilderness Act cri\u00ad teria and standards. The Forest Service itself, tormented by the question and harassed by constant and sometimes hyper\u00ad critical demands, took a major step. At the 12th Biennial Wilderness Conference staged by the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society, the Forest Service invited the forces for Wilderness to sit down with them to dis\u00ad cuss the issues and find the answer. Impllcit in the invitation was the thought, among other alternatives, that the mechanism for accomplishing the objective might be cre\u00ad ation of another system. Such areas would possess to a substantial degree the prime characteristics of wilderness, in spite of man's past activities, from which they are re\u00ad covering, but which do not measure up to the strict criteria and standards required by the Wilderness Act. For lack of a better name, we've called it a system of \"wild\" areas. Follow-up d!lscussions were initiated by wilderness interested organizations. A con\u00ad sensus has not yet developed, however al\u00ad ternative courses of action quickly became apparent: 1. Create a system of \"Wild Areas\" by statutory or executive designation. 2. Amend the Wilderness Act so that east\u00ad ern areas that do not meet the present stitf requirements of the Wilderness Act can be included under that Act. Have Congress reinterpret the Wilderness Act to the extent that reconstituted or re\u00ad coverable wilderness can be included in the National Wilderness Preservation System. There appears to be agreement, 1f alterna\u00ad tive one is chosen, that the \"wild\" area system should be established by Act of Con\u00ad gress and individual areas be brought into the system by Act of Congress. This proce\u00ad dure would parallel that provided by the Wilderness Ac;. for bringing areas into the Wilderness System. The regulations on man\u00ad agement and use of \"wild\" areas would parallel those required for wilderness. Addi\u00ad tionally, they should be withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under leasing or disposition of mineral materials. Moreover, because of complex ownership patterns prevalent in eastern forests, acquisition of inholdings could be made by condemnation where necessary. In these two latter re-spects the \"wild\" area system would offer greater protection than does the Wilderness Act itself and the present 5,000 acre limita\u00ad tion need not be inhibiting. Establishment of a system of \"wild\" areas would not mitigate against consideration of eastern areas for designation under the Wil\u00ad derness Act. Areas which meet the criteria and standards of the Wilderness Act would continue to be eligible for wilderness designa\u00ad tion. However, if they do not meet those stiff requirements because of man's past activities, but nonetheless offer high potentials for wil\u00ad derness values and experience, they could be eligible for designation under the \"wild\" area system and their wilderness characteristics be preserved into the future. Adoption of the \"wild\" area system ap\u00ad proach would provide another category of federal areas at no additional administrative or management cost. It would parallel the Wilderness System. It would be consistent with the several category approach provided in the Wild and Scenic River Systems already established by Congress. It would assure the preservation of prime national forest areas in the east to provide wilderness recreation and other values for the m1111ons of citizens residing far from our great western Wilder\u00ad ness areas. Moreover, it would accomplish this without threatening the integrity of the wilderness principle or wilderness system and without opening the Wilderness Act to weak\u00ad ening amendments by those interests which would gladly scuttle the whole wilderness concept. Following the same Executive-Legislative procedures as provided in the Wilderness Act the publlc could be assured that actions taken under a \"wild\" system act would be consistent with overall national forest ob\u00ad jectives and purposes as specified in the Mul\u00ad tiple Use Act of 1960. Finally, there would be full opportunity for citizen input all along the line. As it stands now, the need for action is apparent. All options for action are open. A working consensus on the best course of ac\u00ad tion to be followed could get this important job accompllshed. By Mr. RIBICOFF: S. 3700. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to allow a credit against the individual income tax for tuition paid for the elementary or sec\u00ad ondary education of dependents. Re\u00ad ferred to the Committee on Finance. TUITION TAX CREDITS FOR NONPUBLIC SCHOOLS Mr. RmiCOFF. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation allowing tax credits for tuition to nonpublic ele\u00ad mentary and secondary schools. Emo\u00ad tional and legal controversy surrounds the question of aid to private or paro\u00ad chial schools and the fate of these schools is an issue which everyone conceme41- with the future of our entire education system must consider. If the Nation's 21,800 nonpublic schools were thriving institutions, Gov\u00ad ernment assistance would not be needed. But that is not the case. The President's Panel on Nonpublic Education has reported that non-public\u00ad school enrollment has been declining at a rate of 6 percent per year. Roman Catholic schools have been the hardest hit, but they are not alone. In the past 2 years, independent school enrollment has dropped 11 percent, military schools 10 percent, and boarding schools 4 per\u00ad cent. At this rate one-fourth of the schools operating in 1970 will be closed by 1975. If this trend continues we will experi\u00ad ence a massive dislocation in our public school system. Over 10 percent of Amer\u00ad ica's total elementary and secondary students attend nonpublic schools. Should these schools collapse, our public school system would have to absorb over 5 million more children. Most of the im\u00ad pact would be felt in urbanized areas already heavily burdened by the need to provide public service. In the 20 largest cities, nearly two out of five schoolchildren are enrolled in nonpublic schools. The public school sys\u00ad tems in New York City would have to expand to accommodate over 358,000 new students if private schools closed. In Chi\u00ad cago, 208,000 students would be added and in Philadelphia 146,000. My own State of Connecticut faces a similar potential burden. Over 100,000 students, 14 percent of all students, now attend parochial and priv31te schools. Twelve of these schools closed in 1971 and more may close this year. We all have a stake in this problem. Some critics of aid to nonpublic schools argue that public assistance will weaken support of our public school system. They point out that less than half of the pub\u00ad lic school bond issues were ratified last year. We cannot ignore, however, the enor\u00ad mous costs involved in transferring non\u00ad public students into the public schools. It has been estimated that collapse of our nonpublic schools would cost local taxpayers an additional $5 billion a year. Taxes would have to increase or more public schools close to meet this expense. The American public should not be forced to assume this additional tax bur\u00ad den unless it is absolutely necessary. In addition, proposals for aiding non\u00ad public education at the levels generally discussed will not encourage expansion of the system, but will only serve to stem their decline. The difficulty arises 1n what form that aid should take. In the past cities and States have been most ingenious 1n developing assistance programs. Few of them, however, have satisfied the constitutional prohibitions against the ''establishment of religion.\" In 1971 the Supreme Court in Lemon against Kurzman, summarized the cu\u00ad mulative criteria it had developed. First, the program must have a secular pur\u00ad pose; second, its primary effect must not be the advancement or inhibition of re\u00ad ligion; finally, it must not foster ''an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\" I believe that tax credits meet these tests. First, the program's purpose is to lower the expense of education to the students' parents. No tax funds would be given to the school. Second, its effect is to enable parents to decide which type of education is best for their child. Finally, because the taxpayer, not the school, is subject to audit, there are no excessive governmental entanglements. The formula I am proposing is similar to that used in S. 1111, my bill to pro~ vide tax credits for higher education ex\u00ad penses. A parent would be allowed a maximum credit of $475 for each stu\u00ad dent's tuitjon, The credit would be com-20574 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 puted on the basis of 100 percent of the :first $200 for tuition; 50 percent of the next $300; and 25 percent of the sub\u00ad sequent $500. Unless some governmental aid is forth\u00ad coming, most of our nonpublic schools will eventually disappear. Those that survive will do so by requiring exorbitant tuitions which only the very wealthy can afford. The result will be that private and parochial schools, rSither than being educational options open to all, will be sanctuaries for the rich. My proposal would avoid these prob\u00ad lems. By allowing middle-and lower-in\u00ad come families the ability to send their chilren to nonpublic schools, it will guar\u00ad antee the continued existence of these schools plus a well balanced student body. I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 3700 be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 3700 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Untted States of Amertca in Congress assembled, That (a) subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to credits allowable) is amended by redesignating section 42 as sec\u00ad tion 43, and by inserting after section 41 the following new section: \"SEC.42.

By Mr. BA YH (for himself and Mr. Randolph): S. 3701. A bill to extend and improve the Federal Highway Safety Program, and for other purposes. Referred to the Committee on Public Works. THE HIGHWAY SAFETY ACT OF 1972 Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce for appropriate refer\u00ad ence \"The Highway Safety Act of 1972\" on behalf of the distinguished chairman of the Public Works Committee <Mr. RANDOLPH) and myself. This bill and oth\u00ad ers pending before the Subcommittee on Roads, which I am privileged to serve as chairman, will be considered at high\u00ad way safety hearings scheduled for Thurs\u00ad day, June 15. In the words of Howard Pyle, president of the National Safety Council, automo\u00ad bile accidents \"remain the largest violent threat to life in the United States.'' In 1970 there were 54,800 fatalities on our Nation's streets and highways, and 2, 735,- 122 nonfatal injuries. Even more people died and were injured in 1971. Carnage on the highway is a reality, not a slogan Mr. President, and we have to do some\u00ad thing about it. Of course the States and the Federal Government have long been concerned about highway safety, and a considerable amount of progress has been made in this field. But much, more remains to be done. The bill I introduce today will help us reach our goal of safe and sane highways in five ways: first, by removing from the road drivers who are under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs; second, by improving our existing roads and bridges; third, by providing emergency medical care to victims of highway accidents; fow\u00b7th, by authorizing sharply increased funding for Federal highway safety pro\u00ad grams and grants to the States; and fi\u00ad nally by providing a financial incentive for States to bring their safety programs into compliance with Federal standards. Let me discuss these aspects of the bill in more detail. First, an attack on the intoxicated driver. The\u00b7 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has stated that- The use of alcohol by drivers on the high\u00ad ways, particularly the continued, excessive use of alcohol by problem drinkers, is the single most important highway safety issue today. And there is growing concern that the use of drugs by drivers also contributes significantly to accidents. The Highway Safety Act of 1972 deals with these prob\u00ad lems. It encourages all the States to bring their safety programs into com\u00ad pliance with Federal standards on alco\u00ad hol in relation to highway safety by re\u00ad quiring the Secretary of Transportation to cut off 10 percent of Federal-aid high\u00ad way funds to States which do not meet those Federal standards by July 1, 1974. It directs the Secretary to prepare a new safety standard requiring the States to have laws against driving while under the infiuence of alcohol or drugs, to en\u00ad force these laws effectively, and to pro\u00ad vide meaningful penalties for the viola\u00ad tion of these laws and, where appropri\u00ad ate, medical treatment for violators. It provides for a special research program into the relationship between drug use and highway safety, and it directs the Secretary to prepare highway safety standards on this topic. As chairman of the Senate Juvenile Delinquency Sub\u00ad committee, I have seen firsthand the results of the use and abuse of drugs. Persons under their infiuence, even prop\u00ad erly so, should not be on our highways. Second, a program to improve the safety of our existing streets and high\u00ad ways. The bill establishes a special pro\u00ad gram to assist States in eliminating road\u00ad way dangers, including high accident lo\u00ad cations and roadside obstacles. For this program, $200,000,000 a year is author\u00ad ized. The bill also creates a new, special pavement marking program for all roads other than those on the Interstate Sys\u00ad tem, with preference to be given to rural areas-where badly marked roads often produce terrible accidents. For this pro\u00ad gram $100,000,000 is authorized. Finally, a new authorization of $250,000,000 is included for the bridge replacement program. Third, a way to provide emergency medical care to victims of highway acci\u00ad dents. This is a crucial new program. If \"accidents will happen,\" then we must help those who are hurt, to prevent need\u00ad less complications, even death. But too often today we do not. Arthur Freese in an article in the Saturday Review re\u00ad cently asserted that: Experts returning from Korea and Vietnam have openly declared that, 1n case of injury, chances for survival would be better in the zone of combat than on the average city street. Perhaps this is just a tribute to our servicemen overseas. But why should not the emergency medical care available to June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20575 highway accident victims here in the United States be as good? The bill I in\u00ad troduce today provides funds to assist States in preparing comprehensive plans for the provision of emergency medical care, and, after approval of the plans, provides funds to help implement them. Whether it is more equipment, like am\u00ad bulances or helicopters, or better train\u00ad ing for personnel involved, this part of the bill will make Federal funds avail\u00ad able where they are deeply needed. Fourth, a sharp increase in highway safety .funding. In addition to the au\u00ad thorizations I have already mentioned, the bill authorizes $270 million for Fed\u00ad eral highway safety programs and grants to the States under existing law, more than twice the amount authorized at present. In addition, $175 million is au\u00ad thorized for highway safety research, again a substantial increase over existing levels. This is a lot of money, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I know, but it is needed, and it can be used effectively. There are, after all, more than 50,000 lives at stake. I should also point out, Mr. President, that all of the money authorized by the bill will come from the highway trust fund. This is a change from existing law, and a de\u00ad sirable one: for what could possibly be more highway related than highway safety? Fifth, and finally, the Highway Safety Act of 1972 creates two new incentive programs designed to encourage States to comply with Federal highway safety standards. This is a \"carrot\" rather than a \"stick\" approach . Under one new sec\u00ad tion, the Secretary will distribute $10 million to those States which have ob\u00ad tained above average results in the high\u00ad way safety area. Under another section, the Secretary will distribute $10 million to those States which have made the most significant improvements in high\u00ad way safety. The money will be used by the States to further their efforts in this field. Mr. President, highway accidents cost the Nation over 50,000 lives and an esti\u00ad mated $14.3 billion in 1971. This extrav\u00ad agant waste of national treasure must be curbed. We must once again have safe streets-safe to drive on, safe to ride on, safe to walk by. That will be the goal of the Roads Subcommittee when we con\u00ad sider highway safety legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a summary of the Highway Safety Act of 1972, and the article to which I referred by Arthur Freese be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill, sum\u00ad mary, and article were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 3701 Be tt enacted by the Senate and House of Representattves of the United States of .America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the \"Highway Safety Aot of 1972\".

SUMMARY OF THE HIGHWAY SAFETY ACT OF 1972 Section 1. Title. Provides that the Act may be cited as \"The Highway Safety Act of 1972.\" Section 2. Penalties for Driving While In\u00ad toxicated. Directs the Secretary of Transpor\u00ad tation to develop highway safety standards which require the States to have laws against driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, to enforce these laws effectively, and to provide meaningful penalties for the violation of these laws and, where appro\u00ad priate medical treatment for violators of these laws. Section 3. Compliance With the Alcohol Safety Standard. Requires the Secretary to cut off ten percent of a State's Federal-Aid Highway money if that State is not in com\u00ad pliance with the Alcohol Safety Standard by July 1,1974. Section 4. Incentives For Compliance With Highway Safety Standards. Creates a new in\u00ad centive program to encourage the States to comply with the Highway Safety Standards. The Secretary will award $10,000,000 a year to those States which he determines \"have obtained above average results \"in the high\u00ad way safety area. He will award another $10,- 000,000 to those States which \"have made the most significant improvements\" in their efforts. The money will be used by the States in their highway safety programs. This sec\u00ad tion also requires the Secretary to report to the Congress whenever he decides not to withhold Federal-Aid Highway funds from States which are not in compliance with the Highway Safety Standards. Section 5. Elimination of Roadway Dangers. Adds a new section to the Highway Safety Act which provides funds for States to e11Ini\u00ad nate dangerous locations and roadside obsta\u00ad cles on all roads. The States will inventory their roads, set priorities, and establish a schedule for elimination of such dangers. The Secretary, after approving the scehdules, will award the State 70 percent of the cost of the projects. Sign and light supports replaced or built pursuant to this section will, to the extent appropriate, be designed to yield or break away upon impact. ($200,000,000 is authorized for each of the next two fiscal years for this program.) Section 6. Drug Use and Highway Safety. Authorizes the Secretary \"to carry out safety research on the relationship between the con\u00ad sumption and use of drugs and their effect upon highway safety,\" and directs him as soon as practicable to issue highway safety standards relating to drug use and highway safety. ($25,000,000 is authorized for each of the next two fisacl years for this program.) Section 7. Emergency Medical Care for Vic\u00ad tims of Highway Accidents. Creates a. new program to help the States provide emer\u00ad gency medical care to victims of highway accidents. The States are to develop compre\u00ad hensive plans for such care, with the federal government paying 70 percent of the plan\u00ad ning costs. After approval of the plans, the federal share of the new implementation costs wlll also be 70 percent. ($5 million is author\u00ad ized for planning grants, and $25 million is authorized for the first year of implementa\u00ad tion grants.) Section 8. Pavement Marking Program. Creates a new, special pavement marking program for all roads, other than the Inter\u00ad state system. Rural areas are to get prefer\u00ad ences for funds under this section. The fed\u00ad eral share of the pavement marking projects is 70 percent. ($100,000,000 is authorized for each of the next two fiscal years for this program.) Section 9. Authorizations. All Highway Safety Programs will be funded entirely out of the Highway Trust Fund. In addition to the authorizations already mentioned, the bill provides: $270,000,000 for each of the next two fiscal years for carrying out federal highway safety programs; $175,000,000 for each of the next two fiscal years for carry\u00ad ing out federal highway safety research; $250,000,000 for each of the next two fiscal years for carrying out the bridge replacement program. lFrom the Saturday Review, May 13, 1972) TRAUMA: THE NEGLECTED EPIDEMIC (By Arthur S. Freese) A twenty-two-year-old motorist over\u00ad turned his car thirty miles southeast of Atlanta this winter. Pulled from the wreck\u00ad age by the ambulance attendants, he was loaded into their vehicle and rushed to a hospital. There the examining physician June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20577 found the young man paralyzed from the waist down-due, the doctor said, to mis\u00ad handling by the ambulance personnel. It seemed that no one had bothered to teach these attendants, employees of a local under\u00ad taker, how to handle accident victims with spinal injuries. According to physicians who specialize in trauma (medically defined as accidental in\u00ad jury), this tragic episode is far from unique; such incidents probably occur somewhere in America every day. Experts returning from Korea and Vietnam, for example, have openly declared that, in case of injury, chances for survival would be better in the zone of combat than on the average city street. Dr. John M. Howard, professor of surgery at Philadelphia's Hahnemann College of Medicine, recently described an incident that took place in his city: A man in his mid-twenties was the victim of an auto\u00ad mobile accident. The police came promptly to the scene, but were trained neither to examine the victim nor to evaluate his in\u00ad juries. They merely loaded the young man into an ambulance and rushed him to the nearest hospital. X-rays revealed that the victim was suffer\u00ad ing from a broken leg, which the doctors splinted. They then packed the young man back into the ambulance and sent him on to another hospital, as theirs was already overcrowded. At the second hospital doctors found that the blood supply to the broken leg was blocked off, and, twelve hours after the initial injury, they performed arterial surgery to restore blood flow. The attempt was unsuccessful. Gas gangrene had set in, and the doctors were forced to amputate the leg. Nevertheless, the young man died. In discussing this tragedy, Dr. Howard sadly summarized the causes: \"Every facet of the system was at fault. Inadequate hos\u00ad pital evaluation and inadequate early care\u00ad a preventable death because our capab1llties had not been effectively mobilized.\" The \"system\"-emergency medical care\u00ad actually has two phasps. The first stretches from the time of the accident to the time the victim enters the hospital; the second spans the time the victim spends in the hospital emergency room (now called the Emergency Department or ED). Failures in both phases a.tfilct trauma care all over the country. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, in its classic little volume Accidental Death and Disabil\u00ad ity, describes trauma as \"the neglected epi\u00ad demic of modern society ... the nation's most important environmental health prob\u00ad lem ... a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars.\" Actually, trauma is what happens to every one of us: the child injured in a bad spill; the elderly person who falls and breaks a hlp; the victim of a knife or gunshot wound; the person who falls from a stool or several-story window; the victim of an auto accident; the person with a slight burn or one that leaves a good part of the body's skin destroyed. Trauma may require no more than careful bandaging, or it may require teams of surgeons working for a dozen hours on end. It also may put its victims beyond help in a matter of seconds. The figures are enough to boggle the mind. According to the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Safety Council, each day trauma k1lls 310 Americans, injures 137,000, confines 32,000 to bed, leaves 1,100 with some degree of impairment, and costs our nation some $58-mill1on. In 1971 trauma left 114,\u00adooo dead, more than 50 million injured (one out of every four Americans), and 500,000 permanently impaired-all at a cost of some $21-billlon. Trauma is a problem of evenings and nights, holidays and weekends, one that wipes out its victims' most productive years; it 1s the leading cause of death among Americans of both sexes, from ages one to forty\u00ad five. And tragically, much of its toll is un\u00ad necessary. Experts say that up to a third of the death and much of the disability could be prevented with adequate emergency medical care. Yet for many years the Ameri\u00ad can College of Surgeons' Trauma Committee was virtually alone in its war on this epi\u00ad demic. Only recently, thanks to a series of studies that reveal the shocking facts, has trauma treatment begun to attract atten\u00ad tion. In a study of highway fatalities in Cali\u00ad fornia, for example, Dr. Julian A. Waller found that four times as many deaths oc\u00ad curred in rural accidents as in urban, even though injuries in the former were \"inher\u00ad ently more survivable.\" The figures, Waller says, evidence a failure of both the ambu\u00ad lance and hospital phases of rural emer\u00ad gency medical systems. University of Michi\u00ad gan surgeon Dr. Charles Frey headed a simi\u00ad lar study of 159 highway fatalities in Michi\u00ad igan. He concluded that twenty-eight of these people (nearly one-fifth) would have been saved and, more significantly, restored to health as good as that before the acci\u00ad dents, had they received the proper emer\u00ad gency treatment. Another nine also might have survived. In other words, one-quarter of the victims would have lived with proper care. Frey attributed almost all the unneces\u00ad sary deaths to inadequately trained ambu\u00ad lance personnel. Dr. William T. Fitts, Jr., professor of sur\u00ad gery at the University of Pennsylvania and editor of the Journal of Trauma, studied all of the 950 trauma deaths reported in a single calendar year in Philadelphia and concluded that fifty-one (51 per cent) of these deaths were avoidable. The fatal mistakes he found were virtually all made by doctors in the hospital. They involved lack of proper patient care, wrong diagnosis, or both. The situation has many people troubled. Physcians themselves display little con\u00ad fidence in their own system. Dr. Robert H. Kennedy, who for twelve years directed the Trauma Committee of the American College of Surgeons, recently admitted: \"I don't feel that if I'm in an accident on a trip, I can be sure of just getting to the hospital alive.\" Another well-known trauma surgeon, who recently carried out a survey of the emer\u00ad gency departments in one of our largest cities, commented, \"There's not an emer\u00ad gency department in this city where I'd feel comfortable having a severely injured mem\u00ad ber of my family treated.\" And Howard Pyle, president of the National Safety Council, summing up the problem in Traffic Safety Magazine, remarked: \"The state of emer\u00ad gency medical services in the nation today is, in a word, grim.\" The Second World War was the watershed of emergency medical care. Before the war interns rode ambulances and staffed emer\u00ad gency rooms and, with the limited medical expertise then available, provided emergency care adequate to the times. But with the war came an explosion in medical know-how and technology, and also the beginning of spe\u00ad cialization. The effect of all this was critical to emergency care. Captain John Waters, former chief of the U.S. Coast Guard Rescue and Research, points out: \"The massive trend toward specialization resulted in doc\u00ad tors retreating Into their hospitals and clinics, where they waited with sophisticated equipment and training for the dead and dying to be brought to them-hopefully in a viable condition.\" The burden of the first phase of trauma care, therefore, fell on the shoulders of the ambulance personnel\u00ad not doctors, but technicians. Today's properly trained ambulance at\u00ad tendant, however, can perform far more life\u00ad saving procedures than the pre-World War II physician ever dreamed of. Dr. Henry C. Huntley, director of the U.S. Public Health Services, emphasizes that \"We can save lives with adequately equipped ambulances and properly trained personnel. It may be 50,000 or 75,000, but a figure of 60,000 is in the right ball park.\" Many stories about ambulance operations are shocking. They tell of ambulance services run by undertakers making little effort to save the living because funerals are more profitable; employees of these services argu\u00ad ing over dead bodies while the living injured go unattended; ambulances, in &. race to the scene of an accident, colliding with each other; ambulance personnel maiming victims not only by carelessness and inadequacy, but, some say, sadistic handling. More than one physician has described the majority of our ambulance attendants as nothing more than \"freight handlers.\" Exaggera.tions? Perhaps. But the stories, unfortunately, are founded in hard facts. A recent University of Iowa study found that some 60 per cent of the state's ambulance services were run by undertakers. Only half required their attendants to have even sim\u00ad ple first-aid training. Almost half admin\u00ad istered no first aid In severe injuries, and nearly two-thirds carried no splints. Less than half bothered to clean their equipment after it was used. The most recent U.S. Public Hea.Ith figures on emergency services show that nearly half the nation's ambulances are operated by undertakers, a quarter by volunteers, and the rest by commercial agencies and fire or pollee departments. Hospitals run only 3 per cent. The setup, however, varies according to region: In the Northeast volunteers make up a large percentage; in the South undertakers provide the bulk of service; in the Midwest commercial companies are plentiful; in states west of the Mississippi hospital-owned am\u00ad bulances are common. The vehicles used as ambulances are in\u00ad dicative of the state of these services. Slight\u00ad ly over a third of the ambulances in the country are custom-designed, and less than one-tenth are rescue vehicles, and even among these only a very small percentage meet the criteria set by the National Acad\u00ad emy of Sciences or carry the advised equip\u00ad ment. Hearses still make up nearly a quarter, station wagons another fourth, and panel trucks or va.ns comprise a tenth of the total. Not exactly model vehicles. Ideally, an am\u00ad bulance should be high enough to allow at\u00ad tendants to stand erect sa they can work efficiently and wide enough to hold a Utter on each side with working room in between. It should carry every needed type of splint, bandage, and backboard (for spinal injuries), an obstetrics kit, oxygen and ventilation units, drug and intravenous fluid outfits, a portable electrocardiograph (EKG), and a defibrillator to shock a stopped heart back into action. It also should carry equipment to broadcast an EKG to the hospital for instant diagnosis, a blood pressure measur\u00ad ing device, and a stethoscope. In short, an ambulance should be a moblle emergency room. Moreover, it should carry shovels, power jacks, fire axes, and hacksaws-what\u00ad ever is needed for the safe extrica.tlon of vic\u00ad tims from a wreck. Another es.sentlal of good ambulance serv\u00ad ice 1s a two-way voice communication sys\u00ad tem so that the ambulance can converse With its dispatcher and its hospitals to obtain medical advice on the handling of an emer\u00ad gency. With vehicles so equipped, doctors in the hospital can give tentative diagnoses and advice for treatment, and also direct the ambulance to a specific hospital for spe\u00ad cialized care-and away from those too crowded to handle the case. The chosen hos\u00ad pital can then be alerted so that it can pre\u00ad pare for the victims. Yet, vital as such com\u00ad munication is, Dr. Huntley finds that only half the ambulances now in service can communicate with their dispatchers, only one in seventeen with their hospital. How many of our ambulances are adequate 20578 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 for proper emergency treatment? At the Na\u00ad tional Symposium on Emergency Medical Services held last May in Philadelphia, Dr. Vernon E. Wilson, administrator of the U.S. Health Services and Mental Health Adminis\u00ad tration, noted: \"Of the 25,000 ambulances used in the United States today for transport\u00ad ing medical emergencies, not more than 1,000 meet the recommended standards for design and equipment.\" All of this equipment is virtually worth\u00ad less, however, unless ambulances a.re stafi'ed with what one trauma expert described as \"a professional, a career man, trained, equip\u00ad ped, and licensed to render essential llfe support.\" Such an individual is now called an Emergency Medical Technician-Am\u00ad bulance or EMT, but one can be found in only a few top ambulance services. Most states do not have realistic require\u00ad ments for training or licensing ambulance personnel. It's a sad commentary, for ex\u00ad ample, that while Pennsylvania. requires bar\u00ad bers to attend barber college for 1,500 hours (50 of which must be anatomy and physiol\u00ad ogy) and manicurists to take 200 hours at a. school of beauty culture, the state has no requirements for ambulance personnel. There are, of course, a. few communities such as Jacksonv1lle, Louisv1lle, Baltimore, and Miami where ambulance personnel a.re properly trained. But the total is a. mere handful. The training of EMTs may soon reach the point of a. two-year college program. But even now they are taught to check a victim's vita.! signs (heart rate, blood pressure, res\u00ad piration), take a quick medical history, and observe and evaluate the victim's condition. In an emergency situation EMTs first estab\u00ad lish and ma.lntain an a.lrway (after four minutes without air a. victim will either die or be pa.ra.Iyzed for life) and administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mouth-to-mouth breathing, and closed chest massage. CPR has maintained innumerable Americans who, although clinically dead (without a. pulse or respiration), were kept alive until medical action could restart the heart. Once the airway is restored, the EMT stops any bleeding, splints a. broken back or neck, administers intravenous fluids, gives drugs, uses a stethoscope, takes a.n EKG, extricates a victim from a wreck, treats a bad burn, delivers a baby-you name It. The value of properly organized and equipped ambulance services employing EMTs can actually be measured in lives: for example, more than 100 lives a year are said to be saved by the ambulance services of Jacksonvme, Florida, in auto accidents alone. The Jacksonvllle Rescue Squad is often cited as the best in the country, and John Waters, now executive assistant to the mayor, is usually held responsible for its excellence. Waters, who in addition to his work With the Coast Guard has directed rescue for the Fed\u00ad eral Highway Administration, notes: \"In 1967, before we started our rescue service, we had 139 kllied in roughly 15,000 auto acci\u00ad dents. In 1971 we had only 118 killed, despite a rise in these accidents to around 24,000.\" There are a number of ways to bring good ambulance service to any community. Pollee and fire departments are especially success\u00ad ful at running these operations because they already have the communications, the avaU\u00ad ab111ty, and often a good part of the know\u00ad how. The model ambulance services of Jack\u00ad sonville, Baltlmore, and Louisville all use this approach. But volunteer companies also have done top-notch lifesaving jobs. Where these are not feasible solutions, experts suggest franchising private companies to operate as public ut111ty monopolies supervised by the government. In sparsely settled areas ambu\u00ad lance services have been successfully based at hospitals with attendants doubling as hos\u00ad pital technicians when not out on runs. A more glamorous approach to emergency service is the ambulance helicopter, which has attracted interest because of its space\u00ad age appeal. But most individuals involved in emergency care don't consider \"choppers\" a viable solution to the present problems; they are simply too expensive to operate. The money would be better spent on improving \u00b7ordinary ambulance service and personnel, and the hospital emergency departments. Waters, however, suggests utilizing the hell\u00ad copters of the military, police, and Coast Guard for emergencies. The Jacksonville Res\u00ad cue Squad, for example, has arranged to call upon helicopters stationed at a local air base in case of an emergency requiring air lift. Another way to improve emergency care would be to standardize victim-hospital com\u00ad munications. In other words, the toll-free 911 emergency number should become national in scope. The 911 operator should have a direct connection to a central dispatcher who can recognize the medical problem, order the appropriate ambulance, and then direct the ambulance to the proper hospital. Like the EMT, the dispatcher should be a professional and should receive a salary commensurate with the training he has. There are only 125 communities in the United States that have the 911 system in operation. We have a. long way to go. For many experts the problem bolls down to a matter of economics and the public's sense of values. As Waters sees it, \"We typi\u00ad cally pay $30 per capita for police protection in an urban area and $24 for fire--yet we won't pay $1.50 for good emergency medical ca.re outside the hospital.\" He went on to say, \"Thirty thousand trauma victims wlll needlessly die this year in their homes and on the streets, wasted due to lack of emer\u00ad gency medical care; Americans wlll die valu\u00ad ing their hair and fingernails more than their lives!\" But the trauma victim mUISt survive more than just the immediate care on the scene and the ambulance ride; he must also face the hospital. One of the biggest problems, for example, is where to take a trauma victim. Any nurse can clean and bandage a child's knee, but what about a serious burn or extensive in\u00ad juries from an auto accident? This dilemma has led to a growing movement among ex\u00ad perts in emergency medical care. Many now call for categorization, a system classifying hospitals and their EDs according to the severity of trauma they are equipped and staffed to handle. For example, Category I would include the best medical centers, capa\u00ad ble of dealing with cases requlring highly intensive and specialized treatment. Cate\u00ad gory II would include the better general hos\u00ad pital.s--4hose able to handle all but the most highly specialized trauma cases. But would have round-the-clock physicians in their EDs. Category m would be more limited: an ED staffed by a registered nurse with a phy\u00ad sician on call within the hospital. The victim would be resuscitated and sta.bllized in the ED, then passed on up the line. And Cate\u00ad gory IV would be, ln effect, a glorified first\u00ad aid station with a nurse on call in the hospi\u00ad tal and a physician (perhaps in his own of\u00ad fice) available within a few minutes. Except for very minor problems, EDs in this category would be able to give no more than temporary ald. The disgraceful weaknesses of our present EDs stand out starkly against these proposed categories. According to Dr. Huntley's U.S. Public Health figures, only one out of seven hospitals have EDs that could be classified in Categories I, II, and III. Of our 7,000 hospitals, a.s ma.ny as 3,000 would not even qualify for Category IV. Less than half of our EDs have written policies and procedures (\"Indefensible,\" Huntley says): only one out of six have twenty-four-hour coverage by physicians, and only half have routine sta1f training. Other surveys reveal equally de\u00ad plorable conditions: Barely one in six hos\u00ad pitals had X-ray and laboratory facilities available round-the-clock; only one in seven hospital administrators felt their own EDs were adequate in space, traffic flow, or loca\u00ad tion. One of the major difficulties in emergency departments is physician coverage. Tradi\u00ad tionally the responsibility of the intern, the ED needs the best qualified and the most ex\u00ad perienced professionals, not the least, 1f lives are to be saved. Although a. variety of new approaches have been tried in recent years, most have proved inadequate. Rotation of hospital staff doctors, for ex\u00ad ample, has falled because a psychiatrist or a dermatologist can not necessarlly perform a tracheotomy, deal with a gunshot wound, or use a defibrillator. Attempts to hire doctors specifically for the ED proved no better: These doctors invariably were either new practitioners trying to get started (they would quit when their situations improved), retired physicians no longer able to practice, or doctors whose personal problems, such as alcoholism, prevented them from main\u00ad taining their own private practice. Today, successful solutions seem to de\u00ad pend on the institutions involved. In major hospitals, teaching institutions, and medical centers, residents (often supervised by a staff doctor) are commonly found in the EDs, with backup specialists always avail\u00ad able; smaller hospitals use physicians spe\u00ad cializing in emergency medicin~octors making a career of staffing the EDs. But politics itself infects the business of saving lives. \"One of the greatest foll1es I've seen in some of our metropolitan areas is this business of political boundaries,\" Waters complains. \"A fire engine or ambulance wlll roll up to a city line with its lights and siren going, and then refuse to cross into the ad\u00ad jacent city or county to render help. When human lives are at stake we've got to forget the parochialism of political entities.\" Most experts agree that the regionaliza\u00ad tion of emergency medical systems is a necessity. In terms of both money and man\u00ad power, the wasteful duplication of fac111ties\u00ad for example, hospital~ across the street from each other that offer the same highly spe\u00ad cialized facilities, such as a burn center\u00ad simply cannot be afforded. \"The pattern of the future,\" says Waters, \"is very clear; large cities with sophisticated communica\u00ad tions, transportation facillties, and major hospitals must provide help to the surround\u00ad ing rural areas. In Jacksonville we're working on a medical evacuation proposal encompass\u00ad ing a twenty-two-county area of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. We promise to offer our sophisticated Fire Control Center as the emergency medical communications nerve center for the area. A call to the center can bring a m111tary helicopter or a special intensive-care ambulance to effect a transfer-each with our trained medical technicians.\" But even if the finest emergency-care sys\u00ad tems could be augmented nationwide, trauma would stlll be a serious problem. For ex\u00ad ample, one out of every ten trauma patients entering a hospital dies within a few hours, and doctors often don't know why. After forty years in the battle for better emergency care, Dr. Kennedy admits, \"We still don't know what happens in trauma, and you can't Uck a problem until you know what the problem is.\" Why does the vigorous per\u00ad son succumb to injuries that an older, less athletic person survives? Why do some of the body organs break down or stress ulcers appear? Why do burn victims on their way to recovery succumb to kidney fa.Uure? Why does pneumonia occur? Nobody really knows. Until a year or so ago, only seven institu\u00ad tions in the country were being funded by the Institute of General Medical Sciences for trauma research. At the head of one of these, the Trauma Research Center of New York City's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, is Dr. John M. Kinney, professor of surgery. Says June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20579 Kinney, \"We're just beginning to learn more about the function of vital organs-that you don't need certain tissues in your body to function on a minute-to-minute basis for survival.\" The lack of research on trauma is particu\u00ad larly frustrating because success in its treat\u00ad ment could be total. Unlike the seriously 111 person, whose body organs are hopelessly de\u00ad stroyed and who must lead a restricted life, the victim of trauma, if kept alive, usually will recover completely. As Kinney explains, \"If you can get the patient past the life\u00ad threatening period, he will be up and around, a functioning member of society once more.\" Federal money is needed for this research and for improvement in our emergency serv\u00ad ices. This will require, however, that the gov\u00ad ernment agree to provide funds for a rela\u00ad tively unglamorous form of research. As Pennsylvania's Secretary of Health Dr. J. Finton Speller said at a recent national symposium, \"President Nixon's war on cancer is a gamble in two respects: mtimate success rests on the hope that we wlll discover scien\u00ad tific principles now unknown; and there is no way of guessing how many lives may even\u00ad tually be saved.\" But, as Speller goes on to say, \"To declare war on unnecessary death in the ditch, in the ambulance, and in the emer\u00ad gency department is no gamble at all.\" Indeed, the tragedy of our national emer\u00ad gency care programs is clearly pinpointed by Dr. Fitts: \"In the trea.tment of accidental in\u00ad jury, the ga.p between what can be done and what is being done is wider than for any other disease.\" The story of another trauma victim clearly 1llustrates the immense poten\u00ad tial that is now being wasted. At 11:00 p.m. on March 29, 1969, a thirty\u00ad eight-year-old professor at MIT was in a two-car head-on colllsion on Route 2 in Arlington, just outside Boston. At the near\u00ad by community hospital, a doctor shook his head as he examined the ba.dly broken body. There seemed little hope of saving the pro\u00ad fessor's life, and restoring him to anything approximating normality seemed too remote even to consider. Nevertheless, two hours later the victim was in the Massachusetts General Hospital emergency ward. His skull was frac\u00ad tured, as were bones in his right lower leg and left forearm; his nose and most facial bones were crushed; his left hlp and shoulder were dislocated as well as broken; his chest had collapsed, he had three broken ribs, and as a result he was having trouble breathing; his right eye was beyond repair and his left one questionable. Later, with tubes in his windpipe and chest, he developing pneu\u00ad monia, a heart infection, and a fever of 106 degrees. A ruptured spleen necessitated more emergency surgery; one eye was removed and, for a whlle, he lost the sight in the other. He continually sUpped in and out of mental clarity. All told there were seven major opera\u00ad tions along with a few dozen other complica\u00ad tions. But on July 22, just four months a.fter hiS accident, the professor walked out of the hos\u00ad pital! At least thirteen specialists had been involved in his medical care, not counting nurses, therapists, and social workers. Six weeks after leaving the hospital, he returned to his MIT duties, and the following summer he was mountain climbing. How can we reduce the terrible toll of trauma? Dr. Kennedy points out that \"It's the public that's got to do it; you can't do it by la.w.\" Toward this goal an infant move\u00ad ment called the Community eouncll on Emergency Medical Services, comprising representa.tives from all phases of our emer\u00ad gency system, has begun agitating for 1m\u00ad proved emergency treatment. In Dr. Fitts' words, \"The tools are available. There are enough men and women for the job in the population, but they must be recruited and trained. Coordination, cooperation, and leadership are needed for the Seventies.\" By Mr. BffiLE (for himself and Mr. CANNON) : S. 3702. A bill to expand the Boulder Canyon project to provide for the con\u00ad struction of a highway crossing of the Colorado River immediately downstream from Hoover Dam. Referred to the Com\u00ad mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Mr. BffiLE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator CAN\u00ad NON, I introduce for proper reference a bill to expand the Boulder Canyon proj\u00ad ect to provide for the construction of a highway crossing of the Colorado River immediately downstream from Hoover Dam. Since at least 1967, a serious traffic sit\u00ad uation has existed at the crossing of the Colorado River in the vicinity of Hoover Dam on U.S. Highway 93-466, in both Nevada and Arizona. The excessive traffic over this narrow and dangerous facility resulted in a request by Senator CANNON and myself to request an alternative traffic crossing to relieve the existing congestion and hazards present in the continuation of the highway across the crest of Hoover Dam. In December of 1970, the Bureau of Reclamation awarded a contract to make a study of improvements in the accom\u00ad modations for visitors at Hoover Dam. The report submitted in April 1971, in\u00ad cluded consideration of the impact that construction of the proposed bridge might have on visitor attendance, traffic congestion, parking, and existing facili\u00ad ties at the dam. The recommendations, relative to the bypass bridge crossing the Colorado River below Hoover Dam, are \"that plans for the planning, design, and execution of the highway bypass be started as soon as possible.\" It concludes saying that by 1975, without a bypass, through-traffic will have to be diverted or else traffic in, around, and through the project area will be unmanageable, with restrictions on visitation at the dam. We urge early committee considera\u00ad tion of this very critical proposal. ByMr.BffiLE: S. 3703. A bill granting the consent and approval of Congress to the Califor\u00ad nia-Nevada Interstate Compact. Refer\u00ad red to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. BmLE. Mr. President, I introduce for proper reference a bill to grant the consent and approval of Congress to the California-Nevada Interstate Compact. This legislation is being introduced at the request of the Nevada members of the California-Nevada Interstate Com\u00ad pact Commission as set out in a letter signed by Mr. Roland D. Westergard, the chairman of the Nevada delegation. On March 17, 1971, a similar bill was introduced in the House of Representa\u00ad tives by Congressman HAROLD JOHNSON of California, who represents that por\u00ad tion of California covered by the pro\u00ad posed water compact. Since that time, numerous meetings have been held be\u00ad tween the administration and represent\u00ad atives of the States to try to resolve some of the d11ferences that apparently existed between them. Since little progress has been made in these negotiations, I have been re\u00ad quested to submit the proposal on the Senate side. In accordance with there\u00ad quest, I am submitting the bill today. By Mr. FULBRIGHT: S.J. Res. 241. A joint resolution au\u00ad thorizing the President to approve an in\u00ad terim agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I send to the desk a joint resolution ap\u00ad proving the interim agreement between the United States and the Union of So\u00ad viet Socialist Republics on certain meas\u00ad ures with respect to the limitation of strategic offensive arms, with an accom\u00ad panying protocol, hereafter referred to as the Intertm Agreement. The letter from the Secretary of State to the President, which is included in the documents submitted today to the Sen\u00ad ate, points out that the Interim Agree\u00ad ment can, by its terms, enter into force only upon the exchange of written no\u00ad tices of acceptance by both countries and only when and if the ABM Treaty is brought into force. In view of the fact that the Commit\u00ad tee on Foreign Relations will begin hear\u00ad ings in the near future on the treaty and this Interim Agreement, I thought it would be helpful to have a specific joint resolution referring to the Interim Agree\u00ad ment before the committee. By Mr. MANSFIELD and Mr. SCOTT: S.J. Res. 242. A joint resolution ap\u00ad proving the acceptance by the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States of the interim agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Social\u00ad ist Republics on certain measures with respect to the limitation of strategic of\u00ad fensive arms. Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished minority leader (Mr. ScoTT) and myself, I send to the desk a joint resolution and ask that it be read and referred to the appropriate committee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be read by the Clerk. The legislative clerk read the joint resolution by title, as follows: A joint resolution approving the accept\u00ad a.nce by the President of the lniterim agree\u00ad ment between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on cer\u00ad tain measures with respect to a limitation of strategic offensive arms. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the joint resolution will be re\u00ad ceived and appropriately referred. By Mr. MATHIAS: S.J. Res. 243. A joint resolution relat\u00ad ing to U.S. snpport of United Nations measures to provide and coordinate dis\u00ad aster relief. Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, in past years we have witnessed natural and other human disasters in many parts of the world. These misfortunates have brought unequalled misery and despair to millions of men, women, children and elderly people whose only offense was 20580 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 to be in the wrong place at the wrong time-in the path of cyclones and civil disturbances, of earthquakes and political upheaval. This country has a proud tra\u00ad dition of response to the appeals for aid and relief from the weak and defenseless. But as the tragedies in Peru, Turkey, and Yugoslavia have shown us in recent years, no single nation's resources and determination to help another are suffi\u00ad cient in times of major catastrophe. Such problems are better dealt with by international mechanisms which dis\u00ad tribute humanitarian burden-sharing among those who are best able to help. As we have seen in cases of Biafra and Bangladesh, although disaster may grow out of political conflicts, especially in se\u00ad cessionist movements in developing coun\u00ad tries, the consequences for innocent peo\u00ad ple caught in the path of advancing armies and campaigns of guerilla war\u00ad fare are almost always duplication of the disasters wrought by nature-hunger, famine, pestilence and urgent shortages of food and medical facilities. The same kinds of reconstruction and rehabilita\u00ad tion efforts are needed in tragedy's after\u00ad math. But because of complex foreign policy considerations, individual nations are not always able to respond to human needs with the speed which a single sense of humanity would otherwise dic\u00ad tate. In such cases, as in cases of earth\u00ad quakes, drought, cyclones, tidal waves, epidemics and hurricanes, there is an international alternative to bilateral relief efforts. The organizational poten\u00ad tial exists a waiting only the standing agreements which will make it possible to move into such situations with the neces\u00ad sary speed. I refer to the United Nations and its Office of Disaster Relief Coordination. This Office, established early this year, holds great potential for dealing with future natural and other disasters. Given the proper support from the member na\u00ad tions of the U.N., it could move quickly to prevent the human misery, mass star\u00ad vation, malnutrition and death which we have seen on a previously unprecedented scale in recent years. But if we truly want to improve and strengthen the U.N.'s potential for alle\u00ad viating human misery and want, we will be much better served by constructive efforts such as those proposed in the legislation I introduce today than by pet\u00ad ulant actions taken in the heat of an\u00ad ger and disappointment. In January of this year, the Secre\u00ad tary-General of the United Nations ap\u00ad pointed a distinguished international public servant, Mr. Faruk N. Berko! of Turkey, as the first United Nations Dis\u00ad aster Relief Coordinator. This position was authorized by the 26th General As\u00ad sembly in response to the kinds of needs I have discussed earlier. \"His new office will be respOnsible for directing interna\u00ad tional relief efforts in oases of natural or other disaster, promoting the prevention and prediction of natural disasters, pro\u00ad viding advice to governments on pre\u00ad disaster planning and disseminating in\u00ad formation relevant to disaster relief. This is a good beginning but the Office does not yet have the authority to deal with the most pressing problems which arise in the aftermath of disaster situa\u00ad tions. It does not have the human or fi\u00ad nancial resources to conduct rehabilita\u00ad tion and reconstruction programs. Today I submit a resolution that urges the President to express through our delegation at the U.N. a commitment to share in providing such material sup\u00ad port for this disaster relief office. More importantly, the resolution urges for an unqualified American offer to provide a unit of 1,000 technical and noncom\u00ad batant personnel from the Department of Defense to serve as a permanent standby unit subject to call by the U.N. This unit should serve as a symbol of America's faith in the United Nations and its principles. This preparedness is crucial to the suc\u00ad cess of relief operations. I strongly be\u00ad lieve that the American Government's capacity to act quickly and with a single voice in such situations requires a great\u00ad er degree of organization within our own executive branch with established lines of authority and direction, than we have seen in the past. It is a service neither to the recipients nor to the American taxpayer who pays for these worthy activities, that time and money be wasted while the bureaucracies of Federal agencies on the one hand and of national and international private and public relief agencies on the other dis\u00ad pute who is to provide what to whom. The fundamental value of this office at the U.N., provided that it receives the clout it requires, is that such wasteful delays would be a great deal less likely to occur. This new program merits U.S. support and participation. My resolution would help to advance that worthy ob\u00ad jective. Mr. President, my resolution would: First, establish within the Department of Defense a permanent unit of 1,000 tech\u00ad nical and noncombatant personnel of the Department who shall answer any call for assistance issued by the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator and who shall be known as the First Brigade-Forces for International Relief on Standby; second, have the President :Instruct our United Nations delegation to offer further as\u00ad sistance to the U.N. Office of Disaster Relief in concert with other nations; and third, set forth a series of objectives which we believe this Office should seek to achieve, including: First, the preven\u00ad tion, prediction, and control of disasters; second, predisaster planning and pre\u00ad paredness, including stockpiling, train\u00ad ing, and assistance from abroad; third, contingency plans for each country of the world or of geographic regions with a history of disasters of severe or fre\u00ad quent nature; fourth rehabilitation and reconstruction; fifth, international or\u00ad ganizational arrangements necessary to effect appropriate relief; and sixth, fi- nancial arrangements necessary to effect such relief. Mr. President, I submit the text of this joint resolution and ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that it be printed at the conclusion of my remarks along with the summary and conclusions of a comprehensive re\u00ad port of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, entitled, \"Assistance in Cases of Natural Disaster.\" This afternoon we will be asked to re\u00ad store $50 million to the full authorization of $100 million for relief assistance to Bangladesh for the coming year. While I support this move, I think that in the future more and more of this aid should be channeled through international relief efforts such as that I have outlined here today. There being no objection, the joint res\u00ad olution and material were ordered to be printed in the REcoRD, as follows: S.J. RES. 243 Whereas, recent experience with disasters in Turkey, Peru, Yugoslavia, Nigeria and Bangladesh demonstrate an urgent need for coordinated international efforts in such cases; and Whereas the United Nations recently estab\u00ad lished a permanent Office of Disaster Relief Coordination, to provide and coordinate dis\u00ad aster relief, which office can be an important instrument in maintaining International stability: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep\u00ad resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) the Con\u00ad gress urges the President to instruct the United States delegation to the United Na\u00ad tions to prepare and submit to the United Nations General Assembly an offer to furnish, in concert with other members of the General Assembly, support to the United Nations Office of Disaster Relief Coordination which was established to provide and coordinate disaster relief to any country or region of the world which has been affected by a disaster and solicits such relief. (b) Such offer should include support to the Office so that the Office may achieve the following objectives- (I) the prevention, prediction, and control ')f disasters; (2) pre-disaster planning and prepared\u00ad ness, including stockplllng, training, and as\u00ad sistance from abroad; (3) contingency plans for each country of the world or of geographic regions with a history of disasters of severe or frequent nature; (4) rehabilltation and reconstruction; (5) International organizational arrang~\u00ad ments necessary to effect appropriate relief; and (6) financial arrangements necessary to ef\u00ad fect such relief. SEc. 2. (a) In affirming the belief of the United States that providing and coordina\u00ad ting disaster relief through the United Na\u00ad tions Office of Disaster Relief Coordination is an essential element in any workable plan for world peace, there is established within the Department of Defense a permanent unit of 1,000 technical and noncombatant person\u00ad nel of the Department. Such unit shall be known as the FIRST Brigade-Forces for In\u00ad ternational Relief on Standby. Upon a call of the United Nations Disaster Rellef Coordi\u00ad nator, the FIRST Brigade or such members thereof as are called for by the Coordinator, shall be detailed to the Office unless the President determines that detantng the FIRST Brigade or members thereof, as the case may be, would endanger the security of the United States or determines that the disaster region is within an area of ongoing military confiict or civll disturbance. Mem\u00ad bers of the FIRST Brigade, while so detalled, shall be considered for all purposes as per\u00ad sonnel of the United States Government. (b) In submitting to the United Nations General Assembly the offer referred in the first section of this Act, the United States delegation to the United Nations should also communicate to the General Assembly that the United States has established the FIRST Brigade as evidence of its support of the Ofllce and of its faith in the United Nations and its principles.

VII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 100. An attempt has been made in this report to outline some of the ways in which international assistance in connexion with natural disasters might be strengthened. It has identified four main areas to which such increased assistance might be directed: pre\u00ad vention, control and prediction; planning and preparedness; the better orga.nization of relief action when the emergency occurs; re\u00ad habllitation and reconstruction. While a Government should be able to count on the help of the international community, pro\u00ad vided through Governments, the League of Red Cross Societies and other voluntary agencies or the United Nations organizations, in its preparations against or its efforts to meet such emergencies, the primary respon\u00ad sibllity for protecting the life, health and property of people within its frontiers and for maintaining the essential public services rests with that Government. International assistance can only supplement, and will de\u00ad pend very largely for its effectiveness on, the efforts of the country itself through its Gov\u00ad ernment or through such organizations as its national Red Cross society. 101. It is to be hoped that apart from particular defensive or preventive measures required to meet recurrent catastrophes, disaster-prone countries will take steps, where necessary, to: (a) Establish a pre-disaster plan (or im\u00ad prove an existing plan) specifying, inter alia, the organizational arrangements in case of disaster (including areas of ultimate re\u00ad sponsibility and chains of command), the available national resources and sources from which other emergency needs can be met; (b) Strengthen the national Red Cross so\u00ad ciety or similar body; (c) Train officials and others for action in disaster situations and to execute par\u00ad ticular aspects of the plan, and strengthen the administrative infrastructure in general; establish stockpiles of non-perishable emer\u00ad gency supplies and, where possible, cash re\u00ad serves as well as, in certain cases, stockpiles of food; (d) Take legislative or other steps to fa\u00ad cilitate the receipt of aid (covering import duties and restrictions, visas, overflight and landing rights and the like as well as spe\u00ad cial conditions in respect of relief units); (e) Endeavour to improve national warn\u00ad ing systems, where necessary, and arrange\u00ad ments for ensuring that the warnings reach the public; (f) Ensure by legislation where relevant, that the minimum risk is run by people living (and housed) in disaster-prone areas; (g) Consider including in their country programmes projects relating to the study, prevention or Initigation of natural dis\u00ad asters. 102. It is hoped that for their part the Governments of countries which expect to give aid will: (a) Increase the volume and scope of the aid they are prepared to provide, including (i) special equipment and logistical sup\u00ad port (vehicles, aircraft including helicopters, hovercraft and other vessels, specifying as far as possible the nature and extent of this aid, with details regarding their type, capac\u00ad ity. range, crews, maintenance and acces\u00ad sory equipment of the vehicles and aircraft); (ii) Relief units, with information concern\u00ad ing the equipment these expect to bring and the timing of their contribution; (b) Assist, where possible, in establishing appropriate stockpiles (in co-operation with the Red Cross or otherwise) ; (c) Take steps to arrange for the co\u00ad ordination of their assistance and that of national voluntary organizations and en\u00ad courage co-ordination among the latter; (d) Endeavour to co-ordinate their own contribution with that of other donor Governments; (e) Co-operate with the United Nations permanent office, keeping it advised of the available resources, and informing it im\u00ad mediately of their deployment after a disaster. 103. The League of Red Cross Societies and other international voluntary organiza\u00ad tions should be encouraged to develop their traditional activities, not least in (a) Strengthening national Red Cross societies and similar bodies; (b) Helping in the preparation or strengthening of national pre-disaster plans, the basic elements of which have been rec\u00ad ommended in the Red Cross Disaster Relief Handbook of the League of Red Cross Soci\u00ad eties; (c) Assisting in the establishment of ap\u00ad propriate stockpiles at the subregional and national levels; (d) Assisting in training programmes and seminars; (e) Strengthening cooperation among themselves and with their Governments and contributing to the over-all coordination of assistance through close cooperation with the United Nations in the field (in particu\u00ad lar between Red Cross delegates and resident representatives) and generally through con\u00ad stant and full exchange of information. 104. Individual United Nations organiza\u00ad tions should continue to act promptly in the caaes of disaster in accordance With their resources and constitutional obligations. Over the years, they have built up a consid\u00ad erable capacity for assisting Governments at such times, and for contributing to the con\u00ad trol or Initigation of the effects of disasters. Among recent developments one may note with satisfaction that the UNICEF emer\u00ad gency reserve has just been increased; that UNDP is now able to speed its assistance to disaster-stricken countries as well as sup\u00ad porting project related to the study, preven\u00ad tion or mitigation of natural disasters; and that ffiRD has likewise given greater as\u00ad sistance to countries in connexion with the long-term effects of disasters. 105. Many areas of activity will, on the other hand, require strengthening if the United Nations system (in cooperation with donor Governments, the League of Red Cross Societies and other voluntary agencies) is to play the larger role expected of it. In ad\u00ad dition to information services and training programmes, these areas include: (a) UNESCO activities in, scientific re\u00ad search relating to natural phenomena (espe\u00ad cially earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, ava\u00ad lanches and the like) , including the exten\u00ad sion of reconnaissance missions to flood and avalanche disasters; (b) WMO activities in scientific research relating to natural phenomena (especially Wind storms), in association with United Nations regional economic commissions, where geographically relevant, with a view to improving (i) Preventive/protective measures; (ii) Predictive and warning systems; (c) United Nations activities in develop\u00ad ing improved methods of building and plan\u00ad ning to mitigate or prevent the disastrous effects of natural phenomena and in devel\u00ad oping the United Nations communications network; (d) WHO action in emergency situations and in pursuit of its basic long-term objec\u00ad tives, including activities both before and after the occurren 'ce of a disaster, for the improvement of health infrastructure, in continued collaboration with other orga\u00ad nizations in the United Nations system and with the League of Red Cross Societies; (e) FAO/WFP provision for potential in\u00ad crease in resources to meet needs in years when a large number of emergencies occur; (f) ITU interest in developing the avail\u00ad ab111ty of transmitters and equipment for use in emergencies; (g) WMO interest in exploring the possi\u00ad bility of having mobile meteorological sta\u00ad tions for use when existing facilities have been destroyed or disrupted by a disaster; (h) ICAO research and rescue service, which might be applied in certain natural disaster situations; also arrangements for special overflying, refueling and landing rights. 106. To stimulate further action in the various areas in question and to help in en'Suring that international assistance is as effective and well co-ordinated as possible, Will call for a concerted effort among the organizations of the United Nations system. The role of the competent organs of the United Nations-including that of the Secretary-General himself-in ensuring co\u00ad ordin'ation will be of particular importance. As regards the specific actions envisaged at the national level, the resident representa\u00ad tives of UNDP, aided by the technical ex\u00ad pertise of the agency and UNICEF repre\u00ad sentatives, should play a major \u00b7part in their respective countries of assignment, while the central responsibility will fall on the permanent office in the United Nations en\u00ad visaged in General Assembly resQiution 271'i' (XXV). The nature and extent of the func\u00ad tions of that office have already been out\u00ad lined in detail. Here it may suffice to say that: (a) the office must maintain continuing contacts with the Governments of potential recipient and donor countries, as well as countries of transit; with the United Na\u00ad tions aid-giving agencies and programmes which will be expected to maintain close contact with the office and keep it advised of all relevant activities, as well as with the League of Red Cross Societies and other major voluntary agencies; and with the resident representatives, to whom it must be in a position to provide the support of experi\u00ad enced staff in time of emergency; (b) it must be able to arrange assistance to disaster-prone countries in pre-disaster planning and disaster-preparedness ar\u00ad rangements; (c) it must collect, digest, keep up to date and disseminate to those concerned the mass of detailed information concerning the af\u00ad fected country and its resources which is essential for the effective organization of as\u00ad sistance, as well as concerning available aid from within and outside the United Nations system; (d) top level meetings should take place as necessary between the head of the office and the executive heads of relevant United Na\u00ad tions organizations, and furthermore the operation of the office as well as the pro\u00ad grammes of individual United Nations orga\u00ad nizations, should be kept under the con\u00ad stant review of the Adininistrative Coinmit\u00ad tee on Co-ordination; (e) while the office, at least at the out\u00ad set, can be quite small, it would in the Secretary-General's view be better not to in\u00ad crease United Nations involvement in the area of assistance in connection with natural disasters if the funds necessary for the mod\u00ad est staffing and other costs required (includ\u00ad ing facilities for rapid communications) can\u00ad not be guaranteed. The risk must be avoided of raising hopes that cannot be fulfilled. 107. The important questions of the loca\u00ad tion and the over-all direction of the pro\u00ad posed office are left open pending expression of the views of Member States, particularly as regards the precise nature and extent of responslblllties Member States would wish the office to assume. 108. It is recommended that a modest financial provision be Inade by the United 20582 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 Nations in respect of assistance requested by disaster-prone countries in pre-disaster plan\u00ad ning and preparedness. Stress is also laid on the need for a substantial increase in the funds available to individual Governments, national Red Cross societies and the League of Red Cross Societies for immediate use in case of emergency. More generally, if the ob\u00ad jectives of the General Assembly resolutions are to be adequately met, there will be need in the coming years for increased-and in some fields greatly increased-contributions from Governments, voluntary organizations and intergovernmental organizations.

SENATE RESOLUTION 319-SUBMIS\u00ad SION OF A RESOLUTION TO CREATE A SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE COORDINATION OF THE AC\u00ad TIVITIES OF THE FEDERAL BU\u00ad REAU OF INVESTIGATION (Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.) FBI OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I am sub\u00ad mitting today with the junior Senator from Montana (Mr. METCALF) a resolu\u00ad tion to establish an FBI congressional oversight committee. According to the provisions of this bill, the majority leader of the Senate would select three Senators, no more than two from a single party, to serve on the oversight committee. Simi\u00ad larly, the Speaker of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives would select three Congress\u00ad men. The members of the committee would select their chairman by secret ballot at the beginning of each session of Congress. Now is an opportune time, in my opin\u00ad ion, for the Congress to adopt this leg\u00ad islation. For more than 50 years there has been no congressional investigation of the FBI's work. This is a clear failure on the part of Congress to perform its function. But, ironically in view of the controversy which surrounded Mr. Hoover, so long as he remained Director, both friends and critics of the FBI may have been some\u00ad what less concerned about Congress' fail\u00ad ure to act. With Mr. Hoover as the FBI's head, there was some certainty about the use to which the Bureau would put its massive power. There was, in short, a pattern of behavior, whether we agreed with it or not, which was predictable. There was some assurance that no ad\u00ad ministration would be able to any great extent to use the FBI's resources for nar\u00ad row partisan purpose. This may be the reason for Congress' lack of vigilance; nonetheless, the rec\u00ad ord is shameful. No committee of the Congress has probed the operations of the FBI since a brief investigation of the Palmer raids by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1921. Since that date, the only congressional review has taken place during the annual requests for appro\u00ad priations. But because of Mr. Hoover's unique position in American life, hear\u00ad ings on the FBI's activities have been completely perfunctory. FBI budget re\u00ad quests have been seldom questioned and never reduced. Rather they have in\u00ad creased year after year. In fiscal year 1971, for example, the Bureau operated on a budget of $335,000,000 and employed 8,482 agents. And it is worth stressing, Mr. President, that like the CIA, the FBI remains free from examination by the General Accounting Office. Given this past record, today we are in the position of not really knowing what the scope of the FBI's work really is. In fact, only on two occasions has the veil which shrouds the FBI been lifted. In 1949, in the trial of Judith Coplon for espionage, the Government was forced to produce 28 Bureau reports dealing with national security matters. These took up approximately 800 typewritten pages of the record. Then, in 1971 a group calling itself the Citizens' Commission to Inves\u00ad tigate the FBI, entered the Bureau's of\u00ad fice in Media, Pa., and carried off all of a large proportion of its files, some 800 altogether. Some of these files subse\u00ad quently were made available to newspa\u00ad pers and others. The picture which emerged from these sources of information suggests that the FBI predictably considers its function primarily as constituting the first line of defense, and the major bulwark, against threats to the national security. But these documents also suggest that the concepts of \"loyalty and subversive\" ac\u00ad tivity, as developed by the Bureau, carry it very far in the direction of viewing all militant or racial dissent as a threat to the national security. These two sources of information-the Coplon reports and the Media documents-identify the fol\u00ad lowing examples of FBI actions in the political arena: First. Because the actor Frederic March and his wife, Florence Eldridge, were reported to have partici\u00ad pated in the activities of various organi\u00ad zations associated with the Henry Wal\u00ad lace movement, a dossier was prepared on their actions. Second. A music student was investigated because he visited the New Jersey headquarters of the Com-munist Party and talked with his mother there. Third. Another person came under sw\u00b7veillance because he \"was connected with some pro-Israel organization which was sending representatives to various parts of the world.\" Fourth. The Media documents established that: The FBI ordered discreet preliminary in\u00ad quiries . . . into all BSU's (Black Student Unions) and similar organizations organized to project the demands of black students, which are not presently under investigation. Fifth. A watch was kept on other black organizations including CORE, SCLC, the Black Coalition, National Black Econo\u00ad mic Conference, and a settlement house. Other isolated cases of FBI actions in the political arena which have come to light include the following: First. In April 1971 Senator EDMUND S. MUSKIE revealed that the Bureau had conducted a \"widespread surveillance of antipollu\u00ad tion rallies held on Earth Day, including one in which the Senator himself had been a speaker. Second. In 1958 the FBI informed agents in the FBI Bulletin that: All Americans should view with serious concern the announced intentions and threats by a political candidate, if elected, to take over and revamp the FBI to suit his own personal whims and desires. This statement was believed to be directed against the candidacy of Sen\u00ad ator Eugene McCarthy. Third. On an\u00ad other occasion GEORGE McGoVERN was running for the Senate against Senator KARL MUNDT in, South Dakota. The FBI made public a letter praising Senator MuNDT's anti-Communist activities. Many Americans would question the propriety of such clearly political ac\u00ad tions as we have cited originating from the chief police organ of the Federal Government. Even more troubling, how\u00ad ever, is the possibility that the enormous amount of sensitive information gath\u00ad ered by the FBI about the private lives of millions of individuals may find its way into the public domain and undermine the constitutional rights of American citizens. In 1971, the FBI had an estimated 200 million fingerprint cards in its files, and nearly 6 million investigative files. The proportion of Bureau resources de\u00ad voted to national security matters is not precisely known, but it has been esti\u00ad mated that the Bureau has 2,000 agents investigating political activities. Other evidence on this point comes from a breakdown of the documents stolen from the Media office. Of over 800 files taken, 40 percent involved political surveillance. Although charges that the FBI under Hoover evolved into a \"Gestapo\" are far\u00ad fetched, there have been cases of this sensitive information being used for par\u00ad tisan purposes. In 1954 Attorney General Brownell read material from Bureau files in making an attack on the previous Democratic administration for continu\u00ad ing Harry Dexter White in Government service. President Truman followed a general policy of refusing to disclose Bureau files, but in some cases was guilty of allowing individual Congressmen to see them at the White House. President Eisenhower adhered to the general policy of nondisclosure, but con-June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20583 ceded that summaries and factual infor\u00ad mation about Bureau files had been turned over to congressional committees. Vice President Nixon, in October 1954, disclosed extensive material from Bureau files in an attack upon Representative Robert L. Condon of California. Senator Joseph McCarthy's Perma\u00ad nent Subcommittee on Investigations obtained substantial amounts of material from Bureau sources, apparently by way of military intelligence. Likewise in the Senate debate over the confirmation of Charles E. Bohlen to be Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Senator Gillette de\u00ad scribed several items of information which had come from the Bureau by way of Secretary of State Dulles. Perhaps the most ale,rming example of a leak of information was reported by the New York Times. In a September 7, 1971, report, the Times disclosed that a former major general by the name of Ralph H. Van Deman--one time head of Army In\u00ad telligence-and his wife maintained after Mr. Van Deman's retirement a private collection of files on 125,000 alleged \"sub\u00ad versive\" persons and organizations. Said the Times: The heart of the Van Deman files, accord\u00ad ing to mUtta.ry sources who have seen them, comprises confidentiaJ intelligence reports that General Van Deman obtained regularly from Army and Navy intelligence and from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I cite these examples not in order to condemn the FBI but to point to the danger of uncontrolled power. Given the total lack of interest by the Congress in the FBI's activities over the years, the astonishing fact is not that such abuses took place but that their extent is not greater than it is. Indeed, the par\u00ad ties guilty of releasing sensitive infor\u00ad mation in many of these cases is not an official of the FBI but a political figure with access to FBI files. The question now, however, is whether the Bureau's record in the field of civil liberties will deteriorate or can be im\u00ad proved. A February 8, 1971, article in the Nation quotes a former FBI agent on this point: I have always been terrlfied of whalt might happen after (Hoover) leaves. There is enough data in those files to make them the damndest Gestapo outfit this country has ever seen. We do not have to accept the alarmist tone of this view to understand that with the departure of Mr. Hoover-a man who ran the FBI with an iron hand-the Na\u00ad tion faces some special problems. There is an immediate need to establish orderly and established procedures for oversee\u00ad ing the important work which the FBI carries out. There is an urgent necessity to prevent any occupant of the White House, from whatever party, from a;bus\u00ad ing the enormous power which any man he appoints as FBI Director will gain. There is a clear requirement that the Congress play a more active role in pro\u00ad tecting the constitutional rights of all Americans from abuse as the FBI car\u00ad ries out its studies in the field of counter\u00ad espionage. It is with these points in mind that I am submitting my proposal for an over\u00ad sight committee. The committee which my bill would establish should, in my opinion, immediately undertake a thor\u00ad ough study of the FBI under the new conditions which will be created by the passing of Mr. Hoover. It might give consideration to such questions as the following: Limiting through legislation the term of office of the new Director. One need not be dogmatic about the ac\u00ad tual length; the important point would be the principle. The New York Times in 1971 suggested a period of 4 or 5 years. The 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act originally had a clause, which was defeated, providing for a 15- year term. Bureaucratic relationship between the Attorney General and the FBI Director. The late Robert Kennedy appears to have been the first Attorney General in years to visit FBI district offices and to issue an order to agents. This is unfor\u00ad tunate and steps should be taken to make the FBI an integral part of the Justice Department. Legal authority for counterespionage of the FBI. When Mr. Hoover was pro\u00ad moted to Director in 1924, Attorney General Harlan Fisk Stone cut back the FBI's operations to strictly law enforce\u00ad ment activities. But in 1936 President Roosevelt called Mr. Hoover to the White House and directed him to \"have in\u00ad vestigation made of subversive activities in this country.\" This was the beginning of the rapid expansion of the FBI into the arena of counterespionage. Clearly with the passage of so many years, the responsibilities of the FBI in this field require full congressional investigation. This review might also study the stat\u00ad utory authority of the FBI to conduct work in criminal cases since there are now some 257 laws and Executive orders empowering the FBI to take action in various fields. There is need for a syste\u00ad matic investigation of all these laws and orders. Periodic review and evaluation of Bureau operations by an independent body. This might take the form of a distinguished presidential commission. This would be in addition to the com\u00ad mittee's own review. Both the committee and the commission definitely should study procedures for eliminating false and irrelevant information from the files on private citizens. Mr. President, long ago Edmund Burke noted that the greater the powers, the more dangerous the abuse. So long as nations exist, espionage remains a prob\u00ad ability and the development of counter\u00ad espionage techniques is a necessity. But this reality does not relieve the Congress of its obligation to the citizens of this country to protect their constitutional rights. Now is the time, not 10 months from now, for the Congress to asswne its re\u00ad sponsibilities. If the Congress does not act before the next election to establish an oversight committee, then any sub\u00ad sequent action of this nature will be seen as a personal rebuke to the future Director of the FBI. This fact will only make it more difficult for the Congress to take the steps required. The Congress should therefore do today what it should have done long ago. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my resolution be printed at this point in the RECORD. I urge the support of my fellow Senators on this im\u00ad portant piece of legislation. There being no objection, the resolu\u00ad tion was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follOWS: S.

Mr. President, I introduce an amendment to S. 3080, a bill to amend the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Act, and for other purposes. I have discussed this amendment with members of the Labor and Public Wel\u00ad fare Committee, which considered S. 3080 and on which I serve, and the chair\u00ad man and members of the committee have indicated their support for my amend\u00ad ment. The amendment has also been brought to the attention of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, since it pertains to federally insured housing, and the chairman has indicated to me that he believes this amendment would be acceptable to his committee. Lead-based paint for interior house\u00ad hold use which contained very high per\u00ad centages of lead compounds, at least 50 percent in several cases, was in fairly wide use during the years before 1950. As a consequence, much housing in ex\u00ad istence today which was constructed prior to 1950 is likely to contain paint with these very high levels of lead com\u00ad pounds. My amendment would require the Secretary of Housing and Urban De\u00ad velopment to establish procedures to minimize the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning when inspecting residential housing constructed prior to 1950 for which an application for mortgage in\u00ad surance or housing assistance payments has been made. Before approving such a mortgage or initiating a subsidized program, HUD is currently inspecting such property to de\u00ad termine compliance with code enforce\u00ad ment and the value of the property for mortgage purposes. Therefore, these pro\u00ad cedures would not present an additional burden to HUD. The amendment would require the Secretary to establish pro\u00ad cedures to eliminate the hazard when paint in housing constructed prior to 1950 is found to be cracking, scaling, peeling, or loose. This is the condition in which it can most easily be eaten by small chil\u00ad dren who are subject to the disease of pica, an appetite for nonfood items. The amendment would also require the Secretary to give to the buyers of such housing assured written notification of the hazards of lead-based paint, as well as a description of the symptoms and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning together with information concerning the importance of the removal of such hazards and techniques currently avail\u00ad able to do so. I have long been concerned with the need to provide a solution and an end to the very serious problem of lead\u00b7 paint poisoning. We should use every means available, and my amendment would in\u00ad corporate into an existing HUD proce\u00ad dure the means to warn the buyer of the hazard of lead-based paint and remove the immediate danger before he moves into the house. S. 3080, the bill which we consider to\u00ad day to extend and expand the Lead\u00ad Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, would provide a major vehicle for end\u00ad ing for all time this tragic disease by providing additional resources to aid communities in detection and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning as well as assisting them in identifying problem areas where lead-based paint presents a high risk. My amendment to this bill will further increase the ability of the Federal Government to attack this tragic and totally preventable disease. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of my amendment be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the amend\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: AMENDMENT No. 1227 At the end of the bill add the following: SEc. 8. (a) Title III of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4801 et. seq.) is amended- (!) by adding end thereof the fol\u00ad lowing: \"FHA REQUmEMENTS \"SEc. 302. The Secretary of Housing and -Urban Development (hereafter in this sec\u00ad tion referred to as the 'Secretary') shall es\u00ad tablish procedures to minimize the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an applica\u00ad tion for mortgage insurance or housing as\u00ad sistance payments under a program adminis\u00ad tered by the Secretary. Such procedures shall apply to all such housing constructed prior to 1950 and shall provide for ( 1) appropriate measures to eliminate, wherever feasible, im\u00ad mediate hazards due to the presence of crack\u00ad ing, scaling, peeling, or loose paint which may contain lead and to which children may be exposed, and (2) assured notification to P\\lrchasers of such housing of the hazards of lead-based paint, of the symptoms and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning, and of the importance and availability of mainte\u00ad nance and removal techniques for minimiz\u00ad ing or eliminating such hazards. Such pro\u00ad cedures may apply to housing constructed during or after 1950 if the Secretary deter\u00ad mines, in his discretion, that such housing presents hazards of lead-based paint.\"; and (2) by inserting after \"PROGRAM\" in the caption of such title, a semicolon and the following: \"FHA REQUIREMENTS\". (b) The amendments made by subsection (a) of this section become effective upon the expiration of 90 days following the date of enactment of this Act. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1972-AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NO. 1228 (Ordered to be printed and referred to the Committee on Finance.) Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am in\u00ad troducing today an amendment that would change the method of financing the special minimum benefit approved recently by the Finance Committee. The committee's provision provides a special minimum of $10 per year for each year of covered employment in excess of 10 years. This benefit would be paid as an June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20585 alternative to the regular benefit if a higher payment would result. This provision would only benefit peo\u00ad ple with 18 or more years of employment; for a worker with 18 years of covered em\u00ad ployment, the special minimum benefit would exceed the regular minimum-$80 as compared with the minimum benefit of $70.40 under present law--or $74 in H.R. 1 as passed by the House. Under the committee's provision, a worker with 20 years of employment un\u00ad der social security would receive a mini\u00ad mum benefit of $100; one with 30 years wou1d receive $200. The minimum bene\u00ad fits for people with various years of cov\u00ad ered employment are as follows: Years of covered Special minimum employment benefit 17 --------------------------------1$74 18 -------------------------------- 80 19 -------------------------------- 90 20 -------------------------------- 100 21 -------------------------------- 110 22 -------------------------------- 120 23 -------------------------------- 130 24 -------------------------------- 140 25 -------------------------------- 150 26 -------------------------------- 160 27 -------------------------------- 170 28 -------------------------------- 180 29 -------------------------------- 190 30 or more_________________________ 200 1 The regular minimum benefit as provided by the House-passed version of H.R. 1. For years of employment less than 18, the regular minimum benefit would be higher than this special minimum. Without question, the committee's provision serves an important social goal: to provide a recent retirement in\u00ad come for people who have worked for many years in covered jobs at low wages. Under the present system it is possible to work in covered employment for 30 years and still receive a retirement bene\u00ad fit that is well below the poverty level. The committee's amendment would change that. But the committee's provision has one major shortcoming. It finances benefits out of the payroll tax that should prop\u00ad erly be financed out of general revenues. This amendment would remedy the de\u00ad fect by financing the new minimum from the general fund. Obviously, the new minimum would represent a sharp departure from the principle that benefits should be actuar\u00ad ially related to past contributions. No doubt, in this case, the departure serves a desirable social objective. But for this very reason, the new minimum should be paid for by all of society, not just by wage earners. Shifting the financing of the new min\u00ad imum 'benefit to general revenues is also desirable from the standpoint of our total tax system. On three separate oc\u00ad casions over the last 8 years, we have reduced one or the other of our two pro\u00ad gressive taxes-the personal income tax and the corporate profits tax. Meanwhile, regressive taxes like the social 8ecurity tax have been increasing dramatically. In the period 1961-72, it is estimated that the percentage of national income raised -by the payroll tax-rose from 3.9 percent to 6 percent. - The overall result is a tax system that places a greater burden on those who can CXVIII--1297-Part 16 least afford it, and a lesser burden on those who can. It is estimated that the new minimum provision would cost $300 million and in\u00ad crease benefits for 1.3 million people in the first year-this assumes a 10-per\u00ad cent increase in social security benefits. If a larger increase is approved, the cost and the coverage of the new minimum benefit would be less-on a long-term basis, the cost would be $1.3 billion a year. In future years, the annual cost would rise up to and above $1.3 billion, as the retired population comes to include a greater proportion of people who have been in covered employment for many years. Subsequently the cost would de\u00ad cline as benefit levels rise, and fewer and fewer people have benefits below $200. Eventually, the new minimum benefit would phase out. Of course, this is not the first proposal to introduce general revenues into the Social Security System. The idea was recommended by the Committee onEco\u00ad nomic Security, whose work led to the Social Security Act of 1935. This recom\u00ad mendation was reiterated by the Ad\u00ad visory Councils on Social Security of 1938 and 1948. The labor movement has for some time supported a plan to fi\u00ad nance one-third of the system from gen\u00ad eral revenues. But this proposal is much more mod\u00ad est. Only the additional cost of provid\u00ad ing the new minimum benefit-of helping a specific group of long-term workers\u00ad would come from general revenues. And the drain on the Treasury would be temporary, ending when the new mini\u00ad mum benefit phases out over time. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that two letters endorsing this amendment from Dean Wilbur Cohen of the Michigan University Graduate School of Education and from Mr. Andrew Bie\u00ad miller of the AFL-CIO, along with the text of the amendment itself be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the amend\u00ad ment and letters were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: AMENDMENT No. 1228 On page 134, between lines 15 and 16, in\u00ad sert the following new section: GENERAL REVENUE FINANCING FOR SPECIAL MINI\u00ad MUM PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT SEc. 144. In addition to any other sums au\u00ad thorized to be appropriated, for any fiscal year, to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or to the Federal Dis\u00ad ability Insurance Trust Fund, there 1s here\u00ad by authorized to be appropriated to each of such Funds, for each fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary to place each of such Funds in the same financial position at the end of such fiscal year as the financial posi\u00ad tion which such Fund would have been in at the end of such year, if section 103 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 had not been enacted. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, Mich., May 23, 1972. Hon. GAYLORD NELSON, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR NELSON: This is in response to your request for my views on your amend\u00ad ment to H.R. 1 to provide that the cost of the special mln1mum benefit in the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program (as approved by the Senate Finance Com\u00ad mittee) should be financed out of general revenues. I strongly support such an amendment. In a very significant article published in June 1938, the then Actuary of the Metro\u00ad politan Life Insurance Company, Mr. Rein\u00ad hard Hohaus, pointed out that a social in\u00ad surance program aims at providing both equity and adequacy. The equity objective in the Federal Old Age, Survivors and Dis\u00ad ablllty Insurance Program (OASDI), as I see it, attempts to relate benefits in some rela\u00ad tion to previous earnings. The adequacy ob\u00ad jective on the other hand attempts to pro\u00ad vide benefits in some relation to social re\u00ad sponsibilities and goals. In my opinion, it is entirely consistent with sound social insurance objectives for the cost of benefits based on the equity principle to be financed out of contributions related to earnings while the cost of part or all of the benefits related to meeting a min\u00ad imum level of adequacy be financed out of general revenues. For those persons in business, industry, and commercial insurance who favor making a sharp distinction between the attributes of private insurance and social insurance, your amendment to finance the special min\u00ad imum from general revenues, should meet with their philosophical support if they wish to reinforce the distinction. I should like to point out that any across\u00ad the-board increase in social security benefits would serve to decrease the cost of the spe\u00ad cial minimum. I strongly favor at least a twenty-percent across-the-board increase at this time in addition to other improvements in the social security system. Sincerely, WILBUR J. COHEN, Dean. AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS, Washington, D.C., June 8, 1972. Hon. GAYLORD NELSON, U.S. Sena:te, Old Senate Office Building, Washtngton, D.C. DEAR SENATOR NELSON: It is our under\u00ad standing that at this time the Committee on Finance has tentatively voted a substantial increase in minimum benefits to social secu\u00ad rity beneficiaries with long attachment to covered employment. The AFL-CIO recognizes the very serious problem to persons with many years of at\u00ad tachment to employment covered by social security but who qualify for only a minimum benefit amount. We believe that, when bene\u00ad fits are increased at the minimum levels with the result that the benefits are no longer actuaria.lly related to past earnings and contributions, it is desirable that they should be financed from general revenues rather than solely financed from the social security tax. We urge support of your approach to fi\u00ad nance the increase in minimum benefits. Sincerely, ANDREW J-BIEMILLER, Director, Department of Legislation. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT APPRO\u00ad PRIATIONS, 1973-AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NO. 1231 (Ordered to be printed and to -lie on the table.) ~ Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, tomorrow I shan\u00b7 move, in an amendment joined in by myself and the Senator from Ma.S.\u00ad sachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY)~ to increase the approp-riation for inillion to $225 millio-n. ----\u00b7 As this measure came over from the 20586 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 other body, it provided $25 million for this item, because the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives had taken no action on au\u00ad thorizing legislation. In the Senate, the Appropriations Committee has pro~ded $150 million the budget amount. Smce we have passed S. 3248, the housing bill, which authorized $225 million for this program the amendment of Senator KENNED; and myself would raise the appropriation to that authorized amount. For the purpose of permitting Sen\u00ad ators to think about it overnight, let me say that there is no single Prc;>gra!ll which would stimulate more housmg m New York and other major core cities and metropolitan areas than section 236. For practical purposes, we can do hardly anything about middle-income housing and moderate-income housing except with adequate 236 funds. These are the scarcest funds of all, and as they are so stimulative in terms of adding to the housing stock, and are absolutely indis\u00ad pensable to so many projects, we really have to consider very seriously at least getting the authorized amount, rather than the budget estimate. This is our priority; and I shall under\u00ad take Mr. President, to demonstrate to\u00ad mo~ow that it is an absolutely indispens\u00ad able priority if we really want to build housing and rehabilitate housing for the moderate- and middle-income groups. We certainly do, and this is the grease for the squeaky wheel as well as the wheel that is not turning. So, Mr. President, I hope very much that Senators will seriously think about this amendment, which can properly be dubbed \"the amendment of experience.\" I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the REcORD, and that the amendment be printed under the rule. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received and printed, and will lie on the table, and, without objection in accordance with the Sen\u00ad ator's request, the amendment will be printed in the RECORD. AMENDMENT No. 1231 on page 2, line 26, deleted the figure $150,- 000,000 and substitute in lieu thereof the figure $225,000,000. ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS OF AN AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NO. 999 At the request of Mr. CHURCH, the Senator from Alaska <Mr. STEVENS) was added as a cosponsor of Amendment No. 999 intended to be proposed to the bill <H.R. 1) to amend the Social Security Act to increase benefits and improve eligibility and computation methods under the OASDI program, to make im\u00ad provements in the medicare, medicaid, and maternal and child-health programs with emphasis on improvements in their operating effectiveness, to replace the existing Federal-State public assistance programs with a Federal program of adUI t assistance ~d a Federal program of benefits to low-income families with children with incentives and require\u00ad ments for employment and training to improve the capacity for employment of members of such families, and for other purposes. STATUS OF COMPETITION AND ROLE OF SMALL BUSINESS IN GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT OF DRUGS-NOTICE OF HEARING Mr. NELSON.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS CRITICISM OF CONGRESS Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, David S. Broder, one of the foremost political analysts in the United States, has written a most interesting criticism of the Con\u00ad gress of the United States in this morn\u00ad ing's Washington Post. Mr. Broder is seen on many of the Sunday interview shows and has recently written a book entitled \"The Party Is Over,\" which has received rave reviews. In an article entitled \"A Fallow Con\u00ad gress,\" David Broder scores the \"meager catalog\" of Congress, \"compared to the needs of the country or the promises Democratic presidential contenders have been making on behalf of their party.\" Broder continues by saying: In any fair accounting for the paralysis on the domestic front, the Democrats who control the Congress must take the lion's share of the blame. The truth is that while the Democrats have talked change in this campaign to the point that their likely nominee, McGovern, is accused by some of his fellow-partisans of being \"too radioa.l,\" the reality of the party's legislative record is one of pitifully little progress. Contrasted with the openings Mr. Nixon has made in the areas of foreign policy where he does not have to wait for Congress to come plodding along, there is real ques\u00ad tion as to which party can honestly claim to be the party of change. Mr. President, I commend this article to the Senate and ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: A FALLOW CONGRESS (By DavidS. Broder) To return from the Democratic presidential primary trial to Washington and the Demo\u00ad cratic-controlled Congress is to move from a world of glittering rhetoric to one of petty, paralyzed reality. While George McGovern, Hubert Hum\u00ad phrey and the rest have been out on the road promising wondrous changes in the of\u00ad fing, their colleagues have been back here\u00ad doing what? Well, the scorecard of major legislation passed by this second session of the 92nd Congress includes two laws that will affect people's lives directly and two other re\u00ad form measures that may have considerable indirect effect. LAST WEEK Congress sent the President a masive program of aid to higher educa\u00ad tion, with a provision included to slow school busing orders. Earlier, it added enforcement powers to the Equal Employment Opportu\u00ad nity Commission. Both those laws will be felt in people's lives. There's also a public benefit in the stricter campaign financing law, which Congress finally pased last January, a carryover from the previous year, though not many voters will see the advantage in concrete terms. And there may be benefits down the road, if the Equal Rights Amendment for women, which Congress approved, is ratified by the states. But that about exhausts the lists of signif\u00ad icant legislation passed this year. It's a meager catalogue, compared to the needs of the country or the promises Democratic presidential contenders have been making orr behalf of their party. It may be that Richard M. Nixon will over\u00ad look this Democratic \"credibility gap,\" but don't bet on it. For three years, the President has had before the Congress serious proposals on revenue-sharing with states and cities, and reform of the welfare system. For two years, he has had equally significant proposals on reorgan'izatlon of the federal executive branch and expansion of health insurance protection. All of these are matters of urgent national priority. They have been acknowledged as matters of major concern by the Democratic June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20587 presidential candidates, who-in all the areas except federal reorganization~have offered counter-proposals of their own going well beyond what the President has suggested. Yet in all these areas, the Democrats will go into convention, less than a month from now, with a record of congressional inaction. To date, the Democratic Con\u00b7gress has neither given the President a final up-or-down vote on his own proposals in these four vital areas nor developed and passed alternative pro\u00ad grams of its own. If there is a justification for this abdica\u00ad tion of political responsibility, it does not come readily to mind. And the Democratic convention orators and platform writers will have to be more devious than usual to di\u00ad vert the public's attention from the yawn\u00ad ing chasm between their promises and their party's poor record of performance. It is true, of course, that divided govern\u00ad ment--with responsibility for the executive branch in the hands of one party and legis\u00ad lative branch in control of the other-is an open invitation to paralysis and irresponsi\u00ad bility. But the Democrats cannot avoid blame by claiming negligence on the part of the President in meeting his domestic responsi\u00ad bilities. The President has made serious proposals in all these areas. He has not threatened to veto the Democratic alternatives, for, indeed, no alternatives have come close to passage. In any fair accounting for the paralysis on the domestic front, the Democrats who con\u00ad trol the Congress must take the lion's share of the blame. The truth is that while the Democrats have talked change in this campaign to the point that their likely nominee, McGovern, is ac\u00ad cused by some of his fellow-partisans of be\u00ad ing \"too radical,\" the reality of the party's legislative record is one of pitifully little progress. Oontrasted with the openings Mr. Nixon has made in the areas of foreign policy where he does not have to wait for Congress to come plodding along, there is real question as to which party can honestly claim to be the party of change. Where is the Democrats' domestic equiva\u00ad lent of the Nixon \"Open Door\" China policy? Where is there a law passed by the Demo\u00ad cratic Congress in the past four years that rivals in significance the Strategic Arms Treaty Mr. Nixon negotiated in Moscow? These are questions the voters will be ask\u00ad ing, when the rhetoric of the presidential campaign is measured against the record. MASS SLAUGHTER IN BURUNDI Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, the Wash\u00ad ington Post of June 11 contains an in\u00ad depth report on the alleged mass slaughter occurring in the tiny African nation of Burundi. The international community has been both shocked and saddened by these incidents which are receiving increasing attention in the media. In February 1971, I headed an Ap\u00ad propriations Committee-sponsored study mission to Central and East Africa. The study mission visited Burundi and be\u00ad came the first U.S. Senators to visit that nation. My colleagues on the study mis\u00ad sion were the Senator from Utah <Mr. Moss) and the Senator from Hawaii <Mr. FoNG). . It was my observation at that time that the potential for mas.sive_violence in Burundi was very great and it would take a very little spark to touch off a con\u00ad flagration. In the study mission report to the Appropriations Committee, I observed: The delicate balance currently containing the contrary interests within the country is constantly up against the outside political pressures from contiguous areas where neigh\u00ad boring governments, for assorted reasons, seek to exploit both the geography and the politics of tiny Burundi. It is our assessment that the present stability in the country will require careful nurturing by its government and people. It is a human tragedy that this deli\u00ad cate stability has not been maintained. I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD 1 as follows: DOUBLE GENOCIDE TEARS BURUNDI APART: WITNESSES TELL OF ORGY OF Kll.LING AFTER ABORTIVE HUTU CoUP (NoTE.-The following dispatch, based on reporting inside Burundi, was filed from Kinshasa, capital of neighboring Zaire (for\u00ad merly of the Belgian Congo).) (By Jonathan C. Randal) BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI, June 9.-Terr ified by yet another bloody uprising against their 500-year-old domination, the minority Tutsi rulers of Burundi are systematically killing the elite of their former Hutu serfs in what can only be termed genocide. Official Burundi government and impar\u00ad tial estimates alike claim that as many as 100,000 people have been killed in the six weeks since Hutu exiles invaded this poor Maryland- sized mountain nation located in Central Africa between Tanzania and Zaire, the former Belgian Congo. But such are the difficulties in collecting reliable information in Burundi that the death toll may be considerably higher in the combination Hutu uprising and Tutsi re\u00ad pression in reaction. By all accounts, the orgy of killing was set off by the invaders' determination to mur\u00ad der all the Tutsis who make up 15 per cent of Burundi's estimated 3.5 million inhabitants. Their plan reportedly then called for the es\u00ad tablishment of a purely Hutu regime. The continuing repression is seemingly dictated by the Tutsis' equal determination to cow Hutu peasants into submission and wipe out the educated Hutu elite in order to ensure Tutsi domination for the foresee\u00ad able future. What has been called an attempt at \"dou\u00ad ble genocide\" has few parallels in the post\u00ad independence annals of Africa. Even such African tragedies as the Congo turmoil of the early and mid-60s, the Biafran rebellion and the recently concluded Sudanese civil war do not match what has happened here. Outwardly impervious to international criticism , including from the Belgian gov\u00ad ernment and Pope Paul VI, Burundi Presi\u00ad dent Michael Micombero shows little inclii\u00ad nation or ability to stop the killing. Western embassies are reluctant to talk for fear of jeopardizing the security of their nationals. (There are some 6,000 foreigners in Burundi, half of them Belgians.) Only oc\u00ad casional passes have been issued to diplo\u00ad mats for travel outside the capital since the violence began. To date the Organization of African Unity, the continent's regional grouping, has re\u00ad fused to investigate the Burundi situation, apparently on the ground that such action would violate its charter forbidding inter\u00ad ference in a member state's internal affairs. At this point, such a move might prove to be too late anyway. The repression has reached down through the ranks of the edu\u00ad cated Hutu elite to such an extent that only a thousand or so secondary school students still survive. In an informal conversation with visiting reporters, President Micombero alluded to the lasting effects of the civil war by quot\u00ad ing-if only to disagree with-an unidenti\u00ad fied missionary who told him \"80 years of evangelization has been washed down the drain.\" Similarly, a longtime foreign resident la\u00ad mented that the violence had \"cancelled out everything that has been accomplished\" since Burundi gained its independence in 1962 after some 80 years of first German and then Belgian colonial tutelage. Now, he added, \"We have \u00b7to start from square one.\" Such is the Burundi genius for intrigue that some diplomatic observers are convinced that the government, which has conceded prior knowledge of the Hutu invasion, al\u00ad lowed the rebels to make their move from bases in Tanzania April 29 in the hope that they would be crushed and that the inva\u00ad sion would justify subsequent repression. A'I\"I'ACK NO SURPRISE Officials from the 31-year-old president on down have admitted that the approximate date of the attack was known in advance. The president, who sports an elegant mut\u00ad tonchop beard, dissolved his government just hours before the attack, and his decision to do so has been interpreted less charitably than his own explanation that he was guided by \"divine providence.\" The morning preceding the invasion, Con\u00ad golese in Burundi living along the rich plain bordering Lake Tanganyika, between Bu\u00ad rundi and Zaire, took to their boats and headed for safety on the Zaire side. [Burundi ambassador to the United Na\u00ad tions Nsanze Terence, at a press conference in New York June 1, said that an attacking force of some 8,000 crossed Lake Tanganyika and entered Burundi. He said that 3,000 Bu\u00ad rundese constituting their \"fifth column\" joined With the invading force inside the country.] Once the attack began on the evening of April 29, the rebels surpassed in violence even the followers of the late Pierre Mulele, the Peking-trained Congolese rebel who led the successful rebellion in KWilu Province in 1964 and whose tactics inspired the Hutu up\u00ad rising here. High on Indian hemp, proteoted by witch doctors' tatoos, anywhere from 3,000 to 25,000 rebels moved out of their bases in the dense forests on the Tanzanian border and went on a rampage. They chanted \"Mal, Mal Mulele,\" the magic Swahili words for the famous Mulele water which was supposed to dissolve the government troops' bullets. REBELS JUMP GUN The attacks centered on the south, north\u00ad east and Bujumbura, a city of 70,000. The rebels jumped the gun in the capital by re\u00ad fusing to pay for gasoline for Molotov cock\u00ad tails at a downtown filling station, chopping oft' the attendants' fingers and thus raising the alarm two hours before operations were to begin. In the northeast, the attackers were quick\u00ad ly repulsed. But in the southern province of Buriri, they struck with great effectiveness, seeking out their victims with lists of names and addresses. Tracts found on captured rebels harangued them to kill Tutsi men, women and children and even disembowel pregnant Tutsi women to ensure \"th81t no Tutsi foetus would survive. A French journalist who interviewed the widow of a Tutsi gendarmerie captain was told that her three children were beheaded by machetes before her eyes, her husband disemboweled and the childrens he8.ds stuffed in his stomach while she . was re\u00ad peatedly raped and left for_ dead .. Micombero recounted that captured docu\u00ad ments spoke of plans for a rebel victory 20588 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 parade in Bujumbura on May 19 during which he, as the last surviving Tutsi, was to be lt1lled. SECRET HUTU SOCIETY Although the government so far has faile<1 to produce the documentary evidence, no responsible observer, Burundi or foreign, se\u00ad riously doubts the government case linking the invasion to a secret Hutu society said to have been formed in 1970 to provide funds to train the rebels. Monthly contributions varied between 100 Burundi francs (about $2) for a poor Hutu to $400 for a rich businessman. The government contends-once again without producing evi\u00ad dence-that thousands of names were on the society's lists, including many prominent Hutus in government and private life. Bernard Bududira, Tutsi vicar general of the Roman Catholic diocese of Burtri in the south, quoted an eyewitness who saw Alois Baraklkana, a Hutu graduate of the Univer\u00ad sity of Arizona and vice director of the gov\u00ad ernment's Economics Ministry, at the lake\u00ad side mission at Mina.go exhorting the rebels to continue their devastation. According to other testimony, other Hutu leaders were in the vanguard of the southern attack, although, unlike their troops, they were not drugged. Some of the rebel mUlta.ry leaders wore blood-daubed enamel dishpans as helmets. Although Mlcombero accused Gaston and Martin Kasongo of being in Bu\u00ad rundi during the attack, no one else has cor\u00ad roborated the presence of these two 'former leaders of the 1964 Simba uprising in the Eastern Congo. All the rebels captured spoke the Burundi language~ Kirundi, indicating that foreign intervention was probably lim\u00ad ited to adapting techniques perfected in the Congo. A major variation on the Simba rebellion, however, was the strict order given to avoid harming whites. DEVASTATION EXTENSIVE The extent of the devastation wrought by the Hutu rebels was brought home by a helicopter :flight low over the rich Lake Tan\u00ad ganyika plain and through the green hllls where most Burundese live. Starting at Bugarama Lake, 25 miles south of the capital, and extending to Nya.nza Lake near the Tanzanian border to the south, there is an almost uninterrupted record of violence: burned-out cars, huts and build\u00ad ings in the town of Rumonge; some 30 muti\u00ad lated bodies, bloated and bleached, in the reeds near the lake shore. They are jealously guarded by crocodiles and a hippopotamus family. \u00b7 But more telling stUl was the almost total lack of people seen from the helicopter in this, one of Africa s most densely populated countries. According to a missionary report, 2,782 homes were burned down in the southern attack, which lasted three days before gov\u00ad ernment 'forces, reinforced by a company of airlifted Zaire troops turned the tide. -\" Although most of the rebels retreated back across the Tanzanian border, President Ml\u00ad combero disclosed the existence of a rebel \"People's Republic\" of Martya.zo, which held sway in the southern hllls for two weeks be\u00ad fore lt was crushed by the army and gen\u00ad darmerie. :But if there is little real argument with the government's explanations about the initial a'btack, the same cannot be said for its claims about casualties, the continUing repression or the mysterious death of former King Ntare V ln. Kitega in central Burundi. In \u00b7his formal \u00b7chat, Micombero recounted the demise\u00b7 of the king, who rashly returned tQ Burundi a.t\u00b7 the end . of March after the . Terming the ex-king a \"fool\" to have thought that his return would provoke an uprising in favor of the monarchy, Micom\u00ad bero explained how he had honored the let\u00ad ter of his promise to protect the king by placing him under house arrest in the royal paLace in Ki tega. Micombero spiked rumors that Ntare had been kUled in fighting between the army and rebels seeking to free and use him as a symbol of their revolt. \"The king was not assassinated,\" the president said, \"but judged and executed immediately on the night of April 29.\" Angered by the importance the Western press has given the aftermath of the attack, Micombero said: \"You people insist on the repression without insisting on its causes.\" In his eyes, the attack, but not the repres\u00ad sion, constituted genocide, which \"no gov\u00ad ernment which caution.\" Indeed, \"It was worse t!lan genocide,\" Micombero said, because the Hutu attackers killed not only Tutsi men, women and chil\u00ad dren but also some Hutus whc refused to Join their ranks. PURSUING GUXLTY He maintained that only thos& who are guilty are being punished and compared his relentless pursuit of the Hatus to the con\u00ad tinuing hunt for Nazis implicated in ex\u00ad terminating European Jews il! World War II. \"They're stlll tracking down those respon\u00ad sible for the Jewish genocide t!len, and that's more than 20 years ago,\" he said. Evasive about the exact death toll, Micom\u00ad bero nonetheless estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 Burundese hac! lost their lives. But he insisted that mori) Burundese were killed in the initial attack than in the subsequent repression. Since in the past he has said 50,000 Tutsis alone had died in the first rebel push, his estlina.tion was interpreted as the first otfi\u00ad cial admission that large numbers of Hutu were victims of the repression. Reliable reports from missionaries, the sur\u00ad est sources of information in this country conservatively estimate that no more than 1,700 Tut.sls--and far fewer loyal Hutus-\u00ad were killed in the south in the initial rebel onslaught and that no more than 4,000 loot their lives in the entire country. In the repression, Hutu casualties in the south alone were said to r.ange from 20,000 to 40,000 dead. Between 3,000 and 4,000 Hutis have been killed so far in the repression in Bujumbura, an equal number in Kitega and some 15,000 to 20,000 in all the rest of the country, except the north where little information has been available. HUTU CASUALTIES Other reliable sources put Hutu casualties as high as 10,000 in Bjumbura alone. In the capital, authorities no longer drive trucks with Hutu cadavers through the cen\u00ad ter of town in broad daylight. But every night trucks carrying the dead are seen either along the lakeside road or along Patrice Lumu\u00ad muba Avenue on their way to a giant bull\u00ad dozed. burial ground near the airport. With relatively few exceptions, only adoles\u00ad cent male or adult Hutu men have reportedly been killed in the repression. However, Hutu women with skills in teaching or nursing have been killed. For example, five Hutu women teachers were bayoneted to death by the army at the Buriri mission. As one source put, \"The army and gendar\u00ad merie haven't wasted many bullets.\" In the early weeks of the repression , per\u00ad sonal vengeance played a role in the arbitrary denunciation, arrest and death of many Hutus, although the army has shot several soldiers and volunteers who were guilty of such excessive zeal. ARBITRARY ARRESTS Now, at least in theory, three citizens must denounce a suspect before he is arrested. But this procedure is not always honored. The other morning in the center of Bujum\u00ad bura, a foreign journalist watched three gen\u00ad darmes jump out of a jeep and bundle three well-dressed men off to an undisclosed destin\u00ad ation. In the south, army atrocities have been re\u00ad ported at at least one mission which was be\u00ad ing used as a feeding and pacification center for Hutus lured out of the forests by govern\u00ad ment promises that calm had been restored. A helicopter mounted with machine guns flew over the assembled Hutus at the Mutumba mission in the south and opened fire, killing about 100 of them. The United Nations has formally protested against the use of requisitioned UNICEF cars in Bujumbura by the police and against the unauthorized use of a United Nations fishery research vessel which has been armed and used to attack suspected rebel strongholds along the lake shore. The effects of the repression at Bujum\u00ad bura 'University are such that 170 of the 360 Burundese students failed to apply for scholarships for the next school year. Since few Burundese are rich enough to attend without a scholarship, the conclusion is that 170 Hutu students have been killed, arrested or forced into hiding. Much of the killing at the university and in secondary schools has been carried out by the students themselves. Policemen arrived in some schools with lists, summoned the Hutus outside, and pushed them into trucks where they were bayonetted to death. At the capital's technical secondary school a professor recounted that on the night of May 19, the Hutu students suddenly put out the lights and tried to escape. Their Tutsi colleagues kUled half of them, but strangely enough some of the 100 or so Hutu students are stUI in school. \"And you would never know anything had happened,' the professor added. The great fear of the foreign community is that the remaining Hutu secondary school students in Bujumbura and elsewhere in the country will \"disappear,'' once the foreign teachers go on their annual summer holidays abroad. At one point last year, the army numbered some 3,500 men. But it 1s now reported well below strength, not because of casualties suffered in fighting the rebels but rather be\u00ad cause its Hutu officers, noncommissioned of\u00ad ficers and men have been either purged or killed. The Christian churches have also paid their tribute to the violence. Missionary sources report the 12 Hutu Protestant pastors and 14 Hutu Catholic priests have been killed so far in the repression. What lessons the recent events here will hold for the future are impossible to tell. No one takes seriously the threat of an immedi\u00ad ate Hutu revolt. \"All the Hutus who lifted their heads have had them severed,\" said one foreigner. ReconcU1ation seexns far off. In the im\u00ad mediate future, foreigners here hope that there wUI be no prolonged rebel insurgency. But eventually, it is believed the Hutus will rise and try once again to oust the Tutsis, probably in less than 10 years. BURUNDI: LAND OF TRmAL PASSIONS Burundi and neighboring Rwanda to the north were both formerly Belgian-admin\u00ad istered trust territories. The two countries became independent in oTuly, 1962. -With populations of about 3.5 million each, the two countries are ethnically divided be\u00ad tween a Tutsi minority a.nd a Hutu majority. The Tutsis, 15 per cent of the population in June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20589 Burundi and 9 per cent in Rwanda are a proud, tall, aristocratic pastoral people who had ruled the poorer, farming Hutus for centuries prior to independence. In 1959, Belgians and influential Roman Catholic missionaries encouraged a success\u00ad ful if bloody Hutu revolt against the ruling Tutsis in Rwanda. At least 20,000 Tutsis were slaughtered, and some 200,000 others fled the country, many to Burundi. Following the revolt in Rwanda, the Tutsis in Burundi tightened their control over the Hutus but also sought to establish closer ties. Numerous intermarriages encouraged hopes that a single unified nation would gradually emerge. Since independence, scarcely a year has passed in Burundi without either an at\u00ad tempted coup, trials followed by hangings or a revolt. But this political turmoil largely involved feuding factions within the Tutsi minority. In 1966, King Mwambutsa IV of Burundi was forced off his throne by his son, Ntare V, with the help of then Capt. Michel Micom\u00ad bero. Three months later, Mlcombero, in turn, deposed Ntare and proclaimed a repub\u00ad lic with himself as president. On April 29 of this year, Hutu rebels, some coming from camps in Tanzania and others apparently from across Lake Tanganiyka in Zaire (the Congo) ,invaded the country. They were joined by Hutu tribesmen within the country, and together they attempted to oust the Tutsl-dominated Micombero gov\u00ad ernment. The coup failed and the Tutsis began a bloody repression in reaction. THE DECIMATION OF LAOS Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, the tiny kingdom of Laos is being destroyed in order that it might be saved. I ask unanimous consent that Joseph R. L. Sterne's dispatch from Vientiane be printed in the RECORD so that Senators may have an opportunity to read an ex\u00ad ceptional first-hand report about \"a hap\u00ad less land caught in Indochina's web of violence.\" There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Baltimore Sun, June 12, 1971] LAos: A MucH BUFFETED BUFFER (By Joseph R. L. Sterne) VIENTIANE.-The doctrine of letting Asians fight Asians has developed a macabre twist in Laos, a hapless land caught in Indochina's web of violence. After more than two decades of war, opposing Lao forces are so tired and decimated that the ground fighting is being taken over more and more by other Asian troops. This is especially true on the Communist side, where Pathet Lao forces totaling an es\u00ad timated 30,000 fairly ineffective troops were outnumbered two to one last January by their tough North Vietnamese allies. The imbal\u00ad ance has leveled somewhat with the with\u00ad drawal of most of the 312th North Vietnam\u00ad ese division to home bases for the current offensive in South Vietnam. But the 316th division remains in the Plain of Jars and several battalions are on the offensive in the south near Pakse. On the government side, an undisclosed number of Thai \"volunteers\" (estimates range from 6,000 to 15,000) have been brought in to help a worn but dogged army of 60,000 Royal regulars plus 30,000 of General Vang Pao's assorted irregulars. Loyalist reserves are so depleted that 13-year-old boys are being put into uniform, a measure the enemy has avoided, and the manpower pool is vir\u00ad tually nil. These Thai \"volunteers,\" who are paid per-haps ten times more than Lao soldiers, are financed by the United States. Washington also provides indispensable air cover support from bases just across the border in Thai\u00ad land. Near Long Tieng, a government strong\u00ad hold in the rugged \"Skyline Ridge\" north of Vientiane, mountain tops are dotted with the craters of American bombs dropped dur\u00ad ing heavy fighting from December to March. As for the village of Long Tieng itself, it is a deserted cluster of dilapidated huts bobby-trapped by their occupants against looters. The vlllagers of Long Tieng are among the 250,000 people--about one tenth of the nation's population-who have been up\u00ad rooted by current fighting and are living in camps while depending on food and seed pro\u00ad vided by the American government. At a refugee center like Bon Xon, halfway from Vientiane to the Long Tieng outpost, charter planes in amazing variety swoop in and out bearing all manner of supplies. The United States effort to maintain Laos costs approximately $350 millon per year, of which only $50 million is spent on economic and budget aid and the rest on military pay, supplies and ammunition. Although U.S. aid was tending to escalate until Senator Stuart Symington pushed through a congressional ceiling, the military situation in Laos has been steadily deteriorating, year by year. The Communists now control 75 per cent of the country's 91,000 square miles. And while more than 80 per cent of the people have chosen to live in areas where the gov\u00ad ernment still prevails, both American and Laos officials freely admit that North Viet\u00ad nam could overrun everything if it were so inclined. That Hanoi has chosen not to do so is a decision reflecting many factors. One is the fear of provoking China, which already has staked out northwest Laos as its own sphere of infiuence by the classic Peking tactic of building a road. Another is fear of annoying the Soviet Union, a signatory of the 1962 Geneva accords which supposedly were to provide Laos with a coalition government of rightists, neutralists and leftists. Still another is the calculation that this would draw retaliation from Thailand a.t a time when North Vietnam has enough on its hands. As a result, North Vietnam has limited itself to a takeover of the eastern part of Laos. On the north, one of its purposes evidently was to deny U.S. government-sup\u00ad ported forces a base from which to counter\u00ad attack against North Vietnam itself and to sustain pressure on Vientiane province. On the south, the high-priority goal has been to secure a wide area for development of the Ho Chi Minh trail system into South Vietnam. Analysts are divided in assessing Hanoi's ultimate intentions. Some anticipate that if North Vietnam can impose a government to its liking in Saigon it will try to integrate all of Vietnam and then place Laos and Cambodia in tributary, status as part of a single Indochina federation or confederation. others believe China would prefer severa.! weak states in Indochina and will see to it (with U.S. help) that Laos and Cambodia remain at least nominally independent. It is on the basis of this latter interpreta\u00ad tion that some analysts conclude that when and if an Indochina settlement approaches, North Vietnam will make sure it controls the bulk of Lao territory. This would bolster the position of the Pathet Lao in negotiations. It is most unlikely that the Pathet Lao would be willing to settle in the 'Seventies for the share of power meted to them a decade ago. But, Prince Souvanna Phouma, the wily neutralist premier once opposed and now sup\u00ad ported by Washington, has been careful not to fill the seats in his Cabinet that had been allotted to the boycotting Pathet Lao. In\u00ad stead, he has kept channels open to Prince Souphanouvong, his half brother and head of the Pathet Lao, in the hopes of creating what one diplomat describes as \"the kind of Laos that is 'minimally acceptable' to the contest\u00ad ing elements.\" For his part, Prince Sou\u00ad phanouvong has abstained from proclaiming a rival government. Out of the years of fighting it has become fairly clear that outside forces-North Viet\u00ad namese and Americans, Chinese and Thais\u00ad can pretty well operate on the territory of Laos as they choose. Not only has this brought misery and dislocation to thousands of peas\u00ad ants with no comprehension of these power rivalries but it has raised doubts whether the nation, a French-created artificiality, can endure. There are, after all, more ethnic Lao In Thailand than in Laos, many of whom are now rebelling under Communist auspices against Thai power in Bangkok. And in Laos itself, aJbout half that population is composed of non-Lao mountain tribesmen who long have been the main source of Pathet Lao strength. Whether Laos is to remain as a much-buf\u00ad feted buffer state or is to be carved or gobbled up by its neighbors is a question for the fu\u00ad ture. What is quite certain is that the deci\u00ad sion will not be made in this indolent capital on the Mekong. DRAFT RESISTERS Mr. TAFT. Mr. President, as the debate continues as to the means for ending the war in Vietnam, we should not forget the problems associated with draft re\u00ad sisters who are now fugitives or in exile. It would be a mistake for us to forget these young men, and it would equally be a mistake for them to forget the obli\u00ad gation which they have to American so\u00ad ciety. My proposal has been that those interested should be allowed to earn amnesty by 3 years of low pay service. On June 4, the Los Angeles Times pub\u00ad lished an article entitled \"Proposals to Bring the Outcasts Home Without Pun\u00ad ishment.\" The article was written by Steve Harvey, an opinion staff writer for the Los Angeles Times. In that same is\u00ad sue was published \"A List of Amnesties in American history.\" I ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the REcoRD. There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: PROPOSALS To BRING THE OUTCASTS HoME WITHOUT PUNISHMENT (By Steve Harvey) An estimated 70,000 young Americans have switched countries rather than fight in Indochina. Draft resisters and deserters, they have found sanctuary mostly in Canada but in other areas of the world as well. Once, the outcasts would have been ob\u00ad jects of revulsion at home. Ever since win\u00ad ning its independence on the battlefield, the United States has taken a special pride in its fighting man. But the Indochina war has torn apart the nation as no conflict had before. In one poll, 65% of those quizzed termed the war immoral. Even President Nixon has stated that the U.S. involvement was a mistake. Whlle some view the exiles as traitors or cowards---end point to the more than 50,000 U.S. troops who have died in Indochina-\u00ad others have come to see them as a unique variety of \"prisoner of war.\" Unable in good conscience to participate in a war they feel unjust, they have made a separate peace. And, at home, a movement has begun to 20590 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 enable them to return home without being punished. Sen. Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio gave the drive a. large measure of legitimacy by introducing an amnesty bill late last year. Taft proposed that draft resisters be par\u00ad doned if they agree, in return, to serve for three years in the armed forces or in some alternate form of public service. The offer would remain in effect one year from the date of the bill's passage. \"America. is big enough and strong enough to give these young men a chance to come home and play a positive role in a life of their own country,\" said the former World War II naval officer. \"It would be a serious mistake for us to foreclose this road to them forever.\" Deserters, however, would be excluded, for Taft believes that to pardon them would grewtly damage the fabric of the armed services. In the House, Rep. Edward I. Koch (D\u00ad N.Y.) has introduced a proposal similar to Taft's except that it would require two years of service rather than three. Neither measure has yet been acted upon. Other developments have provided fur\u00ad ther evidence of a. change in the public's attitude. The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have isbued a. statement urging consideration of amnesty for \"those who have been im\u00ad prisoned as selective conscientious objectors, and giving those who have emigrated an op\u00ad portunity to return to the country to show that they are sincere objectors.\" Other reli\u00ad gious groups such as the United Presby\u00ad terians, the United Church of Christ and the American Baptist Convention also support some kind of amnesty. Former Rep. Charles Porter (D.-Ore.) has founded an organization called Amnesty Now, which is proposing unconditional am\u00ad nesty for draft resisters and deserters. Am\u00ad nesty Now plans to press both political par\u00ad ties to insert its proposal into their planks at the conventions this year. President Nixon has altered his stand on amnesty. In November, when he was asked whether he would consider granting amnesty , Mr. Nixon's reply was one word: \"No.\" But two months later, he told an interviewer who asked the same question, \"We always, under our system, provide amnesty . . . I for one would be very liberal with regard to amnesty.\" However, the President added that before he could consider any proposal, America's fighting role in South Vietnam must end and all American prisoners of war must be released. (More than 1,600 men are listed by the Defense Department as captured or miss\u00ad ing in action.) Amnesty has also been a lively issue on the campaign trail. Sen. George McGovern (D.-S.D.) has called for a general amnesty (as has Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D.-Mass.)). Former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy first sug\u00ad gested the possibllity during his 1968 presi\u00ad dential campaign. Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D.-Me.) believes amnesty must be delayed until \"the war is over and the fighting is ended.\" Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D.-Minn.) has adopted a sim\u00ad ilar stance. Taft has reported some unfavorable reac\u00ad tion to his bill, \u00b7tncludlng a telegram from Florida offering to buy him a ticket to Can\u00ad ada. But the American public appears to be cautiously favorable to amnesty. A recent Gallup poll showed that 63% favored pardon\u00ad ing the exiles-if they agree to perform na\u00ad tional service. But only 7% favored uncon\u00ad dt.tiona.l amnesty, while 22% were totally opposed to any \u00b7form of amnesty and 7% were unsure. An iniponant--a.nd sometimes forgotten\u00ad aspect of the whole question is the attitude of the exiles themselves. Many have expressed opposition to any offer short of unconditional amnesty, taking the position that it is the government that should be seeking forgiveness, not them. \"I don't feel guilty about anything ,\" 26- year-old John Toler of Chico, Calif., told an interviewer in Stockholm recently . \"And so I don't see why I should have to accept a punishment as a condition.\" \"It's all a campaign issue,\" said George Meals, 26, of Atlanta, Ga. \"It's not reality and it's not going to happen.\" Toler and Meals are two of about 600 war resisters--mostly deserters--who have tied to Sweden. About 450 are still there. Jack Calhoun, now living in Canada, re\u00ad cently published an open letter to Rep. Koch denouncing the alternative service aspect of both the Koch and Taft proposals. \"We left the States because we did not want to become criminals of the heart and now feel that a government which has the stain of Indochina on its conscience has no business passing judgment on our 'crimes' and meting out punishment no matter how seemingly tolerant and liberal it may be dressed up,\" Calhoun wrote. A separate panel of resisters in Canada also issued a statement shortly after Taft's legislation was introduced, demanding \"to\u00ad tally nonpunitive restoration of civil rights.\" Sweden and Canada. have been helpful to the war resisters. The Swedish government gives the American exiles free rent and about $27 a week in welfare until they get settled and find jobs. Free language lessons and grants to attend school are also available. Canada, which encourages immigration , asks no question about a newcomer's draft status at home and offers counseling service for jobs. For the immigrant with some higher education, it is reasonably easy to attain the status of \"landed immigrant\"--entitling him to almost all the privileges of Canadian citizenship, including unemployment and health benefits. The U.S. extradition agreements with the two countries do not cover offenses such as draft evasion or military desertion. It is, of course, impossible to calculate how many exiled war resisters would return to the United States given the opportunity. But for now, amnesty ... conditional or otherwise ... does not seem near. In the meantime, an estimated 70,000 Americans can't go home again.

Mr. President, it was with sorrow that I read in the morn\u00ad ing newspaper of the death of Saul Alin\u00ad sky. I have known him for many yea.rs and considered him a good friend. He was one of the most energetic and imag\u00ad inactive persons I have ever known. He devoted his life in seeking the improve-June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20591 ment of the poor people of our country and he succeeded in many of his endeav\u00ad ors. He was a fuie citizen and our people are deeply in his debt. I ask unanimous consent that the arti\u00ad cle by Mr. David Boldt, published in the Washington Post, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the REc\u00ad ORD, as follows: SAUL ALINSKY, 63, ORGANIZED THE POWERLESS IN AMERICA (By David R. Boldt) Saul Alinsky, 63, who spent a lifetime organizing the powerless to achieve power through the radical concept of what he called \"pure democracy,\" died yesterday after an apparent heart attack in Carmel, Calif. Mr. Alinsky's career was a succession of generalships over mass movements of the oppressed in America. It began with battling for dissident mine workers and continued in his native Chicago where he organized white slum-dwellers in the \"Back-of-the\u00ad Yards\" section. He organized blacks in the ghettos of a dozen cities, including Chicago, Rochester, N.Y., Kansas City and Buffalo. In the end, he sought redress for an increasingly alien\u00ad ated-and powerless-American middle class, while also trying to teach his organizing methods to others. If his assaults and threats goaded the con\u00ad servative establishment to rage, he also pre\u00ad served a distance from liberals \"who walk out of the room when an argument becomes a fight,\" and drew fire from radicals who found him ideologically impure. He once said of ideologies. \"When you have one you sutler from the delusion that you know all the answers. I certainly don't.\" His chroniclers, including close confidants such as editor T. George Harris said that his ideol\u00ad ogy actually was that of the \"founding fa\u00ad thers of the American nation.\" Time magazine, in its proflle of Mr. Alinsky, cited James Madison's warning in the \"Fed\u00ad eralist Papers\" against allowing any class or faction to obtain too much power as perhaps the best statement of Alinskyism. In explaining how he conceived his tactics, which included sending black pickets to the white suburban homes of slumlords, deposit\u00ad ing dead rats and garbage on the steps of city hall, Mr. Alinsky sometimes seemed to have the dlfiiculty that comes to anyone who ob\u00ad tains a great talent as a natural gift. \"All I know is what every good organizer knows,\" he once said in an interview for Har\u00ad per's magazine, \"You react to all the action with a reflex.\" Mr. Alinsky began developing his reflexes in Chicago, where he was born the son of a Jew\u00ad ish tailor who had emigrated from Russia, and where he experienced many of the same frustrations that later embittered the city's blacks. He attended the University of Chicago, where he studied archaeology, and during one summer worked with the dissident miners who were battling against John L. Lewis' United Mine Workers. Out of the battle, oddly, developed a long and close relationship between Mr. Alinsky and Mr. Lewis. Mr. Alin\u00ad sky later wrote a biography of the union leader. As a graduate student in criminology, Mr. Alinsky studied the organization of the Ca\u00ad pone gang, and also began his own organizing efforts in the Back-of-the- Yards area. He brought about better economic conditions for the impoverished white immigrants who lived in the area by putting pressure on their employers-the meat packing companies\u00ad through boycotts and sitdowns. After the Back-of-the-Yards effort made him widely known, Mr. Alinsky founded the Industrial Areas Foundation, which worked closely with the Catholic urban programs of Samuel Cardinal Stritch. Mr. Alinsky lectured young priests that they \"would have to choose between becoming a bishop and being priests.\" In the early 1960s, Mr. Alinsky's IAF orga\u00ad nized blacks in a ghetto area of Chicago into the Woodlawn Organization, which used picketing and garbage deposits at city hall to make effective its demands for better hous\u00ad ing and municipal services. From there, he brought efforts to other cities. Constantly seeking ways that the poor could achieve real power beyond the power to outrage and inconvenience, Mr. Alinsky sought to use stockholder power to force Kodak to hire more blacks in Rochester He urged church and other groups that held blocs of the company's stock to demand changes in hiring policies. Mr. Alinsky frankly admitted to a split personality. A vociferous and demanding radical in public, he was a quiet and charm\u00ad ing conversationalist in private. He also con\u00ad fessed to sometimes being less sure of his righteousness than he sounded. Since 1967. Mr. Alinsky had devoted him\u00ad self mainly to teaching at the institute he founded in Chicago, and in keeping in touch with such proteges as Cesar Chavez, the orga\u00ad nizer of the California farm workers, and Nicholas Von Hoffman, a columnist for the Washington Post, both of whom worked for Mr. Alinsky. Mr. Alinsky's life was often touched by per\u00ad sonal tragedy. His first wife drowned. His second wife, Jean, has been incapacitated by multiple sclerosis for many years, and lives in Carmel. Friends said that Mr. Alinsky was in Carmel to visit her. He had divorced her two years ago and remarried. He is survived by his present wife, Irene, his mother, and by a son and daughter of his first marriage. AMERICAN HEALTH CARE: PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, at a time when a current social debate has reached a peak and yet prior to the enactment of any major corrective legislation, I want to explore the problems and po\u00ad tential of our American health care system. How can the wealthiest nation on earth permit a sizable segment of its society to go without any health care at all? Why is it that we can spend $70 or $80 billion in 1 year alone on health costs and still have literally millions of people who cannot find, or cannot af\u00ad ford, basic medical care? Why? Because of the delivery system through which Americans receive their health care. The system itself is inade\u00ad quate, not the components. Most attacks on our system of medical care have not been on the quality of individual care, but on the collective performance of the entire health care system. Take the availability of care-the fact that certain people in certain places simply cannot find a doctor. Whether this is due to poor geographic distribu\u00ad tion of medical personnel or the over\u00ad specialization of physicians is not the issue. The point is clear-some people in this country go without medical care, and that is intolerable. Medical care is a basic right of the people-their right to life. It is wrong when a man's ability to obtain that med-ical care depends on his color or his ability to pay; on where he lives, or who he knows. This problem of access is compounded by another-the escalating cost of health care. These costs have risen to such an extent that medical care has become a luxury, rather than a necessity. Some people, even with insurance, cannot af\u00ad ford to pay the exhorbitant medical bills of today-and thus, cannot afford the care they rightfully deserve as citizens of this wealthy Nation. And then, we see the inefficiency and waste in our system. Highly trained phy\u00ad sicians perform tasks that could be handled by physician assistants. Patients occupy expensive hospital beds for test\u00ad ing that could be done on an outpatient basis. Many hospitals have duplication of expensive equipment, and others have costly equipment which is rarely used. It is, therefore, not the quality of individual medical care, but the inefficient func\u00ad tioning of a total system that has brought on a crisis in health care. This crisis must be met, and changes must be made. The public is unhappy with the status quo, and they are de\u00ad manding that the inefficiencies and in\u00ad equities be dealt with. :i think the public is entitled to these changes, but they should be made gradually with caution and constant evaluation. Otherwise, we might launch broad new programs that would compound our problems, rather than correct them. How do we change the system? Where do we begin? I think one place to begin is to develop some real cooperation 'and coordination among the various groups that make up the health care industry\u00ad the doctors, hospitals, and insurors. Our system has been a fragmented one, with all parts operating independently, care\u00ad fully guarding their own special inter\u00ad ests. I hope that we can reverse this trend and begin a new attitude-one of coor\u00ad dination and teamwork with the cen\u00ad tral aim of providing improved health care for everyone. Once this stage is set, once the basic cooperation is present, then any number of innovative changes could be developed. In some areas, hospitals could merge or consolidate to avoid duplication of ex\u00ad pensive equipment. In other areas, affili\u00ad ation agreements among hospitals or medical centers might be feasible through which services could be shared at reduced costs. Doctors could organize in group settings and could use paramed\u00ad ical personnel to greater advantage. Pre\u00ad paid group practices, with their charac\u00ad teristic emphasis on efficiency and econ\u00ad omy, could be set up in areas lacking health services. Insurors could work with providers in devising methods for cover\u00ad ing outpatient services. The list is end\u00ad less. The important thing is that change is essential; and if the health care industry refuses to initiate these necessary changes, then government is going to move in and occupy the field. When the private sector fails to provide, govern\u00ad ment is sure to act. I do not want so\u00ad cialized medicine. I do not want a fed\u00ad erally owned and operated medical sys\u00ad tem. 20592 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 Therefore, I believe the active partici\u00ad pation on the part of the medical pro\u00ad fession is vital. I believe that the ulti\u00ad mate solution lies in a true cooperative effort between the public and the private sector. Government can and must make an accommodation with the medical pro\u00ad fession in order to make health care leg\u00ad islation work. And equally so, the profes\u00ad sion must recognize that there are prob\u00ad lems and must not resent or resist the ef\u00ad forts of government. All participants must realize that change is inevitable and should look to the good of the total system, not to the protection of private interests. Only in this way will we have a workable system, uniquely American, where quality health care can be made available to all. A NEW COALITION Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, on Sun\u00ad day, June 11, the Washington Post pub\u00ad lished a very good article by Neal Peirce on the new coalition emerging in Ameri\u00ad can politics for change and reform. Mr. Peirce makes a fundamental point in his analysis: Neither political party, and no leader, has been able to give effective expression to the hopes and fears of the American people. But at the same time, he notes, the message of the presidential primaries to date is that \"the ice has begun to break.\" Mr. Peirce outlines the basis for a new coalition in American politics and points out that the candidate most ident\u00ad ified with this trend is Senator GEORGE McGovERN. Mr. President, I commend Mr. Peirce's column to the Senate and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: BEHIND THE WINNER: A NEW COALITION? (By Neal Peirce) (NOTE.-The writer, author of \"The Mega\u00ad states of America: People, Politics and Power in the Ten Great States,\" is a contributing editor of the National Journal and presently a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson Interna\u00ad tional Center for Scholars.) Now that the 1972 presidential primary season is largely behind us, the time has come to take stock, to see what these elec\u00ad tions mean for the country. My own con\u00ad clusion is that the Democratic primary con\u00ad tests, from New Hampshire to California, mark a portentous turn in American politics. For at least a decade, American politics-\u00ad and that means American government--has been like a river clogged by a massive ice jam. The point is not original-seasoned analysts like David Broder have made it time and again-but it bears repeating: Neither political party, and no leader, has been able to give effective expression to the hopes and fears of the American people. Racial discord and lawlessness have stalked the land. We have had the unique experience of high un\u00ad employment fused with inflation. There has been a breakdown in ou!\" systems of educa\u00ad tion, of law enforcement, of transportation. The voters, looking to government for solu\u00ad tions, have seen instead political stalemate followed by inaction. Thus American politics, as John Saloma. and Frederick Sontag write in their book \"Parties,\" \"has been gripped by a sense of frustration and helplessness.\" At the same time, they note, there is \"a mood of antici\u00ad pation in the country, an expectancy, a rest-less searching, even a deep yearning for some issue, some leader, some catalyst that will effect a new synthesis, a new reality in polit\u00ad ical and governmental performance.\" The message of the primaries in this: The ice has begun to break. REJECTING THEMES OF THE PAST First, we have seen an almost unprece\u00ad dented willingness of the voters to reject the classic old political themes of votes for past favors and loyalty to safe, centrist candi\u00ad dates. Hubert Humphrey's record of legisla\u00ad tive achievements failed to make him a frontrunner; Edmund Muskle's centrism failed to fire the voters' imagination. In\u00ad stead, we saw heavy votes for two highly un\u00ad conventional politicians, George Wallace and George McGovern. Some would say that the voters in the Democratic primaries have been disproportionately the activists and the angry-but the fact is that they have rarely, if ever, turned out in such numbers, and with such effectiveness, in earlier years. Second, we are witnessing an early twi\u00ad light to the era of the media-groomed can\u00ad didate. Both Wa.l.lace and McGovern cut images that would make Madison Avenue shudder. McGovern, despite the cool, confi\u00ad dent demeanor he has developed, is essen\u00ad tially a quiet, nonflamboyant man who might well win a prize as the \"anti-media\" candi\u00ad date of 1972. But that would be by past standards; what the voters now seem to want in candidates is credibility, a willingness to take clear-cut and even highly controversial stands, to suggest that real change can take place in this country. Third, the primaries have shown us star\u00ad tling weakness in the time-honored organs of the old politics-within the Democratic Party, for instance, the traditional bosses and their organizations, and the labor unions. In almost every test, their candidates have lost, or run much more poorly than anticipated. The reason is not that political organizations and labor unions are obsolete. It is that they have failed to catch the rebellious mood of the people. and have lost touch wtth their followers. Fourth, there has been a remarkable trans\u00ad formation in the politics of youth, from pro\u00ad test and confrontation into a powerful weap\u00ad on of a new politics. The demonstrations of the young have largely disappeared from the streets and campuses, only to resurface, in a quiet and highly effective form, in Mc\u00ad Govern's phenomenally successful canvassing operations-and in the voting booths. Whether one agres with McGovern's policies or not, the channeling of youthful protest into the legitimate areas of elective politics is good news we could scarcely have hoped for four or even two years ago. Is the outpouring of citizen action in poli\u00ad tics, exemplified by youth, a temporary phenomenon, likely to fade away if Mc\u00ad Govern loses the nomination or the election? I think not. The cork can't be put back in the bottle. The activists have seen what power they can wield; it is in their blood\u00ad stream and they are likely to be in the thick of campaigns throughout this decade, no matter who wins in November. By opening their party to these new activ\u00ad ists, who alo include large segments of women, minorites and intellectuals, con\u00ad sumer-advocates, environmentalists and anti-war agitators, the Democrats have taken a risk of great internal divisions (as the pro\u00ad technics at next month's convention may well demonstrate). But they have brought dynamic elements into their party, a piece of political missionary work that the Re\u00ad publicans may one day have good reasoilto envy. It is on the basis of the dramatic \"opening up\" of the Democratic Party, which had its roots in the reform mandate laid down by the 1968 Democratic convention, that we can move on to a corollary of immense impor-tance; the outlines of a possible new political alliance, at this moment in the process of creation, that could update and even replace the Democratic coalition created under Franklin D. Roosevelt four decades ago. Who might be included in a new coali\u00ad tion? The newly enfranchised youth, of course. It has been popular to say that the young won't count for much because of their tra\u00ad ditionally low turnout at the polls. Yet on the Democratic side of last Tuesday's Cali\u00ad fornia primary, the turnout of 18-to-24-year\u00ad olds (18 per cent) was not far from their share of the voting-age population (21 per cent). According to a CBS News survey, they went for McGovern over Humphrey, 70 to 20 per cent. Without them, McGovern might well have lost the primary. All surveys point to a heavy Democratic edge among the new voters across the country. If they register and turn out in suoota.ntial numbers next autumn, and the presidential election is as close as it was in 1968, they could easily tip the scales to the Democrats. A second element of a new coalition would consist of liberal-minded suburbanites, who make up part of the most highly educated segment of the populace. These are people who feel economically secure enough to in\u00ad dulge their interests in \"good government,\" reform and social welfare issues. A third and less secure element would be a portion of the low-and Iniddle-income voters, including many blue-collar workers, who chafe under high taxes, find govern\u00ad ment too unresponsive, and look to any leader who can offer them a change and a better deal-whether it be a Kennedy, a Wallace, or a McGovern. When voters in this group are preoccupied with a race-connected issue such as busing that seexns personally threatening to them, they may stray from any new Democratic coalition; when not, they are prime candidates for it. Last, as McGovern was able to demon\u00ad strate in California, a new coalition can in\u00ad clude the blacks and Mexican Americans\u00ad generally speaking America's dispossessed. (The McGovern vote among blacks has ad\u00ad vanced steadily in the primaries, from a nadir of 1 per cent in Florida to about 44 per cent, six points ahead of Humphrey, in California. McGovern also took about 60 per cent of the Chicano vote in California.) A FLUID ALLIANCE One can predict that such a coalition will have no staying power, that the interest of its constituent parts are simply too diverse. Without organized labor's enthusiastic sup\u00ad port, any Democratic coalition wlll be hard pressed to win in a general election. Yet the McGovern movement is deeply threatening to big labor's heavy role in the Democratic hier\u00ad archy; some labor chiefs might prefer an\u00ad other four years of Nixon, during which they could reestablish their hold on the Demo\u00ad cratic Party. As far as youth and the ticket\u00ad splitting suburbanites are concerned, they look much too independen-t to fit into any stable, lasting party organization or voting coalition. Thus the new coalition may prove very fluid, appearing for some issues and candi\u00ad dates, disappearing for others. But since it is a coalition forming within the largest polit\u00ad ical party in the country, it is not to be taken lightly. On an immediate basis, the new coalition cannot elect McGovern president unless his campaign can reach out more effectively than President Nixon's to appeal to the indepe.nd\u00ad ent, moderate voters of the country. To begin with, McGovern will have to make overtures to the South. And he already faces the polit\u00ad ically perilous task of moclifying his stands to assuage the fears of Inilllons of centrist, moderate voters-without alienating his ideo\u00ad logically committed volunteers in the process. It must be remembered, too, that President June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20593 Nixon and the Republicans are also in the business of coalition building, appealing on the one hand to blue-collar America with stands like anti-busing and to sophisticated suburbanites with new and creative over\u00ad tures to the Soviet Union and China. The Republicans believe they have an excellent target in McGovern's \"radicalism.\" But the Republicans' efforts to build a new majority faltered badly in the 1970 mid-term elections. The potential Republican majority has conflicts as serious as those facing the Democrats. An appeal to the conservative and blue-collar Catholics, for instance, can back\u00ad fire and alienate the Republicans' traditional base among white-collar Protestants. In November, moreover, the President will bear the burden-from a quarter century in the limelight of partisan politics--of vir\u00ad tually smbolizing the politics of stalemate and rhetoric that has frustrated the country. Fairly or not, McGovern seems fresh and di\u00ad rect by contrast. In June, we cannot know if a new Demo\u00ad cratic coalition of the type McGovern en\u00ad visages can carry the day in November. But we do know that a new and powerful brand of citizen politics has been born. And for the first time since the 1930s, one senses a.t least the potential of a vital new grouping of American voters, one likely to significantly infiuence the remainder of the 1970s and the 1980s, even if it fails to win a majority in 1972. THE MINIMUM WAGE LAW-A CRUEL HOAX Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, the mini\u00ad mum wage law is one of the cruelest hoaxes perpetrated on the poor of America. By raising the minimum wage we sim\u00ad ply will be cutting off employment op\u00ad portunities for thousands of workers who hold marginal jobs. On the other end of the scale, we will be touching off a chain reaction of wage increases that will feed inflation without benefiting anyone. These points were stated succinctly in a letter written by Jonathan Marshall to the Publishers' Auxiliary. The letter was published on May 25, 1972. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the letter, by one of Arizona's leading newspapermen, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ON MINIMUM WAGES EDITOR: Your April 25 issue suggests that news\u00ad papers support the Anderson-amendment limiting the increase in the minimum wage so that it only be increased to $1.80 the first year instead of $2.00, as proposed in 81861. I suggest that such a. compromise is really a. cop out. If this country is serious about fighting inflation, the minimum wage should be held a.t $1.60 per hour. If it is allowed to go up, the country will find that its balance of trade will be worse than during the past year because we wlll not be able to compete with other countries which have cheaper labor. This will mean that our American companies will close plants or assembly lines and unemployment wm continue to rise. The trouble is, we can't have our cake and eat it too. If we want to compete on the world market, reduce unemployment and hold down inflation, we have to start at the bottom, as well as the top. In other words, raising the minimum wage will set off a. chain reaction 1n the total economy and everyone will suffer. For these reasons, I suggest that our members contact their con\u00ad gressional delegations and urge them to hold the line. JONATHAN MARSHALL, Publisher. GENOCIDE IS NOT A THING OF THE PAST Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, some people see the Genocide Convention as a gesture of no importance, with no other purpose than the further vilifica\u00ad tion of already-condemned crimes of past decades. Genocide, it is said, is a thing of the past, and we cannot change history with treaties 30 years after the fact. But this hopeful view of the future resembles the hopefulness which pre\u00ad ceded the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime. The growth of democratic en\u00ad lightenment in the 18th and 19th cen\u00ad turies presumably had ushered in a time when systematic mass murder would be unthinkable. This naive optimism was rudely shocked by the growth of fascism. Those who think genocide is no longer a subject of concern would do well to study last Sunday's editions, June 11, of the Washington Post and New York Times. Each newspaper features a front page article on the tragic conflict in Burundi between the ruling minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus. At least 100,000 people, and possibly many more, have been killed in Burundi in the last 6 weeks. The report by Jonathan C. Randal in the Washington Post says, in part: By all accounts, the orgy of killing was set off by the invaders' determination to murder all the Tutsis who make up 15 per cent of Burundi's estimated 3.5 million in\u00ad habitants. Their plan reportedly then called for the establishment of a. purely Hutu re\u00ad gime. The continuing repression is seemingly dictated by the Tutsis' equal determination to cow the Hutu peasants into submission and wipe out the educated Hutu elite in order to ensure Tutsi domination for the foreseeable future. What has been called a.n attempt at \"dou\u00ad ble genocide\" has few parallels in the post\u00ad independence annals of Africa. The Organization of African Unity has refused even to investigate the Burundi situation on the grounds that its charter forbids interference in its members' in\u00ad ternal affairs. What the Genocide Con\u00ad vention does is proclaim that systematic extermination of racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups is not a matter of only internal concern, but that it vio\u00ad lates international law. The convention allows the United Nations to consider cases of genocide, and determine what action is necessary. The United States has for too long blithely ignored the issue of genocide. Evidence that genocide is going on in the 1970's should shake our complacency. I urge the Senate to immediately take up and ratify the Genocide Convention . THE NATION'S LABOR LAWS AND UNION LEADERSHIP Mr. TAFT. Mr. President, prior to the passage of the Wagner Act, it was diffi\u00ad cult for Amarican workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. The Wagner Act was an attempt to give the workingmen and women of the Nation sufficient bargaining power with their employers in order to advance their eco\u00ad nomic well-being. As years passed, how\u00ad ever, it became evident that the Wagner Act contributed to new problems and failed to touch others which Congress attempted to rectify through the passage of Taft-Hartley and Landrum-Griffin. Recently, I have received a summary of public opinion attitudes, as developed by Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton, N.J. This public opinion survey, taken late in 1971, is significant with respect to the attitudes of the general public on our Nation's labor laws and union leader\u00ad ship. Because of the importance of this subject, I ask unanimous consent that the summary be printed in the REcORD. There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: JANUARY 19, 1972. SUMMARY OF LATEST TRENDS IN ATTITUDES ON LABOR UNIONS AND LABOR LAWS A PERSPECTIVE 1971 was a. year in which there was a sig\u00ad nificant shift in the mood of the American public. For the first time since 1958, concern about the state of the economy topped all other \"problems confronting the country,\" including the war in Vietnam. Today, President Nixon has the backing of the majority of the American people for his new economic program. Twice as many among the general public agree with Mr. Nixon as agree with Mr. Meany about recent economic decisions. Concern over high prices and unemploy\u00ad ment undoubtedly colors people's attitudes towards labor unions and labor union leader\u00ad ship. When labor spokesmen criticize Presi\u00ad dent NiXon's economic policies or push for inflationary wage settlements, they jeopar\u00ad dize their position in the eyes of the public at large as well as their influence as spokes\u00ad men for rank and file union members. The public is critical of union leadership on such points as: Meeting their responsib111ties to the public as well a.s to their own members--64 % of the public feel that union leadership is doing only a fair or poor job in this area. In the recent debate over government economic policies, 52% of the public felt that, in op\u00ad posing these policies, union leaders were not truly reflecting the views of their own mem\u00ad bers. Opposition to the President's policies-only 29% say that union leaders were right in op\u00ad posing the President's plans, and a clear majority say they were wrong. Even among union families, there is dis\u00ad enchantment with recent labor leader con\u00ad duct. A minority of union families-29%-be\u00ad lieves that top labor leaders represent the average member when they speak out on the wage freeze and price controls. A scant 13% approve the discourteous treatment accorded the President a.t the AFL--CIO convention in Bal Harbour , Florida.. And a.n impressive 86% of union members say that Mr. Meany was wrong in accepting his 28.6% ($20,000) an\u00ad nual salary increase. ATTITUDES TOWARD UNIONS Concern over inflation (among union mem\u00ad bers as well as the public a.t large) has played a. role 1n undermining confidence in union leadership. Over the past year, the gen\u00ad eral attitude climate for labor unions has de\u00ad teriorated due to strikes, and particularly the threat of major strikes that characterized the year 1971. 20594 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 Some of the main findings in this survey: There is a growing feeling since November, 1970, that strikes and labor trouble have seriously hurt the country as a whole (union members 53% to 61%, public 64% to 68%). A majority of union members as well as the public believe that union demands will cause higher prices (union members 57%, general public 68% ) Criticism of union leadership is on the rise in terms of their not being responsive to the public's interests (union members 53% to 59%, public 60% to 64%). Union members are no less aware than the general public that we are in an inflationary period (union members 95%, public 91 % ) . Increasing awareness exists among a ma\u00ad jority of the public that high wages in this country make it difficult for the U.S. to com\u00ad pete with other countries, both at home and abroad. And a clear majority of union mem\u00ad bers feel the same way today. LEGISLATIVE ISSUES On a number of specific legislative issues, there is solid public support which comes as much, if not more, from union members themselves as from the rest of the public as a whole. These tend to be issues which in\u00ad volve the due democratic process in union affairs. LATEST SURVEY RESULTS DECEMBER, 1971 Favor a law to: Give unions and manage- ment equal rights to communicate with em-ployees __________ ____ Require a secret ballot after 30-day strike ____ Guarantee union mem- bers right to criticize their leaders _________ Allow companies and unions to decide whe\u00b7 ther or not to bargain on things not included in union contracts _____ Require secret ballot in representation elec-tions. _______________ Allow companies and unions to decide whe- ther not to engage in. c~alition-type bar- gammg _______ -------Total Union Points public members difference (percent) (percent) 78 89 +11 77 81 +4 74 85 +11 67 73 -Hi 65 71 +6 56 63 +7 On certain other more technical issues, such as common situs picketing, jurisdic\u00ad tional disputes, and so forth, the public's and union members' support is somewhat lower and the gap between union mem\u00ad bers and the public tends to be smaller. This study has been updated regularly since 1966. And there have been signifi\u00ad cant gains in support for specific labor reforms among the public, and in some cases, among union members as well. For example: [In percent) Total public Union members Latest Latest Favor a law to- 1966 survey 1966 survey Guarantee union members' right to criticize their leaders ________________ 64 74 72 85 Require a secret ballot in representation elections. 57 65 77 71 Permit management to discipline employees who commit violence in connection with a labor dispute ___________ 52 62 58 58 Forbid strikes caused by 51 union rivalry ___________ 44 37 52 Most of these gains were recorded in years prior to 1971. The results for this year would suggest that support for legislative changes has begun to stabilize, but at relatively high levels. The main changes since the 1970 survey are those dealing with the general climate for labor (reported on page 2). The findings in this survey indicate that the impact of 25 million new young voters wm not significantly affect the drive for labor law reform. On most questions posed, the views of 18 to 24 year olds do not differ widely from those of the rest of the public. In sum, the level of support for labor law reform has been maintained, and in some cases, significantly increased. Of interest: There has been a small drop, on the borderline of statistical significance, in the proportion of the public which be\u00ad lieves that we are now in a period of infla\u00ad tion. At the time interviewing for the current survey was done, Phase II controls had been in effect for some weeks. While it is too early to say with any assurance, it is quite possible that this drop may reflect a feeling on the part of the public that the wage\u00ad price program can achieve the desired result of putting brakes on the inflationary process. A CITIZEN'S VIEW OF VIETNAM Mr. TUNNEY. Mr. President, one of my constituents, Mr. David Lippman, has forwarded to my attention a per\u00ad suasive and compelling letter written by Mrs. Ruth Henning to the Los Angeles Times. I am pleased to call Mr. Lippman's letter to me and Mrs. Henney's letter to the Times to the attention of the Senate and ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: MONDAY, MAY 22, 1972. Senator JOHN TuNNEY, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.O. DEAR SENATOR TuNNEY! I've enclosed a Beautiful letter by Ruth Henning, Taluca Lake, printed in the Los Angeles Times May 20, 1972. Ruth Henning's letter should be read to the Senate and placed in the Congressional record. I take my Hat off to Ruth. Keep up the good work John. Sincerely yours DAVID LIPPMAN. LETTERS TO THE TIMEs-\"PERSONAL RE\u00ad SPONSES\" TO THE BLOCKADE DECISION (By Ruth Henning) I read your editorial pages every day and it has always seemed to me that the different opinions expressed are more or less in bal\u00ad ance. I have been encouraged that you have spoken out against the war and pray you will continue to do so. When I read the article (May 12) by Emerson D. Moran and the prominence you gave it, I felt inspired to give you my re\u00ad sponse to the President's action, which rep\u00ad resents a.n opposing view. I am a wife and mother with three grown children and a recently acquired college education-san Fernando Valley State, 1968. This is my first letter to The Times. After watching the President on television, I felt sick, frightened and angry. I have waited to write this because I did not want to strike out while under the influence of such intense emotions. Now, a week later, I am st111 filled with fear, anger and revulsion. I neither approve nor support this decision, and I am frankly amazed at the number of Americans who do. It's too bad the President didn't make his cease-fire-total-withdrawal offer long ago when it might have been believed and ac\u00ad cepted. I do not in any way support the Hanoi government, but in all honesty, I can\u00ad not blame them for being super-cautious about any \"carrot\" dangled in front of them by our government whose past actions have included saturation bombing, antipersonnel weapons, napalm, defoliation, systematic de\u00ad struction of their country and its popula\u00ad tion, and stubborn support for the unpopu\u00ad lar, repressive Thieu regime. It seemed obvious to me, an ordinary citi\u00ad zen, that Vietnamization was only another name for continued m111tary action, and that it would never work without our con\u00ad tinued mllita.ry support. It also seems obvi\u00ad ous that our prisoners of war will never be released until we get out of Vietnam. Our present activities are, far from freeing our prisoners, only creating many, many more. \"We can't just turn tau and run like cowards,'' say the superhawks. For a decade, we have been there pouring out our life's blood and the major portion of our tax dol\u00ad lars for reasons which none of us can under\u00ad stand or support, if indeed they were ever valid. The President himself admits we were wrong to start the whole thing, but he now seems frozen in the posture that right or wrong, we must win. Win what? A tiny, war\u00ad devastated country halfway around the world that wm never stay \"won\" without permanent troops of occupation and perma\u00ad nent financial outlay. We would show far more courage to admit our mistake than to go on doggedly, desperately getting in deeper and deeper. \"There will be a. bloodbath if we leave!\" agonize others. In the name of heaven, what is going on there now? If we care so much about the Saigon government, we could get them out along with our own people a.t far less expense. \"We will lose our credibllity if we suffer a. military defeat!\" shout the ardent national\u00ad ists. I submit that we have already lost our crediblllty by our futile, inhumane actions. Does anyone seriously believe the world doubts the strength and power of the United States? Judgment perhaps--but never power. \"We will no longer be Number One!\" cry the Flag-wavers. This is such a. shallow, childish, arrogant argument it hardly seems worth answering. The world knows we are the richest country, that our technology, our industrial capacity, our national will and strength are second to none when our cause is just--that we have the nuclear ca.pacity to destroy the whole world many times over. If our national aim is to triumph over com\u00ad munism, it is my belief that we will succeed only by making ourselves once again the shining example of democracy that works, of democracy that feeds its hungry people, takes care of its sick, provides jobs for its unemployed, cleans up its environment; that makes itself responsive to and responsible for all its people, not just the special interests; a. democracy that encourages and pays for education, medical advances cultural devel\u00ad opment, and the protection ~fits beauty and natural resources; a. democracy that puts the emphasis on the quality of its life rather than the quality of its gross national prod\u00ad uct; a democracy that, from its plenty, ex\u00ad ports help for human needs with no strings attached. We must do what's right for us, and admit with all humility that we may not always know what's right for someone else. If we are true to our own ideals, we will then-and only then-be Number One. This is the kind of supremacy I want for the country I love--for the United States of America! June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20595 THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ATTAINMENT OF PEACE Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I invite the attention of Senators to a speech by United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim explaining the participation of the U.N. in world affairs and particularly its attempts to achieve global peace. Mr. Waldheim spoke before a gather\u00ad ing of American business and labor lead\u00ad ers at the New York Hilton on May 25, 1972, when President Nixon was visiting Moscow to conclude with the Soviet Union several far-reaching agreements. Mr. Waldheim applauds this sort of ac\u00ad commodation among the world powers which would include, of course, the President's trip to the Peoples Republic of China. I ask unanimous consent that Secre\u00ad tary-General Waldheim's speech be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ADDRESS OF SECRETARY-GENERAL KURT WALDHEIM I am glad to be here today among so many distinguished businessmen, labor leaders and other great American personalities brought together by the United States Association for the United Nations. I cannot be grateful enough for the support we receive from the Association here in New York and in many other cities of the United States. I knew al\u00ad ready of its activities when I was a Perma\u00ad nent Representative of my country in New York, but since my appointment as Secre\u00ad tary-General I have had many more oc\u00ad casions to judge its numerous and valuable contributions to our work. I wish to thank you all for having come here tonight, thus showing your interest in what the United Nations is trying to do. There have been rather considerable changes in the world scene during the last two years. Several hopes which had been ex\u00ad pressed in the United Nations have been ful\u00ad filled. One hope was that the heads of state of the Great Powers, including the People's Republic of China, would meet from time to time to end their confrontations and divi\u00ad sions and begin bullding together a peaceful and better world. Well, the President of your country has visited China and at this very moment he is in Moscow. In all human affairs, to speak to each other is the first simple but essential step to better understanding, co-operation and ultimately friendship. A fundamental change has thus intervened in world affairs. Cold shoulders have been replaced by face\u00ad to-face meetings of men who bear great re\u00ad sponsib111tles towards humanity in the name of their powerful countries. The People's Republic of China, the most populous country on earth, in the absence of which the United Nations lacked realism is now occupying its seat in the world orga~ nization and in the Specialized Agencies. An\u00ad other important event has taken place a few days ago; the German treaties were ratified, opening a new phase of East-West relations in Europe. Some may like or dislike these develop\u00ad ments, but a Secretary-General of the United Nations can only like them because they mean progress towards peace and accommo\u00ad dation amongst the Great Powers. For any\u00ad one to walt and hope that one of these powers would disappear or collapse would be tantamount to hoping for world war. There is no other choice. The equilibrium of atomic terror means also equilibrium of an under\u00ad standing and co-operation between the ten\u00ad ants of power. Two years ago, I had just finishing writing a book on Austria's foreign policy in which I had concluded that it could be taken as axiomatic that the big powers did not want war and that a period of detente had been initiated by President Eisenhower and Pre\u00ad mier Krushchev. Austria was the first bene\u00ad ficiary of this change: It regained its inde\u00ad pendence and was free of Four-Power occu\u00ad pation. There have been several severe crises and strains in East-West relations since then, but none of them, neither the U-2 incident nor the Cuban Missile Crisis, interrupted the process of detente. There have been two fur\u00ad ther serious crises recently: Bangladesh and the escalation in Viet-Nam, but again none of them interrupted the trend. We must therefore be aware of a deep current of change in world political relations. To the men fighting and to the people suf\u00ad fering in Viet-Nam, North or South, Viet\u00ad namese or foreign, this is of course no con\u00ad solation. Death obliterates for them any hope or any vision about a future humanity at peace. The fact that there has been no world war for twenty-seven years in the most populous and more rapidly changing human society the world has ever seen can be no damper on our impatience and concern with bleeding and unsolved conflicts. While wel\u00ad coming the smiles we must also eliminate the tears. My readiness and efforts regarding Viet\u00ad Nam are known to you through the news media. They reflect not only my own personal human concern but also the fact that the community of nations cannot much longer stand by and wait for the possible but un\u00ad certain end of that conflict as a result of ef\u00ad forts among the parties concerned. The Paris negotiations have now lasted for four years and the situation today is not better than it was at that time. The bloodshed in Viet-Nam does great harm to the United Nations in the eyes of the public which is asking itself: \"Why is the United Nations not seized with the prob\u00ad lem? Why is the United Nations not doing something about it?\" The United Nations has perhaps not per\u00ad formed miracles, but each conflict brought before it has been solved or has, at least, been stopped. However regrettable protracted unsolved conflicts like Cyprus and the Middle East may be, an armistice is definitely better than an active conflict. I have placed my concern and views before the Security Coun\u00ad cil in a memorandum to its President. It is my duty to do so in the interest of peace. I have also offered my good offices in order to be helpful in finding a solution to this conflict but it is also evident that we can succeed only if we have the co-operation of the par\u00ad ties concerned. The community of nations must aim at re\u00ad moving urgently once and for all the various sources of bleeding and irritation which poison international relations from Cyprus to Korea, passing through the Middle East and South-East Asia. During World War II, at Teheran and Yalta, the leaders of the Allied Powers were able to meet, to talk to each other, to review their problems and to come to accommodations and agree\u00ad ments. Why can we not try to do the same today on the whole string of unsettled prob\u00ad lems which divide and retard us? Does it require a new holocaust to do the simple things which any man in the street in any country of the world would recom\u00ad mend to be done: to meet among all con\u00ad cerned, to negotiate, to accommodate and to give, at long last, to the tired inhabitants of this planet lasting peace? The benefits would be enormous for all. In this task we need not only the good will of the big powers but also that of the medium and smaller powers involved. They too must bring their contribution to the common objective of peace and understanding. We had no United Nations at the time of Theran and Yalta. Well, we have it now. The United Nations would therefore be the obvious meeting place for such an effort. I hope that with the ratification of the German treaties we will soon see both Ger\u00ad manys represented at the United Nations, bringing the world organization close to universality. I urge that this world organization created for peace and global needs be used, supported and strengthened. We know the objectives: They are inscribed in the Charter. We have the instrument which is now almost uni\u00ad versal and in which the big powers have been given big privileges. In our highly com\u00ad plex and interdependent world, multllateral co-operation is an absolute must. The bllllons of people deprived of atomic power, of satellites and of scientific supe\u00ad riority have also a right on this planet: The right to live in peace, to strive towards their progress and to build together an orderly and peaceful world. Lest we create the bonds of solidarity today among all countries there will be other big powers tomorrow pursuing the same obsolete dreams of today. We hear nowadays several lists of big powers; two, three, four or five. Never does one hear men\u00ad tioned in such lists the name of the United Nations. This is wrong and short-sighted, for by disregarding and underestimating the world organization, one belittles the many poor of this world who have also a nation\u00ad hood, a pride, a value and a culture. One de\u00ad prives the community of nations of the strength, were it only the moral strength, which resides in their union. It is high time that in our deeply interdependent world, we discover the simple laws and immense bene\u00ad fits of unity. We must give its collective in\u00ad struments the first place it deserves. The process of accommodation among the big powers and the acceptance of the idea that we might be able after all to live to\u00ad gether in peace and friendship on the same planet must be accompanied by a greater willingness to learn from each other and to exchange experience. Not everything is bad in one country, one system, one continent, one race or one culture and perfect in an\u00ad other. There is good and bad everywhere. We must strive together to foster what is good and to eradicate what is bad. It was not so difficult to lay down in the Charter our com\u00ad mon objectives of peace, security, non-re\u00ad course to violence, economic progress, social justice, racial equality and the protection of the individual's human rights. We must work more intensely and more speedlly towards them, leaving aside claims of superiority of any sort, be they ideological, national or material. We must be more impatient and less com\u00ad placent on the political side. Vast new prob\u00ad lems are in the making or are already amidst us, from which no nation will be immune or able to escape, whatever its wealth, power or size may be. The names of these new prob\u00ad lems are: the population explosion, the en\u00ad dangered environment, the consumption and urban explosions. It is not significant that the first agreement signed in Moscow be\u00ad tween the two heads of state should deal with the environment? But, here again, the prob\u00ad lem is world-wide. Our attention is beginning to be diverted from purely national con\u00ad cerns to preoccupations relating to the planet as a whole. There are immense tasks awaiting humanity. They must be tackled in our com\u00ad mon interest. They will provide the employ\u00ad ment needed as a result of diminished arma\u00ad ments and the eradication of bullt-in obso\u00ad lescence and wasteful consumption. You will ask me: \"How adequate for these tasks do you find the instrument of which you are now the Chief executive officer?\" I would not hesitate to answer this: It is an excellent instrument. It is now almost uni\u00ad versal. It provides, together with its special\u00ad ized agencies, international co-operation on 20596 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 practically every subject on earth, from the atom to outer space, from population to the environment, from hunger and health and development to drugs and crime. It consti\u00ad tutes the most potent world observatory and warning system of global events and changes on this planet. Its knowledge and thinking reach well in the future. Some of the finest men and women from all countries, all be\u00ad liefs, all races, all cultures and all systems work for it. It is a unique meeting ground for statesmen of practically all countries on earth during the General Assembly. It has prevented untold confiicts and has paid a thousand times its cost which is less than that of the Fire Department of New York City or the budget of many companies. Of course, like any human institution and perhaps more than any other institution, the United Nations is in need of constant change, correction, improvement, self-criticism, mod\u00ad ernization and streamlining. I will apply my\u00ad self to these tasks with all my strength. There are however three major defeCits with which I have become concerned since my appointment: the reluctance or hesita\u00ad tion of governments to use fully the organi\u00ad zation they have created; the ignorance and lack of understanding of the public and of the mass media regarding its achievements and its built-in limitations; and the finan\u00ad cial obstacles constantly placed in its way and which begin to be frankly intolerable. An organization and its Chief Executive Officer, which are expected to deal with peace, secu\u00ad rity and practically every Ul and global prob\u00ad lem on earth, should be given the peace of solvency and a minimum of financial elbow\u00ad room. We are wasting too much time in try\u00ad ing to meet each month's payroll. This situ\u00ad ation, furthermore, does not help the morale of the people who have assembled from so many countries, including so many from the United States, to work together in the United Nations. To have good workers for peace, development, the environment and so on, nothing is more important than a good moral. May I therefore appeal to you to help me correct these short-comings? There is need for more honest down-to-earth learning about it, and there is need for putting an end to its financial lmpedlmelllts. I have been greatly encouraged in all my talks with heads of government in recent months. All of them place renewed confi\u00ad dence in the United Nations and have prom\u00ad ised me their full support. Every where there ts hope, greMi hope and a large part of it is placed in the United Nations. Ladles and gentlemen, may I repeat what I said recently in the General Assembly and assure you that I wm fight for peace to the utmost of my strength. But I need your help. We, if we all work together, if we all help each other, then we shall achieve what we all want to achieve, peace--peace for us, peace for our children, peace for our genera\u00ad tion and peace for generations to come. OSHA AND SMALL BUSINESS\u00ad OVERWHELMING REDTAPE Mr. MciNTYRE. Mr. President, the flood of Government paperwork forms imposed on the American businessman today is credited by some as their single biggest problem in their constant com\u00ad petitive effort to stay in business. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Regu\u00ad lation of the Small Business Committee, I have undertaken an in depth examina\u00ad tion into this area which I choose to call \"Federal form pollution\"-a burden that costs the Nations businessmen $18 bil\u00ad lion every year. I invite the attention of Senators to a thought-provoking column written by James J. Kilpatrick and published in the Washington Sunday Star of May 11, 1972, citing how small employers are pro\u00ad testing bitterly against another example of federally imposed recordkeeping; namely, that required by the Depart\u00ad ment of Labor under its interpretations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. As Mr. Kilpatrick so aptly puts it, and as our subcommittee is finding more and more of a truism as we delve into the businessman's paperwork burden, \"statistics to the bureaucrat are like cud to the cow.\" Certainly, the intent and purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to protect the American working man and woman is most commendable, but why good laws passed by Congress must become enmeshed by the Federal bu\u00ad reaucracy in hard and irrelevant rules and regulations for the businessman, I just cannot understand. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that Mr. Kilpatrick's column be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: INDUSTRIAI. SAFETY ACT OVERBURDENS EMPLOYERS (By James J. Kilpatrick) Industrial safety is one of those things, polltlcally speaking, that no prudent pol\u00ad Itician can oppose and every prudent pol\u00ad itician must support. It stands in a class with clean air, clean water, pure food, and non-flammable nighties for little girls. Thus, it was, 17 months ago, tha.t the Sen\u00ad ate voted 83-3 and the House 309-60 for the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The act went into effect April 28, 1971. American employers and employees now have been struggling with its provisions for a little more than a year. It wlll be another year before even tentative conclusions can be drawn on the law's effectiveness. Meanwhlle, the verdict seems to be mixed. There is some reason to believe that the law's impact is llke the little boy's book re\u00ad port on a 600-page volume dealing with penguins: \"This book told me more about penguins than I really wanted to know.\" With its sweeping and detailed regulations, the act of 1970 may have imposed upon industry more safety than really is required. One hesitates to venture such a judgment. The figures (excluding minlng casualties, which are compiled separately and are cov\u00ad ered by another law) offer a sobering picture of conditions in need of correction: In 1970, some 14,5DO p&-sons died and 2.2 million suf\u00ad fered disabling injuries in industrial ac\u00ad cidents. An estimated 250 milUon man-days of work were lost. Beyond dispute, many employers have been negligent, and many workers have been careless. Granted all that, an impression is growing that the 1970 act is developing, just as its critics have protested all along, into a law\u00ad yer's dream and an engineer's nightmare. In their eager-beaver zeal to make an im\u00ad pressive splash, safety inspectors from the Department of Labor have made more than 22,000 inspections in their first nine months of enforcement. They have recommended penalties in a startling 40 percent of their investigations--penalties adding up to near\u00ad ly $1.5 mlllion in fines. If the penalties were imposed only for serious infractions of safety rules, employer protests would have a hollow ring. But in thousands of instances, it appears, elaborate citations are drawn up for the most trivial offenses: An electric extension cord is not precisely secure, a hardhat 1s not precisely the approved weight, a toilet seat is not exactly so many inches off the floor, an ap\u00ad propriate receptacle has not been provided for used paper cups at the water container. Employers complain that the system leaves them virtually at the mercy of two groups-\u00ad their own workers, and the Labor Depart\u00ad ment inspectors. Under the law, the burden of maintaining safe conditions falls entirely upon management; if an inspector finds a laborer bare-headed, when he should be wearing a hardhat, the employer is penal\u00ad ized--even though he may have pleaded re\u00ad peatedly with his workers to observe the rule. Small employers are protesting bitterly, with apparent justice, at the heavy burden of record-keeping demanded by the act. statistics to the bureaucrat are llke cud to the cow. It is understandable that the Department of Labor wants to feed its com\u00ad puters A.ll kinds of lovely figures. But the forms are demanding; the records are tedi\u00ad ous; and compliance takes endless time. Admittedly, accidents cost money; but so does safety. Last week the U.S. Chamber of Commerce heard from a manufacturer of earth-moving machines. Between 1969 and 1975, some 350,000 such machines wlll have been built. Under the law, each must carry $2,000 in new roll-over protection. That represents an added cost of $700 million which must be recaptured somehow. Employers undeniably have an obligation to provide safe and sanitary conditions for their workers. Who could quarrel with that? But some noise, and some dust, and some hazards are inescapably part of the world of manufacturing and building. If the admin\u00ad istrators of the act get excessively fl.nlcky, they will succeed only in driving costs up, and cooperation down. CONCERN IN ACTION Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, in this day of worldwide environmental con\u00ad cern, I think most of us realize that it will take a concentrated dedication on all our parts if we are to achieve our goal of preserving and protecting our environ\u00ad mental quality. But the true test of our concern lies in the decisive question \"What am I willing to do?\" Oregonians, I believe, are leaders in this field for they are doers, not just talkers. In a recent environmental con\u00ad test conducted by KXL-AM radio in Portland, responses to the question \"What am I doing to improve the en\u00ad vironment?\" exemplify the concern and individual work Oregonians exert in their day-to-day lives. Some of the entries were in the form of letters, others were poems and essays, and all were construc\u00ad tive. The credit for this timely and mean\u00ad ingful contest goes to the staff on KXL radio. The staff thought up the idea of devoting an entire month of public af\u00ad fairs programing in March, and in April put their ideas to work. KXL broadcast 10, 60-second contest promotion announcements per day be\u00ad ginning April 3 and continuing through April 29, for a total of 270 announce\u00ad ments. The announcements ranged from noise pollution to solid waste disposal and covered all phases of pollution prob\u00ad lems. Mr. President, because of the impor\u00ad tance of this subject to each of us, I ask tmanimous consent that four of the top entries submitted to KXL radio in the June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20597 environmental contest be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the entries were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS CONTEST, KXL RADIO, PORTLAND, OREG. (By Mrs. Dorothy M. Carl) Heredity determines the color of our eyes but environment lights them up and, in the area of environmental improvement, we can no longer go on just being a good egg-we must hatch or go rotten. This game of Ecology starts at home plate and we are all players-no spectators. Litter is our grossest national product-let's start a clean-up epidemic. If we improve one other person's habits by being a good example, we have improved 2 people! Don't spell it \"freeDUMB\"-polluting habits shackle even the free. In a land where we can say anything we think (and if we can't think, we can say it anyway), fight noise pollution-if the mind goes blank, turn off the sound. Buy only returnable or recyclable contain\u00ad ers-and return or recycle them. Share mag\u00ad azines and papers. Bury or compost all clip\u00ad pings, grass, twigs and \"soft\" garbage. In\u00ad stead of burning leaves, write poetry about the glories of autumn-and then bury them both! Learn to gamble with a spade and some seeds, enlisting the aid of friendly insects and birds instead of sprays-and planting no more than your wife can weed. Dig the dandelions-before they blow their tops. Ride a bus--or walk-wherever possible. Quit smoking-and refrain from telling others how you did it. Stamp out those tiring smile buttons\u00ad substitute the real thing. Help an unwed mother-take one of her kittens-and have it neutered. Register and always vote, carefully study\u00ad ing candidates and their attitudes-aware that friends of environment are people whose feelings run ahead of their thinking. Make friends of our mighty rivers, stapled with bridges and dammed for power-you will not despoil a friend. Enjoy our glorious forests, deserts and open spaces, always leaving them as untouch\u00ad ed as the first day of creation so that they will be there to return-and return-to. Anything we can conceive, we can achieve--the most undeveloped territory in the world is under our scalps, and, I would that we have calluses on our minds but no bunions on our countryside! ENTRY IN ENVmONMENTAL AWARDS CoNTEST (By Marcia Lieurance) A number of years ago I stood on the edge of a cliff on a high mountain top in eastern Oregon listening to the quiet and observing the beauty unfolding in the panorama below. As I contemplated this peaceful time and scene--wondering how it had looked in years past-and wondering how it would look in the future--! asked myself \"What can we do as individuals to reverse some of the trends that threaten our environment today?\" Trends that could destroy such places and scenic wonders that were giving me this pleasurable moment in time. The answer was \"Individual and volun\u00ad tary assessment work\" similar to the assess\u00ad ment work of gold and silver and other min\u00ad ers proving up on their mining claims. Since that day on the mountain top our large family and our many outdoor loving friends do our \"assessment work\" each time we are on an outing whether it be at the ocean, parks, lakes or streams or at a remote and isolated picnic spot on the desert or mountains. We religiously do \"our assessment work\" by not only cleaning up our own areas but by cleaning up everything within our ca\u00ad pabilities that are left behind by careless people. Sometimes we also repair things dam\u00ad aged by vandals, remove rocks from the road, or just about anything that needs immedi\u00b7 ate, individual attention. The small youngsters in our group of out\u00ad door enthusiasts are as eager to help with the pre-cleanup that is prerequisite to our good times as are the teenagers, mom and dad. \"Voluntary assessment work\" has become the small price we pay for the continuing pleasure we receive in our great outdoors. \"SWAP A DmTY WORLD FOR A CLEAN ONE\" (By Milo Moys, president) DEAR Sms: I am president of an 11 month old club called S.W.A.P. which stand for \"Stop Water and Air Pollution.\" We are very well organized and have done a lot in the Portland area. We began our club at our school with three members of the 7th grade and now have 18 members and operate with\u00ad out parental supervision except for advice here and there. We have cleaned up rood\u00ad sides, distrilJuted Solv material, collected ma\u00ad terial from all over the world to compile into our own material to pass out to the public. We have taken surveys, and are now build\u00ad ing a recycling center in the Hillsboro area for glass and cans. In the next 2 months we hope to begin water test on the WUlamette and Tualitan Rivers.

Mr. President, through\u00ad out the course of history, mankind has been confronted by many dangers and threats to its existence; capricious weather that destroys crops, floods that erase villages, fires that rage through forest and farm, disease and pestilence that sweep before them the weak and the strong alike. But of the enemies of mankind, none seem so wanton as the enemy among us, the terrorists and mur\u00ad derers who stalk the innocent and prey upon nnwitting bystanders. The most re\u00ad cent example of insane terrorism at Lod Airport in Israel on May 30, 1972 con\u00ad vincingly demonstrated the depths of depravity to which these heinous mem\u00ad bers of the human family have reached. In on~ furious instance of savagery, three terrorists created an eternity of havoc and destruction, an eternity of injury and pain, an eternity of maimed and crippled bodies and minds, an eternity of death for 24 pilgrims and travelers who through chance were poised before the weapons of madness. The incident at Lod assumed what to\u00ad day's com.m.entators describe as \"inter\u00ad national repercussions.\" Air France flight 132 originated in Paris, stopped in Rome, and flew on to Israel with its passengers from Europe, Israel, Puerto Rico, and Japan. One of the terrorist organizations headquartered in Beirut took pleasure in announcing its sponsorship and support fOT the attack. Radio broadcasts origi\u00ad nating in. Cairo, Damascus, and Bagdad, represen tmg the Palestine guenilla groups but with the apparent support of the Arab governments, applauded the ac\u00ad tions of the three gunmen with words such as \"daring,\" \"heroic,\" and \"thrill\u00ad ing.'' 20598 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 What can be \"thrilling'' about a sur\u00ad prise attack on innocent people in a crowded airport? What is \"daring\" about using machine guns and hand grenades against unprotected and unsuspecting religious pilgrims on a spiritual journey of faith? Did these \"heroes\" expect im\u00ad mediate transportation to some diaboli\u00ad cal Valhalla fOT murders in the name of a dubious political cause? Can these means, the callous murder of innocents, in any way be justified by the ends they are intended to serve? I would suggest, and I am positive that every sane man, wom\u00ad an, and child will agree with me, that the terrorists cannot be justified, regard\u00ad less of the injustices real and imagined of the past, regardless of the seemingly unreachable solutions to the wide-rang\u00ad ing problems which separate the Arabs and the Israelis, regardless of the causes, phrased in lofty and illogical rhetoric, to which these terrorists pledge their lives. Our world has in recent time been subjected to a new reign of terror. We have seen leaders of nations shot down by unbalanced assassins, and watched neighbors settle their differences with the torch instead of debate. We read of the new horrors of massacres in Africa and the mounting statistics of death in Asia. Police and soldiers patrol the streets in Ireland and Cyprus, and armed terror\u00ad ists kidnap diplomats in Turkey and Latin America. A feeble-mindde few threaten hundreds with bombs and guns on planes and ships for a reward of ransom money. But whether their rea\u00ad sons be political or monetary, the ter\u00ad rorists of the world threaten all. Terror in the Middle East is not a modern innovation. In the long-standing controversy over Palestine, terror tactics have been used by the malcontents and lunatic fringe as their response to a fail\u00ad ure to realize political gains-the mur\u00ad derous tantrums of the unstable. A legacy of 25 years of war, hate, and frustra\u00ad tion is the foundation for the kidnapings, murders, bombings, hijackings, and ar\u00ad sons of recent days. There seems to be no end to the chain of terrorist acts, to the explosions at Hebrew University, the Tel Aviv bus station, the Western Wall, or the apartment building in Haifa. There seems to be no limits to how far afield the terrorists will carry their bombs and guns to threaten and involve a growing circle of peoples and nations-to the Athens office of El AI, the airport in Algiers, Dawson Field in Jordan, and now to Lod Airport in Israel by way of Paris, Rome, Tokyo, and San Juan. For the responsible governments in\u00ad volved in the Arab-Israel dispute, the prospect of hijackers and kidnapers presents a serious and perplexing prob\u00ad lem. The State of Israel instituted rigid and effective controls over its planes and airports, but Israel's efforts are negated by the laxity and apathy of other nations and airlines. The Govern\u00ad ment of Jordan has condemned terror tactics but was unable to act against the terrorists in September 1970 when hun\u00ad dreds of passengers and crewmembers were held at gunpoint at Dawson Field. The Lebanese Government has tried to control the movements of the terrorists along the Isreal border, but while there has been some success, the area remains a staging ground for attacks against Is\u00ad rael. After the massacre of May 30, lead\u00ad ers of Lebanon and Jordan again issued statements condemning terrorism and denouncing the actions of the three mur\u00ad ders at Lod Airport. But are the state\u00ad ments enough? Does the condemnation by a Government leader constitute an effective brake on the actions of the ter\u00ad rorist 0rganizations which are permitted to operate within the territories of Jor\u00ad dan and Lebanon? It seems to me that public statements are not enough, even though well intended and inspired by deep conviction. More must be done to stop the kidnapers, hijackers, and killers. There are several alternatives open to the United States. We could sever diplo\u00ad matic relations with those nations which encourage or harbor terrorists and for\u00ad bid our citizens to travel to those coun\u00ad tries or to use their airlines. We could ask for voluntary boycotts against states where the hijackers operate freely. We could seek stronger international controls over preventive surveillance of pas\u00ad sengers and luggage. The course of action I propose combines features of each of these approaches and has the added ad\u00ad vantage of providing an incentive for all the governments involved to insure that corrective measures are taken against international criminals. Nations which harbor terrorists, or which do not comply with acceptable standards of preventive surveillance, or which contribute to the terrorists' cause by allowing propaganda dissemination, recruiting, training, or headquartering within their boundaries, or which encourage other acts of violence by either applauding terrorist exploits or by not condemning them, should be denied the right of access to the world's international air facilities and should be denied service by the world's interna\u00ad tional airlines. An international boycott of airlines and airports, maintained through exist\u00ad ing international organizations, such as the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations, would deny to na\u00ad tions friendly to the terrorists the rev\u00ad enue from tourism and international air commerce. This action would produce an international expression of con\u00ad demnation of the permissive govern\u00ad ments, would encourage other govern\u00ad ments and airlines to tighten their own security measures in order to avoid the boycott, and would inconvenience the nationals of boycotted nations to the ex\u00ad tent that the people would demand more stringent controls over terrorists in order to relieve the boycott. Some strong action of this nature is imperative. The lives of innocent people are more than ever at stake. PROBLEMS OF WOMEN OBTAINING CREDIT Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, the Na\u00ad tional Commission on Consumer Finance has recently been holding hearings on the problems women have in obtaining or maintaining credit ratings when their marital status changes. One of the more interesting testimonies presented was that of Jorie Lueloff Friedman, of Chicago, on the credit problems she had when she got mar\u00ad ried to Richard Friedman, regional di\u00ad rector of HEW in Chicago. I think her testimony does point up biases in credit systems against women. I ask unanimous consent that her testi\u00ad mony before the National Commission on Consumer Finance be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the testi\u00ad mony was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: TESTIMONY OF JORIE LUELOFF FRIEDMAN My name is Jorie Luelofi Friedman and I'm here to speak as an individual and not as a representati ve of any group or organiza\u00ad tion. I would like to draw your attention to a situation you may be unaware of, just as I was until I had to contend with it personally. The problem is this: Many stores require women with established credit to reapply for credit in their husband 's name when they get married. This seems to be done as a mat\u00ad ter of course even when there is no change in the women's financial status. The impli\u00ad cation is that a woman has suddenly become a second class citizen or an irresponsible child who can't be trusted to pay her own bills--just because she got married. This is what happened to me. I've supported myself for the past nine years-first as a writer for the Associated Press and, currently, as a newscaster for NBC News in Chicago. I've had charge accounts at most major Chicago stores for more than six years. I've always paid my bills on time and I never had a credit problem-until I got married. Shortly after my marriage I wrote all the stores where I had charge accounts and re\u00ad quested new credit cards with my new name and address. That's all that had changed\u00ad my name and address. Otherwise, I main\u00ad tained the same status--the same job, the same salary, and, presumably the same credit rating. The response of stores was swift. One store closed my account immediately. All of them sent me application forms to open a new account-forms that asked for my hus\u00ad band's name, my husband's bank, my hus\u00ad band's employer. There was no longer any interest in me, my job, my bank, or my abil\u00ad ity to pay my own bills. I called some of the stores and asked why I had to open a new account. Without ex\u00ad ception, they informed me that under Illinois law, my husband-not I-was now respon\u00ad sible for my bllls. According to the Consumer Fraud Division of the Illinois Attorney Gen\u00ad eral's Office, this simply isn't true. Further\u00ad more, they report that under Illinois law the wife alone is responsible for her debts, r.nd husband and wife are equally responsible for family expenses. Nevertheless, in the interest of expediency, I dutifully filled out the credit application forms, listing my husband's employer and bank. The net result of all this activity is that my husband, who will probably never set foot inside a women's clothing store, now has charge accounts at most of the major women's stores in Chicago. The problems with the stores were only a shadow of the trials that lay ahead with one of the major credit card organizations. I've held one of their credit cards for four years without any problems. When we married, I recomm ended that my husband get one of their cards. He applied for his own account\u00ad and eventually we each had our own credit card. But guess who got my bills! Not me\u00ad but my husband _! For four months he 'paid his part of the bill, and with his check each month, he enclosed a note explaining that I-his wife-had paid fifteen dollars for the June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20599 privilege of my own account and preferred to pay my own bllls. We received no reply from the company, and they persisted in charging my husband for my bills. The whole thing came to a head one night two months ago when my husband was here in Washing\u00ad ton on business. He returned to his hotel to find he'd been locked out of his room. The reason? Well, the hotel had called the credit organization and been informed that he had not paid his current bill and, therefore, was a bad credit risk. Being somewhat irritated by the incident, my husband got in touch with the company's credit manager in New York who investigated, apologized profusely and admitted the whole mess was their fault. So finally, after dozens of calls and letters I was permitted to pay my own bills. Now my account is finally in workable condition. But to this day the company persists in send\u00ad ing my husband notices that his account is \"dangerously overdue\" because he hasn't paid them the money I already paid them. We've been married and consequently plagued by credit problems for a year. Out of that whole year one relatively small in\u00ad cident perhaps illustrates the problem best. When we got married, my husband had just lost the 1971 Chicago mayoral election and, consequently, was between jobs. At that time we applied for a charge account at one of the world's largest department stores. On the form it asked for the husband's employer. I told the credit clerk that my husband didn't have an employer at the moment, and I offered to supply the name of my company and my bank. \"No,\" she said. \"We don't care about the women-just the men.\" She cer\u00ad tainly summed it up. In the eyes of a credit department, it seems, women cease to exist-\u00ad and become non-persons-when they get married. And so, a woman who has proved herself responsible by paying her own bills for years is suddenly treated like a child who can't be trusted any longer. It's not only unfair and demeaning, but ridiculous and unrea\u00ad sonable that a woman should have to forfeit her economic identity-simply because she changes her name. I would hope that you who can do something about it, would recommend that Congress develop and pass legal protec\u00ad tions to guard against this discriminatory practice-legislation that would prohibit credit card issuers from requiring women to reapply for credit upon marriage, unless there is some reason to believe that their finan\u00ad cial status has deteriorated. UNAUTHORIZED RAIDS ON NORTH VIETNAM ORDERED BY GENERAL LAVELLE Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, the juxtaposition of events and news stories in the press of last night and this morn\u00ad ing suggests a problem which deserves attention of the Senate and of the peo\u00ad ple of the country. A four-star Air Force general, Gen. John D. Lavelle, has acknowledged order\u00ad ing U.S. Air Force units in Southeast Asia to make unauthorized raids against targets in North Vietnam and then re\u00ad porting those raids as \"protective-reac\u00ad tion\" missions. At the time this information comes to light, we have reports from Peking that U.S. air attacks in North Vietnam, but near the Chinese border, are viewed by the Chinese as threats to the security of China. The last time units of the Armed Forces threatened to move near the bor\u00ad der of mainland China, we ended up with a confrontation in Korea with the armed forces of China. I am pleased that the administration has moved so quickly to remove General Lavelle from his post. That action sug\u00ad gests to me that high officials realize the danger implicit in the exercise of military power by overeager or irresponsible officers. At the same time, it is unfortu\u00ad nate that derelictions of duty of this kind must be called to public attention by a letter from a noncommissioned of\u00ad ficer. One is reminded that it was L simi\u00ad lar communication which brought to public attention the massacre at Mylai. These events suggest to me that one of the problems that needs immediate at\u00ad tention is that of command and control in the Armed Forces-ranging from the Commander in Chief down to the ranks of enlisted men. Indeed, command and control should extend in an unbroken chain from Congress, to the President, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the com\u00ad manders in the field. Congress should provide policy guidance, the President should operate within the framework of that policy, and the commanders of the Armed Forces must operate under the guidance of the President. When any part of that link is broken, representative government is threatened. I ask unanimous consent that two articles from the New York Times be printed in the RECORD. In addition, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Mr. Anthony Lewis about the destruction of the town of Phucloe by our air raids be printed in the RECORD. It may be possible that the denial of these raids on civilian targets by our Air Force results from unauthorized air strikes and falsified reporting by those in command. The indiscriminate slaughter of de\u00ad fenseless civilians in Vietnam-both North and South Vietnam-is a dreadful indictment of our country. This purpose\u00ad less conflict should be ended. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: GENERAL TESTIFIES HE MADE 20 RAIDS WITH\u00ad OUT ORDERS (By Seymour M. Hersh) WASHINGTON, June 12.-Gen. John D. La\u00ad velle acknowledged today that he was dis\u00ad missed in March as commander of Air Force units in Southeast Asia after ordering his planes to make \"in the neighborhood\" of 20 unauthorized raids on military targets in North Vietnam and reporting them as \"pro\u00ad tective-reaction\" missions. \"In certain instances,\" the general said at a House of Representatives committee hear\u00ad ing, \"I made interpretations that were prob\u00ad ably beyond the literal intention of the rules.\" But General Lavelle, the only four-star general in modern United States military his\u00ad tory to be demoted upon retirement, also in\u00ad sisted that his superior officers in the chain of command had been kept fully informed of his activities. FOUR HOURS OF TESTIMONY The reason for General Lavelle's dismissal was disclosed in The New York Times yester\u00ad day. General Lavelle and the officer who dis\u00ad missed him-Gen. John D. Ryan, the Air Force Chief of Staff-testified for two hours this morning before a House Armed Services investigating subcommittee headed by Rep-resentative F. Edward Hebert, Democrat of Louisiana. The two generals returned in the after\u00ad noon for two more hours of testimony but this time behind closed doors. A subcommit\u00ad tee member said later that part of the secret session was devoted to tracing the extent of knowledge about the unauthorized raids at the highest American headquarters in Sai\u00ad gon, the Military Assistance Command, Viet\u00ad nam, headed by Gen. Creighton W. AbraiUS. REPORTS VVERE ACCURATE Asked about this during the morning's open session, General Lavelle said: \"I had a lot of superiors, and I'm not saying that they all knew-by any stretch of the imag\u00ad ination.\" He added, however, that he had reported the raids to the Saigon headquarters and that \"the reports were accurate.\" \"I think General Abrams knew what I was doing,\" General Lavelle said in response to questions. \"But I'm positive that General Abrams had no idea what the reporting re\u00ad quirements were. He never worried about or sat down and debated our rules of engage\u00ad ment before we did it.\" General Lavelle testified that he ordered the raids, aimed at targets in the southern\u00ad most areas of North Vietnam, between Nov. 8, 1971, and March 8 of this year. He took over as com.IIlander of the Seventh Air Force in July, 1971. The targets, he sa1d, included \"airfields, radar sites, missile sices, missiles on trans\u00ad porters, equipment with the missiles and heavy guns.\" The strikes were 'very success\u00ad ful,\" he added. CITES ENEMY BUILD-UP The general said that he had authorized the attacks after failing to get authority to begin attacking what he said was a substan\u00ad tial build-up of North Vietnamese equipment such as tanks, aircraft and oil depots in an area 11 to 15 miles north of the demilitarized zone, which straddles the border between South Vietnam and North Vietnam. The North Vietnamese offensive began late in March with an all-out assault across the eastern half of the DMZ at that point. In April President Nixon authorized the current bombing in North Vietnam. General Ryan, in his testimony, said that he had removed General Lavelle from his command after an investigation-prompted by a letter from an Air Force sergeant-\u00ad showed that \"some missions had not been flown in accordance with the rules of en\u00ad gagement and there were irregularities in the operational reports.\" THREE FALSIFIED REPORTS General Ryan said the offi.cial Air Force in\u00ad vestigation had concluded that there were 28 violations of the rules of engagement in\u00ad volving unauthorized strikes by 147 aircraft. In Air Force parlance, a mission can involve one or many individual attacks by aircraft. The Air Force Chief of Staff also reported, under questioning, that three falsified after\u00ad action reports had been uncovered by the in\u00ad vestigating team. The inquiry was completed on March 23, General Ryan testified, and General Lavelle was quickly ordered back to Washington. After being offered a chance to stay in the Air Force as a two-star general, General Lavelle retired. \"It was determined by my inspector gen\u00ad eral's team,\" General Ryan said, \"that the impetus behind filing false statements came from General Lavelle.\" QUESTIONED BY PIKE General Lavelle was questioned closely by Representative otis G. Pike, Democrat of Long Island, whose protests of what he termed a \"cover-up\" of the incident led to to\u00ad day's open hearings. Regarding the false statements, the General acknowledged that \"I told my staff that we could not report \"no enemy reaction\" in the official statements filed by the pilots after the unauthorized missions. 20600 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 In other words, the reports had to indicate that the assaults were made in response to enemy activities. Under the rules at the time, United States warplanes could respond to en\u00ad emy artillery or missile fire and could even attack a missile site after the enemy's radar \"locked on\" a plane, indicating that a rocket would be fired. General Ryan told the Congressmen that no disciplinary action had been taken against either the pilots or their immediate superiors for the falsification of records, most of which are classified. General Lavelle said that he had taken full responsibillty for the false reports. \"I'm the Commander and the buck stops here,'' he said. He added that \"in my opinion, these were low-level wonderful people\" who were filing \"what they thought we wanted.\" The general insisted, however, that he had not known of the falsification until he was informed of them by representatives of the Air Force investigating team. As soon as the falsified documents were shown to him, Gen\u00ad eral Lavelle testified, \"I stopped all of those strikes.\" \"I WOULD DO IT AGAIN\" . It was not made clear during the public testimony how General Lavelle could have or\u00ad dered his subordinates to depict all strikes as \"protective reaction\" and yet still be un\u00ad aware of the resulting falsified documents. At one point, the officer, now officially retired as a three-star general pending Senate confir\u00ad mation, said: \"If I had to do it over again, I would do it again, but look into the report\u00ad ing system first.\" He added that he didn't \"think it was very smart\" for his subordinates to fake combat reports, \"but that's how it happened.\" \"I be\u00ad lieve somebody, someplace got overeager,\" he said. After the official Air Force investigation and the resulting order \u00b7to stop all unauthor\u00ad ized attacks, General Lavelle testified, \"I as\u00ad signed three men to find out how we could continue doing what we were doing but re\u00ad port it accurately.\" The general said he con\u00ad cluded after the study that we were \"un\u00ad able to do so.\" CHINA CALLS RAIDS THREAT TO BoRDER PEKING, June 12.-China condemned American bombing o'f North Vietnam today and for the first time since the intensifloo\u00ad tion of the attacks described them as a threat to her security. A statement issued by the Foreign Min\u00ad istry expressed support for Hanoi and said the raids were acta of aggression against the Vietnamese people and \"grave provoca.tions against the Chinese people.\" The statement was the strongest against United States actions in Vietnam since Pres\u00ad ident Nixon's visit to Peking in February. [In Washington, Administration officials said there were precise limits on United States air operations over North Vietnam in the vicinity of the Chinese border. They looked upon the Chinese statement princi\u00ad pally as politically motivated support for North Vietnam and said they continued to believe that Peking accepted United States assurances of last month that the air strikes were not meant as a threat to Chinese scu\u00ad rity.] American strikes have included attacks against two rail lines running from the Chi\u00ad nese border to Hanoi that have taken United States planes close to the border. The statement was noticeably more terse than one issued on May 11, three days after President Nixon ordered the mining of North Vietnamese ports and air strikes on North Vietnamese supply and communications ilnes. . \u00b7It said that the United-states had \"stead\u00ad ily expanded the sphere --of bombing up to areas close to the Sino-Vietnamese borders, -threatening the security of China:\" \u00b7 \"These frenzied acts of aggression on the part o'f U.S. imperialism,\" it said, \"are new war crimes committed against the Vietnam\u00ad ese people, and at the same time grave provo\u00ad cations against the Chinese people.\" The mention of America's actions in Viet\u00ad nam as a threat to China has been absent from Peking statements since the invita\u00ad tion to President Nixon to visit Peking was announced last July. The statement was similar in tone to de\u00ad nunciations of the United States in the early stages of the Vietnam war. It carried a clear warning to the United States that China was firmly behind North Vietnam, whatever tac\u00ad tics were employed, \"until complete victory is won.\" The statement concluded: \"U.S. imperial\u00ad ism should know that the heroic peoples of Vietnam and the other Indochinese coun\u00ad tries are by no means alone in their struggle.\" THE COST OF PHUCLOC (By Anthony Lewis) LONDON, June 11.--Beveral weeks ago in this space there was a report from the North Vietnamese vlllage of Phucloc. It described the damage done when, as the villagers and North Vietnamese officials said, American planes bombed Phucloc at 2:20 on the morn\u00ad ing of April 16. They said that of the popu\u00ad lation of 611, 63 were killed and 61 injured. The Defense Department in Washing ton was asked to comment, to say how such a nonmilitary place could have been bombed. Phucloc 1s a village of mud huts, a small island in a sea of rice fields, about five miles south of Haiphong. The Pentagon reply, received in due course, was a flat denial that American bombers had attacked Phucloc. A B-52 raid on Haiphong on April16 had been announced shortly after it took place, an official said. But it was against Pentagon policy to bomb populated areas, he said, and there had been no raid on Phucloc. There is an almost Alice-in- Wonderland logic to that Pentagon comment: We do z:ot bomb civilian targets, so we could not have bombed Phucloc. In its blandness it really suggests that there was no bombing, that the whole affair was made up or a mirage. The difficulty is that anyone who actually saw Phucloc after April 16 will believe other\u00ad wise. It would be extremely difficult to fake the bomb craters that I saw there with my own eyes. It would be a remarkable piece of theater to stage the screaming women in the rubble, and the people who spoke of their familles being killed. And others have seen Phucloc. It would be one thing for a. Pentagon of\u00ad ficial to say that no such civilian vlllage is an American bombing target but that a mistake could not be altogether excluded that close to Haiphong. It is another to imply that there was no bombing of Phucloc at all-especially when United States intelligence photographs could well have shown the damage. The Pentagon comment thus unintention\u00ad ally illuminates one grave cost of this war to Americans: the damage to our candor and humanity. It is not only Phucloc, of course. A number of Western correspondents over many years have reported on bomb damage to civilian facilities in North Vietnam, to schools and houses and hospitals. But American official policy is endently to ignore all such reports. to brush them asid3, to deny that mistakes can have occurred. The official announcements continue to speak of B-52's raiding gasoline dumps and bridges and electrical plants, and of ships offshore shelling \"Communist military tar\u00ad gets.\" It ls as if there were no human beings involved at all. But common sense, like the eyewitness \" acc\"ounts, tells us that any iarge\u00ad scale bombing \" or sh-elling hits some uinocent civilians. Why, ther., does the United States Government ignore or deny it? Some of those involved in the policy of heavy bombing and shelling must, uncon\u00ad sciously or otherwise, regard the Vietnamese as untermenschen, as creatures somehow not so human as us. Others, actually facing the truth about the human damage that Ameri\u00ad can bombs and shells and chemicals have done, still think our political objectives are more important. But many Americans, probably most, have simply tuned out. The continuing death and destruction in Vietnam are no longer in theit consciousness. That is why public opinion can be so inert when Seymour Hersh of The New York Times discloses secret findings that another mas\u00ad sacre occurred on the same morning as -.fylai ir. 1968. The official report speaks of \"murder,'' and of \"pretense\" and \"misrepresentation\" in covering it up, but hardly anyone in Wash\u00ad ington-in the military, in Congress or in the press-really seems to care deeply. In a way, concealing the truth or not car\u00ad ing i.s worse than killing women and children at Mylai or bombing them by mistake at Phucloc. Nor does it help to say that the Com\u00ad munists have killed countless innocent peo\u00b7 pie in Vietnam. Americans have to worry about their own souls. RECENT ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT NIXON TO IMPROVE THE CON\u00ad DITIONS OF ELDERLY AMERICANS Mr. BENNET!'. Mr. President, most of the attention in the past few months has been focused on the President's for\u00ad eign policy program, and justifiably so, for President Nixon has brought Amer\u00ad ica's role in the world to a level of un\u00ad questioned leadership in the movement to find a lasting peace. Nevertheless, our attention should not be wholly absorbed by events abroad for the President also made great strides here at home. One of President Nixon's major con\u00ad cerns has been the welfare of 21 million Americans over age 65. The President pledged at the White House Conference on Aging that 1972 will be a year of action on behalf of the aged. This action was begun in his mes\u00ad sage to Congress in March. President Nixon's program for the aged is comprehensive-it contains five major points. First of all, the President has increased the income of elderly Americans: He recognized that a major problem of the aged is their low level of income-three out of every 10 per\u00ad sons 65 or older were living below the poverty level in 1966. However, under the Nixon administration, there has been a 26-percent increase in social security benefits since 1969. Second, President Nixon has recog\u00ad nized that the quality of many nursing homes is substandard, and has endeav\u00ad ored to upgrade the quality of these nursing homes by announcing an eight\u00ad point plan in August 1971. Significant progress has been made since then in carrying out that plan: More State nursing home inspectors are being trained, Federal enforcement has been strengthened, and a coordinated set of guidelines for fire safety and safety standards is being put into effect. The President's third course of action has been to increase the budget of the Administration on Aging to $200 million for 1973, thereby providing homemaker, transportation, nutrition~ and commu\u00ad nity services. June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20601 President Nixon's fourth step is that of significantly expanding opportunities for older Americans to make meaningful contributions to all facets of society. The President has doubled funding for the foster grandparents program, and has tripled it for the retired senior volunteer program. The President will also pro\u00ad pose legislation to broaden the coverage of the Age Discrimination in Employ\u00ad ment Act to include State and local gov\u00ad ernment. This way, as President Nixon has explained- The country retains the benefit of their skills and wisdom; they 1n turn have the feeling of usefulness and pa.rticipation which employment can provide. Finally, Mr. Nixon has organized the executive branch to meet the needs of older Americans. He has formed the Do\u00ad mestic Council cabinet-level Committee, and has appointed a Special Assistant on Aging as well as a Special Consultant on Aging. By instituting these various aids for the aged, President Nixon has clearly shown that he is making good on his campaign promise to generate \"thought\u00ad ful, workable, and effective solutions\" to the problems of the elderly. The Presi\u00ad dent has followed the advice submitted in the report of the Presidential Task Force on the Aging, that we \"share the fruits of a future they helped create with citizens who have worked hard to insure for themselves an old age of dig\u00ad nity, security, and independence.\" FOREIGN TRADE AND INVESTMENT ACT Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, although we have staggered from one trade deficit to another, the current administration would have us believe that the dollar devaluation is a panacea for all our trade ills. In fact, this is another Nixonomic nostrum designed with an eye to quieting the electorate without impinging on the interests of the multinational firms. Not only does this policy leave the un\u00ad derlying problems unresolved, but it ignores the realities of present-day trade practices. An April 19, 1972, article in the Wall Street Journal points out that exporters to the United States are not raising their prices and American ex\u00ad porters are not lowering theirs-pre\u00ad ferring instead to increase profit. Equally disturbing is a Journal of Commerce article detailing the necessity for the Japanese Ministry of Interna\u00ad tional Trade and Industry to intervene directly to encourage a number of export firms to raise their prices. Although it remains to be seen if this move is any\u00ad thing more than trade propaganda, the fact that it had to be made at all belies the Nixon position that devaluation has set our foreign trade and investment house in order. Mr. President, because of their impor\u00ad tant implications for our trading future, I ask unanimous consent that these two articles be printed in the REcORD. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: CXVIII--1298-Part 16 To Avom TRADE FRICTION: JAPAN MovEs To CURB EXPORTS TO UNITED STATES, EUROPE (By A. E. Cullison) TOKYO, April 18.-Japan's Minister of In\u00ad ternational Trade and Industry (MIT!) today in a major move announced plans to begin enforcing regulations probably this month or early in May which would require Japanese manufacturers of tape recorders , electronic desktop computers and both black and white and color television sets to raise prices on exports to American and West European markets or to slash the volume of such ex\u00ad ports. Meanwhile members of the Japan Automo\u00ad bile Manufacturers Association Export Com\u00ad mittee announced their decision in Tokyo to\u00ad day that the committee is working out means for controlling exports in a preventive move to avoid trade friction in American and West European markets. NO COMPLAINTS YET Committee members said so far they had not received any complaints but intended to anticipate such problems and thereby elim\u00ad inate the likelihood that MIT! might en\u00ad force regulations requiring even more strin\u00ad gent voluntary restrictions on the part of the auto industry. Japan's car makers are particularly wor\u00ad ried about British market disruption, for example. Kakuei Tanaka, minister of international trade and industry, promised his ministry would enforce Japan's export-import trans\u00ad actions law to prevent recurring dumping charges against Japanese products in the United States, Britain and European Eco\u00ad nomic Community nations. Although he limited initial price increases and volume curtailments to mainly electronic goods there were indications in MIT! that the ministry also was considering similar measures of a restrictive nature for Japan's automobiles, chemicals, synthetic fibers and industrial ball bearings plus any other prod\u00ad ucts which are threatening to upset orderly marketing abroad. MARKET DISRUPTION MIT! Minister Tanaka admitted Japan cannot afford to face worldwide antidumping charges or to be accused of market disrup\u00ad tion. Wherever MIT! finds Japanese exports increasing too rapidly prices will be increased or export volumes slashed, he said, on a \"vol\u00ad untary\" basis by Japan's manufacturers and trading houses. Japan's orderly marketing effort will be on a goods and region basis and not across the board, however. Officials of MIT! and various industries and major corporations involved are now holding negotiations and already have reached basic agreement on limiting the number of desk top calculator exports and raising the price of color television sets destined for the U.S. market by 16.88 per cent which was the amount the yen was revalued upward last December. Mr. Tanaka said MIT! and industry leaders also have agreed upon increasing prices of tape recorders bound for British and Western European countries. MIT! authorities have been seriously disturbed in recent months by overseas claims that Japanese products were being dumped at profitless prices mere\u00ad ly because Japan's domestic economy is in a 21-month-long recession and export was the only way to relieve pressure on inventories. MIT! authorities admitted privately today that their latest unexpected move was given a final push by reports reaching Tokyo that Britain and the Benelux countries are seek\u00ad ing some sort of parley with Japanese indus\u00ad tries with a view to preventing an increased infiow of Japanese products. There were hints this afternoon that the Finance Minister was testing MIT! opinion on imposition of a special export tax or ex\u00ad port surcharge , but MIT! authorities re\u00ad portedly oppose such moves in favor of new program which would promote imports in\u00ad stead as a way of balancing trade with the U.S. which expected to be $3 billion in Ja\u00ad pan's favor this year. [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 19, 1972] AFTER THE FALL: DESPITE DEVALUED DOLLAR, MANY FmMs Do NOT GAIN ANY TRADE ADVANTAGES Competitive pressures are undermining some of the price advantage that U.S. com\u00ad panies should be winning in international trade as a result of the devaluation of thE\u00b7 dollar. Importers of a variety of goods, ranging from TV sets to soft goods, have been slow to increase their American selling prices to reflect the new currency alignment agreed to in Washington last December. And sellers of some American products overseas have been fudging on the price cuts that should be resulting from the dollar's cheaper worth. That isn't what the world's monetary plan\u00ad ners had in mind when they agreed to reJig\u00ad ger the world's currencies at a meeting at the Smithsonian Institution last Dec. 18. Their theory was clear enough: A cheaper dollar was supposed to make American goods cheap\u00ad er abroad and increase the price of imports in this country. All other things being equal, a Japanese radio that sold for $100 in the U.S. last summer should cost $116.88 now because the yen's worth \"!as raised 16.88% against the dollar. An American-made medical instru\u00ad ment that cost $100 previously should sell in Japan for the yen equivalent of $85.56. U.S. trade specialists reasoned that, within a year or two, such price changes, coupled with other trade agreements , would begin to alter buying patterns in international trade. The higher price tags would discourage im\u00ad ports into America while cheaper quotes would spur sales of American goods in foreign lands. The -u.s., it was hoped, would tli(m start seeing some improvement in its trade account with the rest of the world. That account sank into the red last year, for the first time since 1888; the deficit was $2.05 billion. S0!4E REACT PREDICTABLY Some manufacturers have reacted the way they were supposed to. Prices for imported cars have climbed almost dollar for dollar apace with the new currency rates. A four\u00ad door Toyota Corona was boosted 16.8% in price, almost precisely matching the yen's increased value, to $2,512. Then the repeal of the 7% excise tax on all new cars, both domestic and foreign, dropped the quote back to $2,385. And prices of foreign wines have also risen in line with parity changes, as have quotes for such widely divergent prod\u00ad ucts as leather goods and sheet glass. But for some importers battling to main\u00ad tain market positions in the face of intense competition, price increases are luxuries that have had to be deferred, 1n part or in whole. For instance, Fuji Photo FUm Co., which must sell against the entrenched Eastman Kodak Co., has held prices for fUm un\u00ad changed. Rather than give Kodak the slight\u00ad est price edge, Fuji has elected to bear the full brunt of the yen's increased valuation itself. Honda Motor Co. officials say they have in creased Japanese export prices on motorcycles to reflect the yen's increased valuation. But they lament they haven't been able to raise retail selling prices 1n the U .8. to the same degree. The result, says a company spokes\u00ad man, has been shrinking profit margins at the company's U.S. sales subsidiary and at its American distributors. 20602 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 13, 1972 TV SETS AND BICYCLES Tvshiba International, a unit of Toyko Shibaura Electric Co., says its wholesale prices were bo::>Sted the full 16.88%. But retail prices for its television sets, radios, tape recorders and some other consumer products have gone up only 6% to 7%. A spokesman at Noritake Co., the Japanese chinaware com\u00ad pany, concedes it, too, hasn't been passing along the full revaluation. \"We tried to ab\u00ad sorb part of the increase by increasing sales somewhat and decreasi ng expense::;,\" he ex\u00ad plains. A man at a Japanese bicycle producer says \"so far\" it has raised pr!ces only 7% to 9% (though another Japanese competitor has lifted quotes \"at least 20%\"). Some American textile executives selling against foreign competitors say they haven't witnesed any price changes since revaluation. Meno Schoenback, president of the Fulton Cotton Mills unit of Allied Products Corp., says textiles from Asia aren't carrying higher price tags \"and I'm not sure if they will.\" In some industries, America.n ret9ilers are being billed the full cost of revaluation, but they are picking up at least part of the in\u00ad creased tab. One shoe-company official, for instance, says the wholesale cost of imported footwear has risen 13% to 18%. But, for the most part, he says, \"retailers are absorbing these increases and aren't passing them on to their customers.\" Some retailers with clout have been able to soften the impact of revaluation on them. \"It's a matter of give and take,\" says Wil\u00ad liam Fine, president of Bonwit Teller Co., a subsidiary of Genesco Inc. Gardiner Dut\u00ad ton, executive vice president of Kenton Corp., estimates that 25% of the goods imported by the company's Mark Cross subsidiary \"are selling for less than the revluation because of our negotiations wth the suppliers to get a lower price.\" TOURS AND STEEL In most instances, American concerns are reluctant to disclose publicly how the dollar's cheaper valuation is affecting their selling prices. But American Express took full-page newspaper ads recently to proclaim: \"As the world's largest travel company, American Express has been able to freeze our tour prices.\" The company conceded that \"as a result of devaluation, some costs inevitably will rise.\" But the company pledged that \"American Express will not pass on these increases to the people who buy our tours.\" On industrial products , price comparisons are muddled by long-term contracts, ex\u00ad tended lead times between orders and deliv\u00ad eries and other factors. But here, too, some prices of foreign goods haven't increased as much as the revaluation. In the steel industry, for instance, the foreign price advantage on such high\u00ad volume iteins as sheet products has been cut in half by the dollar's devaluation, to about 10% from 20%. But some analysts contend the price edge for foreign steel might be even slimmer if the impact of revaluation were passed on in full. Chemical pricing varies widely. For some chemicals, \"costs have risen in line with the realignment,\" an industry source relates. Du Pont Co., though, notes that quotes for organic chemicals, mostly dyestuffs, have been largely unaffected by the currency changes. \"Perhaps 10% have changed, but the changes haven't been large in magni\u00ad tltde,\" says a spokesman in Wilmington . From Du Pont's view, \"it appears that ex\u00ad porters from whom we buy (chemicals) --<>r their countries-are absorbing the devalua\u00ad tion impact: we expect future contracts to be affected, though not to a staggering degree.\" WARNING FROM THE TREASURY The Du Pont spokesman didn't elaborate on how foreign countries might be absorb-ing the devaluation impact. Last month, however, Magnavox Co. filed a complaint with the Treasury Department charging that the Japanese government was granting \"substantial export subsidies\" to Japanese makers of TV sets shipped to this country. Among other points, Magnavox said that the J:1panese government was helping its export\u00ad ers by undervaluing the yen and intervening on currency markets. Japanese producers denied the charges. The Treasury has yet to act on the Magna\u00ad vox allegation. But this month it issued a warning to foreign companies that they may be violating U.S. rules unless they adjust their prices to reflect the currency revalu\u00ad ations. Yesterday Japan's Minister of Intern::1.tional Trade and Industry, Kakuei Tanaka, said the Japanese government has obtained \"broad agreement\" from Japanese electronic manu\u00ad facturers to voluntarily restrict exports. He said the companies will either reduce export volume or increase export prices. No date was given to indica -::e when the voluntary export curbs will be imposed. Assistant Treasury Secretary Eugene T. Rossides said that last December 's \"appre\u00ad ciation of foreign currencies in relation to the dollar has effectively increased the ad\u00ad justed home market\" prices of foreign mer\u00ad chandise as expressed in dollars. \"This raises the possibility that some of these home mar\u00ad ket prices Inay now exceed\" the prices at which the goods are sold in the U.S., he said. Unless the companies either reduce their home market prices or lift their export prices to reflect the realignment, the official stated, they may violate U.S. laws that prohibit the sale of foreign merchandise in the U.S. at lower prices than they sell for in home markets. But it's a two-way ocean, and sellers of some U.S. goods are also ignoring the effects of revaluation in other countries , where a cheaper dollar should mean cheaper prices for American-made goods. PPG Industries Inc. says it hasn't altered its export prices for glass. It evidently hopes that a higher dollar price for its products overseas will offset any reduction in export volume. Berkey Photo Inc., which exports the Omega photographic enlarger, says it is hop\u00ad ing to ultimately pass on the dollar's cheaper value in its overseas sales. \"But first,\" a spokesman says, \"we have to put pressure on our foreign agents and importers to make sure they don't pocket the difference.\" SECRETARY PETERSON ON HARTKE-BURKE Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, the Wash\u00ad ington Evening Star of Sunday, May 21, contains an extensive excerpt of a speech that Secretary of Commerce Peter Peterson gave on ''The Foreign Trade and Investment Act of 1972\"-the so-called Hartke-Burke bill. Secretary Peterson makes cogent argu\u00ad ments why this bill would be harmful to the Amertcan economy. It would, accord\u00ad ing to Secretary Peterson, raise prices, eliminate some vital imports needed by American industry, erode competition, lead to retaliation by other countrtes, and cost this country jobs. Secretary Peterson does point out the need for changes in the international economy and in our international eco\u00ad nomic policy--such as more effective ad\u00ad justment assistance-but he definitely opposes this piece of legislation. As Sec\u00ad retary Peterson says, this bill would \"re\u00ad strict our freedom of economic expansion still further,\" and \"would freeze us into a pattern of protection and economic re\u00ad action.\" I agree. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the arti0le be prtnted in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: A BILL THAT WOULD SOAK THE CONSUMER (By Peter G. Peterson) It has often been said that this is the age of \"consumerism ,\" and that in the United States this trend has gone further than in other countries . And it is certainly true that Americans can choose freely, widely, hand\u00ad s::>mely and-! think-jo yfully among an im\u00ad pressive array of consumer goods in virtually all product areas. But an anomalous development is now tak\u00ad ing place--an organized effort to raise our cost of living, to divert our human and in\u00ad dustrial resources from the things we do well and efficiently to the things we do less well and at higher cost, which would raise unem\u00ad ployment and wreak havoc on overall U.S. foreign policy at the same time. I am referring to the \"Foreign Trade and Investment Act of 1972\"--<>therw ise known as the Hartke-Burke bill. What is behind this curious bill that w::mld purport to make us richer by increasin g in\u00ad flation? That would increase unemploym ent in our most efficient industries? That would set us on a course of economic isclationis:n yet anticipate no countermeasures from our customers abroad? That would trigger bitter political conflict with our majcr allies around the world? The Hartke-Burke bill represents a protest vote against imports-what is behind it? The contemporary debate over imports and investments is amply endowed with catch phrases, the most familiar to us being the so-called \"export of jobs\" by U.S. investors\u00ad particularly the larger multinational firms. The U.S. is also said to be receiving a \"flood\" of imports, implying that imports are something bad and the country is in dan\u00ad ger of drowning. What does the bill do? The Hartke-Burke bill proposes that most items imported by the U.S. from foreign countries, be rolled back to the 1965-69 level. They could then increase only in proportion with rising U.S. production. This would mean a cutback of about $10.4 billion from our present level of imports, and more from future levels. Now, many retailers have adopted the slo\u00ad gan, \"Keep the Lid On\" in cooperating with the President's wage-price program. The Hartke-Burke bill would \"slap a lid\" im\u00ad ports at levels reflecting 1960's consumer \"de\u00ad mand and preferences but \"take the lid off\" a. major restraint on inflation. It is difficult to quantify precisely the over\u00ad all price effects of these cutbacks. The De\u00ad partment of Commerce trade staff is trying to do that. We do know, however, that they would be very large. Under the Hartke-Burke proposal, imports of capital goods needed by American manu\u00ad facturers to stay abreast of foreign competi\u00ad tion would be rolled back by 31 percent from 1971 levels. Consumer goods would decline 34 percent, food 15 percent, and automotive vehicles a whopping 56 percent. Of course, certain im\u00ad ported items would be particularly hard hit. Imports of color television sets, for example, would be cut back by 64 percent {$131 mil\u00ad lion) . Imports of new passenger cars would drop by 54 percent ($2.3 billion), and im\u00ad ports of 35 mm stlll cameras by 30 percent ($10 million). Some experts tell me it is probably safe to assume that the bill would raise the U.S. price level by at least $10-$15 billion, and probably much more. Such a development would be tragic, both for our domestic economy and for our inter\u00ad national competitive position. You are all June 13, 197.2 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20603 well aware of the major effort launched by President Nixon last August to bring U.S. in\u00ad flation under control. Phase II has as an in\u00ad terim goal reducing the rate of inflation by 1.5-2 percent, down to 2-3 percent by the end of the year. It is thus highly relevant to note that the Hartke-Burke quotas could raise prices by at least 1.5-2 percent-as much as Phase II will reduce them! In short, such legislation would seriously undermine the anti-inflationary effects of the President's wage-price program. CA~ IMPORTS WOULD FALL SHORT OF DEMAND For example, more than 600,000 Americans currently demonstrating a desire to buy an imported subcompact would be prevented from doing so. Would importers be content to simply sell half as many cars at the same price as before? They would have to lay off workers and cut expenses where they could, but their unit costs would also inevitably rise. Furthermore, they would find an oversupply of customers clamoring for each car allowed in. So they (and of course the manufacturer) could easily raise prices to minimize the reduction in their profits. Finally, U.S. import quotas of this severity would go far toward permitting U.S. manu\u00ad facturers to simply charge much higher prices than their own costs or the marketplace would dictate. Think with me of the effect of quotas which virtually guarantee the domes\u00ad tic producers a fixed share of the market. How many of your suppliers have lowered prices as an offensive marketing weapon to hold on to their market share against for\u00ad eign competition? I would guess a great many. What do you think would happen if that fear, or stimulus, were removed? They would have far less incentive to hold prices down. In addition to lowering the level of im\u00ad ports, the quotas applied according to the bill's formula would freeze the product and country Inix at the average ratios existing from 1965-1969. Think with me how often in your lifetimes demands or tastes have changed, and in turn the quality of foreign sources has changed. For example , consumers have recently shown increasing preference for Japanese cars in relation to German cars. In 1971, four out of every 10 purchasers of foreign cars bought a Toyota or Datsun. Under the pro\u00ad posed quotas, only about half as many new foreign cars would be allowed into the coun\u00ad try and only one in seven of those could be a Japanese car. Those domestic price ri~es I talked about would also substantially erode the internal competitiveness of the U.S. economy. We know that the inflation of the mid and late 1960s had just such an effect. It made our dollar increasingly over-valued in the ex\u00ad change Inarkets, retarded our exports and stimulated imports. It required us to devalue the dollar late last year. The devaluation should improve our trade balance by about $6 to $8 billion over the next few years, according to our own esti\u00ad mates, those of the international economic organizations, and those of leading acadeinic economists. It will thus restore much of our earlier trade surplus. In the process, it should create at least half a million additional jobs for U.S. worker&-precisely the number, in\u00ad cidentally, which the AFL-CIO claims were lost due to the changes in our trade balance in the late 1960s. The recent devaluation, however, has only provided us with an opportunity. We could fritter it away if we fail to maintain the com\u00ad petitive improvement which it provides. I have already outlined how the Ha.rtke-Burke bill would raise our prices, and thus reduce our competitiveness directly. In addition, Hartke-Burke's sweeping im\u00ad port quotas would deny U.S. producers some of the vital imports they nood to remain competitive, or at lee.st raise substantially the costs of those imports . Our textile in\u00ad dustry, for example, buys substantial amounts of European machinery in its drive to improve productivity. Most importantly, however, a rigid regime of import quotas would affect the American competitive spirit. I don't even recall as a former businessman ever going to work thinking how glad I was to have competi\u00ad tors. I suspect none of us really enjoys our competition. And it is certainly easy to dis\u00ad like foreign competition even more. And yet, we all know that competition from abroad has increasingly provided the U.S. with a strong incentive to innovate, in\u00ad troduce new technology and to InaXiinize quality and productivity. There are a number of good illustrations of this tradi tiona! resilience of our system\u00ad when it is challenged. One is shown by the recent experience of U.S. electronic calcula\u00ad tor manufacturers. Increased foreign com\u00ad petition and an eroding market share gave domestic producers a timely indication in the late 1980s that their technology was be\u00ad coining outmoded. On the basis of this imp.:;rt-precipitated \"early warning,\" American manufacturers initiated an in ten ive R&D effort which is now paying sizeable div~dends in terms of in\u00ad creased sales of U.S. cliculator.'> both at hom~ and abroad. And one U.S. manufacturer is close to producir:.g a mini-cJ.lculator for un\u00ad der $100-far under the price of similar Jap\u00ad anese versions. What about the effect of Hartke-Burke on other countries? Can we expe~ others to ac\u00ad quiesce to quotas? Our major trading part\u00ad ners would stand to lose an avera.ge of near\u00ad ly 30 percent of their exp-orts to the U.S. Imports from the Europetan Economic Community would be cut back nearly 25 per- cent. or $1.8 billion. \u00b7 Canada would be hit with a 30 oercent loss in its exports or $3.6 billion-which would cut its entire Gross Na.tiona.l Product by 4 percent! The less developed countries , which literal\u00ad ly depend on exports for their survival, would be dealt a further severe blow to their as\u00ad pirations. And, tragically, those that are the newest of the developing countries (and these are usually those with even greater poverty), would be hit the hardest since their 1965- 1969 imports to the United States would be at lower levels. Suppose the European Community retal\u00ad iated against the U.S. aircraft industry. Sales of most current model U.S. aircraft to Euro\u00ad pean airlines could virtually cease, with an annual loss of export sales of about $400 mil\u00ad lion. Europe could not only supply most of its near-term needs for aircraft from its cur\u00ad rent or planned produotion, but its response to U.S. quotas would also threaten future generations of U.S. aircraft. New projects either would be precluded, as the EEC pro\u00ad duced competitive aircraft, or would have to be priced to yield a break-even point at a much lower level of sales. Economies of scale could not be realized as they have in the past. In turn, increased costs of future aircraft to U.S. airlines would be passed on to the consumer in higher air fares. Everyone would lose. The manu\u00ad facturers would sell fewer airplanes. The air\u00ad lines would pay higher prices for them. The consumer would get higher air fares. And many highly skilled, high paying jobs would be lost in the already troubled aerospace industry. Despite the certainty of retaliation against our exports under the Hartke-Burke quotas, there are some who say \"what of it?\" They suggest that reducing both sides of our trade account by the same amount would provide a net increase in the number of jobs here at home. They assume that the job content of the domestic production which would replace imports is greater than the job content of our exported goods. This assumption is false. Indeed, the reverse is true. When both direct and indirect labor requireme nts are considered-that is, the labor directly o.::cu\u00ad pied in export and import-competing ind'l.ls\u00ad tries, and also the labor required to produce intermed iate goods which support these in\u00ad dustries-it turns out that our exported goods are actually more labor-intensive than our domestically produced goods which C)m\u00ad pete with imports. But foreign trade, like all economic change, does cause real problems for certain individuals. Recognition that open and bal\u00ad anced trade helps the nation as a whole is no solace to the workzr who does his job, or the firm which goes bankrupt, as a result of im\u00ad ports. We must have a clear and effective policy approach to deal with such problems. Our economy must grow rapidly, to achieve full employment and induce rapid rises in prcductivity. We must effectively check in\u00ad flation, to stay competitive both at home and abroad. We must receive fair treatment in inter\u00ad national trade from other countries. We must negotiate better rules and procedure to gov\u00ad ern the internation al monetary and trading systems. NEED FOR AID TO THE VICTIMS In addition, however, we must have an ef\u00ad fective program which will provide assistance to those industries, firms and especially workers, injured by imports. Such an \"ad\u00ad justment assistance\" program was adopted by the Congress in principle in 1962. But it has been ineffective in pra.ctice due to a combination of excessively tight legislative requirements, excessively tight legal inter\u00ad pretations of those requirements-indeed, a failure on all our parts to attract sufficient priority to this very economic but also very human problem. An interagency group is hard at work de\u00ad vising a better adjustment assistance pr:::\u00ad gram. Access to adjustment help must be greatly eased. Assistance must become avail\u00ad able much more quickly to those who need it; \"early warning\" must apply in this c:m\u00ad text as well. It must receive the highest prior\u00ad ity from both the adininistration and the Congress. In a sense, Americans need the stimulus of trade and international competi tion even more than most people. For us, expansion , in\u00ad novation and competition have always been a way of life and we have benefited greatly from our willingness to compete on equal terms with all comers, anywhere in the world. Frederick Jackson Turner, the histo\u00ad rian, wrote that Americans need an cutlet for their energies . He saw the closing of the fron\u00ad tier as a crucial turning point for this so\u00ad ciety which had until the early part of this century given itself wholly to the great task of settling a continent. In many ways we see evidence today of the wisdom of Turner's assessment . Increasingly, the dynamism of our society is giving way to lassitude and a certain purposeless time\u00ad serving which not only harms us economi\u00ad cally, but does great social harm as well. Given this situation, can we sanction a bill which would restrict our froodom of eco-. noinic expansion still further, that would. freeze us into a pattern of protecticn and economic reaction? This is an excerpt from a speech given recently by Secretary Peterson before the convention of the American Retail Federa\u00ad tion here. CUTBACKS BY NIXON ADMINIS\u00ad TRATION IN IDGHWAY FUNDS . APPROPRIATED FOR NEVADA Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, a st:u-\u00ad tling bit of news concerning Nevada's. \u00b7 20604 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 13, 1972 SENATOR SCOTT SUPPORTS EDUCATION highway construction program has prompted me to again point out how un\u00ad authorized budget cutters in the Office of Management and Budget are drasti\u00ad cally altering the intent of Congress. The Governor of Nevada has informed me the State will receive only about 75 percent of the $31.6 million in highway funds authorized for fiscal 1973. This means that although Congress, acting under its constitutional powers, saw fit to provide Nevada with $31.6 million for road construction, the Nixon adminis\u00ad tration, acting under nothing more than gall, decided that $23.4 million was enough. Not only has the OMB drastically cut available funds; it has also dictated methods of allocating them that will mean millions more cannot be used. Un\u00ad der a new quarterly control system, the State would have to carry over funds from quarter to quarter to use them all. Unfortunately, this is tantamount to kissing the money goodbye, because, as the Governor says, OMB is in the habit of confiscating unobligated monthly balances. Although this particular problem af\u00ad fects only Nevada, its implications reach every one of us here and in the House. If the dictates of Congress can be blithely ignored by the self-appointed money managers of this administration, what are we doing here? With the Presi\u00ad dent launching invasions in Cambodia, signing arms agreements in Russia, and altering legislation here at home-all without consulting Congress-! fear we might soon become obsolete. I repeat my call made a few weeks ago for all Senators to support the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. RANDOLPH) and the members of his Public Works Com\u00ad mittee in their efforts to make the pend\u00ad ing Federal-Aid Highway Act inviolate against administration raids. I also ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Governor of Nevada be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the REcORD, as follows: THE STATE OF NEVADA, Carson City, Nev., May 18, 1972. Hon. HOWARD W. CANNON, U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR CANNON: The financing Of our highway program is now reaching a state of chaos. The Nevada State Highway Department recently received an Instructional Memo\u00ad randum (copy attached) from the Federal Highway Administration which indicates that Nevada will receive only $23.4 million of the $31.6 mill1on appropriation made by Congress for fiscal year 1973. With Nevada's present economy, we simply cannot absorb a blow of this magnitude. This is a continuation of the diversion tactics we have experienced over the past several years. I will not justify this tactic by calling it an \"impoundment\" for the funds have not been impounded, but have actually been diverted for other uses which were not the intent of Congress. The reduction in funds is bad enough. To make matters worse, the IM indicates that a. quarterly control will be continued and an additional control by road system will appar\u00ad ently be initiated. Considering the size arid magnitude of current projects, The Depart-ment cannot function under these restric\u00ad tions. Under a. quarterly control by system, the State would only be able to obligate the following amounts: $1.05 million per quarter for the Primary System $0.8 million per quarter or the Secondary System $3.45 million per quarter for the Interstate System. This would force the Department to carry funds over from quarter to quarter. Judging by what has happened in the past, when OMB has confiscated unobligated quarterly balances, I am, frankly, very dubious of attempting to develop any quarterly carry\u00ad over. There are two other points of interest I wish to bring to your attention: 1. At the rate now proposed for the Inter\u00ad state program, we could anticipate comple\u00ad tion of the system in about July, 1985 or 13 years from now. This indicates that, time\u00ad wise, we are now just slightly over half fin\u00ad ished with the Interstate System. 2. In 1956 we received approximately $7 million annually for the ABC system. For these same systems we are now receiving $8.5 million annually. Due to inflation, im\u00ad proved design and safety requirements, re\u00ad location assistance, etc. our purchasing power has been reduced to about 50 percent of its 1956 value. This isn't including the added costs involved in the administration of extra hearings, equal employment opportunity pro\u00ad grams, on-the-job safety requirements, in\u00ad creased planning involvement and so forth. It is my feeling that the time has arrived for Congress to challenge the authority of the Office of Management and Budget to manipulate the Highway Trust Fund to meet their own goals. This agency has apparently assumed the authority to develop their own program within the limits established by Congress. It is this premise that should be challenged, and if necessary, clarified by leg\u00ad islation. I feel that we have now reached a point where we should seriously consider asking Congress to discontinue the collection of Federal revenue taxes that accrue to the Highway Trust Fund. It would seem appro\u00ad priate that we only collect those revenues necessary to complete the Interstate System. This woud allow the States to increase their State tax revenue equal to the Federal re\u00ad duction. This revenue could then be ap\u00ad plied to their own particular problems. Upon completion of the Interstate System, these revenues would also become available for collection and distribution within each in\u00ad dividual State. I do not feel that this would be the best course of action, for I do agree that the national highway system requires !national coordination and involvement. However, with the current control and cutback of funds, there seems to be no other recourse available to get the program flexi\u00ad bility so desperately needed to keep pace with our State's transportation needs. I earnestly request your vigorous support in assuring that the intentions of Congress for the Trust Fund are strictly complied with and to suppress the effective legislative control the OMB has been allowed to exercise in the past several years. In closing, I am sure that you are aware of our feelings regarding the President's proposal for reorganization. Our understand\u00ad ing at the present time is that H.R. 6962 has been reported out to the House. I cannot express too strongly our opposition to this bill and its intended purpose. I also request your active opposition to the entire reorganization proposal. Warmest personal regards. Sincerely, MIKE O'CALLAGHAN, Governor of Nevada. Mr. SCHWEIKER. Mr. President, the future welfare of the Nation depends to a large extent on the education its young people are receiving today. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. ScoTT) has been a strong and consistent sup\u00ad porter of the Federal commitment to education. He has shown a particular concern for students attending nonpublic schools, in light of Supreme Court deci\u00ad sions overturning certain Pennsylvania laws, and has called for the adoption of limited tax credits to allow the continued existence of private education. The Sen\u00ad ator has also urged a continued high level of Federal funding for elemen\u00ad tary, secondary, and higher education programs. I ask unanimous consent to place in the RECORD a statement of Senator ScoTT's efforts to aid education.

ADDRESS BY SENATOR KENNEDY BEFORE KENTUCKY BAR ASSO\u00ad CIATION Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, on May 24, the distinguished Senator from Mas\u00ad sachusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) delivered an address to the annual convention of the Kentucky Bar Association. I ask unani- mous consent that his speech, which ad\u00ad dresses the problem of bringing the North and South together on national issues, be printed in the RECORD at the conclu\u00ad sions of my remarks. His theme, an appeal to unity in our country, is treated with reason and com\u00ad passion. His speech ends with a note of optimism, asserting that we can build the kind of society which we all want. His closing words, I believe, deserve con\u00ad sideration: America was built, Kentucky was built, by people who were poor in everything but hope and human spirit, by people who had a deep and lasting dedication to working for what they knew was right. That's the way it was before, and that's the way it can be again. North and South can move ahead together, if only we have the wisdom and inspiration t{) carry out the goals and dreams we share With all the people. There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ADDRESS OF SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY TO THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE KEN\u00ad TUCKY BAR AsSOCIATION I am pleased and honored to be here with you this evening and to have the oppor\u00ad tunity to address this annual convention of the Kentucky Bar Association. Flying into Louisville this afternoon, see\u00ad ing again the beautiful mountains and the magnificent rolling hills of Kentucky, it is easy to recall the famous lines of the Ken\u00ad tucky Irish poet James Mulligan, as he wrote many decades ago: \"The moonlight falls the softest, In Ken\u00ad come bluegrass . . . landscape is the grandest, And the politics the dainnedest, In Ken\u00ad tucky.\" Coming here tonight, it is also easy to re\u00ad call the dramatic role that the people of Kentucky and their great leaders have played in the history of our nation. Over the years, men of Kentucky and men of Massachusetts have often worked together. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in American history came more than a century and a quarter ago, when Henry Clay of Ken\u00ad tucky and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts stood together on the Senate floor in Wash\u00ad ington, in a noble effort to preserve the Union. Together, they forged the famous Com\u00ad promise of 1850. Together, they stemmed the threatening tide of Civil War for a decade, longer than almost anyone, North or South, had thought humanly possible in that des\u00ad perate period of darkening national crisis in 1850. A century later, when President Kennedy was a member of the Senate, he served on a committee charged with the responsib111ty of selecting the five outstanding Senators in the history of the country. Their first and unanimous choice was Henry Clay of Kentucky, for the vision he had held of a strong and national Union, and for the power and wisdom he had used so well in helping to preserve it. In recent years, the story has been the same. The people of Kentucky have always had distinguished leaders to carry on the proud tradition of your past. You gave the nation one of our outstand\u00ad ing Vice Presidents in Alben Barkley, and one of its outstanding Chief Justices in Fred M. Vinson. In my own years in Congress, there is no Senator for whom I have had higher affec\u00ad tion or respect than John Sherman Cooper. For twenty years, he has served the nation and the people of Kentucky well, and his re\u00ad tirement this year means a heavy loss for all of us in Washington, whatever our state or political affiliation. 20606 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 13, 197.2 In addition, I am proud to serve in Con\u00ad gress with so many ot~er fine Kentucky lead\u00ad ers. Marlow Cook and I have worked to\u00ad gether on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, and we have many common inter\u00ad ests in areas of direct ~oncern to the Ken\u00ad tucky Bar Association and ol;her Bar Associa\u00ad tions throughout the country . The other Senate Committee on which I serve is the Labor Committee. There, I come in frequent contact with Carl Perkins who is one of the most able and effective com\u00ad mittee chairmen in the House, a man re\u00ad sponsible for the continuing flow of some of the most vital and effective social legislation Congress has ever passed. I also have great respect for the work of your fine young Congressman from Louis\u00ad ville, Ron Mazzoli, who has compiled a dis\u00ad tinguished record as one of the most effec\u00ad tive freshman members of the House. I'm especially honored to have the opportunity to visit Louisville again myself, and to join you at this centennial convention of the Kentucky Bar Association. Under the able leadership of President O'Hara and men like Mike Mills, the past year has been one of important progress and accomplishments on many local fronts. The new client's indemnity fund, and the devel\u00ad opment of the first prepaid legal insurance program, are but some of the important signs of success and growth you have achieved. I know that President-elect Rum\u00ad mage will build on this fine record, and keep the Association at the forefront of the move\u00ad ment for change and progress and a decent life for all the people of the Commonwealth. As lawyers, we share many common bonds. We have a long and fine tradition of service at every level of government--national, state, and local. One of the most dis\u00ad tinguished members of your Association, Jim Wine, was picked by President Kennedy to serve as one of his most effective Ambassa\u00ad dors. As lawyers, more than any other group in our society, we have it within our power to create the change we know must come. I come to Louisville tonight, believing deeply that what happens in the cities and com\u00ad munities of Kentucky is of enduring im\u00ad portance to our nation. The state that gave Abraham Lincoln to the Union is also a state that proudly shares in many of the most enduring customs and enlightened traditions of the South. And so today, as perhaps never before in your history, there are opportunities for in\u00ad novation and leadership here. Kentucky can be a bridge between North and South, a model for progress in every corner of the nation. Perhaps no other state in America today has the heritage and capacity to build a bridge like that to our common future. Coming to Kentucky this evening , I do not pretend to any special knowledge of this re\u00ad gion, and I do not come as an expert on de\u00ad velopments in the modern South that are now so widely discussed across the nation. But I have had the chance to work in Wash\u00ad ington with many distinguished leaders from Kentucky and from the Southern States, and I have learned that there are many things the South can teach the North, if only we will listen. It is not an easy thing to S\"l .-~. coming as I do from a Norhern State that has always had great pride in its leadership on race and many other areas. But I believe that if we are honest with ourselves in the America of 1972, we must be filled with pessimism over some of the directions the North may take, and we must look South to see the really hopeful steps. In many parts of the Border Region and the Southern States, you have actually reached a point where you are moving past the North on the passionate issue of race. It is as though, by some new and cruel arithmetic, prejudice is declining in the South while resentment rises in the North. The real tragedy for the nation in the Seveilities would be for the North to repeat the racial agony of the South in the Fifties and Sixties. And it would be a double trag\u00ad edy, because it would all be so unnecessary. If Yankee ingenuity means anything , it means the ability to learn from history, from experience of others with problems like our own. And so it would take a peculiar blind\u00ad ness for us in the North to stumble into the sort of obsession with race that the South seems now to be leaving behind, thanks to the vision of your wisest leaders. And race is not the only issue on which the South has something to offer. It doesn't take much travel around America, listening to the people, to realize that basic things are wrong with the nation in areas like inflation and unemployment, health and education, crime and poverty, transportation and pol\u00ad lution. These are issues that cut across all social and geographic lines. They affect North and South alike. That is why President Kennedy liked to come to Kentucky. He liked to walk among the people, to visit them in their home ~ and farms, to hear about their problems, to learn about their dreams and aspirations. As to\u00ad day, he found that people everywhere are restless for change, and they are willing, as never before, to take leadership where they find it. A few days ago, in thinking about these question and about what I would say here in Louisville tonight, I took the opportunity to look through the Inaugural Addresses and other speeches of the new Governors of the Southern and Border States. And I find that who they are and what they are saying and doing offer some of the clearest and most hopeful signs anywhere in the nation that we can really solve the common problems we face. Here in Kentucky, the election campaign by Wendell Ford last year was an inspiration to the nation. At the State Capitol on In\u00ad auguration Day last December, he spoke of his com~assion and concern for all the people of Kentucky, old and young, black and white, rich and poor. \"The test of a man in public life,\" he said, in words that I would make my own, \"is not how well he campaigns. Rather, it is how effectively he meets the challenges and responsibilities of office. \"Man has gone from ox-carts to moon\u00ad buggies because of his determination. \"The gauging of government is not how popular it is with the powerful and the priv\u00ad ileged few, but,how honestly and fairly 1.t deals with the many who depend upon it, whose lives are controlled by it. \"The only reason 'for the existence of gov\u00ad ernment at any level,\" he said, \"is to serve the people.\" That's the sort of Administration we ought to have in Washington and every other state. Thanks to the effective leadership of men like Governor Ford, Kentucky is making progress today on a variety of important State and local issues. The General Assem\u00ad bly has already redeemed the Governor's pledge to bring a greater measure of tax jus\u00ad tice to the people. Already, you have begun the task of government reorganization, in order to bring government closer to the peo\u00ad ple. It is not my purpose in coming here to\u00ad night to debate such issues. But I do admire the spirit of a State with vigJrous leader\u00ad ship, as it boldly tests itself on so many major areas of importance to the people. And it's not just Kentucky where events like this are happening. At many other State Inaugurations in the past two years, Gov\u00ad ernors like Holton of Virgin:a a-::d Askew of Florida, Bumpers of Arka sas and West of South Carolina, have sounded the call for a progressi ve attitude on race, and have gone on to other urgent and pressing pr -blems like those you face in Kentucky . It isn't any accident that State HOl'ses m this regicn are filling up with new and mod\u00ad erate young leaders. Frcm Frankfort to T:.ll\u00ad ahassee, from Richmond to Jackson , from Columbi a to Atlanta, the South is helping to lead the attack on our most important soci ~1 problems. And it isn't only the new Governors. Cou\u00ad rageous urban mayors, men who have made their peace with race, are also marching to the drums of change out of the simple nec\u00ad essity of getting on with their city's sprawl\u00ad ing problems. Indeed, this region is moving forward more rapidly today than at any time within my memory. It is far less reticent and insecure, and far more open to the possibil\u00ad ities of growth and new development than almost any other section of the country . As you should, you bring a healthy skep\u00ad ticism to Northern models of development. That attitude does not mean the South is being defensive or parochial. It only means that you are more observant, that you are no longer swallowing the patent Yankee medi\u00ad cines, that you really hope to avoid the classic Northern errors of industrial blight and urban decay, the promiscuous prolifer\u00ad ation of our motels and neon lights, and even our errors on human rights. Perhaps, as the cynics say, the South to\u00ad day is no more \"new\" than any of the other New Souths that have been pro~laimed so often since the Civil War. You know from past experience that dreams of peace and rec\u00ad onciliation are easily shattered when pas\u00ad sions are aroused. You know from present experience that it is not easy to point with pride, when the Southern and Border States trail the nation in areas like infant mortality and health care, illiteracy and rural poverty, and regressive taxes on sales and property. But you also know the feeling of satisfac\u00ad tion that progress always brings. You know the feeling of confidence and m\"l.turity that leadership bestows. Today, you have men in public life who represent all the people, not just the special interests. You know the sort of opposition you have to overcome. You know that for their own narrow political or financial ad\u00ad vantage, there are men in high places in Washington today who would like to see the South preoccupied with race, to the point where you are unable and unwilling to claim your rLghts in all the areas that really matter deeply, beginning with things like homes and health and schools and jobs. But those who seek to inflame the passions of the people fail to understand the quiet forward revolution that is taking place in the South today. Time and again in recent years, events have shown that the people are ready to move ahead. All they ask is a man whose vision is clear enough to see the way, and who cares enough to try to lead them forward. For the first time since Franklin Roose\u00ad velt, men and women are emerging in pub\u00ad lic life who understand the people's needs. The decent and ordinary people of America didn't make the world they live in, but they have the chance to change it. And they know that the only way for change to come is for them to get involved by electing leaders who truly represent their interests. If in this new era we stand against the people, if we give them war instead of peace, if we stand With the oil industry against tax reform, with the insurance industry against health reform, with the auto industry against safe cars, with the highway lobby against urban transit, then we do not under\u00ad stand the direction of our country. We deny our heritage and our history. To me, one of the most important areas in which North and South can work together is in the area of health reform. That is an area in which as lawyers and men and women in June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20607 private life, we share a common interest. It is an area which holds enormous promise for the American people, and I am pleased to know that one of the major sessions of this centennial convention was devoted to an important issue in health reform-the problem of medical malpractice , an area where there is a compelling need for doctors and lawyers to work much more closely together. As a member of both the Judiciary Com\u00ad mittee and the Health Committee in the Sen\u00ad ate, I share your view of the need for action on this growing problem. Indeed, one of my major goals in the present Congress is to end the friction that has developed between med\u00ad icine and law, and to restore cooperation be\u00ad tween these two desciplines whose efforts are so important for the future well-being of our nation. As you know, America is engaged today in a growing national debate on health reform. Together in the Senate, John Sherman Cooper and I support a comprehensive pro\u00ad posal for national health insurance. In Ken\u00ad tucky, we have the strong support of Stanley Chauvin, the President of the Louisville Bar Association , and Dr. Harvey Sloan, of the Kentucky Public Health Association. Our proposal is called the Health Security Act, and I believe that it contains the best answers that have been developed so far to end the health care crisis. The Health Security Program I favor is grounded in a handful of vital principles that, I hope, will forn~ the foundation of any legislation Congress passes. Those principles are simply stated, and I would like to share them here with you. I want a health care system that is not just an expensive privilege for the few. We lead world in Nobel Prizes for medicine and research, but we are winning no Nobel Prizes for our ability to translate the promise of the laboratory into the reality of decent health care for all the people. I want a health care system where you can call a doctor and not get just an answer\u00ad ing service. When they rush you to the hos\u00ad pital in an emergency , I want them to meet you at the door and ask how sick you are, not just how much health insurance you have. I want every man, woman and child in America to be covered at any time and for any illness by health insurance , available at a price he can afford to pay. No American should lose his health insurance because he lost his job. No American should be hounded by bill collectors to pay the cost of sickness. No American should have the tragedy of seri\u00ad ous illness compounded by the tragedy of bankruptcy or serious financial burden. I want every American to receive the same high quality of health care that anyone else receives. I want to provide decent care in the South End and West End of Louisville as they have today in the East End of the city. No American should be given second class health care because he is old or poor or black. I want a system that pays doctors and hos\u00ad pitals to keep the people healthy, instead of a system whose profits depend on 111ness. I want a health care system that has enough doctors and facilities to meet the need. I want a system that encourages doc\u00ad tors to practice their profession in every community in America, not just in the high rise office buildings on Park Avenue or in Beverly Hills. Those are the principles of the Health Se\u00ad curity Act. Not everyone agrees with them today. The A.M.A. does not agree. The Jefferson County Medical Society does not yet agree. The health insurance industry does not agree. But I think that you and I and millions of ordinary men and women across the na\u00ad tion do agree. The opposing forces arrayed against us are powerful and organized, but I do not believe they have the strength to re\u00ad sist the overwhelming tide of the people's need for change. Perhaps we will not win the reform we want this year, but in the end the people will not be dented. Together, I am confident that we shall prevail, and succeed in bringing decent health care to all our citizens. As a member of both the Judiciary Com\u00ad the same strong need for change and innova\u00ad tion exists in the area of medical malprac\u00ad tice--an area that you have analyzed so effectively in your seminar yesterday and in the other proceedings of this convention. The time has come when we can no longer afford to ignore the soaring burden that the problem of malpractice now imposes on doc\u00ad tors and hospitals throughout the nation. When every new young graduate of every medical school calls his lawyer and insurance agent before he frames his medical diploma, you know something's wrong. When doctors pay more each year for mal\u00ad practice insurance than they pay for secre\u00ad taries and office space, you know that some\u00ad thing's wrong. When every doctor begins to see his next appointment as a lawsuit and not a patient, you know that something's wrong. When every doctor and hospital imposes painful and unnecessary treatments on their patients, or perhaps worse, refuses to give tests or procedures that might be of substan\u00ad tial benefit, simply because such actions will stand up better against a million dollar suit in court, you know that something's wrong. We knaw the problem has been compound\u00ad ed by the enormous advances in medicine in recent years. But as lawyers, we also have to share the blame. The soaring costs of liti\u00ad gation and attorney fees have made the problem worse. We have to find a better way to protect the patients when things go wrong in mod\u00ad ern medicine. We have to find a better way to guarantee the quality of care. We have to find a better way to eliminate the incompe\u00ad tence of the very few, without distorting the professional standards of the entire profes\u00ad sion of medicine, and without penalizing the hundreds of thousands of dedicated Ameri\u00ad can physicians who are capable of providing the finest care available anywhere in the world, if only we will give them the oppor\u00ad tunity. We know the doctors do not benefit from the present system of litigation. We know the angry passions that have been aroused. We know the patients do not really benefit, when only ten or twenty cents out of every dollar in malpractice awards is all that ever filters down to even the most successful claimants . Indeed, it is fair to say, the only ones who really stand to benefit from the present sys\u00ad tem are we, the lawyers. And we as lawyers have no right to enjoy such spoils, when our efforts are contributing so much to the gross distortion of the livelihood and practice of our professional colleagues in the field of medicine. That is why I am pleased to learn of the progress you have made in dealing with this problem in Kentucky, and the effective way in which you have aired the question at this convention . One of the most important aspects of the health legislation I have sponsored in the Senate would provide for arbitration of med\u00ad ical malpractice claims, and would establish a National Commission for Quality Health Care. The arbitration procedure I envisage would be similar in many respects to the Screening Committee for Medical Malpractice discussed in your symposium. The Commission I have proposed would be an independent govern\u00ad ment agency, created especially to monitor health care systems and to develop new ap-proaches to determining the quality of care. Under the system I favor, the parties would be free to choose the sort of procedures in\u00ad volving experts as well as laymen, in the man\u00ad ner they deem most suitable for deciding particular medical and legal issues in their community. For too long, for want of imagination and a little professional cooperation, we have al\u00ad lowed a situation to develop that has helped to worsen the nation's health care crisis. Now, thanks to the leadership of organiza\u00ad tions like your own, we are beginning to awaken to the magnitude of the problem, and I am confident that the States and Congress will respond. Together, we can cross the threshold into a new age of health care for North and South alike. In many respects, that's why it is on all the other great challenges we face. We can build the kind of society we want, the kind President Kennedy worked for, the kind Robert Kennedy dreamed of when he asked us to seek a newer world. We can end the war and bring our economy back to health. We can rebuild our cities and educate our children. We can preserve our environment and end the blight of\u00b7 crime. We can do all the other things we have to do to safeguard the future of our nation. America was built, Kentucky was built, by people who were poor in everything but hope and human spirit, by people who had a deep and lasting dedication to working for what they knew was right. That's the way it was before, and that's the way it can be again. North and South can move ahe.ad together, if only we have the wisdom and in\u00ad spiration to carry out the goals and dreams we share with all the people. WHY A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY IS NEEDED Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, recent ex\u00ad periences confirm that the _regulatory agencies we have set up to protect the consumer-particularly in the most im\u00ad portant area of health and safety-re\u00ad quire a shot in the arm. For example, I was disturbed to learn last December of a secret agreement in August 1971, between Food and Drug Ad\u00ad ministration officials and particular sup\u00ad pliers of leaded Christmas tree tinsel. FDA seems to have dealt away its obliga\u00ad tion to inform the public of the hazard in return for the manufacturer's promise to discontinue manufacturing the lead\u00ad ed tinsel after Christmas 1971, and dis\u00ad continue sales of the tinsel after Christ\u00ad mas 1972-that is, next December. One would have thought that the tragic deaths of so many infants in this country from eating paint containing lead would have been sufficient basis for the FDA to put a halt on the sale of leaded tinsel. But in the absence of full consideration of the consumer interest, FDA officials apparently saw it otherwise. Fortunately, however, the indiscretion was brought to the attention of the public through the outcries of Congressman JoHN Moss, my Own COlleague, Senator JOSEPH MONTOYA, and a concerned news media. Now, as a result of my raising the issue again, di\u00ad rectly with FDA Commissioner Charles Edwards upon his appearance before the Subcommittee on Executive Reorganiza\u00ad tion in connection with legislation to create a new safety agency, he has as\u00ad sured me by letter dated May 30, 1972, that appropriate measures are being taken to keep leaded Christmas tree tin-20608 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 sel from being sold in this country in the future. Commissioner Edwards says: we have checked all known lead tinsel manufacturers and have been advised that there are no stocks available for retail dis\u00ad tribution in this country. We have also con\u00ad tacted the firm that supplies uncut lead tin\u00ad sel sheets and have been informed that no sales were made this year to domestic firms, and only about 20,000 pounds to Canada and Mexico. We will monitor the distribution channels to insure that no lead tinsel finds its way into the retail pipelines between now and Christmas 1973. I was disturbed to read 3 months back that almost 1,250,000 chickens tainted with PCB-polychlorinated biphenyls\u00ad a DDT-like industrial chemical linked with skin irritation in humans-had been destroyed in Maine after discovery was made by Agriculture Department officials. Who, among the responsible Federal inspection officials, was sleeping on the job to have permitted so many chickens to have become contaminated without earlier discovery? This disclo\u00ad sure followed on the heels of a General Accounting Office report to Congress sharply criticizing the Department's in\u00ad spection of poultry plants and citing such unsanitary conditions as: Filthy and debris-strewn floors; Greasy conveyor motors and rollers congested with fecal material, feathers, and dirt; Dusty, cobwebbed ceilings and green algae on the walls of coolers; and Rusty, dirty equipment, with heavy blood accumulations from previous slaughter. I was shocked to learn that the chair\u00ad man of the board of one of the largest crib firms in the country-upon being informed that the space between the bars of a wooden cradle he manufactured ex\u00ad ceeded safety limits concurred in by ex\u00ad perts, \"So he did not \"have to justify anything.\" That brand of crib, and others exhibiting the same hazard, is still on the market while the Food and Drug Administration, which has jurisdiction, stands idly by. I am appalled that, although Congress amended the Flammable Fabrics Act in 1967 to provide for more stringent stand\u00ad ards for wearing apparel, standards for flame-retardant infant sleepwear were not announced by the Commerce Depart\u00ad ment until last year-4 years after en\u00ad actment of the law-and these are not scheduled to take effect until mid-1973. Meanwhile, we are faced with an esti\u00ad mated annual toll of 175,000 clothing burn injuries and 4,000 deaths. It was further distressing to learn re\u00ad cently of wholesale fraud and corruption in the operation of mortgage insurance housing programs in cities across the country occurring literally under the noses of Federal Housing Administration officials. Particularly in the area of sec\u00ad tion 235 home ownership programs and section 236 rental and cooperative hous\u00ad ing programs, agency officials ignored unscrupulous operators and fast-buck artists who were bilking low-income families and defrauding the public treasury. And, :finally, I was astonished to re\u00ad ceive from the Goverrunent Accounting omce 2 months ago a report which docu\u00ad mented that the Division of Biologics Standards-DBS-in the National In\u00ad stitutes of Health was guilty of a callous disregard for public health and safety in permitting the sale of ineffective and potentially hazardous flu vaccines to the public. From 1966 through 1968, DBS in\u00ad discriminately approved subpotent dos\u00ad ages of influenza vaccine and thereby subjected Americans to more than 60 million doses of what may have been worthless prevention, or worse. The agency failed to turn down a single lot of flu vaccine, even though some contained as little as 1 percent of the required strength. Of 221 lots released during the period, 130 did not meet standards es\u00ad tablished by the agency itself. Inasmuch as the side effects of these inoculations\u00ad including extreme fever, rash, incapac\u00ad itating diarrhea, and cramps-can be severe, I suspect that for thousands, if not millions, of Americans, ~eir at\u00ad tempts to protect themselves from illness were actually much more harmful than no protection at all. The DBS blunder illustrates that the American public has been deceived into believing that, because an agency of the Federal Goverrunent has been set up to afford protection, the public is indeed being protected. But the tragic truth is: that just is not so. We cannot be satisfied with predict\u00ad ing more of the same, and then retiring to the sidelines to bemoan its occurrence nor take satisfaction in the accuracy of our predictions. Simply plying more money into exist\u00ad ing agencies, or providing more staff, has proven over and again to be an un\u00ad satisfactory and unproductive effort. On reading daily accounts such as these, and based on the overwhelming evidence compiled in 3 years of hear\u00ad ings before the Subcommittee on Execu\u00ad tive Reorganization documenting bu\u00ad reaucratic lassitude, unconcern, and neglect so far as consumer interests are concerned, I can only conclude that an independent watchdog agency is neces\u00ad sary to change things around. The Subcommittee on Executive Re\u00ad organization today, after extensive dis\u00ad cussion, approved by bipartisan 7 to 0 vote and reported to the full Govern\u00ad ment Operations Committee on which I am the ranking minority member, a revised version of S. 1177. The new measure reflects literally months of in\u00ad tensive effort by Senators RIBICOFF, JAVITS, and myself, and the staff of the Executive Reorganization Subcommittee, to improve the original version, to clar\u00ad ify it, and to make sure that there would be no undue interference with legiti\u00ad mate business interests nor the orderly processes of Government. This draft re\u00ad fines and perfects the bill that passed the Senate in December 1970, by a mar\u00ad gin of 74 to 4. At that time companion legislation was reported out of the House Goverrunent Operations Committee but was stalled in the last-minute legislative rush in the House Rules Committee. The draft borrows from some of the best aspects of H.R. 10835, which was approved by the House in this session of Congress in October 1971, by a vote of 344 to 44, but it also benefits from the rather heated, and frequently confused, debate on the House floor over just what the measure was intended to cover. The Nixon administration supports, and just yesterday reiterated to me its support of the concept of an independ\u00ad ent agency to represent the interests of consumers in proceedings before Federal agencies and courts. I look forward to prompt action by the full Goverrunent Operations Com\u00ad mittee, notwithstanding an intensive lobbying campaign by some to stall, cripple, or kill the measure in this Con\u00ad gress. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent to insert in the RECORD at this point the full text of the helpful letter from Commissioner Edwards to me relating to leaded tinsel, together with a perceptive front-page article written by Robert Hey entitled \"Consumers to Get a Watch\u00ad dog?\" appearing in the Christian Science Monitor of May 27, 1972. Inasmuch as the article was written prior to the cir\u00ad culation of the subcommittee print of S. 1177, it contains some inferences which are not reflected in the actual language of the bill. I also request that an excellent piece appearing in yesterday's Washing\u00ad ton Post by Morton Mintz-assisted by John Thorner- and entitled \"Hill Panel to Act on Independent Consumer Body\" also be reprinted. There being no objection, the letter and the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, Rockville, Md., May 30, 1972. Hon. CHARLES H. PERCY, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR PERCY: During the course of the recent hearing of the Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization, on the subject of consumer safety legislation, you inquired about the activities of the Food and Drug Administration relating to lead icicles sold for Christmas decoration. I noted that, al\u00ad though we did not have medical or other technical data upon which to base a ban\u00ad ning order, we had taken certain actions to promote the voluntary removal of this prod\u00ad uct from the m.arketpla{!e. In order that you may be fully informed, I am providing additional information on this subject. As of Christmas 1971, all domestic lead tia.sel manufacturers stopped production of lead tinsel. At the close of each Christmas season, supplies in retail channels are closed out of inventories at a reduced price as is the usual custom. Lead tinsel's bulky packaging and low cost make it uneconomical to hold quantities in retail inventory from one year to the next. Therefore, our concern is with the inventories that might be available in the various manufacturers' warehouses. We have checked all known lead tinsel manufacturers and have been advised that there are no stocks available for retail dis\u00ad tribution in this country. We have also con\u00ad tacted the firm that supplies uncut lead tin\u00ad sel sheets and have been informed that no sales were made this year to domestic firms, and only about 20,000 pounds to Canada and Mexico. We will monitor the distribution channels to insure that no lead tinsel finds its way into the retail pipelines between now and Christmas 1973. June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20609 If we can be of further assistance, please let us know. Sincerely yours, CHARLES C. EDWARDS, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs. CONSUMERS To GET WATCHDOG? (By Robert P. Hey) WASHINGTON.-Would you like to have a powerful consumer advocate in the middle of the discussion the next time Interstate Com\u00ad merce Commission officials sit down with big moving companies to discuss the way they move people like you? Or the next time the Federal Trade Com\u00ad mission discuss what to do about deceptive advertising with the advertiser? Or when the Department of Transportation and automakers argue over auto safety stand\u00ad ards the department must set? Loads of consumers would-and this year it appears that they might. Consumer groups have fought to get, in ef\u00ad fect, such a consumer ombudsman for con\u00ad sumers in high circles of government--and to admit him to negotiations while decisions are being made. Now Congress appears willing to establish a broad consumer agency, able to be the con\u00ad sumer's ombudsman in the formal and in\u00ad formal dealings of government agencies that \\concern consumers. After much tricky negotiation behind the scenes--not quite completed-the way seems prepared for congressional passage this year of an intensely important consumer bill. It would establish an independent consumer agency in the federal government. It has been learned that in approximately two weeks the senate government reorganiza\u00ad tion subcommittee is to approve a consumer agency bill, which would strengthen in im\u00ad portant ways one approved last year by the House. Consumer groups had sought this strengthening; some industry groups had op\u00ad posed it. CONSULTATIONS HELD Further, several sources in and out of Con\u00ad gress confirm that there have been numerous consultations among various faction members of Congress who hold varying points of view on the agency and with representatives of the White House. The aim of the secret consultations, now in their final stages, is to ensure that the bill approved by the subcommittee will be palat\u00ad able for all concerned-the White House, the House of Representatives, the subcommittee's parent Government Operations Committee. Those involved in the consultations are trying valiantly to prevent discussions from becoming personal--clashes of personality\u00ad the flaw substantially responsible for con\u00ad gressional defeat of a similar measure in 1970. So far they have succeeded. While a last-minute snag could always develop, it now appears that agreement from all concerned is about reached. PROVISIONS SKETCHED The agency that the bill proposes would: Be empowered to represent consumers' in\u00ad terests during the formal and many informal little meetings of government officials, some\u00ad times with industry representatives, which affect consumers. These take place almost constantly. The new agency thus would be able to represent the interests of American con\u00ad sumers in court proceedings before courts and federal regulatory agencies. Keep a public record of consumer com\u00ad plaints. Initiate programs to inform consumers, test products, and investigate consumer com\u00ad plaints. Highly important to consumer groups\u00ad the new agency would be wholly independent of the White House, and would be established by federal law. The present top consumer CXVIII--1299-Part 16 representative in government is Mrs. Virginia H. Knauer, who as special assistant to the President is in a position established by the President, not by law. Consumer groups have been critical of Mrs. Knauer on many issues. But more im\u00ad portant, they say, is the concept that a gov\u00ad ernment agency charged with representing consumers must be independent of all other government arms--including the White House-if it is to retain consumer confidence; and, some would add, if it is to be able to act independent of political pressure. NIXON BACKS HOUSE MEASURE President Nixon supported the measure passed by the House. Like the one expected to be approved by the Senate subcommittee, it established the Consumer Protection Agency, independent of the White House and of all other branches of the federal government. But there were two important differences between the two bills. The House bill says that the consumer agency would be empowered to participate in formal cases before government agencies in which consumer issues were at stake. The measure in the Senate subcommittee reads that the agency can participate also in informal meetings, such as those held so often between government agencies and in\u00ad dustries or specific companies-meetings that frequently result in consent decisions or other government action. Second, the House-approved version said that the proposed agency could intercede in procedures covered by the Administrative Procedure Act, i.e., rulemaking and formal kinds of government activities weren't men\u00ad tioned. OMISSIONS OR HAZINESS? There was considerable question here whether these oinissions in the House bill were intended specifically to exclude the con\u00ad sumer agency or whether the bill was not written clearly. In any case, consumer groups wanted the bill clarified-and wanted to make certain that the agency could intervene broadly in any formal or informal government action involving consumers. Apparently they will be getting their way. Yet even if the bill is passed by Congress this year and signed into law by the Presi\u00ad dent, the effectiveness of the agency is not automatically assured. Next year Congress would have to appro\u00ad priate the money to run the agency. That's sometimes where the crunch comes in: Con\u00ad gress sets up a program or establishes an agency, then doesn't give it enough money to do its job. Thus, consumer groups here remain wary. It will be important, they say, to be vigilant next year-to make certain that enough money is appropriated to give the prospective consumer agency a large enough staff to represent consumer interests effectively. [From the Washington Post, June 12, 1972) HILL PANEL To ACT ON INDEPENDENT CONSUMER BODY (By Morton Mintz) A bi11 to establish an independent con\u00ad sumer protection agency, to advocate con\u00ad sumer interests before other federal agencies and the courts, comes before a Senate gov\u00ad ernment operations subcommittee for action Tuesday after a widespread lobbying cam\u00ad paign to weaken or kill it. Capitol Hill aides said that Washington representatives of about 150 major companies and trade associations set up a task force to draft weakening amendments but that other major companies--including General Motors, General Electric, Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck--declined to join. A subcommittee source named George W. Koch, president of the Grocery Manufactur-ers of America, Inc., as one of the leaders of the task force. An aide to a Republican senator said that one major effort of lobbyists opposing the bill is to try to have it referred to the Judi\u00ad ciary Committee, a majority of which tends to oppose consumer legislation. Another tactic being urged on senators is an amendment to create not a consumer ad\u00ad vocate who could intervene with federal administrative agencies and courts, but one with an amicus, or friend-of-the-court status-and then only in formal procedures. The Nixon administration despite reported divisions among its advisers has backed a less stringent version of the legislation en\u00ad acted last October by the House, 344 to 44. As of yesterday, the Senate bill was ex\u00ad pected by subcommittee sources to be re\u00ad ported with only minor changes, in good part because of strong support from the two senior Republicans, Sens. Jacob K. Javits of New York and Charles H. Percy of illinois. The chief sponsor is subcommittee chairxna.n Abraham A. Ribicoff (D-Conn.). The bill would give the consumer protec\u00ad tion unit no regulatory mission. Instead, the administrator would be empowered to inter\u00ad vene as a party to an agency proceeding 1! he decided that action was necessary in order to represent consumers adequately. He could also petition an agency to initiate a pro\u00ad ceeding in behalf of consumers. He could not intervene in state and local proceedings unless invited. Two key provisions in the Senate bill-not included in the House bill, whose chief spon\u00ad sor was Rep. Chet Holifield (D-Cali!.) -have been special targets of lobbying efforts. One gives the administrator the right to intervene in any proceeding involving a pos\u00ad sible fine, penalty or forfeiture. He could par\u00ad ticipate, for example, in a proceeding of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administra\u00ad tion intended to determine whether an auto manufacturer had complied with a safety standard. The other provision empowers the adminis\u00ad trator to participate-again as a right--in informal proceedings. At the safety admin\u00ad istration, for example, he could participate in the current investigation of the road\u00ad handling characteristics of the 1960 through 1963 Chevrolet Corvairs. The absence of these provisions in the Holi\u00ad field bill led its original sponsor, Rep. Ben\u00ad jamin S. Rosenthal (D-N.Y.), to end up op\u00ad posing it in its final form. Ralph Nader, also embittered, charged the House bill had been gutted. The Grocery Manufacturers' Koch, in a statement to The Washington Post, said his group favors a consumer protection unit \"created to assist, not attack, other federal agencies that are directly responsible for the protection of consumers ... We would favor the . . . initial role being something similar to that of an amicus curiae in court, with\u00ad out procedural power that could disrupt deci\u00ad sion-making.\" Both the Holifield and Ribicoff bills, Koch protested, would allow the unit \"to intrude disruptively in the proceedings of federal agencies.\" The lobbying campaign-much of it di\u00ad rected against the Holifield as well as the Ribicoff blll-has been not only extensive, but, in some ways unusual. Last February, for example, the Consumer Federation of America, which represents al\u00ad most 200 consumer groups at the state, regional and national levels, got hold of a 32- page \"Business Responsiveness Kit\" of un\u00ad disclosed authorship. The kit calls the bill, \"The most serious threat to free enterprise and orderly government ever to be proposed in government.\" The kit suggests formation of a multi\u00ad business \"central protest group\" for each state, with emphasis on \"being able to com\u00ad municate on a personal basis with their U.S. 20610 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 Senators,\" and lays out specific additional techniques of opposition. \"There is nothing in this action program that should cause embarrassment,\" the kit says. But because the program can be \"most effective if it is based upon strengthening relationships between state and local busi\u00ad nessmen and those government officials in Washington who represent them,\" the kit cautions, \"it is urged that you guard against publicity of your actions that might go be\u00b7 yond those who share your concerns.\" In March, in a Senate speech, Percy, a former member of the illinois Chamber of Commerce, accused that organization havtn\u00b7g done a \"disservice\" by misrepresenting the Senate and House bills with \"a blunderbuss blast\" that stimulated some 2,000 letters of complaint to him alone. The chamber had attacked the legislation in a letter to 9,000 Illinois businessmen. In April, a subcommittee Democrat, Sen. Lee Metcalf of Montan \u00b7a said in a speech in Helena that \"a lot of companies\" opposed to the Ribicoff bill had launched \"a massive . . . pervasive and misleading campaign against it.\" In a reference to a former Capitol Hill lobbyist for the Kennedy White House, Mike Manatos, and J. Edward Day, who was Mr. Kennedy's Postmaster General, Metcalf said, \"I get visits from the old New Frontiersmen who have been hired to help kill the bill or render it useless.' Metcalf also said that A. Miles Hughey, a Washmgton public relations man, had dis\u00ad tributed material in Montana warning live\u00ad stock raisers that one result of passage of the Ribicoff bill would be \"eliminating drugs from animal feeds,\" an'd another would be, \"meat and poultry plant inspection proce\u00ad dures will be investigated.\" Hughey told a reporter that he a.Iways accompanied his materials with copies of the bill, but refused to identify his client. Asked if he would name other clients, he said. \"I don't have any at this moment.\" The director of government relations for General Mills, Graham T. T. Molitor, sent Ribicoff and Percy a copy of a letter to Catherine Bedell, chairman of the Tariff Commission, in which he sharply attacked the bill and said, \"I would greatly appreciate comments from your legal counsel as to what Tariff Commission proceedings would be affected and how this proposal would affect future business relationships with the com\u00ad mission.\" Mrs. Bedell told Washington Post re\u00ad searcher John Thorner that she has not replied to the letter, which was dated March 24. \"We don't comment on policy impact or political impact,'' she added. She also said that Molitor \"has a right\" to send such a letter. ADDRESS BY SENATOR SAXBE BE\u00ad FORE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF OHIO AFL-CIO Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I in\u00ad vite attention to a speech given recently by the distinguished Senator from Ohio ~Mr. SAXBE) at the annual convention of the Ohio AFI..r-CIO. In his speech, Mr. SAXBE describes the state of health care in the Nation. He also comments on two major legislative proposals, the National Health Security Act and the Health Maintenance Re\u00ad sources Development Act. I commend the speech to the Senate as a valuable analysis of the American health care system and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. Senator SAXBE has been a leading ad\u00ad vocate of the Health Security Act. His long-established concern, as well as his broad understanding of the intricate is\u00ad sues raised by the health care crisis made his observations particularly rele~ vant and significant. There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in the RECORD as follows: ' AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (Remarks of Senator WILLIAM B. SAXBE) It is a pleasure to be here today and speak at the annual convention of the Ohio AFL\u00ad CIO. I am especially happy to have this op\u00ad portunity to talk with you on a subject of real concern to me-the problems in our health care delivery system. How can the wealthiest nation on earth permit a sizable segment of its society to go without any health care at all? Why is it that we can spend seventy or eighty billion dollars in one year alone on health costs and still have literally millions of people who can't find, or can't afford, basic medical care? Why? Because of the delivery system through which Americans receive their health care. The system itself is inadequate, not the components. Most attacks on our system of medical care have not been on the quality of individual care, but on the collective per\u00ad formance of the entire health care system. Take the availability of care-the fact that certain people in certain places simply cannot find a doctor. Whether this is due to poor geographic distribution of medical person\u00ad nel or the over-specialization of physicians, is not the issue. The point is clear-some people in this country go without medical care-and that is intolerable. Medical care is a basic right of the people\u00ad their right to life. It is wrong when a man's abili~y to obtain that medical care depends on h1s color or his ability to pay or where he lives or who he knows. This problem of access is compounded by another-the escalating cost of health care. These costs have risen to such an extent that medical care has become a luxury, rather than a necessity. Some people, even with in\u00ad surance, can't afford to pay the exorbitant medical bills of today-and thus, can't af\u00ad ford the care they rightfully deserve as citi\u00ad zens of this wealthy nation. And then, we see the inefficiency and waste in our system. Highly trained physicians per\u00ad f~rm tasks that could be handled by physi\u00ad Cian assistant s. Patients occupy expensive hospital beds for testing that could be done on an outpatient basis. Many hospitals have duplication of expensive equipment, and others have costly equipment which is rare\u00ad ~y ':ls~d. It is, therefore, not the quality of 1nd1V1dual medical care, but the inefficient functioning of a total system that has brought on a crisis in health care. This crisis must be met, and changes must be made. The public is unhappy with the ~tatus. quo, and they are demanding that the meffiClencies and inequities be dealt with. I think the public is entitled to these changes-it is their right. After all, this na\u00ad tion is currently spending seventy-five billion dollars on health costs alone, and more than one-third of that expenditure is public money-Federal, State, and local tax dollars The public has a right to demand that thei~ taxes be spent in the most efficient and effective way. But it is also important for the people to know that these changes must be made grad\u00ad ually, with caution, and constant evaluation. Otherwise, we might launch broad new pro\u00ad graxns that would compound the problems rather than correct them. We can't expect to change overnight what has taken centuries to develop. How do we change our health care system? Where do we begin? I think a good beginning would be to rechannel and redirect our cur\u00ad rent expenditures-that seventy-five billion dollars-into new systems with a better net . result. We should take Medicare, Medicaid, all 1nsurance expenditures, and private costs, and redirect these vast sums to new compre\u00ad hensive systems, so that people will have a better chance of getting their money's worth. For the past three years, I have cosponsored S. 3, the Health Security Act. I sponsored this bill because it provides comprehensive quality health care to all Americans. It would provide full coverage of all health benefits\u00ad routine physical examinations, visits to doc\u00ad tors' offices, outpatient care of all kinds, and even dental care. The program would be financed in a most judicious manner, with half of the funds coming from Federal reve\u00ad nue and the other half through payroll taxes. In addition, this health security program contains cost and quality controls, as well as funds earmarked to improve the system. It is the most comprehensive bill, but also the most expensive. Congress has not acted on this bill. It still remains in the House Ways and Means Com\u00ad mittee and the Senate Finance Committee, and Chairman Mills has already announced that his committee will not report any health legislation this year. The bill has been met with much opposition, and it h:::ts been se\u00ad verely attacked on its high cost. Generally, Congress is reluctant to enact such an ex\u00ad pensive program. However, in my opinion, the cost argument is a fallacious one. It s m\u00ad ply doesn't hold water. According to recent HEW statistics, the Health Security Program, as outlined inS. 3, would not cost much more than the total health care expenditure which we now have without any program at all. In Fiscal Year 1970, sixty-seven billion dol\u00ad lars was spent on he::tlth care, and HEW esti\u00ad mate::i that the Health Security Program would have cost seventy-three billion dollars in that same year. In light of the fact that we are currently spending seventy-five billion, I think a comprehensive national program pro\u00ad viding full health care benefits would have bean worth the extra six billion that it would have ccst. Hopefully, the next Congress will take this into con ideration and will take some action on this important measure. In the meantime, the Senate is presently taking action on a most important health bill-the Health Maintenance Organization and Resources Development Act. The Health Subcommittee is going to report a bill which is expected to pass the Sen'l.te some time this year. It is important that this bill pass the Senate, even if it dces not become law This bill is the beginning of the first real major legisl~tion reform in the health field. To get a maJor program past half the Congress sets a precedent for future action This bill is like a miniature Health Security Act--it is a fore\u00ad runner to the larger bill. It has the Eame goal of comprehensive and quality health care for all, and emphasizes system reform. What is an HMO? How will this new bill work? A Health Maintenance Organization is a prepaid group practice which renders full coverage of all health benefits for a fixed fee. An HMO has a team of physicians and other medical personnel to cover all services-\u00ad everything from an eye examination to com\u00ad plicated surgery, and hospital care would be provided as well. An HMO functions on the principles of economy and efficiency characteristic of a prepaid system. There is a financial incentive for emphasizing preventive care-for keep\u00ad ing people healthy. This would switch the emphasis which is presently on acute hos\u00ad pital care, to a less expensive preventive care, and thereby reduce the total health care ex\u00ad penditure in this country. An HMO also gives more for the money. The comprehensive range of benefits-any health service-can be obtained through a prepaid group practice for the same or less money than people presently spend for only partial coverage. Therefore, it gives greater June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20611 benefits at lower costs. For example, in Ohio under the best Federal employee Blue Cross\u00ad Blue Shield plan, the cost per month for a family is $58.46. In contrast, a family can enroll in the prepaid Kaiser Community Health Foundation in Cleveland for $50.94 a month. The Blues' plan would cover all hospital and some acute care physician costs, but the Kaiser plan would provide every\u00ad thing. You might ask, \"If HMO's have a financial incentive to reduce costly services, what is to insure that necessary services would not be withheld or that all services would be of high quality?\" The new Senate bill deals directly with this problem by establishing a Commission on Quality Health Care to pro\u00ad tect the consumer and to monitor and regu\u00ad late quality control mechanisms within the HMO. In addition, the bill sets up a trust fund to help finance portions of premiums that low-income workers couldn't afford, thereby insuring that they could enroll in the plan. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the need to change, and re-emphasize the fact that these changes are going to come about slowly. I firmly believe that the ulti\u00ad mate solution to this health care problem lies in a true cooperative effort between the public and the private sector. People should exercise patience. Government can and must make an accomm odation with the medical profession in order to make health care legislation work. And equally so, the profes\u00ad sion must recognize that there are problems and must not resent or resist the efforts of government . All participants must realize that change is inevitable and should look to the good of the total system, not to the pro\u00ad tection of private interests. Only in this way will we have a wcrkable system, uniquely American, where quality health care can be made available to all. VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS SUPPORT S. 2987 FOR MEMORIAL TO THE LATE PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, the Veter\u00ad ans of Foreign Wars of the United States, with the approval of their commander in chief, Joseph L. Vicites, representing more than 1,700,000 members has gone on record fully endorsing and strongly sup\u00ad porting S. 2987, introduced by me and cosponsored by my distinguished col\u00ad leagues, Senator BARRY GOLDWATER and Senator PAUL J. FANNIN, of Arizona, and Senator JOHN 0. PASTORE, of Rhode Island, which passed the Senate unani\u00ad mously on June 8 last. This legislation would authorize a maximum of an antic\u00ad ipated $20 million for Eisenhower Col\u00ad lege, of Seneca Falls, N.Y., through the use of up to one-tenth of the moneys from the sale of \"proof\" Eisenhower silver dollars to perpetuate this living memorial. In his statement to the Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, Francis W. Stover, legislative director of the VFW, stated that Dwight David Eis\u00ad enhower symbolized the strength, in\u00ad tegrity, character, and the nobility of this great Nation and that this unique method of funding will :;,nake possible a broad, grassroots participation by all Americans. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the state\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: STATEMENT OF FRANCIS W. STOVER Mr. Chairman and members of the commit\u00ad tee: Thank you for the privilege of present\u00ad ing the position of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to this distin\u00ad guished Committee with respect to S. 2987. This statement has the approval of our Com\u00ad mander-in-Chief, Joseph L. Vicites, and rep\u00ad resents the intense interest of the more than 1,700,000 members of the Veterans of For\u00ad eign Wars of the United States in this most meritorious legislation. No American is more closely identified with the membership of the Veterans of Foreign Wars than Dwight David Eisenhower. Many of our members served with General Eisen\u00ad hower in his capacity of Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during World War II and organizer of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Forces. He was one of us. As the 34th President of the United States, he demonstrated that he was indeed a leader without peer in both war and peace. He fits every description and definition of a truly great American. Regardless of how we may honor him, President Eisenhower has earned his rightful place in history. His integrity , his compassion, his empathy for all Americans is legend. Probably more than any other Amer\u00ad ican of his time, Dwight David Eisenhower symbolized the strength, integrity, character, and the nobility of this great nation. To perpetuate the memory of this great man, there was established in September, 1965 Eisenhower College. As a former Presi\u00ad dent of a leading American University-Co\u00ad lumbia-this was most fitting and proper. Eisenhower expressed his wholehearted ap\u00ad proval of this monument to him when at the ground-breaking ceremony, he stated: \"This is an honor that will be prized by me every day of my life, for I can think of no greater monument to any man that a college bear\u00ad ing his name; an institution which will be a vital, vigorous champion of freedom through proper education.\" The obligation is now upon us to assure that this living monument in honor of Dwight David Eisenhower will continue , pros\u00ad per, and be the lasting memorial and monu\u00ad ment we intended . Before you is a bill which will provide a giant step in this direction. The Veterans of Foreign Wars extends its highest commendat~on to Senator Jacob Javits of New York and his distinguished col\u00ad leagues, Senator Barry Goldwater and Sena\u00ad tor Paul J. Fannin of Arizona, and Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island for introducing S. 2987, which will authorize and anticipates $20 million to assist Eisenhower College. This income will be realized in the form of one dollar from the proceeds received from the sale of each \"proof\" Eisenhower silver dol\u00ad lar, which will be sold for $10.00 to coin col\u00ad lectors. Further, this legislation will sup\u00ad plement Public Law 90-563, as approved in 1968, which provided $5 million for Eisen\u00ad hower College on a matching basis. This unique method of funding will make possible a broad, grass roots participation by all Americans, such as coin collectors and collectors of Eisenhower memorabilia. At the same time it will insure that this movement to this great American will endure. One last comment, Mr. Chairman. The money contemplated in this bill for this monument to Dwight David Eisenhower will be far, far less than Federal funds which have been expended for monuments to other Presidents. In summary, Mr. Chairman , the Veterans of Foreign Wars from our Commander-in\u00ad Chief Joseph L. Vicites on down fully endorses and strongly supports S. 2987. We urge the Comittee 's favorable consideration and advancement of this legislation, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars will be working closely with your Senate colleagues to obtain full Senate approval of this legislation and its enactment into law. BILL BROWNRIGG Mr. FONG. Mr. President, I join Sen\u00ad ators on this side of the aisle in express\u00ad ing my deep appreciation of, and my high regard for, Bill Brownrigg, who retired recently as assistant secretary to the Senate minority. Bill was here to aid me when I first arrived in the U.S. Senate nearly 13 years ago to represent the new State of Hawaii. His aid was invaluable to me then and continued to be so since. I will always treasure my asso~iation and friendship with him. Though I feel a loss with his absence, I join his many friends in wi'5hing him well. To Bill I say in the language of our native Hawaiians: Mahalo and Aloha. \"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF\" Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, \"Fiddler on the Roof\" became Broadway's longest running production ever on the evening of June 17, 1972, with its 3,225th per\u00ad formance, beating \"Life With Father,\" which played 3,224 performances, from November 8, 1939, through July 12, 1947. Stars who have played Tevye in \"Fid\u00ad dler on the Roof\" since it opened in New York at the Imperial Theater Septem\u00ad ber 22, 1964, in chronological order: Zero Mostel, Luther Herschel Ber\u00ad Jarrett, Paul Lipson, and Jan Peerce. The play is a triumph also for its director, composer, lyricist, choreographer, costumer, and author, and for its producer, Harold Prince, of New York. Paul Lipson, who returned to his starring role May 2, 1972, has played more performances than any other ac\u00ad tor, 1,806 as Tevye in New York and on tour with the National Co. His total per\u00ad formance in \"Fiddler\" as Lazar Wolf, is 3,225 performances. It is the exact total of the New York run. But during the 6 months the National Co. ap\u00ad peared at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Lipson totaled 14 performance s per week as against the New York comrany's 8. Overseas productions include: Finland, 15 separate productions more than any other country in Europe, and the first to present it in Europe Municipal Play\u00ad house, Helsinki; Great Britain, London and British touring productio ns ran con\u00ad currently; Israel, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, West Ger\u00ad many, East Germany, Japan, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, France, Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, South Africa, Rhodesia, Switzerland , Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. Up\u00ad coming will be productions next season in Hungary and Greece. In London, \"Fid\u00ad dler'' ran for 5 years at Her Majesty's, where another Harold Prince production, \"Company,\" is a big hit. Music Theater International estimates that the subsidiary leasing in the United States and Canada will produce 1,015 separate productions in the first 16 months of release through June 1972. A total of more than 2,500 perform\u00ad ances were given by professional, com\u00ad munity, and academic producers; and 20612 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 13, 1972 more parochial schools played \"Fiddler\" than other schools. Total gross in the United States on Prince productions of \"Fiddler\" New York and national companies-$51,430,- 000, plus $12,935,000 for stock and other productions in the United States. Capi\u00ad talized at $375,000, the musical had re\u00ad turned 98 percent profit to its investors and a matching sum to its producer. To\u00ad tal profits, which are divided between the producer and 147 investors is $7,402,- 500, so investment in theater sometimes pays off handsomely. There have been 43 complete score record albums, plus 18 original cast al\u00ad bums in English, Dutch, German, Span\u00ad ish, Hebrew, Yiddish, Norwegian, Swed\u00ad ish, French, Japanese, and others. Estimate of theatergoers who have seen \"Fiddler\" in live productions around the world: 37,500,000. Awards to \"Fiddler on the Roof\": New York Drama. Critics' Circle-Best Mu- sical. American Theatre Wing Tony Awards: Best Musical. Best Director-Jerome Robbins. Best Choreographer-Jerome Robbins. Best Stein. Best Producer-Musical-Harold Prince. National Catholic Theatre Conference-- Best Musical. New York Newspaper Guild-Page One Award. THE SALT AGREEMENT Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, President Nixon in his quest for world peace has reached some historic agreements with the leaders in Moscow. It now is up to Congress to study carefully both the spe\u00ad cifics and the implications of these agree\u00ad ments before voting to confirm them. In considering the SALT agreement, I believe that we must understand the realities today both in our Nation and in the Soviet Union. Ralph de Toledano in his syndicated column last Friday made some very in\u00ad teresting and meaningful points concern\u00ad ing the SALT agreement. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that a portion of the column be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ExCERPT What President Nixon and General Secre\u00ad tary Brezhnev negotiated and signed wa.s the product of long and serious discussion be\u00ad tween America's most knowledgeable experts and their Soviet counterparts. There were complex problems to solve, so complex that many thought a meeting of minds was im\u00ad possible. To imply, therefore, that Mr. Nixon was grandstanding in Moscow is both unfair and uninformed. In viewing the SALT agreement, what is important to consider bolls down to the ques\u00ad tion: Where woUld the United. States have stood without it? That question was pa\u00ad tiently answered by Henry Kissinger to the White House press corps in Moscow-and by the President 1n his meetings with the House and Senate leadership. But facts often get lost in rhetoric. A look at the arithmetic shows that the United States held its own. If the Kremlin had continued its vast con\u00ad struction program, as it obviously fully in\u00ad tended to do, it would have had by mid-1977 when the SALT agreement expires a nuclear megatonnage of 5,500, compared to a U.S. megatonnage of 4,550. But under SALT, the USSR w111 have a megatonnage of 4,000 in 1977, to America's 4,450. In deployed strategic warheads, which is what really counts, the USSR would have had 3,400 without the SALT agreement, to a U.S. total of 11,000. Under the agreement, the USSR will have 2,600 and the U.S. 11,000. In heavy bombers, there will be no changes\u00ad USSR 140, the U.S. 500. The Soviets have more land-based missiles today, but they lack MIRV-our multiple reentry missiles-which is what gives us the great preponderance of deployed warheads. Without SALT, they would have had 1,900 in 1977, but now they will be restricted to 1,330. The U.S. would have had 1,054, but now it wlll have 1,000. Without SALT, the Soviets would have had 1,200 sea-based missiles in 1977 to our 656. Under SALT, they will reduce that number to 950, but we will increase ours to 710. But the true significance of SALT is not found in those figures. It lies in the mutual decision to halt an arms race which offered neither side any real security and was drain\u00ad ing both the Soviet and the American econ\u00ad omies. As I write from Moscow, there is enough overkill in those figures and that nuclear weight for mutual obliteration. What worries some critics is that the Soviets may disregard the agreement and continue to build up their nuclear forces, particularly nuclear-armed submarines. But the United States has adequate means of detection. After all the Soviets cannot build a submarine in a salt mine--no pun intended-or dig an ICBM silo in secret. We will know about it and can abrogate the agreement. The Kremlin knows this and, in fact, it was fully discussed at the SALT talks. But beyond this, it should be noted, there would be no practical reason for So\u00ad viet violations-and the men of the Kremlin are eminently practical. They would have much to lose and very little to gain. The Kremlin made it very clear that its main objective is an increase in trade with the United States. The Soviet Union also wants technological assistance. And it will get them when such matters as Lend-Lease and interest on credits are worked out. Had there been more time, they would have been settled in Moscow. That the Kremlin should even have discussed payment of its Lend\u00ad Lease debts is an index of its strong desire to come to terms with the United States. It is no longer a question of \"softness\" on the part of the United States but one of logic. For even if, in a year or so, the Krem\u00ad lin goes back on its word, nothing will be lost. And the breakthrough in communica\u00ad tion with the Soviet leadership made by Mr. Nixon during his careful preparation for the summit and at the meetings in the Kremlin will always remain as a positive achievement. CONFERRAL OF HONORARY DOC\u00ad TOR OF LAWS DEGREE UPON GER\u00ad ARD C. SMITH Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, on June 4, Georgetown University conferred upon Gerard C. Smith an honorary doctor of laws degree. The honorary degree was presented in recognition of Ambassador Smith's \"great contribution to peace\" as Chairman of the U.S. delegation to the strategic arms limitation talks. I cannot improve upon the citation and I ask uanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. I shall read the last two para\u00ad graphs of the citation: But perhaps his greatest contribution to peace has been realized in his role as Chair\u00ad man of the United States Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. His patience and sk111 at the negotiating table have brought us at last within reach of a long\u00ad sought goal-a world free from the danger and burden of armaments. The agreements reached in Moscow in themselves can reverse the mad momentum of the arms race, and also can present the United States and the Soviet Union with a significant opportunity for the eventual reduction of the vast nuclear arsenals of our two nations. For these outstanding contributions to\u00ad wards the universal goals of peace and san\u00ad ity, the President and Directors of George\u00ad town University, by virtue of their charter from the Congress of the United States, proudly and respectfully proclaim the Honor\u00ad able Gerard C. Smith Doctor of Laws, honoris causa. Ambassador Gerard Smith has demon\u00ad strated the highest measure of diplo\u00ad matic skill and deserves our respect and gratitude for his devoted service to the United States and the future of mankind. There being no objection, the citation was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: GERARD C. SMITH, B.A., LL.B. (Director, U.S. Arms Control and Disarma\u00ad ment Agency; representative, U.S. Delega\u00ad tion, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) The President and Directors of Georgetown College, to all who shall view these presents: Greetings a,nd peace in the Lord: Tenacity of purpose, imagination 1n con\u00ad ception, and skill in execution characterize the man we honor today for his role in the pursuit of peace. He has faced the most im\u00ad portant challenge of our times, and has been a consistent force behind this nation's efforts to promote world security through the con\u00ad trol and reduction of armaments. Lawyer, publisher , naval omcer, diplomat, he has contributed h1s talents to his Govern\u00ad ment under the Administrations of five Pres\u00ad idents. He served as a Chief Adviser to the Eisenhower Administration for the Atoms for Peace Conference, and in 1958 played a major role in the shaping of U.S. proposals for a permanent United Nations Peace Force and regional arms control. In 1963, President Ken\u00ad nedy gave him credit for proposing the Wash\u00ad ington-Moscow \"Hot-Line\"-an idea he first advanced as Assista.nt Secretary of State for Policy Planning in the late fifties. In 1969, he became Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Under his capable leadership, the United States has continued to add to the series of agreements with the Soviet Union to design to reduce the risks of nuclear war. He has also presided over two important mul\u00ad tilateral arms control agreements: a treaty prohibiting the employment of nuclear weap\u00ad ons on the seabeds, and a convention prohib\u00ad iting the development, production and stock\u00ad piling of biological weapons, thus effecting, for the first time in history, a ban over an entire class of deadly weapons. But perhaps his greatest contribution to peace has been realized in his role as Chair\u00ad man of the United States Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. His patience and sklll at the negotiating table have brought us at last within reach of a long\u00ad sought goal-a world free from the danger and burden of armaments. The agreements reached in Moscow in themselves can reverse the mad momentum of the arms race, and also can present the United States and the Soviet Union with a significant opportunity for the eventual reduction of the vast nuclear arsenals of our two nations. For these outstanding contributions to\u00ad wards the universal goals of peace and sanity, the President and Directors of Georgetown June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20613 University, by virtue of their charter from the Congress of the United States, proudly and respectfully proclaim The Honorable Gerard C. Smith, Doctor of Laws, honoris causa. In testimony whereof they have issued these formal letters patent, under their hand and the Great Seal of the University, at Georgetown in the District of Columbia, this fourth day of June, nineteen hundred and seventy-two. ROBERT J. HENLE, S.J., President. EDWIN A. QUAIN, S.J., Chairman, Board of Directors. DANIEL J. ALTOBELLO, Secretary. THE PEOPLE OF POLAND AND THEffi COMMUNIST RULERS Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, Ralph de Toledano also wrote an excellent column last Wednesday regarding the people of Poland and their refusal to bow to their Communist rulers. I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that this column, which contains a very worthwhile message for all of us, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: POLAND-TROUBLE SPOT IN COMMUNISTLAND? (By Ralph de Toledano) It is Corpus Christi, Poland's great Catholic holiday. Every shop in Warsaw is shut down, and no government business is transacted . At 8 a.m. altars are being set up on the city's main street. At the great cathedral in Old Town, destroyed by the Nazis and rebuilt by the Polish government with loving care, Mass is being said. People of all ages all seem to be moving towards the cathedral. Priests and nuns are everywhere to be seen. In the cathe\u00ad dral, late teenagers and young adults make up a substantial part of the worshippers. Many of them are on their knees for as much as fifteen minutes at a time. Ten o'clock mass. The cathedral is packed to overflowing. Down the street are two huge open air masses. There are processions every\u00ad where, one of them six blocks long. The streets are jammed. You see the little girls in white dresses, little boys in blue. Church song fills the air. This is Warsaw, the capital of a Commu\u00ad nist country. But at heart it is unshakably Catholic, unshakably tied to its old tradi\u00ad tions. Even those whose faith has been eroded participate, as a political act. The Communist leaders do not like it, but they accept it. To do otherwise would be to court riot and revo\u00ad lution. Where religion is concerned, the state is powerless. But this carries over to other aspects of life. The Polish people are open and friendly to visitors, particularly to Americans. They go out of their way to be friendly. If they speak English or French--or even German-they will stop you on the street, if only to say a few words of welcome. They find it reassuring that an American President is visiting their country, an indication that they have not been forgotten in a time of summitry and great power accommodation. They st111 make their jokes about the gingerbread Palace of Culture which Stalin put up for them. They are not paralyzed by the voice of the Communist bureaucracy. They have been ruled by the Kremlin's satraps for 25 years, but they still feel that this condition is not permanent. Is this a time bomb planted within the Communist empire? Warsaw exploded once, in the Fi!ties-and the Kremlin knows that Poland must be handled with care. The regime speaks correctly in terms approved by Moscow. But it, too, realizes the limita-tions of its power. The Polish people have never accepted communism, and they can be pushed just so far. There is another factor involved in Soviet\u00ad Polish relations-a factor of considerable importance to the world as well. World War II is still very much a reality to the peoples of both countries. Warsaw, which was still a scene of devastation when Richard Nixon visited it in 1959, is being rapidly rebuilt. But the Poles have not forgotten the death and destruction. And neither have the Rus\u00ad sians. If the two peoples have one thing in com\u00ad mon, it is the seemingly eradicable recollec\u00ad tion of the horrors of war. In Moscow, you are constantly reminded by Intourist per\u00ad sonnel, by multi-lingual newspapermen, almost by everyone you speak to, of what war did to their city, to their country. The signs are everywhere visible-and in Lenin\u00ad grad, the pattern of machine-gun fire is still visible on churches and public buildings. The statistics of blood spilled and property laid waste come quickly to the tongue of the people. If the Communist leadership in the Krem\u00ad lin still wants the fruits of imperial expan\u00ad sion, they want it without the costs of Armageddon. The Communists in Warsaw still want the fruits of power, but not at the cost of inviting revolution. The Polish people want independence, but they are not ready to invite a holocaust. This, perhaps, is the message of the sum\u00ad mit meeting. For what the President has demonstrated is that firmness and fortitude can prevail. There will be much debate over the question now being asked: Did Mr. Nixon give away more than he got in his meetings with the Soviet leaders? The answer to that is a complex one. But it Is already clear that if American policy continues to be pragmatic and based on knowledge rather than pious wishes, the road begun in Moscow can have a far-reaching continuation and a return of rationality in world affairs. The President is aware of this, as he told the Joint Session of Congress. Now it is up to the Congress to stand behind him.

Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, my posi\u00ad tion is very simple and short on an amendment that is also simple and short. This is not a contest or a disagree\u00ad ment, or anything of that kind, between two committ3es of the Senate. My atti\u00ad tude is just to try to keep the lines straight and keep the record straight with resre3t to the actual military oper\u00ad ation, the fighting in Indochina. 'Ihe matter we have before us now, S. 3390, is the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and its continuation. This is an annual measure, and it includes our worldwide military assistance program, wherever it applies. However, after we really got into the war in Vietnam on an appreciable scale and were paying the cost of the equip\u00ad ment, the weapons, and really the oper\u00ad ation of the army of South Vietnam, plus the Koreans, who are also there, and also some other allies in a much smaller way, and after we were carrying that load, running into the millions of dol\u00ad lars for years, the machinery, the book\u00ad keeping, the accounting of our military assistance program-ordinarily called MAP-proved inadequate and inefficient when it came to the handling of the vast sums. MAP is a peace program. It is military aid for peace, and goes to a great many countries. It is administered by the State Department under a regular, prescribed system and distribution. Military aid to South Vietnam during the fighting of this war is really, as I have said, a war measure. It is war money and it involves taking care of a fighting army under battle conditions. So we just have to have a different system altogether. Mr. McNamara, then Secretary of De\u00ad fense, appeared before our committee and testified to the inadequacy of the ordi\u00ad nary MAP system in meeting this prob\u00ad lem. He asked that the matter be trans\u00ad ferred over to the Armed Services Com\u00ad mittee-it was not a choice between com\u00ad mittees- to let that committee author\u00ad ize what they saw fit in the way of money for our own forces in that area, for U.S. forces. All that money for supplies and everything else was commingled, any\u00ad way, for our troops and their troops. That money would be kept track of and Congress would have control over it, but it would come from a different source. It would come from the Department of De\u00ad fense. That was Mr. McNamara's rec\u00ad ommendation , and the Foreign Relations Committee informally agreed to that. It has worked since 1966, and we have got- ten along all right. This had been gone into before. Since I have become chairman I have known about it, and our committee has gone into it very carefully. Our staff has worked on it. We have called on them for a. com-plete accounting of tha.t money and have called on them for an accounting of the amount of money the Department of De\u00ad fense has spent in different countries. They have supplied the information. We put it out on the table when the bills were being marked up last year and the year before. We had plenty of discussion about it. The Senator from Missouri was very much interested in it and was very helpful in it. He and I had some differ\u00ad ence of opinion about it, but one thing we did-we worked out an amendment that we finally agreed on. Anyway, the two of us did. This year we have worked on it again. We did not quite reach an agreement. We did not quite get to that point. The pend\u00ad ing bill provides that, after fiscal 1973, all this would go back to the Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee. I am not suggesting the Foreign Relations Committee would not do a good job on it. I just say that if we put it back into MAP, we are going to have an inadequate system. We are going to have a source of money in the State Department to pay for the fighting that is being carried on by the military, and we will run into the same snags and the same unbearable burdens that existed previously. My amendment is to strike that amendment in the bill and await events, and just as soon as the hostilities stop over there, or even as soon as we have a cease-fire agreement carried out with evidence of permanence, I would be will\u00ad ing to let the matter go back to the For\u00ad eign Relations Committee, o ... let the Sen\u00ad ate do that. As evidence of my willingness, we agreed last year that jurisdiction over funds for Thailand would be sent to the Foreign Relations Committee, because the fighting was not going on there. At least, the prospect was that there would not be any fighting there, and I agreed to let this jurisdiction go back to the For\u00ad eign Relations Committee. I have the same attitude now toward South Vietnam, Laos, and the other countries, as I had last year toward Thai\u00ad land. We were hoping last year the war would be over by now, but it is not, so we have to look realities in the face. I urge the Senate, for the reasons I have assigned, to strike this part of the proposed bill, to await events. The mat\u00ad ter can be considered at any time next year. The Senator from Alabama (Mr. SPARKMAN) is familiar with this matter. I see him on his feet. I am glad to yield to the Senator. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Of course, I agree with what the Senator has said about what we might call more or less an un\u00ad derstanding that we had. Last year. for example, the Foreign Relations Commit- tee had this same provisicn in the bill, and here on the floor of the Senate. as the Senator has pointed out, all of that part relating to countries other than 'I''-\" was stricken from the bill. Thailand wasi transferred to the MAP program. The1 Senator at that time made a sta~teJment l somewhat along the lines of his .n:::mc:~.J.k.:. this morning. I will quote what he said last year on this issue. He said: June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20615 I am willing that in the future jurisdiction with respect to Southeast Asia be returned to the Committee on Foreign Relations. I think that while we are there and our men are there and the activities are going on, we ought to keep it where it is because they have to be considered together. As I understand, that is the same argu\u00ad ment the Senator presents at this time. Mr. STENNIS. Yes. Mr. SPARKMAN. Before we get to the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1973, un\u00ad doubtedly we will be out of that war. In fact, the Mansfield amendment which is in this bill requires that-- Mr. SYMINGTON. Did the Senator say fiscal 1973? Mr. SPARKMAN. No, I said the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1973. The Mans\u00ad field amendment which is in this bill re\u00ad quires that all forces be remove~ from South Vietnam by August 31 of this year. In other words, I think all of us will agree that it is a m':l.tter of a relatively short time until we are going to be out of that war. Let me say something else. In past years, when we have h~d the military program and the econormc program-we used to have them in two parts-! felt very strongly that we ought not to be called upon to handle the military pro\u00ad gram, but it was decided otherwise, and I think the decision was made both by the committee and by the Senate. So I do not find too much difficulty in going along with the Senator on this proposal, because it is just a matter of time; cer\u00ad tainly, as the Senator says, next year it would be understood that it would re\u00ad vert back to the Committee on Foreign Relations under the regular MAP pro\u00ad gram; and if the Senator is willing, I would be willing to accept the amend\u00ad ment. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President , will the Senator yield? Mr. STENNIS. Yes; I thank the Sena\u00ad tor from Alabama for his very timely re\u00ad marks, and I am glad to yield to the Senator from Missouri. Mr. SYl\\UNGTON. Mr. President , I am impressed with the argument made by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I would ask, is Thai\u00ad land currently under the Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee? Mr. STENNIS. I believe it is for 1973. Mr. SPARKMAN. Yes. Mr. STENNIS. Yes, it is, that is cor\u00ad rect, for 1973 it is under the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. SYMINGTON. And the Senator's amendment does not change Thailand; it just changes Vietnam and Laos? Mr. STENNIS. That is correct. My amendment just strikes out the provi\u00ad sions of the bill that are relevant. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, as a member of both these committees, based on the war that is going on, I would agree with the chairman, and am glad the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from Alabama (Mr. SPARKMAN) says he would accept this amendment. I would also support it. Mr. STENNIS. I thank the Senator from Missouri very much. Again I em- phasize that he has worked on this prob\u00ad lem and is very familiar with it, having worked on it from year to year, and has really made a contribution. Mr. President, I think we ought to be very clear that we all want this war to be over, and are hoping that it will be, as we were a year ago that it would be over by now. Certainly we hope that before this matter arises again it will be over. But I want to make it clear that until it is, as long as we have this situation of having to apply these sums of money, I think the jurisdiction of the Armed Serv\u00ad ices Committee ought to continue as it is under the present law. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. STENNIS. I yield. Mr. SPARKMAN. I am glad the Sena\u00ad tor makes that clear. Mr. E.TENNIS. Yes. Mr. SPARKMAN. I said that on the ground that we were all confident that we will be out before that time. Mr. STENNIS. Yes. That is all right. I thank the Senator. Just a word here: I have been thinking a great deal. I have made very few prophesies about the extent of this war, and I do not make any prophesies now, but I am encouraged to say just a few words about the present situation as com\u00ad pared to what it was 60 days ago, or soon after the offensive started. I feel encouraged by the developm ~nts of the last few weeks. Maybe I am on the gloomy side a 1ittle, or express my\u00ad self when I am gloomy more than when feeling a little better. At any rate I have decided I would say just a few words to\u00ad day, in no way intended to give a rosy re\u00ad port--! have heard too many rosy reports on this matter for the last many years\u00ad but I think, Mr. President, that it is fair and accurate to say that in several important respects, things are looking somewhat better in this war, certainly better than they were soon after this re\u00ad cent offensive started. First the mining of the North Viet\u00ad nam h~rbors and the renewed bombing of communications and other targets is apparently slowing down the delivery of the vital fuel, ammunition, and other supplies to the south. Second, the bombing is, by all accounts, more accurate and effective than before. That impresses me. It seems to me\u00ad and I have not had the weekly special briefing on this; I missed the one today\u00ad but news accounts and what I pick up here and there impress me that this bombing is more accurate and effective, and it includes more vital targets, and that is encouraging to me. Finally and most importantly, the North Vietnamese offensive, which was so devastating in its early phases, appears to have been greatly slowed, if not stalled, by the stiffening South Vietnamese, who have been greatly helped by our air sup\u00ad port, of course. I have sometimes discounted the abil\u00ad ity of the South Vietnam ese to hold under the vigorous determination of these seasoned soldiers from the north, but I have been very much pleased with the way the South Vietnamese have stif\u00ad fened and have responded. I know they are greatly helped by our advisers, and I give the greatest credit to those ad\u00ad visers. I think this, even though not enough has happened yet to bring about any final decision. Of course, the North Vietnamese al\u00ad ways have the option of retreat, of going back into the bushes, going back to guerrilla warfare, and recouping, re\u00ad vitalizing, resupplying, and coming back to fight another day. I really think that this evidence that we find now is encouraging. Just as an example, I mention the Kontum area, how it has held out successfully, and An Loc. I am advised that some 35 disabled tanks of the North Vietnamese that had been knocked out of operation have been discovered recently in a very small area. So I have that word of encouragement, and I just decided last night that I would say these w.ords today in this debate, for whatever they might be worth generally. I want to make clear, now, that I am not predicting any great, overwhelming victory, but I do think conditions are about as I have outlined. I yield to the Senator from Missouri. Mr. SYMINGTON. I thank the able Senator, and came over to support the Senator .on his amendment. On the con\u00ad duct of the war, I would ask the able chairman, inasmuch as the United States has a gross national product of well over a trillion dollars, and the estimated gross national product of North Vietnam is $3 billion, less than one-third of 1 percent of the gross national product of the United States, dces the Senator not be\u00ad lieve that if we really do our best to de\u00ad stroy the forces attacking South Vietnam, in the long run we might well be success\u00ad ful? Mr. STENNIS. Oh, I think so, if we really put forth the effort, and appar\u00ad ently we have given our military the green sign to go on this further than we have bef.ore. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, I am not one who believes that the North Viet\u00ad namese will abandon their effort. We can give the South Vietnamese tanks, planes, and guns, but we cannot give them heart; and it becomes increasingly clear that only the use of massive U.S. airpower saved the Saigon Government. What worries me i3 the consistent sup\u00ad port of this Thieu Government by this administration; I, for one, dJ not believe that this war, which is costing us billions of dollars and, what is more important, thousands of American lives as well as the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians over there-inclu ding women and children in South Vietnam as well as North Vietnam-is important to the secu\u00ad rity of the United States. I know the able chairman said, in the beginning, that he did not want to get into this war and I would hope he would agree with me-especially as the terrible pictures of civilian casualties continue to come out as a matter of pub1i~ reccrd that the sooner we can get out of there, the better for all concerned. Mr. STENNIS. I appreciate the Sena\u00ad tor's remarks very much. He is very well versed in this subject. As he has said, he knows that my attitude is-that we are already in, and we have to do the best we can. I do not want us to have to tuck tail and be forced out. We would have to live with that for a century. Mr. President, I have sent to the desk an am~ndment which would delete that 20616 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 proVlSlon in the foreign assistance bill which would transfer the authority for funding military aid for South Vietnam and Laos into the regular military aid program under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee. I invite the attention of the Senate to the let\u00ad ter which is on each Senator's desk, since this spells out the reasons why such a shift is entirely inappropriate at this time. The main reason why such funding must remain for the time being within the wartime funding pattern of the cur\u00ad rent methods is as follows: Since a war is in progress in South Vietnam and Laos, it is simply imprac\u00ad tical for funding to be handled under the normal peacetime provisions of the mili\u00ad tary assistance program. The military assistance program, properly under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee, is designed for peacetime military aid. In peacetime we can make precise estimates of equipment needs. In peacetime we can order a specific number of rounds of ammunition and with precise levels of military grants or sales provide the stockpiles and modern weapons that our allies need. But wartime is entirely different. Dur\u00ad ing the Korean war a funding system was established which was very similar to that which we now use for South Vietnam and Laos. It essentially authorizes that funds appropriated for Department of Defense military functions may be used by other free world forces. That means that in the emergency conditions of a war, particu\u00ad larly when U.S. forces are involved, we can make expenditures for wartime needs for both U.S. and allied forces in a quick and flexible fashion. Often the logistic systems of the American and allied forces are integrated with one another. It is simply impractical in the heat of battle to operate an accounting system which keeps track of whether a specific round of ammunition is going to be used by American or South Vietanamese forces. Not only the South Vietnamese Army, but also the South Vietnamese Navy and Air Force are supplied with American equipment. In peacetime, when U.S. forces are no longer fighting in that part of the world, it will be clear that re\u00ad placements of equipment and ammuni\u00ad tion needed by the South Vietnamese and Laotian Armies will be entirely separate from expenditures for U.S. forces. Thus I hope, and intend, that in the future the responsibility for military aid to these two nations can be returned to a normal peacetime basis and the jurisdiction for that aid can be returned to the Foreign Relations Committee. But it would be putting the cart before the horse to seek to return the funding for this aid to a peacetime basis before the conditions which would permit such a return ac\u00ad tually exist. I should point out that there is nothing new or different about this method of funding. As I have mentioned above, it was used during the Korean war for funding of American and Allied forces in that conflict. In 1966 and 1967 this method of funding-called military as\u00ad sistance service funded-was begun for South Vietnam and Laos because .of the hostilities in these countries. Last year the Foreign Relations Committee in\u00ad cluded in the bill as reported a provision which would have returned responsibility for funding for South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand to the normal peacetime mili\u00ad tary assistance program. It was agreed at that time that the military assistance program for Thai\u00ad land would be returned to the military assistance program under the jurisdic\u00ad tion of the Foreign Relations Committee but that the time was not yet appro\u00ad priate for the change in the funding au\u00ad thority for South Vietnam and Laos. I believe that, and I still believe, that when the conditions permitting a normal and peacetime military assistance program\u00ad such as that which we now have for Korea-exist in South Vietnam, it will be appropriate for us to return to the normal peacetime system of handling the military assistance program. But these conditions do not yet exist and we do not yet know when they will come about. We all hope it will be soon. But none of us can be sure. The request for military assistance for the free world forces in Southeast Asia will have to be increased for the current fiscal year from $2.5 to $2.7 billion we have been told by the Department of Defense. This is are\u00ad sult of the North Vietnamese offensive which has required the expenditure of large amounts of ammunition by the South Vietnamese, the replacement of equipment destroyed during the fighting, and so forth. We all hope that these expenditures will be predictable and that there will be no unpleasant surprises during the months ahead. But we cannot be ab\u00ad solutely certain, and we should not write it into hard law that in exactly 12 months and 17 days from this moment the war and the need for wartime funding meth\u00ad ods will be over. We must see what comes and we must match the funding methods to the needs of Southeast Asia, not the other way around. I urge Senators to vote to adopt the amendment. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent to have printed in the RECORD the text of the letter I have sent to each Senator. There being no obj eciion, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: U.S. SENATE, Washington, D.O., June 13, 1972. DEAR COLLEAGUE: The amendment which I have proposed to the Foreign Assistance Act for FY 1973, on which we will vote today, deletes a provision in the b111 which would transfer all funding for military assistance in South Vietnam and Laos into the annual military assistance program, under the juris\u00ad diction of the Foreign Relations Committee. As you are no doubt aware, military as\u00ad sistance for these two countries is now handled differently-it is authorized in the annual Department of Defense Procurement Authorimtion Bill, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Commit\u00ad tee. There is a good reason for this. Since there are hostilities currently in South Viet\u00ad nam and Laos, it is simply impractical for military assistance to be funded under the normal peacetime procedures of the military assistance program. This was recognized back in 1966 when the authorization aid to these two countries was transferred to the military authorization bill, at the request of the De\u00ad partment of Defense. This is the only way it is practical to fund military assistance for countries which are involved in continuing hostilities which directly or indirectly involve American forces. The funding for our allies was handled this way during the Korean War. I do not, by any means, believe that the funding authorization for military aid to South Vietnam and Laos should be perpetu\u00ad ally kept in this status any more than aid to Korea. was kept there. I am willing that, in the future, jurisdiction over the military aid to these two countries should be returned to the Committee on Foreign Relations. I made this point last year at the time we agreed to re\u00ad turn jurisdiction over mllita.ry assistance to Thailand to the Foreign Relations Commit\u00ad tee. The Committee on Armed Services thus does not seek or intend for the current fund\u00ad ing procedures to become a permanent fix\u00ad ture. But as long as the war is being fought in South Vietnam and Laos, the funding re\u00ad quirements for this type of assistance are so different from the requirements or ordinary peacetime military assistance that the aJd to these two countries must be in a different category. The report accompanying the Foreign As\u00ad sistance Act contends that returning this funding to the regular military aid program will \"symbolize\" the return of the responsi\u00ad b111ty for the war in Vietnam to the Viet\u00ad namese. I am afraid that it would do some\u00ad thing far more damaging than that. By un\u00ad necessarily complicating the funding of our assistance to South Vietnam and Laos, such a. shift in funding could seriously endanger the effectiveness of that return of responsi\u00ad bility to the Vietnamese. I urge you to vote in favor of the amend\u00adment. Sincerely, JOHN C. STENNIS. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I am willing to have a voice vote on the amend\u00ad ment. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, !yield ba.ck my time. Mr. STENNIS. I yield back the re\u00ad mainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask nnan\u00ad imous consent that such amendment be called up at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection. it is so ordered. Is the amendment at the desk? Mr. SAXBE. The amendment is at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read the amendment, as follows: On page 10, line 16, strike out \"$150,000,- 000\" and insert in lieu thereof \"$150,000,000 exclusive of excess defense articles ordered for grant to the Republic of Vietnam\". Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of the amend\u00ad ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mod\u00ad ification will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read the modification, as follows: On page 10, line 12, immediately after \"SEc. 11.\" insert \"(a)\"; in line 17, before the title \"HOSTILITIES IN INDOCHINA\", insert the fol\u00ad lowing: (b) section 8(e) of said act is amended by striking out the words 'prior to July 1, 1972'.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquires of the Senator from Ohio whether it is his intent to vacate the part of the agreement that related to a limitation on time as well as bringing up the amendment at another time. Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, I believe that we can dispose of this amendment in a very short time, and I therefore ask unanimous consent that the order for the time reservation also be vacated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, this is a very short amendment and has to do with limitations on the excess military equipment. The amonnt is reduced from $185 million to $150 million. This is agreeable, although it is a 13-percent cutback. However, the modification that it would apply to all the countries, in\u00ad cluding South Vietnam, would deprive the other countries of the material that the President thinks is necessary for them to maintain their individual de\u00ad fense in the troubled world today. Therefore, I submit that this very short amendment, which would knock out the date prior to July 1, 1972, would accom\u00ad plish what I believe is the intention of the Senate. My amendment to the Foreign Assist\u00ad ance Act would eliminate the provision of excess defense articles to Vietnam from the $150 million ceiling on the pro\u00ad vision of \"no cost\" excess defense articles to allied and friendly governments. Last year the $185 million ceiling for the pro\u00ad vision of these \"no cost\" excess defense articles excluded the provision of these articles to South Vietnam. As presently drafted, section 11 of the Foreign Assist\u00ad ance Act includes Vietnam and reduces the ceiling to $150 million-$35 million below last year's figure. Mr. President, the provision of excess defense articles to South Vietnam is a key element in our Vietnamization pro\u00ad gram. With this equipment the Vietnam\u00ad ese will be able to continue to make progress in beating back the North Viet\u00ad namese invasion and assuming more and more of the responsibility for their own defense. The administration asked for a $245 million ceiling on \"no charge\" excess de\u00ad fense articles and within this ceiling had tentatively allocated $32.2 million for Vietnam. If the ceiling proposed by the Foreign Relations Committee is amended to exclude South Vietnam, the total amount available for other nations un\u00ad der this program will have been reduced by $62.8 million or over 13 percent when compared to the amount authorized in fiscal year 1972. This alone is a severe cut but one which the administration is prepared to live with if South Vietnam is excluded from this ceiling. We must understand that the equip\u00ad ment is actually excess to the needs of our own Armed Forces. I have heard it said that the Department of Defense simply declares excess any equipment it wishes to give away to foreign countries. This is not true. Equipment is deter\u00ad mined to be excess after careful calcu\u00ad lations show that it no longer is needed for our own mobilization requirements and retention in stock would be uneco\u00ad nomical. We should realize that this excess equipment was bought and paid for\u00ad usually many years ago-through the Defense budget. It has served the pur\u00ad pose for which purchased. For the most part, it is obsolescent or uneconomically repairable by U.S. standards. But to for\u00ad eign countries that do not need the most sophisticated and latest models, and where materials are relatively scarce but labor is relatively plentiful and inex\u00ad pensive, these are very useful items. If not used to meet bona fide military as\u00ad sistance requirements, it generally must be disposed of as scrap and valuable de\u00ad fense assets are wasted. I am not prepared to say that, if we waste this equipment, the United States will have to purchase it at some later time for our foreign friends. But I do say that someone will have to buy it, and I suspect that the United States in one way or another will wind up footing a considerable part of that bill. I also have heard it said that excess equipment is given to foreign countries simply because it is available-that there is no real requirement for it. This too is not true. It is given away only when available items match a preestablished requirement that has been validated by U.S. officials under a very rigid set of critelia. I think it significant to add here that only about 5 percent of the available excess is used for military as\u00ad sistance. The rest does not match a vali\u00ad dated requirement or else is material that is not supplied under the program. The purpose of my amendment is to give the Department of Defense reason\u00ad able leeway to make good use of excess equipment but, at the same time, prevent an unconstrained issue of this material to foreign countries. The Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee insists upon exercising constraint and control in authorizing continuance of this program; I consider this to be entirely proper. But I am con\u00ad vinced that, at the figure proposed in the committee recommendation, it is overly constrained to a point that would be un\u00ad necessarily damaging to our own inter\u00ad ests as well as those of our foreign friends. If limited to $150 million, including equipment that might be needed by South Vietnam, a little more than $100 million will be available for other coun\u00ad tries. I firmly believe that this is not enough and therefore am proposing that excess material given to South Vietnam not be counted under the authorization. This would eliminate any constraint on provision of excess material in support of the Vietnamization process and provide enough to meet the most pressing needs of other countries. In concluding these remarks, I would like to underscore one final point. Whttt I am proposing will cost the U.S. tax\u00ad payer nothing. To the contrary, it will inevitably save him money now or at some time in the future. I support this amendment to eliminate South Vietnam from section 11 of the Foreign Assistance Act. Vietnam was not included under the ceiling on \"no charge\" excess defense articles last year because it was believed that Vietnam could not be looked upon as just another military aid recipient. Normal considera\u00ad tions simply do not apply in a shooting war. This is as true this year as it was last year. The timely provision of excess de\u00ad fense articles to South Vietnam helps ac\u00ad celerate the pace of Vietnamization and the speed with which we can withdraw our troops there. So, while I can under\u00ad stand the desire of the Foreign Relations Committee to reduce the outward flow of arms to nations which are not involved in hostilities, I do not believe the same considerations apply in Vietnam. We should give the administration the legis\u00ad lative support which it needs to complete the Vietnamization program. I hope very much that the distin\u00ad guished manager of the bill will accept this amendment without forcing a \"'vote on it. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I have discussed this matter with the Sen\u00ad ator from Ohio. I think his amendment is entirely reasonable. Therefore, for myself, I am willing to accept the amend\u00ad ment. Mr. SAXBE. I thank the Senator from Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend\u00ad ment, as modified, of the Senator from Ohio. The amendment, as modified, was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. QUORUM CALL Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SE\u00ad CRECY, EXECUTIVE L, 92D CON\u00ad GRESS, SECOND SESSION Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the Treaty on the Limi\u00ad tation of Antiballistic Missile Systems and the interim agreement on certain measures with respect to the limitation of offensive strategic arms signed in Mos\u00ad cow May 26, 1972-Executive L, 92d Con\u00ad gress, second session-transmitted to the Senate today by the President of the United States, and thr..t the treaty and interim agreement and associated proto\u00ad col, with accompanying papers, be re\u00ad ferred to the Committee on Foreign Re\u00ad lations and ordered to be printed, and that the President's message be printed in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hearing none, it is so ordered. The President's message is as follows: To the Senate of the United States: I transmit herewith the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Sys\u00ad tems and the Interim Agreement on Cer\u00ad tain Measures with respect to the Lim\u00ad itation of Strategic Offensive Arms signed in Moscow on May 26, 1972. Copies of these agreements are also being for\u00ad warded to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I ask the Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty, and an expression of support from both Houses of the Congress for the Interim Agreement on Strategic Offensive Arms. These agreements, the product of a major effort of this administration, are a significant step into a new era of mu\u00ad tually agreed restraint and arms limita\u00ad tion between the two principal nuclear powers. The provisions of the agreements are explained in detail in the Report of the Secretary of State, which I attach. Their main effect is this: The ABM Treaty limits the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems to two designated areas, and at a low level. The Interim Agree\u00ad ment limits the overall level of strategic offensive missile forces. Together the two agreements provide for a more stable strategic balance in the next several years than would be possible if strategic arms competition continued unchecked. This benefits not only the United States and the Soviet Union, but all the nations of the world. The agreements are an important first step in checking the arms race, but only a first step; they do not close off all ave\u00ad nues of strategic competition. Just as the maintenance of a strong strategic posture was an essential element in the success of these negotiations, it is now equally essential that we carry forward a sound strategic modernization program tc maintain our security and to ensure that more permanent and comprehensive arms limitation agreements can be reached. The defense capabilities of the United States are second to none in the world today. I am determined that they shall remain so. The terms of the ABM Treaty and Interim Agreement will permi~ the United States to take the steps we deem necessary to maintain a strategic posture which protects our vital interests and guarantees our continued security. Besides enhancing our national secu\u00ad rity, these agreements open the oppor\u00ad tunity for a new and more constructive U.S.-Soviet relationship, characterized by negotiated settlement of differences, rather than by the hostility and con\u00ad frontation of decades past. These accords offer tangible evidence that mankind need not live forever in the dark shadow of nuclear war. They provide renewed hope that men and na\u00ad tions working together can succeed in building a lasting peace. Because these agreements effectively serve one of this Nation's most cherished purposes-a more secure and peaceful world in which America's security is fully protected-! strongly recommend that the Senate support them, and that its deliberations be conducted without de\u00ad lay. RICHARD NIXON. THE WHITE HOUSE, June 13, 1972. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1972 The Senate continued with the con\u00ad sideration of the bill (S. 3390) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and for other purposes. TIME LIMITATION ON ALLEN AMENDMENT Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.

FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1972 The Senate continued with the con\u00ad sideration of the bill (S. 3390) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and for other purposes. The PHESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the distinguishe~ Sen\u00ad ator from Alabama is now recognized. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. Pr~sident, will the Senator from Alabama yield for a question? Mr. ALLEN. I yield. Mr ROBERT C. BYRD.

Mr. ALLEN. Yes, it is my intentiOn. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Then I would hope that there- spective cloakrooms will send out mes\u00ad sages to Senators on both sides of the aisle stating that there will be a roll\u00ad call vote at 2:45p.m. today, and I express the further hope that sufficient Sena-tors will be on hand prior thereto, in or\u00ad der to give the Senator from Alabama a sufficient second to his request for the yeas and nays. . Mr. ALLEN. I thank the distinguished Senator for his cooperation. AMENDMENT NO. 1219 Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment now at the desk and ask that it be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: on page 9, strike out line 3 and all that follows through and including line 14 to-wit: PROHmiTION AGAINST FURNISHING ASSISTANCE SEC. '/. Section 620 of the Foreign Assist\u00ad ance Act of 1961, relating to prohibitions against furnishing assistance, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: \"(x) No assistance may be furnished under part II of this Act (including chapter 4 of such part), and no sale, credit s~le, or guaranty with respect to defense a.rt1cles or defense services may be made under the For\u00ad eign Military Sales Act, to, for, on behalf of the Governments of Pakistan, India (includ\u00ad ing Sikkim), Bangladesh , Nepal, Ceylon, the Maldive Islands, or Bhutan.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous-consent agree\u00ad ment, the Senator from A~abama has 30 minutes and the Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes. Who yields time? Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I yield my\u00ad S\u20aclf 12 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Alabama is recognized for 12 minutes. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, the parlia\u00ad mentary situation is that there is pending before the Senate a committee amend\u00ad ment by the Committee on Foreign Rela\u00ad tions in the nature of a substitute to the bill as introduced. That committee amendment in the nature of a substitute incorporated within its provisions ce~\u00ad tain amendments which were ofiered m the committee and which, from time to time, have been ofiered here on the ftoor. One of those amendments was the runendmen t by the distinguished Sena\u00ad tor from Idaho (Mr. CHURcH) which would have reinstated a ban against for\u00ad eign military sales to or on behalf of the Governments of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Ceylon, the Maldive Islands or Bhutan. So that, in order to strike ~t the Church amendment, it is necessary to put in an amenciment to the committee substitute inasmuch as the Church amendment has now become a part of the committee substitute. So this amendment which I have called up would, in efiect, table or strike out the Church amendment calling for a ban on military assistance in South Asia, to the countries I have enumerated and which are set out in the language of the substitute. Mr. President, according to the com\u00ad mittee report, the following is a list of the military aid programs planned for countries in South Asia--this is South Asia and not Southeast Asia--for fiscal year 1973: First. Ceylon-$15,000 in grant aid for training. Second. India-$2 million in cash FMS sales and $234,000 in grant aid for trsining. Third. Nepal-$1 million-the report says $1 million, and I will touch on that in a moment-in cash FMS sales and $29,000 in grant aid for training: Fourth Pakistan-$3,600,000 m cash FMS sale.s and $243,000 in grant aid for training. . Mr. President, there are several pomts to bear in mind in connection with the figures cited by the committee. The. $2 million cash foreign military sales gomg to India is meaningless and the $3,600,- 000 cash foreign military sales is equally meaningless for Pakistan, for the simple reason that both India and Pakistan are under an embargo which prohibits mili\u00ad tary sales to these nations. I have been assured that there are no present plans to lift the embargo. That would really mal{e that a moot questiOn-the $3,600,000 that Pakistan can buy in this country for cash ~.nd t~e $2 million that India could buy m this country for cash. I am going to point out in a moment that foreign military sales are not always machine guns, tanks, or planes, but they can be civilian equip\u00ad ment. They can be bulldozer s. They can be electronic equipment and many other things besides riftes, guns, and tanks. I have also been advised that the $1 million figure in cash military sales to Nepal is actually an error fed into a computer and that an errata sheet will be shortly issued by the Department of Defense to show that the :figure of $10,- 000 was intended and not $1 million. Consequently, what the committee is undertaking to do is to prevent grant aid for training military personnel for Cey\u00ad lon in the amount of $15,000-for Ne\u00ad pal, $29,000-for India, $234,000-for Pakistan, $243,000. In addition, com\u00ad mittee by its recognition that the pro\u00ad hibitions do not prohibit commercial sales of either weapons, supplies, or trade by private industry would permit Nepal to purchase in cash $10,000 from com\u00ad mercial sources, even if the Church amendment is not knocked out in the substitute. So, we are talking about a total sum of $521,000 grant aid for training-and later on I will comment on the training a little bit more--and $10,000 in cash sales. That is all the amendment is really to accomplish, inasmuch as we already have an embargo on shipments from this country of military supplies from any sourc~the Department of Defense, or commercial-going to India and Paki\u00ad stan. Mr. President, the above is the total sum which may be spent for purchase of weapons, supplies and equipment from commercial sources or trading by private industry nations of south Asia. According to the committee report, the committee approved these restric\u00ad tions and I quote from the report: In order to insure that the U.S. Govern\u00ad ment does not become any more deeply in\u00ad volved in the military affairs of the nations of south Asia.. It is worth bearing in mind that the 20620 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 13, 1972 total estimate of cash sales under the Foreign Military Sales Act amounts to only $5,610,000. Mr. President, I point out th8it these are sales for cash that the Church amendment, the committee amendment, is seeking to ban-not credit sales, not grants-in-aid-but sales for cash and some half a million dollars for training in this country of civilian and military personnel from the countries mentioned. We are talking about cash sales and not credit sales. And we are talking about cash sales of only $10,000 when we ex\u00ad clude sales of equipment and supplies un\u00ad der the existing embargo. The result is that the committee has simply said th81t the United States shall not provide grants fur military training of military person\u00ad nel from any of the nations in south Asia. So, in the main what the Church amendment, the committee amendment, would also seek to do would be to bar the expenditure of a half a million dollars, $521,000 to be exact, for training in this country of military personnel and some civilian personnel on electronic equip\u00ad ment and things of that sort. It would deprive us from the great benefits for this country of having these people from the countries of Southeast Asia in this country where they could obtain train\u00ad ing from our military officers. And they have a very definite esprit de corps be\u00ad tween them and our own military in\u00ad structors and personnel. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I yield my\u00ad self an additional 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Alabama is recognized for an additional 2 minutes. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, that in the main, in view of the embargo imposed on shipments to these countries from any source, military or commercial, would be barred. To me, it simply says that the United States shall not provide grants for military training of military person\u00ad nel for any of the nations in South Asia. And that in the judgment of the junior Senator from Alabama would be a very shortsighted policy indeed. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ALLEN. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky in order that he might propound an inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Kentucky is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I appre\u00ad ciate very much the Senator's explana\u00ad tion of his opposition to this section. I must confess that I was not in the com\u00ad mittee at the time this amendment was adopted. I see the Senator from Idaho on the floor and as the author of the amendment, I know that he will explain it. However, as I recall the discussion prior to the adoption of the amendment, it was designed to cut off the possibility of a resumption of the supply of military equipment that had been furnished over the years and particularly to Pakistan. If the request has not been made, I ask consent that the Senator from Ohio Sen\u00ad ator SAXBE and the Senator from South Carolina, Senator HoLLINGS, be made co-sponsors of the amendment. Senator SAXBE has visited the area, and he and Senator HoLLINGS introduced the resolu\u00ad tion expressing the sense of the Senate for reorganization of Bangladesh. The Senator from Alabama (Mr. AL\u00ad LEN) has pointed out-and, I think, very correctly because I am looking at tabu\u00ad lation No. 4 in the report-that the amounts represented here are approxi\u00ad mately $500,000. Mr. ALLEN. $521,000; the Senator is correct. Mr. COOPER. The Senator has stated that these amounts to the various coun\u00ad tries would be used only for military training. Mr. ALLEN. As to the items for train\u00ad ing. However, it does have the items of $2 million to India, and $3,600,000 to Pakistan, and $15,000, I believe, to Nepal. That is a projection by the committee based on information furnished by the Defense Department. However, the point the juni.or Senator from Alabama is mak\u00ad ing is that despite those figures, there is an embargo in force-and there has been for some time-preventing shipments of any sort, from military sources or from civilian sources, of military supplies to these countries. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, the Sen\u00ad ator is correct but the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the resumption of military aid such as has occurred in the past. If the Senator's amendment were to be adopted, it would not prevent the sale or grant of military equipment to these countries, provided the embargo is lifted. Is that a correct statement? Mr. ALLEN. The Senator is correct. That is the sales for cash in the amounts stated in the report. I did point .out that there was a computer error in the million dollar figure listed for Nepal. That figure is only $10,000. And I am so advised by the Department of Defense. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I will take only a few minutes. I want to say that, from my experience in the area, I believe one of the causes of war and the troubles in the area can be attributed in some de\u00ad gree to our military aid. These oountries receive large supplies of military aid from other countries. India is almost entirely supplied today by the Soviet Union, and Pakistan receives military aid from the Peoples' Republic of China and from the Soviet Uni.~Jn. We should stay out of the competition. Mr. President, I will ask for time later. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I yield the fioor and reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Idaho is recognized. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might require within the limit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Idaho is recognized. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Alabama would strike sec\u00ad tion 7 from the committee bill. If this were to pass, we would end up without any congressional policy regarding the furnishing of arms to the countries of the Indian Subcontinent. The executive ( would then be free to proceed at its pleasure. It could lift the current em\u00ad bargo and reinstate the arms supply pro\u00ad gram for Pakistan or for India as well as transfer those materiels programed for Ceylon or Bangladesh unchecked by any legislative guidelines. The Congress, having not spoken in this or in any other bill, would leave the executive free to proceed with it. That is the only way one could construe the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Alabama. Mr. President, the Committee on For\u00ad eign Relations, in section 7 of the For\u00ad eign Assistance Act of 1972, has reported a provision prohibiting any further par\u00ad ticipation by the U.S. Government in supplying weaponry to the nations of South Asia. The purpose of the provision, as al\u00ad ready noted by the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky , based upon long and bitter experience, is to insure that the United States not blunder again, severely disserving our national inter\u00ad est, as we did in the 1965 war between India and Pakistan and in the Pakistan\u00ad Bangladesh and Pakistan-Bangladesh\u00ad India wars in 1971. If this provision were enacted into law, all federally financed armaments would be banned. Commercial sales, on the oth\u00ad er hand, would become a direct matter between the South Asian governments and the private companies concerned. Tensions that led to tragic and trau\u00ad matic conflicts in South Asia continue to linger. For the United States to rearm Pakistan, or to arm Bangladesh, the newest nation, to counterbalance India, now the dominant power in the area, would only heat up the fires that still flicker on the subcontinent. For the United States to provide India with more military might would only make the ad\u00ad jacent nations more mistrustful of their colossal neighbor. As long as the U.S. Government offers arms and ammunition to any of these countries, as long as the Pentagon acts as the agreeable agent in procuring and purchasing military mate\u00ad riel, as long as our Government provides free military training to the competing officer corps, and as long as we intervene in the delicate military affairs of Bang\u00ad ladesh, Bhutan, Ceylon-now Sri Lanka-India-and Sikkim-Nepal, and Pakistan, we are only repeating our mis\u00ad takes of the past. In recent times, tangible progress has been made by the superpowers toward limiting the testing, deployment and transfer of nuclear weapons. I submit it is also imperative to seek ways for ~e\u00ad ducing the massive international traffic in conventional arms. This amendment, then, serves as a first step toward con\u00ad trolling the flow of these arms into the most volatile region of the Asian con\u00ad tinent. In turn, our noninterference would encourage South Asian govern\u00ad ments to seek among themselves solu\u00ad tions of a more conciliatory nature. Hopefully, this process could begin with the Delhi summit at the end of this month. Five advanced powers-the United States, the U.S.S.R., France, the United Kingdom, and China-have supplied June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 20621 nearly all the weaponry for the wars in South Asia since 1947. Ironically enough, the opposing armies in these wars possessed pretty much the same weapons provided by the five afore\u00ad mentioned nations. This was the case in last year's cruel conflict between India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The Sherman tanks used by the Indian Army and the M-47 and M-48 tanks used by the Pak\u00ad istan forces were all manufactured in the United States. The Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks used by all combatants were manu\u00ad factured in the Soviet Union. The Indian Air Force flew Soviet Mig-21 jets while Pakistan flew Soviet Mig-19s. And now Ceylon has joined the club of combat\u00ad ants, receiving arms aid from the major suppliers to control the numerous unem\u00ad ployed and unsatisfied youth in that country; the militant rebels have received their tools of violence indirectly from the same sources. Such completing -the\u00ad circle circumstances reach beyond the limits of evil into the realm of the ludi\u00ad crous, as was recently pointed out in a French magazine. \"Frenchmen can take comfort in the fact,\" the periodical noted- That, along with providing Mirage jet fighters to Pakistan, France is also exporting anti-aircraft missiles to India to shoot down the jets. This is somehow maintaining the balance. Since the end of last year's war, how\u00ad ever, the balance lies solely in the lap of just one nation, India. Any efforts to arm its neighbors as some kind of \"even\u00ad handed\" approach to the area would be both provocative and counterproductive, if not an act of the absurd. The fact is that India has emerged the dominant power in the Indian Ocean region. Only India can work out with its neighbors the course of peace and friendship in that area of the world. Certainly the United States cannot provide equilibrium on the Subcontinent. But the United States and the U.S.S.R. could stimulate further dis\u00ad ruptions by supplying arms. What the Committee on Foreign Rela\u00ad tions is proposing here is not part of any retreat to Fortress America, but a pol\u00ad icy that would allow the U.S. Govern\u00ad ment to behave in a realistic, restrained, and moral manner. For the first time in 25 years, federally financed arms would be totally banned from South Asia. For the first time in a generation, American\u00ad furnished arms would not be stimulat\u00ad ing a regional arms race, or contributing to the outbreak or intensification of hos\u00ad tilities, or constituting an unnecessary diversion on the part of recipient coun\u00ad tries of resources needed for vital in\u00ad ternal growth. For the first time since 1954, when the United States began to arm Pakistan lavishly, we could conduct our relations in a neutral, friendly man\u00ad ner toward all the nations of the Sub\u00ad continent. Our national conscience would be free of the onus that our arms were a major factor in keeping India and Pakistan on the edge of war. If the United States really has com\u00ad passion for the peoples of South Asia, which I believe to be the case, then Con\u00ad gress will take our Government out of the arms aid-and-sales business insofar as these countries are concerned. Hope-fully, other powers would follow our ex\u00ad ample, but only time would tell. The way to begin is for the United States to estab\u00ad lish a clear and unambiguous policy, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has recommended, a policy of banning further U.S. military grants and sales to the nations of South Asia. Mr. President, I do hope that the Sen\u00ad ate will see fit to retain the Church amendment in the bill by rejecting the motion to strike of the Senator from Alabama. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky. Mr. COOPER . I spoke briefly on this matter a few moments ago. I appreciate the correct statement by the Senator from Alabama. He is always precise in his facts. But I believe to strike out the language adopted in committee would have the effect of placing our country in a situation that when the embargo is lifted-and the embargo could be lifted at any time-furnishing arms to these nations or those who wanted arms could be resumed. I have followed this problem for a long time. I believe our activities in furnish\u00ad ing arms to Pakistan has been one of the causes of the great trouble we have had. As I have said, India is being supplied almost wholly by the Soviet Union. China is providing some arms to Pakistan as is the Soviet Union. Perhaps the Soviet Union and China will provide arms to other countries of the area. I have never felt it helped the recipients or the United States. And in time the countries of the India subcontinent may dislike their reliance on their present suppliers of arms. The Senator from Alabama pointed out very correctly that the money in this bill, with the exception of the $10,000, is for military training. Looking at pages 6 and 7 of the report, the footnote on page 6 and 7 shows these cases the aid is for \"United States and overseas training only.\" With regard to India and Pakistan it is for U.S. training only. I think that is proper to keep such an association with those countries. It is not a matter of furnishing hardware for them; it is a matter for training. I hope the Senator will amend the committee amendment in the bill, pro\u00ad posed to be stricken by the Allen amend\u00ad ment, by adding on page 9, line 11, in the bill after \"defense services\" the words \"other than military training\" or similar words he would prefer. When I was last in India, there was some expression that this would be a proper link and aid between our coun\u00ad try and their country, I do not say that my information came from the highest levels, but I think it is correct that it would be a proper link. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I have no objection to the alteration in the pro\u00ad vision that the Senator recommends. I suggest to him, however, that it might be better if it came on line 9 of page 9. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena\u00ad tor's time has expired. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have 1 minute to complete this colloquy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CHURCH. I would propose that we insert the words \"other than training\" following the parentheses . That is the proper place for it to come, and it would have the same effect. I would be amen\u00ad able to amending the provision in that respect. Mr. COOPER. Will the Senator move to amend the committee amendment? Mr. CHURCH. Yes. Mr. President, I move that on line 9, page 9, the words \"other than training\" appear following the parentheses and comma. I move the adoption of that per\u00ad fecting amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent for the Senator's proposal to be adopted at this time. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator please send the language to the desk? The clerk will state the amendment. The assistant legislative clerk read the amendment, as follows: On page 9, line 9, after the word \"part\" and the closing parenthesis, insert the words \"other than training\". The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment? Without objection, the committee language is so amended. Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Alabama has 13 minutes re\u00ad maining. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey tMr. CASE), who does not feel as I do about the amendment, asked for 3 minutes' time. Is he here? I am prepared to yield to him. In view of his absence, and since time is running, Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Alabama. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, the com\u00ad mittee substitute singles out one section of the world for special treatment, ignor\u00ad ing many of the important and beneficial effects which our military assistance re\u00ad lationships have had in the past with the countries of the area. This indiscriminate prohibition on all forms of military as\u00ad sistance is its greatest weakness. Over the years in all the countries of the region we have maintained modest but important military training pro\u00ad grams, which vary in size from one of approximately $250,000 in India and Pakistan to one of less than $50,000 in the case of Nepal, and under the perfect\u00ad ing amendment that was agreed to, the training programs could still be carried on. These programs have provided oppor\u00ad tunities for personnel from all military services to come to this country and to learn something of American military technology and tactics and to understand more about the American way of life. These links with the mil1tary leadership in the countries of South Asia have pro-20622 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 vided useful points of access and a basis of understanding and friend'5hip which has been and could continue to be an important positive political factor for us. It is important that the United States be able to provide military training to a se\u00ad lect number of military personnel when and as we determine it to be in our in\u00ad terest to do so. I continue to speak about the training program because, if the Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee saw fit to knock out the training program, and the proponents of the Church amendment now admit that it was in error in doing so, might they not be wrong also in preventing or banning military sales to those countries? Mr President, will the Chair stop me when I have 3 minutes remaining, so that I may yield that time to the Senator from New Jersey? Additional examp:es of the loss of flexibility which the amendment would impose on the conduct of our foreign relations can be seen in the examples of Nepal and Ceylon. Almost a decade ago when Nepal was fa-:ed with the need to equip its very small armed forces at a time of particular concern about the Chi\u00ad nese threat, we were able to institute a small assistance program under which we provided medical, communications, and transport equipment to the Nepalese army. We are continuing to sell very small quantities of spare parts to support this equipment even today, but the Church amendment embodied in the committee substitute would eliminate that type of sale Similarly, we agreed in 1964 to join with the Government of India in build\u00ad ing the East-West Highway across the southern plains of Nepal. Roadbuilding equipment for this highway was provided under our military assistance program. As I stated in my earlier remarks, all military assistance does not consist of a rifle, or a tank, or a weapon. Civilian equipment and material can also be provided. The highway has been a major co\u00ad operative program in Nepal with impor\u00ad tant positive impact on the economic development and national integration of Nepal. \\Ve would be unable to continue to support our contribution to this proj\u00ad ect if the pending amendment is not adopted. Finally, in Ceylon, where in 1971 a Maoist insurgency broke out, we were able to move swiftly to meet requests for assistance from the Government of Cey\u00ad lon. We provided helicopters and other equipment needed for the internal se\u00ad curity of this friendly island in the Indian Ocean. Our support was an im\u00ad portant contribution to the political stability and independence of Ceylon. Spare parts support will be required in the future if our interest in the inde\u00ad pendence of Ceylon is to have any visible credibility. If the amendment I have of\u00ad fered is not agreed to, we will not be able to provide such support. Thus the committee substitute would do a serious disservice to the national interests of the United States. It would deny us needed flexibility in meeting emergent situations in the future; it would make it more difficult for the United States to build cooperative rela\u00ad tionships with the countries of South Asia and to help them in the tasks of their own self-defense which is the fun\u00ad damental assumption of the Nixon doctrine. The next question that comes to mind is, Where will these nations turn for their future military requirements? And the Senate should ponder that question well. The equipment previously furnished by us will rapidly become useless without spare parts. If the nations involved in\u00ad tend to provide training for their military personnel in technical and specialized fields, where will they turn for such train\u00ad ing? Under the perfecting amendment, that is a moot question. The answer is obvious. Communist Russia and Communist China are anx\u00ad iously awaiting the opportunity to ex\u00ad clude all U.S. influence in South Asia. It is my sincere conviction that if the Sen\u00ad ate does not vote to strike this section, we will have significantly contributed to the achievement of Communist goals in South Asia. In conclusion, it is my contention that the minimal grants for training does not represent a deep involvement in mili\u00ad tary a.ffairs of the nations of South Asia. I futher contend that to deny these na\u00ad tions the right to purchase for cash nec\u00ad essary spare parts and equipment pre\u00ad viously furnished by the United States is a futile gesture, costly in good will, and can only provoke the nations involved into choosing alternative sources of as\u00ad sistance. The committee's purpose may be well intentioned, but, in my judgment, it is unwise, and I hope that the Senate will vote for the pending amendment striking out the language of the Church amend\u00ad ment embraced in the committee amend\u00ad ment. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, the remainder of my time. PERSONAL STATEMENT Mr. CASE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. I asked the jun\u00ad ior Senator from Alabama if he would let me have the floor because at this time I do want to raise a question, while the senior Senator from Alabama (Mr. SPARKMAN) is present, as to a procedure followed this morning in which the senior Senator from Alabama was involved. The Stennis amendment to strike sub\u00ad section 3 of section 4 of the bill was to be voted on, according to the unanimous\u00ad consent agreement, at a quarter to 3 today. At about 10 minutes to 12, without a quorum call and without notification to me, though the Senator from Alabama knew that I had been the author of the language which would have been stricken by Senator STENNIS' amendment, he va\u00ad cated the unanimous-consent agreement and accepted the Stennis amendment, and it was adopted by a voice vote. I say this because I think it was most unfortunate, and that this kind of thing is contrary to the spirit in which the Sen\u00ad ate operates and has to operate if we are to accomplish our business. I would be glad if the Senator from Alabama would respond. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I will say to the Senator from New Jersey that I can see why he would feel this way. I do not blame him one bit. As a matter of fact, I did know that the Senator of\u00ad fered this language in the committee. I knew, and was reminded by all the ref\u00ad erences to the Case amendment, that he was greatly interested in an amendment that I had introduced yesterday after\u00ad noon and had printed, which was on the table today. I had been told that he would not be ready to consider that un\u00ad til Monday of next week, and I agreed to that. I must say that I just was not think\u00ad ing about this being something which he should be notified about. I fully agree with him that he should have been noti\u00ad fied, and there should have been a quorwn call in order that not only he, but all Senators, would know that this changed situation was about to take place. I do not know anything further that I can say. I am sorry that it developed that way, but that is the way it was. Mr. CASE. I appreciate the statement the Senator has made. I accept it, of course. I would only say that I think that all of us, when we are in a position of controlling any part of the action of the Senate, have got to be extremely sensitive-and this should go for our staffs as well-to the needs of people whenever we operate, as we almost always do, under unanimous consent. These practices, once established, tend to ac\u00ad quire a rather sac..red quality, and unless notification of an agreed scheduled change is given to the specific individuals involved, we are going to have chaos here, and it will be difficult to operate. I certainly understand that the Sena\u00ad tor from Alabama would not have done this except by inadvertence, and I ac\u00ad cept the apology. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. ALLEN. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. RoTH).

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate ames\u00ad sage from the House of Representatives onS. 3166. The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the amendment of the House of Representatives to the bill <S. 3166) to amend the Small Business Act, which was to strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert: That paragraph (4) of section 4(c) of the Small Business Act is amended- (1} by striking out \"$3,100,000,000\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"$4,300,000,000\"; (2) by striking out \"$450,000,000\" and in\u00ad serting in lieu thereof \"$500,000,000\"; and (3) by striking out\" \"$300,000,000\" and in\u00ad serting in lieu thereof \"$350,000,000\".

Mr. President, I move that the Senate concur in the amendment of the House. The motion was agreed to. MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE A message from the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives, by Mr. Hackney, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House had agreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagree\u00ad ing votes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 11417) to amend the Rail Pas\u00ad senger Service Act of 1970 to provide financial assistance to the National Rail\u00ad road Passenger Corporation for the pur\u00ad pose of purchasing railroad equipment, and for other purposes. The message also announced that the House insisted upon its amendments to the bill <S. 979) to extend the act of September 30, 1965, as amended by the acts of July 24, 1968, and October 13, 1970, relating to high-speed ground transportation, by removing the termi\u00ad nation date thereof, and for other pur-poses; disagreed to by the Senate; agreed to the conference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and that Mr. STAGGERS, Mr. JAR\u00ad MAN, Mr. MURPHY of New York, Mr. DE\u00ad VINE, and Mr. HARVEY were appointed managers on the part of the House at the conference.

FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1972 The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill <S. 3390) to amend the For\u00ad eign Assistance Act of 1961, and for other purposes. AMENDMENT NO. 1222 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I un\u00ad derstand there is a full hour on the amendment I am about to offer, the time to be divided evenly. Is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct? Mr. KENNEDY. For the benefit of Sen\u00ad ators, I will say I do not think we will need nearly all of that time. I am hope\u00ad ful we can get to a vote within half an hour. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amend.Inent. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 1222, to the For\u00ad eign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, submitted by myself and the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Kentucky (Mr. COOPER), and Senators HUMPHREY, BAKER,MONDALE,CHURCH,SAXBE,STEVEN\u00ad SON, HOLLINGS, and CRANSTON. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 20625 The legislative clerk read the amend\u00ad ment <No. 1222) as follows: On page 6, line 13, strike \"$50,000,000\" and substitute in lieu thereof \"$100,000,000\". Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. The purpose of this amendment is to restore the amount of aid and assistance to be made available to Bangladesh from some $50 to $100 million, which was initially requested by this administration. If this amendment is successful, the funds would be used for the items which were included in the REcoRD yesterday. They are basically humanitarian pro\u00ad grams to try to help restore the lives, the well-being, and the homes of hundreds of thousands of citizens of Bangladesh who have suffered so grievously over the period of the last year. May we have order, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator from Massachusetts is making an important statement, and he has re\u00ad quested that the Senate be in order. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, prob\u00ad ably no people in recent times have suf\u00ad fered more grievously than have the peo\u00ad ple of Bangladesh over the last 2 years. During the period of the last 2 years more than 1 million of them lost their lives in the cyclone that struck their southern coast .. and then, shortly after that, they expenenced some of the most dreadful violence that any have been subjected to in modern history-a violence that caused some 10 million of their own to flee from Bangladesh into India. I had an opportunity to visit many of the refugee camps surrounding the bor\u00ad ders of Bangladesh just about a year ago, and it was not extraordinary, during that time, to see hundreds of thousands of children less than 7 years of age dying from mass starvation. As a matter of fact, the best estimate was that there were some 10,000 or 12,000 children who died every day of malnutrition. That was about half the total number of such deaths during that period of time. So the people of Bangladesh have suf\u00ad fered grievously from violence and ter\u00ad rorism in their struggle for freedom in their desire to effectuate the indepeitd\u00ad ence which they had secured at the ballot box. Now that peace has come to Bangla\u00ad desh, the 10 million refugees have re\u00ad turned from India to Bangladesh, with some help and assistance from India\u00ad for rather than being a people who were willing to languish in refugee camps, where they could be assured of some food and shelter, they returned to their homes in a strikingly short period of time, to rebuild their lives and their homes and to seek a new life in the country which they loved. This effort by the United States of pro\u00ad viding some $100 million, which would be the amount authorized if this amend\u00ad ment were successful, represents the U.S. share of participation in the hu\u00ad manitarian undertaking to permit those people to restore their lives and well\u00ad being. I think, quite frankly, it is a mini\u00ad mum figure. It represents a little less than a quarter of the total amount which has been estimated as necessary to restore Bangladesh to its 1970 economy. It would, I believe, provide the kind of restoration and rehabilitation in the most important and crucial areas of housing, and would provide some transportation, but most directly in efforts that would have the greatest impact on people's lives, health, and housing and their basic needs. The resources which will be made available under this amendment will, to a large degree, be expended-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen\u00ad ator's 5 minutes have expired. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 more minutes-are partially being expended through the voluntary church agencies. The voluntary agencies, which represent all the great faiths and international service organizations, are perhaps some of the great unsung heroes in the field of humanitarian concern and relief. This aid program will work through the vol\u00ad untary church agencies, composed of men and women who are selfless in their desire to help their fellow human beings. They are remarkably efficient in assur\u00ad ing that any tax dollar devoted to hu\u00ad manitarian relief actually gets into the field and the area of greatest need. So I believe, Mr. President, that this amend\u00ad ment for the restoration of $50 million, even recognizing some of the extraor\u00ad dinary needs we have here in this coun\u00ad try, is completely in the tradition of U.S. humanitarian concern for the hundreds, thousands, and millions of homeless ref\u00ad ugees, who have suffered so much and who are now attempting to restore their lives and well-being, and represents a strong arm of friendship to those people, to help them to help themselves. Finally, Mr. President, I understand that there was some reluctance by the Committee on Foreign Relations to rec\u00ad ommend the full amount requested by the administration, because some of the pre\u00ad viously authorized funds had not been expended. I understand and appreciate that. But that was largely due, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, because we as a country had with\u00ad held our diplomatic recognition of Bang\u00ad ladesh until fairly recently, so it has only been recently that we have been able to involve ourselves in negotiations for the restoration of AID. In the past few weeks, the AID program has been announced, and I think it represents a very imagina\u00ad tive and well thought out program. There is considerable need for this kind of help and assistance, which we can provide with this amendment if it is agreed to, and I hope that it will be. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of my prepared re\u00ad marks be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the text was ordered printed in the RECORD, as fol\u00ad lows: As I stated in introducing this amend\u00ad ment yesterday, the unprecedented tragedy that swept the land and people of Bangladesh last year has rightly brought an unprece\u00ad dented humanitarian response from the American people and Congress. Despite the slowness of our Government to react, the American people and the Congress have seen the birth of Bangladesh as a saga of human courage and tragedy rarely witnessed in modern times-a saga deserving of our con\u00ad cern and our help. After traveling to Bangladesh last Febru\u00ad ary as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommit\u00ad tee on Refugees, I noted in my formal report to the Senate on April 5th, that \"Tragedy and triumph were everywhere present.\" But, as I concluded then, \"As evident as were the tragedies and challenges facing the people of Bangladesh, so, too, was the resilience and courage and determination of the Bengali people. They are far from the 'international basket case' some would have us believe.\" Clearly, Bangladesh faces immense prob\u00ad lems, and there can be little doubt that it is, and will likely be, a very poor nation for some years to come. But their resilience and courage which I observed is already at work in rebuilding their country and their lives. What the people of Bangladesh need today and over the next few months is the where\u00ad withal to rehabilitate their nation. What they ask of us and the internaltional com\u00ad munity is to help provide the material re\u00ad sources to help them help themselves. It is still premature to attempt to esti\u00ad mate the total costs of relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Bangladesh, but there is little doubt that the need is great. In its initial assessment of the situation in Bang\u00ad ladesh, the United Nations outlined priority relief needs with a major emphasis on food and imported goods to get industry going again. But a follow-up survey released in April, a combined United Nations and world bank team identified the total cost of non\u00ad food rehabilitation needs as ranging near $650 million through June 1973. The response to appeals for international assistance have been considerable, but the need remains great. These needs are discussed in some de\u00ad tail in a mP.morandum prepared for the sub\u00ad committee on refugees by the agency for in\u00ad ternational development, which I ask unani\u00ad mous consent be printed at the conclusion of my remarks. Last year the Congress voted $200 million to help return and rehabilitate the refugees who fled famine and war into India and those countless millions who remained in Bengal without food or shelter. This year, we must continue the relief work we have helped to begin. Mr. President , I fully appreciate the ra\u00ad tionale behind the Foreign Relations Com\u00ad mittee's report on why it did not recommend the full $100 million authorization re\u00ad quested for Bangladesh by the administra\u00ad tion. At the time of the committee's report there was no public announcement as to how the administration planned to use the funds. And as one who has been severely critical of the lethargy and inadequacy of the ad\u00ad ministration's response to the humanitarian needs of Bangladesh, I shared the commit\u00ad tee's skepticism. The long, and totally inex\u00ad cuseable, delay of our government's diplo\u00ad matic recognition of Bangladesh, severally limited A.I.D.'s abillty to proceed with the full range of American assistance programs. Without recognition we could not proceed with regular bilateral programs which, 1n the past, have been so very successful in Bengal. Without recognition, all American aid had to be channeled through the United Nations relief organization in Dacca, which served to push the percentage of the American con\u00ad tribution to the international effort far be\u00ad yond that which either United Nations or U.S. officials desire. But now, 8lt last our Government has negotiated a bilateral agreement with the Government of Bangladesh. Despite the many difficulties we might have expected to face-after the famous \"tilt\"-in restoring American relations with Bangladesh, the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has welcomed the return of American assistance and the presence of American voluntary agencies. Important among t:Jaese voluntary agen\u00ad cy programs are the special efforts of Catho\u00ad lic relief services and church world service, the housing programs of CARE, the special training programs being undertaken by the international rescue committee, and many other American and international organiza\u00ad tions. These programs deserve our support because they are effective, and because the 20626 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE June 13, 1972 people and Government of Bangladesh have seen that the voluntary agencies have had a long history of useful work, and that they have responded so generously on their own to the humanitarian needs of the Bengali people. So this recent bilateral agreement with Bangladesh represents an important achieve\u00ad ment for which I commend A.I.D. The ref\u00ad ugee subcommittee has studied A.I.D.'s plans and we can report that this bilateral agree\u00ad ment reflects carefully thought out projects, mutually agreed upon by both governments. Moreover, as I introduced yesterday in the record, the list of projects that American funds will support are the kinds of assist\u00ad ance Bangladesh requires at this time. Finally, Mr. President, let me say again that in an authorization bill otherwise de\u00ad voted almost exclusively to security assist\u00ad ance, I urge the Senate not to cut corners on our humanitarian responsibility-to sup\u00ad port this amendment to authorize the full $100 million request for relief and rehabilita\u00ad tion assistance for Bangladesh. Mr. President, I ask also unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a memorandum prepared by AID to justify the amount requested, and a table en\u00ad titled \"Commitments to Bangladesh, January to December 1972.\" There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: MEMORANDUM PREPARED BY AID FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON REFUGEES FISCAL YEAR 1973 $100 Mn.LION REQUEST FOR SOUTH ASIA RELIEF Magnitude of current needs In its initial assessment of the postwar situation in Bangladesh on February 9, 1972, the United Nations outlined priority relief needs with major emphasis on food. In a fol\u00ad low-up survey of Bangladesh released in April, a UN/World Bank tea.m identified re\u00ad hab111tation and reconstruction needs judged as a minimum necessary to restore the shat\u00ad tered economy to the pre-war standard at\u00ad tained in 1970. That team estimated a total need for approximately $650 million of non\u00ad food assistance through June 1973. Their cost estimate included agriculture and rural reconstruction, power and industry, transportation and health. UN assessments estimated food import needs through to the next major harvest in December 1972 to be about 2,300,000 tons. Some 1,300,000 tons of this amount has been pledged and is being delivered. It is still premature to attempt to estimate the total costs of relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Bangladesh. There is, how\u00ad ever, little doubt that the overall magni\u00ad tude of need is great and that Bangladesh must continue to receive substantial outside assistance if its people are to recover from the recent tragedy and restore their shat\u00ad tered economy. Response to the international community In response to appeals for assistance is\u00ad sued by the UN Secretary General and Gov\u00ad ernment of Bagladesh, the world community has thus far donated or pledged approxi\u00ad mately $678 million in aid of all types for Bangladesh as follows: ESTIMATED TOTAL POSTWAR AIR PLEDGES AND/OR DELIV\u00b7 ERIES TO JUNE 1, 1972 [In millions of dollars) United States Other Total BilateraL ___________________ ____ 90 340 430 Contributions in support of UN______ 118 51 169 Voluntary agencies _____________ ___ 9 70 79 Other~--\u00b7 ----------------- ------\u00b7------- 18 18 Total._________ ____________ 217 479 696 1 A recent $18 million commitment by the United Kingdom was not allocated between bilateral and multilateral activities. International contributions to date have been substantial. Yet, unmet requirements are such that further assistance will be needed if the new nation of Bangladesh is to recover. The greatest hurdles lie ahead-not only in terms of monetary considerations\u00ad but in terms of the international commu\u00ad nity's will to finish a task it has only just begun. lt should be noted that the UN Sec\u00ad retary General plans to issue a new appeal for funds in August. Response of the U.S. Government The United States has indicated its will\u00ad ingness to assume a fair share of the burden and since the end of the Indo-Pakistan war last December has contributed $140.5 mil\u00ad lion from the FY 1972 appropriatiton for re\u00ad lief activities in Bangladesh, including the recently signed $90 million bilateral grant agreement. Under the terms of that agree\u00ad ment, the United States will provide urgently required commodities such as fertilizer, cot\u00ad ton, and tallow, and will assist in high prior\u00ad ity rehabilitation projects, primarily coastal embankments, restoration of power genera\u00ad tion and distribution facilities, rebuilding of roads and bridges and repair and rehabilita\u00ad tion of facilities in the education sector. Current status of the FY 1972 $200 mil\u00ad lion appropriation for U.S. assistance is out\u00ad lined below: Appropriated for FY 72: $200 million. Prewar Obligations-(Prewar relief for Bangalee refugees in India and for relief within East Pakistan): $27.7 Million. Postwar Obligations-($90 million bilateral grant; $50.5 grants to UN and vol\u00ad untary agencies: $140.5 Million. Planned Obligations During Remainder of FY 72-(Bangladesh has requested additional bilateral aid of $40 million covering such areas as housing and rehab11itation of med-leal facilities. Also, voluntary agencies have recently completed assessments indicating a need for approximately $15 million in added support for their programs in housing, feed\u00ad ing, etc.): $31.8 Million. The United States has also agreed to pro\u00ad vide from PL 480 sources a total of 550,000 metric tons of food grains and edible oil with a delivered world market value of approximately $76.5 mlllion. Thus, food aid and dollar relief grants of U.S. postwar as\u00ad sistance to Bangladesh from all sources totals $217 million. This level of assistance repre\u00ad sents approximately one-third of the total aid of all types pledged by other donors and is consistent with Congressional desires t!'at the U.S. share not exceed 40 percent cf the total from all other sources if reasonably pos\u00ad sible. FY 1973 Request for $100 Million Appropriation As the needs of Bangladesh remain critical for the immediate future, and the world com\u00ad munity continues to respond with new hu\u00ad manitarian assistance commitments, the $100 million request for FY 1973 will permit the United States to continue to participate in the international relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction effort. The amount requested represents in our best judgment a proportion\u00ad ate share, roughly a third, of the anticipated worldwide contributions for Bangladesh in FY 1973. Any reduction below this amount or break in U.S. assistance would have serious consequences for the people of Bangladesh, who despite their best efforts, cannot yet make their way alone. The authorizat ion and appropriation of $100 million for assistance to Bangladesh during FY 1973 is, therefore, essential. In implementing the additional $100 mil\u00ad lion in assistance during the coming months, the United States will make its contributions on the basis of a continuing assessment of needs and the contributions of others. As in FY 1972, these funds will be used for sub\u00ad stantial bilaterial activity as well as con\u00ad tinued support of UN and voluntary agency programs. An A.I.D. team has already identi\u00ad fied a number of additional rehabilitation needs which the United States could effec\u00ad tively support and which could be prepared for implementation in the next few months. These include: lccal manufacture of tugs and barges, reconstruction of town water and sewage systems and rehabilitation of re\u00ad lated health facilities , dredging of inland waterways, and provision of materials for construction of basic housing . We would also want to be able to support the efforts of U.S. voluntary agencies which have also recently completed new assessments of pro\u00ad grams they could effectively handle. We be\u00ad lieve the United States should also be able to respond to the UN Secretary General's final appeal for the international relief effort in August as well as support an IBRD initiative in reconstruction.

I 2sk unanimous consent, if the Senator has no objection, to become a cosponsor of the amendment. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I esk unanimous consent that the name of the Senator from Kansas <Mr. DoLE) be added as a cosponsor of m v 9 mendmen t. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I am very glad to cosponsor the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Massachu\u00ad setts (Mr. KENNEDY), which would pro\u00ad vide an additional $50 million for the relief of Bangladesh. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who is yielding time to the Senator from Kentucky? Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 5 minutes. Mr. COOPER. This additional $50 mil\u00ad lion would authorize a total of $100 million for the humanitarian relief of Bangladesh. At the time this subject was consid\u00ad ered in the Foreign Relations Committee, we did not have a full breakdown of the requirements for relief for Bangladesh. Such evidence has been provided to the committee and the Members of the Sen\u00ad ate since that time. The administration has indicated its willingness to assume a full share of the burden of relief activities for Bangla\u00ad desh. The request for $100 million for the fiscal year 1973 was made by the administration. It would permit the United States to continue to participate in international relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts. The amount requested, added to other funds which have been made available, would con\u00ad stitute almost one-third of the amount which has been pledged or provided by other countries. As I recall, there are 26 nations offered aid. India has already provided or will provide $206 million, in addition to the great burdens which she bore when the hundreds of thousands of Bangladesh people were in India. The United States would provide $217 million. Mr. COOPER. Heretofore, our aid since the war has been provided through the United Nations and voluntary agencies, but now that the United States recog\u00ad nizes the Government of Bangladesh, there are no diplomatic obstacles to car\u00ad rying out a bilateral program as well as assistance through the U.N. and volun\u00ad tary assistance for the relief of the mil\u00ad lions of victims of the natural disaster and the war of last year. At this point, I would like to say that the Senator from South Carolina <Mr. HoLLINGS) and the Senator from Ohio <Mr. SAXBE), who introduced the reso\u00ad lution in the Senate a~king that the United States recognize Bangladesh, have become cosponsors of this amend\u00ad ment. This amount for humanitarian relief, in mv view, represents a necessary con\u00ad tributicn to Bangladesh, and it repre\u00ad sents also the generous character of the American Government and people. There is a clear need for help, and the United States is fortunate to be able to render critical assistance in a time of great need. I think it is necessary that the United States, as a humanitarian matter and to carry out its long record of assistance to countries throughout the world, make available the full sum of $100 million. Although it may be too early to make such a prediction, it could be that this assistance will be a factor in leading in time toward restoration of better rela\u00ad tions between our country and the coun\u00ad tries of the Indian subcontinent. Again, I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his initiative. I am glad to join him. I hope very much that the Senate, with its knowledge of this situation, will vote for this amendment and provide for these millions of people some assistance in a very critical time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I com\u00ad mend the senior Senator from Massa\u00ad chusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) and the senior Senator from Kentucky <Mr. CooPER) . I know that Senator CooPER always had his heart in the right place in wanting to help this country, but he also had his heart in what he thought were the proper procedures and that we recognize it in an orderly fashion through the adminis\u00ad tration. I, on the other hand, thought I would bring it to a head at the time in intro\u00ad ducing the resolution, because to me Bangladesh represented what had eluded us for many years in Vietnam; namely, the right of self-determination, of free government operating upon its own. That is the way I have always seen East Pak\u00ad istan-now Bangladesh-as a nation. Having had that free election, I thought we should come to their side. Be that as it may, the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) has gone to that country; and when we could not join officially, he gave that country hope. Now he follows through, together with Senator CooPER, in providing the mate\u00ad rial means to help them rebuild. I would hope that we would join in, to recoup the loss of face by the United States in Southeast Asia because of our lethargy and tardiness and failure at the appro\u00ad priate time to recognize Bangladesh as the true expression of self -determina\u00ad tion. The other day, the administration asked for $5 billion additional. This is just 1 percent of the $5 billion requested for the military effort being made in Vietnam. We are asking here only 1 per\u00ad cent of that, or $50 million additional, to rebuild a far more populous nation and in that sense a far more influential na\u00ad tion in Southeast Asia. It is just 1 day's cost of the regular war over there-$50 million. I think we can do far more for the interests of the United States and for the interests of free people every\u00ad where to go along with this increase. Mr. President, for over a year and a half now, the administration has been dragging its feet on the problems of B<mgladesh. During those bloody months while the brave people of East Pakistan struggled to win their independence, the Nixon administration callously ignored them, and instead gave aid and comfort and arms to the forces of tyranny and oppression. The fact that the East Paki\u00ad stanis were seeking the same self-deter\u00ad mination for which we were fighting in Vietnam made no impression on the pol\u00ad icymakers of the executive branch. our acquiescence in this policy of terror con\u00ad tinued to the end, and in the end the people of Bangladesh won through to victory. The United States reaped the scorn of freedom-loving peoples every\u00ad where for this policy. Our relationship with India, especially, was brutally dam\u00ad aged by this policy. Since joining the ranks of nationhood, the people of Bangladesh have been struggling with the awesome tasks of re\u00ad construction. Even today, their future is by no means assured. The road ahead will be long and hard. It should be the policy of the United States to lend a helping hand-to assist in the reconstruction and further devel\u00ad opment of Bangladesh. Our approach should be to take initiatives, and to ap\u00ad ply a little of that famed American in\u00ad genuity to the gigantic problems that new nation faces. Instead, we had to be pulled kicking and screaming into recog\u00ad nizing the new nation. Now, once again, we have the oppor\u00ad tunity to act. Given our record of the past 2 years, this is an unearned luxury\u00ad but act we can and act we must. The Committee on Foreign Relations has recommended cutting the request for aid to Bangladesh for fiscal year 1973. We now know that there is every justifi\u00ad cation to go ahead with the full amount The amendment by my two distinguished colleagues, the Senator from Kentucky <Mr. CooPER) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY), would re\u00ad store our aid to the full amount. It would help shore up the economy of Bangladesh, insuring that that country would become no nation's pawn-be it Russia's or India's or anyone else's. This action is the right action to take from every standpoint. It will be of in\u00ad valuable help to the economy of Bangla\u00ad desh. It will be to the diplomatic interest of the United States and to the stability of all of South Asia, and it will represent America's recogntion of the errors of the past. It is time that 2 years of folly be replaced by a moment of wisdom. In that vein, Mr. President, I am happy to be a cosponsor of the Cooper-Kennedy amendment. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of the time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. KENNEDY. I yield. Mr. COOPER. I understand that the Senator from Ohio <Mr. SAXBE) may be on his way to the Chamber. Could we have a quorum call for a few minutes? Mr. KENNEDY. Yes; before suggest\u00ad ing the absence of a quorum, I should like again to commend the Senator from Kentucky <Mr. CooPER). He has served 20628 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 as Ambassador of this Nation to India, and, therefore, he has a particularly good understanding of the subcontinent. His views about American interests in that part of the world should weigh heavily on all of us. I also commend the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Ohio, who, more than anyone else in the Senate, together stimulated the in\u00ad terest of the Members of the Senate in the whole process of recognition of Bangladesh. It is through the process of recognition that this bilateral avenue has been opened up for the United States to help in these humanitarian undertakings. I want to commend them for that at this time. _ Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro\u00ad ceeded to call the roll. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? Mr. COOPER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland. Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, I am very happy to suport the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the distingiushed Senator from Mas\u00ad sachusetts in bringing this amendment to the floor, and I intend to vote for it. I think it is an important expression of the intentions of the American people, in the position of great power and great wealth and great influence in the world which the United States has attained. I do not think we ought to forget some of the important chapters in our own history. In the formative years of this Republic, when we were a revolutionary Nation, we were a young and struggling Nation and were very much dependent upon infusions of help of various kinds from other, better established, and then wealthier nations. This is a cycle through which nations go. It is an obligation of sorts upon civilization that, as new units are formed, those which have already attained success will help others to reach out for success. It is an important step in human development. I think that the Senator from Ken\u00ad tucky and the Senator from Massachu\u00ad setts have recognized this in this impor\u00ad tant amendment. It is a humanitarian amendment. It is one which I think ex\u00ad presses the basic goodwill and the basic good intention of the American people. But, more than that, I think it has an historic place in the history of Bangla\u00ad desh and in the history of the United States. It recognizes that history, and I think that the Senate should support the amendment overwhelmingly. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio <Mr. SAXBE). Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, I support this amendment. I have been very much interested in the survival of Bangladesh. The sheer magnitude of the problem is almost more than one can comprehend. The number of people, the shortage of resources and other difficulties that face them, the very nature of their country, certainly qualifies them for humani\u00ad tarian aid. That is what this amendment would help with. I cannot help feeling that only in this way can Bangladesh survive as a viable country. Even though we have discovered in the past that humanitarian aid does not bind the recipients to us, nevertheless, I feel that this is a worthwhile and humani\u00ad tarian effort that we should join in on both sides of the aisle to push through. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I want to say this at the beginning, that I think I have just as much feeling and sympathy towards the situation that prevails in Bangladesh as anyone. I think that we should help. I think-in fact, I know-that we have helped, but I hope that the Senate will not agree to this amendment that is offered by the able Senator from Massachusetts. The committee believes the United States should do its fair share for Bang\u00ad ladesh, but no more. Congress appro\u00ad priated $200 million for Bangladesh ref\u00ad ugee relief for the 1972 fiscal year. To date $168.2 million of that has been committed-$90 million of it only a few days ago. There is $31.8 million left which has not been committed in any way and this money is available indefinitely. In addition, the United States has given $76.5 million in food aid under Public Law 480. Thus the total aid to Bangla\u00ad desh relief work, so far, is $244.7 million. It should be recognized that we are no longer dealing with a refugee relief problem-a disaster situation-as we were when Congress considered this last year. We are talking about development assistance primarily-how and how much are we going to provide to help make Bangladesh a viable country. Of the $90 million in aid the United States just pledged most will go for import of fertilizer, raw cotton, flood control, road and power projects-categories for which the regular development loan funds are normally used. The committee has rec\u00ad ommended $50 million more in special grant relief funds. This, together with the carryover funds, makes available $81.8 million in dollar grant aid for the coming fiscal year. In addition, there is no limit on the food aid that can be provided under Public Law 480. And, if a case can be made for more, it can be provided through the regular development loan program or as grants through the tech\u00ad nical assistance program. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to free $50 million of regular aid funds to loan or give to countries other than Bangladesh. With the state of our Gov\u00ad ernment's fiscal situation, I cannot sup\u00ad port a $50 million increase in economic aid, particularly at this time. I urge that the Senate reject the amendment. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, the Sen\u00ad ator from Massachusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) is the chief sponsor of the amendment. He spent days in India and Bangladesh and saw conditions there. I have always found the Senator from Alabama (Mr. SPARKMAN) to be a humane man, but he has the responsibility, as manager, of supporting the committee bill. I have read the report of AID and the need that exists in Bangladesh. It provided a description of the disposi\u00ad tion of the $200 million authorized for fis\u00ad cal year 1972. It is correct that $31.8 mil\u00ad lion of that remains to be obligated. But AID reported that this money is needed to cover such areas as housing, rehabili\u00ad tation, and medical facilities. AID also makes the statement that money is need\u00ad ed and additional sums are needed for such purposes as fertilizer, cotton, and tallow and to assist in high priority re\u00ad habilitation projects. Such as restoration of river embankment-for prevention of floods-the restoration of power genera\u00ad tors and distribution facilities, rebuilding roads and bridges, rehabilitation facili\u00ad ties, and in the field of education. These are all prime needs of Bangladesh for reconstruction and restoration. In addition, as the Senator from Mas\u00ad sachusetts said there, I am certain that grievous personal needs exists among the people of Bangladesh. The $50 million we ask, as the Senator from South Carolina has said, is such a small amount com\u00ad parable to the money we make available for arms. Surely, at this point, we can provide an additional $50 million for a people who have been in turmoil and travail for a year or more. By the adoption of the amendment. the Senate, the Congress, and the American people, can show their best side to the world. I hope that the Senator from Massa\u00ad chusetts will make a final statement and then we can come to a vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time\"! Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that 2 minutes are left and I yield myself 2 minutes and then am prepared to yield back my time. Mr. President, we as a country are pre\u00ad pared to make extraordinary expendi\u00ad tures when it comes to the question of escalation of our military involvement in Southeast Asia. We do not hesitate to provide a greater percentage of our money for military aid to different coun\u00ad tries throughout the world. \\Vhen we think it is in our interest, we are prepared to make grants or loans in an amount of approximately $5 billion ea.ch year for military equipment. So, if we think that it is in our interest, then I believe, when we are expending so much in many areas of the world on military hardware, that we should also indicate what I believe is the most important sense of the Ameri\u00ad can spirit, that is, to extend the hand of friendship and humanitarian concern, which is ingrained in our American character. It is appropriate that we do that, and that we express it, as the distinguished Senator from Maryland and the distinguished Senator from Ken\u00ad tucky have already pointed out so clear\u00ad ly today. I would like to see the United States the No. 1 country in terms of hu-June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20629 manitarian aid and assistance, because there are four or five different nations in the world already giving more per capita aid than the United States for humani\u00ad tarian concerns in Bangladesh. I would like to see the United States No. 1 in that area, and perhaps fourth or fifth in mili\u00ad tary aid throughout the world. So I hope that this amendment will be accepted. I think that it will indicate our concern for the people of Bangladesh, who have been struggling so hard for their lives and their existence over a period of the past year or so, and who have really achieved their independence through democratic means. As the Sena\u00ad tor from South Carolina and the Senator from Ohio have pointed out, when they went to the polls to elect 167 out of 169 members to the General Assembly, and had free elections, in spite of that self\u00ad determination, those elections were re\u00ad pressed. Yet, they persevered and achieved their independence. They are now the eighth largest country in the world in terms of population. They want to spend only a pittance for military af\u00ad fairs. They want to devote all their re\u00ad sources for the benefit of their people. Accordingly, Mr. President, it seems to me that the United States should respond in a meaningful way, as I believe this amendment does, to the humanitarian needs of the people of Bangladesh. Mr. President, I yield back the remain\u00ad der of my time. Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Sena\u00ad tor from Massachusetts. On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.

OIL IMPORT CARGO PREFERENCE AMENDMENT Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, presently pending on the Senate Calendar of Busi\u00ad ness as order No. 804 is the bill, H.R. 13324. It carries the rather innocuous title in the Calendar of \"An act to au\u00ad thorize appropriations for the fiscal year 1973 for certain maritime programs of the Department of Commerce.\" Mr. President, owing to amendments, and one in particular, made by the Com\u00ad mittee on Commerce to H.R. 13324, it is no longer a harmless bill capable of pro\u00ad ducing no ill effects. The particular com\u00ad mittee amendment to which I refer is to be found in section 3 of H.R. 13324. It would have the effect of requiring that at least 50 percent of \"crude and un\u00ad finished oils and finished products, not including residual fuel oil to be used as fuel and No. 2 fuel oil,\" imported into the United States on \"a quota basis, al\u00ad locations of licenses\" be carried on higher-costing tanker vessels of the United States. As pointed out by my dis\u00ad tinguished colleague from Michigan <Mr. GRIFFIN) and myself in separate views in the committee report <No. 841), ac\u00ad companying H.R. 13324, this amendment is \"a blow against the consumers,\" since it is bound to have an adverse cost im\u00ad pact upon the oil and petro-chemical in\u00ad dustries of our country resulting in in\u00ad creased consumer prices for such prod\u00ad ucts throughout the entire Nation. My colleague (Mr. GRIFFIN) and my\u00ad self in our separate views therefore con\u00ad cluded in the following manner: We also should be mindful of the repeated warnings that any added delay in the con\u00ad struction and operation of bulk power plants-be it for environmental reasons or otherwise--can only give rise to increasing the grave danger of future \"black-outs\" or \"brown-outs\". Certainly, anything that might tend to slow up or restrict a needed fuel oil supply for such plants, like this oil cargo preference amendment to H.R. 13324, might very well contribute to worsen our ever-present power crisis. That such an amendment could emanate from the Committee on Commerce, which long has championed the interest of the av\u00ad erage consumer of our nation, is shocking and beyond belief. Certainly, the armor of this \"golden knight\" of consumer interest will be severely tarnished 1f this amendment on the importation of oil is allowed to re\u00ad main in the blll, H.R. 13324. Now, Mr. President, the committee re\u00ad port on H.R. 13324 goes to considerable length trying to explain and to justify this amendment concerning U.S.-:fiag carriage of certain oil imports under quota. As a matter of fact, only slightly more than nine pages of the report are devoted to explaining appropriation au\u00ad thorization for maritime programs of al\u00ad most $556 million. Yet, slightly more than 22 pages of the committee report are de\u00ad voted to justifying this onerous oil im\u00ad port cargo preference amendment. To quote from the bard of Avon, \"The lady doth protest too much, me-thinks.\" Mr. President, this oil import cargo preference amendment certainly is a controversial provision. I am aware, for example, that this amendment has gen\u00ad erated a considerable number of letters and telegrams to my colleagues in the Senate. And, most conspicuous in my opinion, has been the lack of a clear-cut position on the part of the Department of Commerce in which the Maritime Ad\u00ad ministration functions and which would be required to administer this oil import cargo preference amendment. As a mat\u00ad ter of fact, the lengthy portion of the Commerce Committee report seeking to justify this amendment places, I under\u00ad stand, considerable reliance upon an\u00ad swers of the Maritime Administration when responding to written questions submitted to it by the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries con\u00ad cerning a similar legislative proposal, H.R. 12324. Accordingly, on June 7, I wrote to the Secretary of Commerce, the Honorable Peter G. Peterson, asking \"whether the position of the Department of Commerce is, in fact, in support of this oil import cargo preference amend\u00ad ment.'' Yesterday, June 12, I received a reply to my inquiry from Secretary of Commerce Peterson, and I shall ask unanimous consent for the full text of my letter to the Secretary and his reply to me to appear at the conclusion of my remarks. Secretary Peterson's letter should help my colleagues in the Senate in evaluating this controversial amend\u00ad ment to H.R. 13324 and in responding to 20630 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE June 13, 1972 the :::nany communications which they have received concerning it. Mr. President, the thrust of Secretary of Commerce Peterson's letter is to in\u00ad dicate that the administration is evalu\u00ad ating various initiatives to bring into being and to sustain an appropriate tanker fleet level. The letter also ex\u00ad presses the belief that the 1970 amend\u00ad ments to the Merchant Marine Act pro\u00ad vide the basic tools to create a healthy and competitive fleet. The Secretary of Commerce th~n goes on to conclude in the following manner: The Department and the Administration believe it inappropriate to adopt oil import cargo preference at this time, and therefore would hope that congressional action on the authorization for Maritime appropriations could be pursued independently. (Emphasis supplled.) Mr. President, the Secretary of Com\u00ad merce's characte rization of adoption of the oil import cargo preference amend\u00ad as being \"inappropriate\" at this time is very accurate. One unfortunate aspect that attaches to this authoriza tion bill is the fact that at a time when the Con\u00ad gress i3 pressing to conclude necessary busine:;s in order to recess for the up\u00ad coming Democratic convention, it is most inapprop riate to attach such a far-reach\u00ad ing substantive amendment to an au\u00ad thorization till which is needed if the appropriation process is to move forward in a timely fa'3hion. Throughout this ses\u00ad sion of the 91st Congress, the distin\u00ad guished Chairman of the Senate Appro\u00ad priations Committee, Mr. ELLENDER, has constantly reminded Members of this body of the necessity for early enactment of needed appropriation au1\u00b7horization measures. As re:::ently as last Wednesday, June 7, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana <Mr. ELLENDER) reported on the status of appropriation bills, noting that the Approrriations Committee has reported the bill making appropriations for such departments as that of Com\u00ad merce. And that committee shortly will be reporting the bill for the Department of Transportation, each of whic-h will be held on the Calendar and each of which will contain a general provision stipulat\u00ad ing that the funds ~hall te available only upon enactment of authorizing legisla\u00ad tion. Mr. President, H.R. 13324 does pro\u00ad vide for needed appropriation authoriza\u00ad tiJns. would authorize funds to be ap\u00ad propriated for construction-differential subsidy for needed construction and re\u00ad construction of merchant vessels; the payment of obligations incurred for ship operation subsidies; maritime research and development activities; expenses of our national defense reserve :fleet; and maritime training at the Merchant Ma\u00ad rine Academy at Kings Point and the sever?! State marine schools. I know of no one, Mr. President, who is opposed to such vital appropriation authorizations. Yet, Mr. President, owing to this most inapp .opriat-\u00b7 committee amendment made to thi: authorization measure, H.R. 13324, which now needs only final action by the Eenate, the approJ:riations neces\u00ad eary for us to move forward with our na\u00ad tional ma:itime program aye being placed in jeopardy. - -Mr. President, I understand perfectly that there is a very natural and laudable pressure being exerted by many to get more and more of our commodities shipped in American-flag ships. We have all been in sympathy with that. But it is not so vital in this instance to provide that 50 percent of oil imported shall be in American bottoms, because in the letter I am about to insert in the RECORD the Department of Commerce indicates the recommendations and the specific legis\u00ad lation it intends to bring up to the Con\u00ad gress, and bring up not later than the corning September 15. This, I hope, win recei\\ e the attention of Senators who will perhaps be im\u00ad pressed by maritin1e people, maritime workers, and union organizations, who want them to adopt the amendment at this time. Among the measures in the legislation that will be sent up by the Commerce Department will be one that includes a federally funded ship con\u00ad struction program permitting Govern\u00ad ment leasing of ships to private opera\u00ad tors. I am talking about oil tanker ships. Further construct :.on incentives, such as loan guarantee and interest subsi'\"Ls. Retroactive construction sub3idies. Rate subsidies. Provisions to offset, in whole or in part, tax disadvantages on U.S.-:fiag operations as compared to foreign operations. All of this is in the works, to get Ameri\u00ad can-flag oil tankers operating. But in\u00ad stead of waiting for that-and the wait would be very brief-we have this highly controversial amendment attached to an authorization bill. This astounds me. One thing the Comrni ttee on Commerce has been identified with for not only this session and not only this Congress, but the last two Congresses, has been the protection of the consumer. If this amendment is adopted, in the haste that we must of necessity follow to get this authorization bill through for maritime appropriations, despite the exceptions in\u00ad volved, it will mean a higher cost for oil throughout this whole country, and par\u00ad ticularly in the Northern States, where we have hard winters. It will mean, for example, another th!'eJ.t and another handicap to our pro\u00ad du~tion of power, which may well hasten blackouts o1\u00b7 brownouts. From an ecolog\u00ad ical viewpoint, in my State, for instance, at least one new powerplant is being con\u00ad structed that will use crude oil for the production of the power, and it will cause the use of No. 2 oil in industrial plants, schools, large apartment houses, and elsewhere. It will mean greater scarcity of oil. and it will mean a higher price to the consumer, which is something that strikes very hard against our people, par\u00ad ticularly in my section of New England, but to a certain extent throughout the country and to a very distinct extent in the Northern States, in cold climates. Therefore, in conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that I strongly supported the Merch3nt Marine Act of :970 enacted during the last Congress. I support the appropriation authorizations to move forward with the maritime program set forth in that act. But I cannot in all good conscience to my constituents and to the consumers of this country, support H.R. 13324 so long as section 3, providing as it does for an oil t.nport cargo preference for U.S.-flag vessels, remains L\"l this bill. Mr. President, I ask un~nimous con\u00ad sent to have printed in the RECORD my letter to Secretary of Commer ce Peterson dated June 7, and the reply from the Secretary of Commerce to me dated June 12. There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: JUNE 7, 1972. Hon. PETER G. PETERSON, Secretary , Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. SECRETARY; As you no doubt are aware, the Senate Committee on Commerce has ordered reported the bill, H.R. 13324, which would authorize appropriations for the fiscal year 1973 for c::Jrtain maritime programs of your Departme nt. However, in reporting this legislative measure the Com\u00ad mittee also made some substantive amend\u00ad ments to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended. One of those substantive amend\u00ad ments to the 1936 Act would require that at least 50% of all oil imported into the United States on \"a quota basis, allocations or li\u00ad censes\", excluding residual fuel oil to be used as fuel and No. 2 fuel oil, be carried on board vessels of the United States. I opposed this oil import cargo preference amendment when it was considered in Executive Session cf the Committee, and it is my intention to oppose it vigorously at such time as the bill, H.R. 13324, is considered by the Senate. In this connection, although the Commit\u00ad tee Report accompanying H.R. 13324 has not been filed as of this date, it will be shortly. And, it is my understanding that in justifi\u00ad cation of this oil import cargo preference amendment considerable reliance will be placed in that report upon the answers of the Maritime Administration when respond\u00ad ing to written questions submitted to it by the House Comrnitee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries concerning the bill, H.R. 12324. These responses were submitted to the House Committee over the signature of Mr. Robert J. Blackwell, Acting Assistant Secretary for Maritime Affairs, and serve to raise a very strong inference that your Department sup\u00ad ports such an oil import cargo preference amendment to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended. In order that the record may be clear on this point, Mr. Secretary, I wish to know whether the position of the Department of Commerce is, in fact, in support of this cil import cargo preference amendment. Your early reply to this request, and such additional comments as you may wish to make on this subject, will be appreciated. With best wishes, Sincerely , Hon. NoRRIS CorroN, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. NORRIS COTTON, U.S. Senator . JUNE 12, 1972. DEAR SENATOR COTTON: This is in re::ponse to your letter of June 7, 1972, requesting the p::>S.\\tion of the Department of Commerce with respect to the oil import cargo prefer\u00ad ence amendment associated with the bill H.R. 13324. Tho Departmental position remains as stated in our letter to Chairman Garmatz of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, dated April 28, 1972, and our letter to Chairman Magnuson of the Senate Commerce Committee, dated May 2, 1972. In those letters, this Department reaffirms its support of the goal of developing and main\u00ad taining a. strong and vigorous U.S.-tanker fleet but also states its view that the Presi\u00ad dent's Maritime Program is the more ap\u00ad propriate vehicle for achieving this g04U. We June 13, 1972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 20331 believe further information, set forth be\u00ad low, on the steps being taken by the Admin\u00ad istration toward such a U.S. tanker fleet goal would be appropriate. First of all, the Departme nt, in cooperati on with the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Navy Department, is updating the analysis of the nature and size of the U.S. flag tanker fleet nece~sary to respond to our Na\u00ad tion's requirements. This study includes determination of the fleet necessary to re\u00ad spond to changes which may arise in na\u00ad tional security requirements from increases in oil imports as a percentage of the na\u00ad tional energy supply, and from any decline in the number of naval auxiliary tankers in operation. Further, the Administration is evaluating various initiatives to bring into being and sustain an appropriate fleet level. As indi\u00ad cated in our aforementioned letters to the Chairmen, we believe the 1970 amendments to the Merchant Marine Act provide the basic tools to create a healthy and competi\u00ad tive fleet. However , our current analysis in\u00ad cludes identification and evaluation of fur\u00ad ther legislative changes to that Act. We h:lve already concluded that the restrictions on the ownership of foreign assets and on trad\u00ad ing flexibility should be removed from the Merchant Marine Act. Moreover, we are al~o evaluating other initiatives including: Federally-funded ship constructi on pro\u00ad grams permitting government leasing of ships to private operators. Further construction incentives such as loan guarantees and interest subsidie s. Retroa.ctive construc tion subsidies. Rate subsidies . Provisions to offset in wh:>le or in part tax disadvantages of U.S. flag operation as com\u00ad pared to foreign operation. We expect to make our findings and recom\u00ad mendations on these and other possible ini\u00ad tiatives available to the interested Commit\u00ad tees of both Houses not later than Septem\u00ad ber 15, 1972. This report would also include a comparison of such initiatives with the proposal that commercial oil imports be re\u00ad served by law to U.S. flag tankers. Accordingly, the Department and the Ad\u00ad ministration believe it inappropriate to adopt oil import cargo preference at this time, and therefore would hope that congressional ac\u00ad tion on the authorization for Maritime ap\u00ad propriations could be pursued independently. Sincerely, PETER G. PETERSON. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1972 The Senate continued with the con\u00ad sideration of the bill <S. 3390) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and for other purposes.

HO ~USE OF REPRESENTATIVES-Tuesday, June 13, 1972 The House met at 12 o'clock noon. Rev. John Brennan O.S.F.S., Father Judge High School, Philadelphia, Pa., offered the following prayer: Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will.-Mark 11: 24. God our Father, grant us a sense of Your presence as we stand before You in this moment of morning prayer. Bless, we pray, our President and gov\u00ad ernmental leaders all over this land. Bless these men and women of the House of Representatives who bear the honor and responsibility of public trust. Inspire them to create Your kingdom of justice on this earth, in which each man renders justice to his fellow man, each citizen to his government, and government to each citizen. Grant them the practical wisdom to resolve the diffi\u00ad cult issues related to the education of all Your children. Through their efforts, may this great Republic become evermore truly one nation, under You, our God, with liberty and justice for alL Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has ex\u00ad amined the J oumal of the last day's pro\u00ad ceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Without objection, the Journal stands approved. There was no objection. MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Arrington, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate agrees to the report of the committee of conference on the dis\u00ad agreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill <H.R. 9580) entitled \"An act to author\u00ad ize the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to enter into agreemenU; with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland concerning the fees for the operation of certain motor vehicles. The message also announced that the Senate had passed a concurrent resolu\u00ad tion of the following title, in which the concurrence of the House is requested: S. Con. Res. 82. Concurrent resolution to express the sense of the Congress that the U.S. Government urge the establishment of a United Nations Voluntary Fund for the Environment to which the United States would contribute its fair share. TRIDUTE TO REVEREND JOHN BRENNAN, O.S.F.S. Mr. EILBERG. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Father Brennan for his most inspirational prayer. At the same time I want to point out that I invited Father Brennan to deliver the invocation today, because he is a most articulate spokesman for the movement to get Gov\u00ad ernment aid for the private school sys\u00ad tems of this country, particularly those in the great cities. These schools provide an education for thousands of children who would other\u00ad wise place an additional burden on pub\u00ad lic school systems which are already failing. Father Brennan is a teacher at Father Judge High School, which is a Roman Catholic high school in my district, which takes in all of northeast Philadel\u00ad phia. He is also president of the Council of Religious Teachers which represents many of the nuns, priesU;, and brothers who teach in the Philadelphia archdio\u00ad cesan school system. Because of his experience as a teacher and the time he has spent studying the system during his term as president of the council, Father Brennan knows the problems and the needs of the big city private school system. He knows that they must have massive Federal aid if they are to survive and if they are going to continue providing children with an excellent education. SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT (Mr. BUCHANAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re\u00ad marks.) Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to call to the attention of the House the action of the House Foreign Affairs Committee this morning in re\u00ad porting out a resolution which it was my privilege to offer in committee in sup\u00ad port of the President's position in Indo\u00ad china. I should particularly like to express my appreciation for the statesmanship dis\u00ad played by Members on the other side, who stood on this critical issue in sup\u00ad port of our President. This was in keep\u00ad ing with our committee's historic record of bipartisanship in matters of high na\u00ad tional priority. I believe it was a blow for peace in Indochina and a blow for peace in our time. "}
