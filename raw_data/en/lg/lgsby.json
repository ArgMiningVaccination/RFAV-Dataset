The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. Infection control refers to policies and procedures used to minimize the risk of spreading infections in hospitals and human or even animal health care facilities. The purpose of the infection control is to reduce infectious disease. These diseases are usually caused by bacteria or viruses and can be spread by human to human contact, animal to human contact, human contact with an infected surface. Consumer rights are focused on protecting from hazardous goods, right to be informed about false and misleading information, right to choose services in terms of price and quality, and the right to be 2. Your immune system is constantly working to fight off foreign invaders. The body recognizes its own cells from foreign cells by protein markers or antigens. As the B and T cells form the can tell the difference between your own cells and foreign cells. B and T cells help form a memory for your immune system. Through much scientific research, a bacteria called Yersinia Pestis was discovered. This bacteria is spread by both animals and insects. This specific bacteria attacks the lymph system causing the infection to spread throughout the body. The reservoirs of this bacteria and disease are mice, rats, squirrels and other small animals. A reservoir is a host of an infection. The vector, meaning carrier, is insects such as fleas and The year is 1778, the place is Valley Forge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. George Washington and many other revolutionary soldiers are here. I am one of them. Valley Forge is a Winter Camp we have built to keep an eye on the British. Life here is torture. Everyday I see my friends and fellow soldiers die. I have been here eight months with only one more to go. I cannot wait to leave this god-forsaken place. But George Washington and others would like me to stay to fight for what is right. I can not stay here, for it is unbearable. There is not enough food to go around, illness and disease are spreading like wildfire, and the living conditions are horrid. Infection control refers to action devoted to policies and procedures that reduce the risk of spreading infections, reduce the occurrence of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasite. The infectious diseases are normally spread by human to human, human to animal contact or by ingestion of food, droplet in the air, and contact with a surface that is the vehicle of the infective agent. H1N1, commonly known as the swine flu, a viral infection, was a cause of 2009 world-wide pandemic. The virus was first found in pigs, but a similar virus also found in humans. The virus spreads in a same manner as any other seasonal flu, mainly by droplets (small particles in the air) when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks, but also by touching Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a disorder in which the body 's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances the symmetrical weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all and/or the person is almost totally paralyzed. In some severe cases the disorder is life threatening- potentially interfering with breathing and sometimes with blood pressure or heart rate. Becase of these consequences it can be referred to as a medical emergency. Many individuals that have this disorder are often put on a ventilator So, what is the definition of health care associated infections? They are infections that patients acquire while being hospitalized to receive treatment for their conditions either medical or surgical. Many of the HCAIs are preventable. In the modern healthcare, there are many types of invasive procedures that is used to treat patients to help them recover, also some devices are used, and all can be a potential risk for transmitting an infection to the patient while receiving the treatment. Vaccinations have been promoted since 1781, vaccinations are injected for Americans to maintain a healthy life and not become ill due to disease caused from measles, mumps, polio and several other diseases. However, there are those that do not agree with getting their children vaccinated due to religious beliefs and there are some people believe vaccinations can cause birth defects. Although, those are their beliefs; however there are those that enter our nation without being vaccinated and it is ultimately putting our children at risk for contracting various diseases, for example the Disneyland measles outbreak of 2014. This paper will specialize on a specific type of bacterial foodborne illness caused by the bacteria Escherichia Coli. E. coli was discovered by Theodore von Escherich in 1885. E.coli is a natural found bacteria that lies throughout the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals and comes in many forms only one of which is deadly. This form is E. coli 0157:H7 which can be caused by direct exposure to fecal matter to kill this rouge E.coli the contaminated material must be cooked at 160 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. In the United States every year 73,000 people are afflicted with this rouge E.coli in which an average of 61 people die. One other form of E.coli that can be detrimental to your health is the Shiga producing E.coli 026 (STEC 026) Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel Immunity is when a person is in a state of being resistant to a particular pathogen. The two types of defense are innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the defenses present at birth and always present to protect us against diseases. Innate immunity does not have a memory response but helps to prevent microbes from gaining access to the body and helps to eliminate those that enter the body. An example of the first line of defense is intact skin and an example of the second line of defense is fever. In an immunologically na\u00efve host, viruses attach to the host cells (Tortora, & Funke, 2013). The human body provides the ideal environment for the microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi to enter the body. Thus, it is the jobs of the immune system to keep them out by protect the body from the harmful substances. Immune system is when the networks of cells and tissues work together to defend the body against the foreign invaders.(Menche,2012 and National Institute Health,2003). According to the Latin word, immune come from the word immunis which is free or untouched. So it is mean that our body must free from the all pathogens that can lead to the diseases. The immune system also can recognize all the millions of the foreign invaders by attacking them and prevent them from enter the body, thus There are numerous amounts of diseases all over the world. In the present time, these diseases are cured or contained by vaccines. A couple centuries ago, doctor Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine in 1796. He discovered this vaccine by observing his ambiance. Jenner realized that milkmaids (tend to cattle) frequently contracted cowpox, but after they convalesced they were immune to the deadlier disease smallpox. So Jenner said, \"Why not infect people with cowpox to confer immunity to the more dangerous disease.\" With his research, he got the pus from a milkmaid who had cowpox and put it on a small healthy eight-year-old boys cut. Eventually, the boy was infected with cowpox, how Jenner predicted. When he "}
