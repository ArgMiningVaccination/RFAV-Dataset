News Volume 8 Number s 5-6 Published on: 7 and 14 Febr uary 2014 UK measles cases in travellers returning from the Philippines An outbreak of measles has been reported in the Philippines [1] in connection with which 10 cases have been reported in t he UK (to date, since 1 December 2013) in persons returning from the country. Public Health England's Immunisation Department has advised health protection teams that they may receive an increased number of notifications of suspected measles cases in trav ellers from the Philippines, or alerts of contacts of measles cases on flights from the country. Current advice is that individuals with clinical features compatible with measles illness who have recently travelled to the Philippines should be treated as likely measles cases, and public health actions - such as identifying vulnerable contacts - commenced ahead of laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. Ages of the UK cases ranged from less than one year to 45 years. Five cases were in children under two years of age, of which three were under 13 months of age and therefore not yet eligible for immunisation. The majority of the cases (eight) had travelled to the Philippines to visit family and friends and at least four cases were infectious on their flight back to the UK raising the possibility of onward transmission and further cases occurring. All the cases presented to frontline healthcare services with a rash illness and in some instances patients were not isolated immediately, exposing healthcare work ers and other vulnerable patients. Health protection teams were reminded that healthcare workers who have had a significant exposure to a measles case should be able to demonstrate satisfactory evidence of protection against measles to continue working, as per national guidance [2]. The Philippines outbreak has prompted a reminder from the PHE -commissioned National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) about the need for all travellers to ensure they are up to date with all vaccines (including MMR) ac cording to the current UK schedule, as travel is a factor in internation al spread of the infection [3] .

Health Protection Report Vol 8 Nos. 5/6 - 7 and 14 February 2014 Laboratory confirmed pertussis in England: data to end -December 2013 With the exception of a small expecte d seasonal peak in July and August 2013, pertussis activity in England has continued to fall through to December 2013 but persists at raised levels compared to recent years. Immunisation of pregnant women continues to be important in the face of these persisting raised levels of pertussis. This news report presents current pertussis activity to 31 December 2013, updating the previous report that included data to the end of September 2013 [1]. A level 3 incident was declared in April 2012 to coordinate the response to the ongoing increased pertussis activity observed in the third quarter of 2011 and extending into 2012 (figure 1) [2]. In response to this ongoing outbreak, the Department of Health announced on 28 September [3,4] that pertussis immunisation wo uld be offered to pregnant women from 1 October 2012 to protect infants from birth whilst disease levels remain high. It has been confirmed that this programme will be continued in 2013/2014 until further notice, pending further advice from the Joint Commi ttee on Vaccination and Immunisation [5]. All infants under 16 months are now in the cohort born to mothers who were eligible for pertussis - containing vaccine in pregnancy. In England there was a fall in confirmed cases of pertussis from July/August 2012 through to December 2012 in infants under one year (figure 2) in whom low numbers of cases have been sustained through to December 2013. In infants aged less than three months there were four confirmed cases in November and three in December 2013; these nu mbers are lower than the equivalent period in 2012 with 23 in November and nine cases in December. Disease incidence does, as expected, continue to be highest in this age group. There were no pertussis related infant deaths reported in November and Decembe r 2013 (provisional). In England overall laboratory confirmed pertussis cases fell each month from November 2012 to June 2013, then increased slightly in July and August 2013 before decreasing again in September through to December 2013, in line with seas onal trends (figure 1). Provisional data show that in November and December 2013, 226 and 219 cases respectively were newly confirmed (table 1), compared with 306 cases in October. Whilst the overall number of cases has fallen, large numbers of cases conti nue to be confirmed in individuals aged 15 years or older with 180 cases reported in December 2013, compared to 666 in December 2012 and 126 in December 2011 (table 1). In those aged 10 -14 years there were 22 cases confirmed in December 2013; 77 in Decembe r 2012; and 23 in December 2011. Whilst cases were lower in all age groups in 2013 when compared to 2012, the impact was greatest in infants aged less than three months. This specific effect on infants covered by the maternal immunisation programme is con sistent with a programme effect. Between January and December 2013 there were 116 confirmed cases in infants under one year of age compared to 508 in 2012 and 207 in 2011. The situation will continue to be monitored. High pertussis activity has been obser ved across all regions in England and Wales (table 2). In Wales 12 laboratory confirmed cases were reported in November and five in December 2013 compared to 59 cases in November and 40 in December 2012. Information on the uptake of pertussis immunisation in pregnant women has been published for women giving birth up to the end September 2013 [6]. The latest provisional data suggests that coverage fell from a peak of 59.6% in February 2013 to a low of 49.8% in June 2013 and increasing to an estimated 56.4% for women giving birth in August and September 2013. Current high levels of reporting may, in part, be due to increased awareness amongst health professionals improving case ascertainment in older age groups. This is reflected by the increased demand for serology testing which is the predominant method of confirmation in adolescents and adults who typically present with milder features late in the course of the illness. However, it is considered that the increases that have been observed reflect a real ch ange in pertussis activity with waning immunity following vaccination and/or natural infection likely to be important contributory factors [7]. This is supported by the high number of confirmed cases in infants under three months of age in whom ascertainme nt has been more consistent through time.

Health Protection Report Vol 8 Nos. 5/6 - 7 and 14 February 2014 Coordination of public health response to flooding in south west England and Wales Public Health England's advice to government, to local authorities and to other partners about potential health consequences of the recent flooding in sou th west England has been seen as a successful demonstration of the new public health system working together in response to an emergency. PHE's Devon, Cornwall and Somerset Centre worked alongside Somerset's Director of Public Health, to provide timely a dvice to the public and media, and with national PHE colleagues to keep the Department of Health fully briefed. Consistency of advice on communicable disease risks and other health impacts was facilitated by a scientific and technical advice cell (STAC) set up at the request of the chair of Strategic Coordinating Group. Local residents in flooded areas were reminded of the importance of avoiding contact with flood water, washing hands and food preparation surfaces and not eating food that had touched flo od water [1,2]. Experience from previous floods in the UK has been that no significant communicable disease risks have resulted (eg no significantly increased rates of gastrointestinal illness), whereas psychological impact and dist ress caused has been no ted [3] .

Travel history In the fourth quarter, travel history was known for 68 cases (67 from enhanced surveillance forms and one from laborator y data); 63 (93%) cases had travelled abroad . Travel -associated cases Travel -associated cases were likely to have acquired their infection in : India ( 34), Pakistan (nine), Bangladesh ( nine), Nepal ( four), Thailand (two) , Malaysia (two) , Cambodia (two), a nd Morocco, Ghana, Myanmar, Somalia, Laos, Viet Nam, Cape Verde and Nigeria (one each). Some cases travelled to more than one country so totals above will not equal the number of total cases that travelled . Where multiple countries of travel have been st ated by the case, only risk countries , as identified by the National Travel Health Network and Centre [3], were included for analysis . If a case has travelled to multiple risk countries each country is counted individually . India and Pakistan continue to b e the most frequently reported countries of travel throughout the year (figure 3). Figure 3.

Anthrax There were no cases reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Brucellosis (data from the Brucella Reference Laboratories) There were no reports of Brucella confirmations during the fourth quarter of 2013, comp ared with two during the fourth quarter of 2012. This brings the total number of cases in 2013 to 13. Health Protection Report Vol. 8 Nos. 5/6 - 7 and 14 February 2014 Hepatitis E (data from Public Health Laboratory Birmingham, and Blood Borne Virus Unit Colindale) There were 193 cases of Hepatitis E in the fourth qu arter of 2013 compared to 157 in the same quarter of 2012. This gives a total of 676 cases for 2013, which is consistent with the on -going increase in cases observed since 2010 [1]. One hundred and seventeen cases (61%) were male (aged 22 -91 years, median 61) and 76 were female (aged 20 -93 years, median 63). Older men predominate and this is a persisting observation, although the excess remains unexplained. Cases were reported from all regions. The majority of cases (72%, n=138) had no apparent travel histo ry.

This brings the total number of cases reported in 2013 to 11. The case in the fourth quarter of 2013 was a 34 year old fema le. She is understood to have been born overseas and to have had exposures unrelated to her residence in the UK. Leptospirosis (data from the Leptospira Reference Unit) There were 10 cases of leptospirosis reported in the fourth quarter of 2013, compar ed with 25 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This brings the total number of cases reported in 2013 to 47. Of the 10 cases reported in the fourth quarter, five were acquired in the UK and five were acquired overseas. Four of the autochthonous cases occurred i n males aged 44 to 64 years, one of whom died, and one case occurred in a female aged 42 years (median age of the five cases was 56 years). Leptospira Icterohaemorrhagiae was identified in one case, while the infecting serovar was not determined for the ot hers. One case lived on a canal boat and contracted leptospirosis following immersion, one was exposed to a stream at the bottom of his garden and one case followed exposure at a rubbish re -cycling site; exposures for the other two cases were not recorded. Two of the cases were confirmed by PCR in addition to serological diagnosis. The five cases acquired overseas all occurred in males (aged 21 -49 years, median 37). Three reported exposures in South East Asian countries: one after swimming in a freshwater l ake and caving and hiking in Borneo, one after visiting an elephant sanctuary in Cambodia, and one in a case who visited Thailand although no specific exposure was recorded. The remaining two patients were exposed in Europe: one reported walking barefoot t hrough marshes in Spain, the Health Protection Report Vol. 8 Nos. 5/6 - 7 and 14 February 2014 other developed his illness after fishing for eels in a Polish lake. One patient was confirmed to be infected with L. Icterohaemorrhagiae, whilst the serovar was not determined for the remaining four. One infection was confirme d by PCR. Confirmations by PCR (undertaken by the Leptospira Reference Unit (LRU) and the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Porton) remain a developmental test with limited technical validation. Clinicians are asked to submit a second specimen from t he patient to the LRU, together with exposure and clinical histories, as this increases the likelihood that the infecting serovar can be identified. Lyme disease (data from the Lyme Borreliosis Unit) Two hundred and twenty one confirmed cases of Lyme bo rreliosis were reported during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 250 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This brings the provisional total number of cases in 2013 to 930. The cases in the fourth quarter came from patients in all age groups; 100 were fem ale and 111 were male (the sex was not given for 10 cases). One hundred and forty five cases were identified as being recent infections, and 76 as being previous or treated infections. Twenty four (11%) cases reported travel histories to northern European countries: France (5), Poland (4), the Czech Republic (3), Germany (2), Sweden (2) and the USA (2). Reports were received from patients in all regions of England and Wales, especially from the South of England (75) and London (38). Pasteurellosis One hun dred and twenty five cases of pasteurellosis were reported in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 122 in the fourth quarter of 2014: Pasteurella multocida (84 cases, 67.2%), Pasteurella canis (two cases, 1. 6%) and Pasteurella sp. (32 cases, 25.6%). This brings the total number of cases in 2013 to 578. In the fourth quarter, 61 of the cases were male (0 -90 years, median 55) and 63 were female (0 - 94 years, median 54). No deaths were reported. The South of Engl and reported the most cases (38), and Wales reported the fewest (6). Of the 21 cases giving an animal exposure, thirteen reported cat bites and eight reported dog bites .

T his brings the total number of cases in 2013 to 29. Seven of the cases from the fourth quarter of 2013 were male (aged 37 -84, median 53) and three were female (aged 35 -56 years, median 42). Seven of the cases were from the South of England, two from the Mi dlands and East of England, and one from Wales. Note: Serological tests for respiratory chlamydophila infections cannot consistently distinguish psittacosis. The cases reported above have been identified by reporting laboratories as infection with Chlamydi a psittaci . Q fever (data from the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Porton, and Bristol Reference Laboratory) Thirteen cases were reported in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 14 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This brings the total number of cases in 2013 to 44, a substantial decrease from the 114 cases reported during 2012. Five cases were female (aged 3 -70 years, median 64) and eight were male (aged 23 -76, median 65.5). Five cases were reported by the North of England, three each by the S outh of England and London, and one each by Wales and the Midlands and East of England regions. Toxoplasma (data from the Toxoplasma Reference Unit) There were 83 cases of toxoplasmosis infection reported in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 86 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This brings the total number of cases for 2013 to 311 (see table below . Nine of the cases in the fourth quarter of 2013 reported ocular symptoms. Twelve cases occurred in pregnant women and one congenital case was reported ( forming a mother -child pair with one of the pregnant cases) (see table below, following page) .

Infection reports Volume 8 Number 6 Published on: 14 February 2014 Emerging infections/CJD CJD biannual update (2014/1), with briefing on novel human prion disease This six -monthly report provides an update on the enhanced surveillance of pote ntial iatrogenic (healthcare -acquired) exposures to Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease (CJD). The data is correct as at 31 December 2013. For numbers of CJD case reports, readers should consult data provided by the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDR SU, http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/data.html ). A briefing on a prion disease - Variably Protease -Sensitive Prionopathy - is also presented below . Monitoring of patients 'at increased ris k' of CJD Individuals who have been identified as at increased risk of CJD as a consequence of their medical care are informed of their exposure and asked to follow public health precautions to avoid potentially transmitting the infection to others. They are also followed -up to help determine the risks of CJD transmission to patients through different routes and to ascertain whether any people who may have been exposed to increased CJD risks go on to develop CJD. Public health follow -up activities include clinical monitoring, general practitioner (GP) updates, and post mortem investigations to determine whether asymptomatic individuals in these groups have been infected with the CJD agent. Some individuals also provide blood or tissue specimens for researc h purposes. A number of different organisations are involved in these activities: Public Health England (formerly the Health Protection Agency), Health Protection Scotland (HPS), UCL Institute of Child Health/Great Ormond Street Hospital (ICH), NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU), National Prion Clinic (NPC), and the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO). The PHE CJD Section coordinates the collation of data on individuals identified as at increased risk of CJD, and who have been informed of this. These individuals are followed up through public health monitoring and research activities by different organisations (table 1). The PHE CJD Section currently holds data on the following groups of 'at risk' patients: recipients of blood components from donors who subsequently developed vCJD blood donors to individuals who later developed vCJD other recipients of blood components from these blood donors recipients of certain plasma products betw een 1990 and 2001 (non -bleeding disorder patients) certain surgical contacts of patients diagnosed with CJD highly transfused recipients. Health Protection Report Vol 8 No. 6 - 14 February 2014 Data on the following risk groups are not held by PHE, but are held by other organisations: bleeding disorder pa tients who received plasma products between 1990 and 2001 (UKHCDO) recipients of human derived growth hormone before 1985 (ICH) patients who could have received a dura mater graft before August 1992 (data not currently collected) people who have been tr eated with gonadotrophin sourced from humans before 1973 (data not currently collected) family risk of genetic prion disease (NPC). The data from the UKHCDO are likely to be an underestimate of the true number of 'at risk' patients with bleeding disorder s who received UK -sourced clotting factors, as there was incomplete reporting of identified 'at risk' patients by haemophilia centres to the UKHCDO database. Notified 'at risk' patients are given the option of removing their details from the UKHCDO databas e, and are then removed from the 'at risk' totals. The data on 'at risk' patients who received human -derived human growth hormone held by the ICH is a slight underestimate of the total as a small number of these patients are not included in the ICH follow -up.

Health Protection Report Vol 8 No. 6 - 14 February 2014 Variably Protease -Sensitive Prionopathy Professor James W Ironside and Dr M ark W Head, The National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit, University of Edinburgh. Variably protease -sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is the most recently identified human prion disease, first described in the USA by Gambetti et al. in 2008 as \"a novel h uman disease with abnormal prion protein sensitive to protease\" [1]. Since then, similar cases have been identified in other countries; the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit has identified nine cases in the UK, three of which have been identified retrospectively and the others prospectively from samples and data collected since 1991 [2 -6]. Other candidate cases are currently under investigation. Patients with VPSPr have no identified risk factors for acquired human prion disease and no associated mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP) coding sequence have been found. In the original description a proportion of the patients had family histories of ill - defined dementia, but this has not been a feature in more recently identified cases [1,2,6]. VPSPr affects patients in the same age range as sporadic Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (sCJD), occurring mostly in patients over the age of 60. The clinical features are more varied than in sCJD and include movement abnormalities, cognitive decline and unsteadi ness while walking. The clinical illness is longer than for sCJD; most patients survive for over a year before succumbing to the illness. Diagnostic clinical criteria are therefore difficult to establish, and further work is required on this topic since th is disease is likely to be under -ascertained [2,6]. Like sCJD, VPSPr occurs in all genetic groups defined by the polymorphism at codon 129 in the PRNP gene, ie MM, MV and MV. Unlike sCJD, there is a preponderance of the codon 129 -V haplotype. VPSPr has di stinctive neuropathological features, the most typical of which are microplaques that occur in a target -like arrangement and are particularly common in the cerebellum. These microplaques show differential staining with a panel of different anti -PrP antibod ies, allowing a distinction from both the common sCJD VV2 and the rare sCJD VV1 subtypes [1,2,5,6]. The most distinctive and defining feature of VPSPr is the biochemistry of the abnormal prion protein in the brain, which is only poorly resistant to proteol ytic digestion, yielding a low abundance, truncated 8kDa (approx) band in Western blot assays [1]. This fragment is often accompanied by a faint ladder of bands extending into the 18 -30kDa range [1,2]. Some cases of VPSPr also show a sCJD -like pattern on W estern blot analysis for abnormal prion protein, often in the cerebellum, suggesting molecular overlaps between VPSPr and sCJD [6,7]. Further work is required to fully establish the epidemiology, clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria and transmiss ion characteristics of VPSPr. The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (ACDP TSE) Subgroup concluded that until further research can demonstrate how transmissible VPSPr may be, it would be advisable to add this novel form of human prion disease to the infection control guidance for CJD and other related disorders.
