N/A Civil Division: Overview MISSION: The Civil Division represents the United States in any civil or criminal matter within its scope of resp onsibility - protectin g the public fisc, ensuring that the Federal G overnment speaks with one voice in its view of the law, preserving the intent of Congre ss, and advancing the credibility of the government before the courts. The Civil Division's role is tw o-fold in that it must repres ent some 200 federal agencies and Congress while maintaining uniformity in governm ent policy. For any particular case, Civil must provide the best possible re presentation to the client agency involved. This responsibility must be balanced with the need to represent the government as a whole and to ensure lasting precedents favorable to the United States. Generally, the Division's litigation falls into one of the following categories: Cases that involve national policies: o The Child Online Protection Act was signed into law in 1998 and was intended to protect minors from sexually explicit material on the Internet. This law has drawn First Amendment legal challenges in court. Cases that are so massive and span so many years that they would overwhelm the resources and infrastructure of any individual field office: o The United States Army Corps of Engin eers (the Corps) has received nearly 490,000 administrative claims arising fr om the damages caused by Hurricane Katrina. The ensuing litigation will be th e largest group of cases ever handled by the Civil Division and could span many years, possibly even decades. Cases filed in national or foreign courts: o Nuclear utilities filed 66 claims agains t the Department of Energy (DOE) in the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging breach of contract for DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. Cases that cross multiple jurisdictions: o Pharmaceutical fraud cases often involve overlapping claims, defendants, and witnesses. The Civil Division plays a cri tical role in ensuring that investigations and litigation are properly coordina ted among federal a nd state entities. The Civil Division workload exceeds 50,000 cases and administrative claims annually. The overwhelming majority - about 89 percent - of these cases are defe nsive. Each year, thousands of lawsuits are filed against the government as a result of its policies, laws, and involvement in commercial activities, domestic and foreign operat ions and entitlement programs, as well as law enforcement initiatives, military actions, and counter terrorism efforts. Civil defeats billions of dollars in unmeritorious claims every year. Th e Division also brings suits on behalf of the 1 2United States, primarily to recoup money lost through fraud, loan defaults, and the abuse of federal funds. Annually, millions, and often billions, of dollars are returned to the treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs as a result of Civil' s affirmative litigation efforts. The Civil Division is also responsible for th e administration of two compensation programs created by the National Childhood Vaccine Inju ry Act of 1986 and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) of 1990. Finally, Civil Division attorneys play a significan t leadership role within the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Branch. The Di vision consults with and advises the United States Attorneys, other DOJ comp onents, and client agencies to ensure that the government's litigation position is unified, consistent, and successf ul. With respect to client agencies, Civil Division attorneys work closely w ith agencies' general counsels to head off potential litigation and prevent unfavorable outcomes should cases proceed in court. It is possible for the public to better understa nd the responsibilities a nd goals of the Civil Division. Electronic copies of DOJ's Congressional Budget Justifications and Capi tal Asset Plan and Business Case exhibits can be viewed or downloaded from the Internet using the Internet address: http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/2009justification . Full Program Costs Funds for the Legal Representation Decision Unit, the Civil Division's only decision unit, are devoted almost entirely to front-line litigation in observance of the management initiatives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (2007-2012). Of the Division's roughly 1,200 employees, the vast majority are assigned to the six litigating branches. In FY 2007, $383,200,000 was available to the Divisi on, exclusive of the RECA Trust Fund (see Civil's RECA Trust Fund Budget). Fifty-four percent of this funding came from the GLA appropriation while forty-six pe rcent was provided through DOJ allotments and reimbursements. The table on the following page di splays a list of the Civil Division's funding sources, including appropriations and reimbursements. 3 Civil Division Funding Sources (Dollars in Millions) Appropriations 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Legal Representation (GLA) 162.5 167.5 174.4 174.9 192.2 208.3 Immigration & Katrina Emergency Supplemental 0 0 0 0 9.6 0 RECA - Admin.

For FY 2009, the Division requests 1,338 positions (957 attorneys), 1,332 FTE, and $270,431,000 to meet its mission and performance goals. Issues, Strategies, and Outcomes Between FY 2006 and FY 2009, the Civil Division's workload is expected to grow from approximately 53,532 to 60,219 cases - an increase of 13 percent - primarily as a result of continued growth in immigration cases and administrative tort claims. However, this number belies the true extent of the workload, as the Division is handli ng over 489,000 administrative claims that have been filed with the Corps seek ing damages associated with Hurricane Katrina. These administrative claims, while not included in the Division's total numbers, are very time- consuming. 4External Challenges: Because the Civil Division's workload is mostly defensive, it cannot control the number of cases filed, the timing of discove ry, the size of evidentia ry collections, the time span of litigation, or the scheduling of trials. The type, volume, a nd size of the cases are determined by several exogenous factors: Military Actions Natural Disasters Influx of Illegal Aliens Challenges to Agency Actions Statutory Enactments Bankruptcies Counterterrorism Measures Whistleblower Referrals Vaccine Program Expansion Federal Procurement Actions Internal Challenges: The external challenges create the Division's greatest internal challenge: the unpredictable volume and nature of the cases assigned to the Division. The Division typically does not have the flexibility to adequately respond to a huge influx of cases, esp ecially when the litigation involves massive volumes of evidentiary material and requi res substantial litigati on support. To address these challenges, the Division has used other mechanisms to secure the necessary funding to assist the government in taking on these complex and resource-intensive cases: Vigorously pursue agency reimbursements. Reallocate work to the extent feasible. Identify prior year balances that can be made available to the Automated Litigation Support (ALS) no-year fund. These strategies have varied in their success rate. The Economy Act permits a federal agency to order supplies and services from another federal agency under certain conditions as prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Act was designed to promote economy in government operations by permitting interagency use of resources and contra cts. For example, the Corps is using the Civil Division's litigation support contracts to process the administrative claims it received following Hurricane Katrina. The Corps reimbursed the Division in FY 2007 and FY 2008 for costs associated with claims processing and document production for discovery in the related lawsuits. Section 109 of the 1995 Appropriations Act aut horizes, but does not compel, agencies to reimburse the Civil Division for all expenses in litigation with unusually high costs. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpor ation reimbursed the Division for the costs associated with the multi-billion dollar savings and loan litigation, which has continued for more than a decade. When overwhelmed with a flood of immigrati on cases, the Division de legated a portion of the briefs to other parts of the Departme nt of Justice, including the United States Attorneys' Offices. However, the other o ffices were soon saturated, and the Division ceased delegating immigration cases when additional resources were appropriated. Outcomes: Despite these challenges, the Division has ach ieved remarkable success in upholding national policies and in defending the publ ic fisc. See the Performance and Resource Tables on page 24 for more information. In FY 2007, the Division saved or recovered nearly $49 for every dollar spent. 5 6 This Page Intentionally Left Blank 7Appropriations Language and Analysis of Appropriations Language Appropriations Language The FY 2009 Budget request includes proposed changes in the appropriations language listed and explained below.

Each year the government undertakes millions of commercial transactions involving purchases, contracts, loans, grants, and the management of trust funds. Its policies a nd laws interplay with major counterterrorism activities, the environment, th e labor force, national and local economies, industry, and the prevention of crime. In total, 56,732 cases a nd matters were assigned to the Ci vil Division during FY 2007, and of this, the vast majority - 89 percent - were defensive. While plaintiffs in most defensive suits seek direct financial relief, some seek to fo rce programmatic changes that can have far-reaching effects on law enforcement practi ces, entitlement programs, and the implementation of federal statutes. Civil's affirmative work is a relative ly small, but critical, aspect of the Division's mission - securing billions of dollars owed to the government each year. The Civil Division is composed of six litiga ting branches and the Office of Management Programs, as described throughout the following pages. Appellate Staff Appellate Staff attorneys represent the United States at the highest levels of judicial re view. When the government receives an unfavorable trial decision, the Staff works closely with the Office of the Solicitor General to determine whether or not to seek appellate review. The docket includes challenges to the PATRIOT Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the policies of the Medicare and Medicaid program s. The Staff also handles a host of counterterrorism cases involving te rrorist surveilla nce activities, the freezing of terrorist assets, and the designa tion of foreign terrorist organizations. These responsibilities have increased si gnificantly with the en actment of the Milita ry Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006. The MCA eliminates habeas jurisdic tion of all courts with respect to claims by detainees held as enemy combatants or those awaiting enemy combatant status determinations, as well as jurisdiction over any other claims by such detainees. The MCA and the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) establish a mechanism for ex clusive review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of claims regarding the validity of the military's designation of a Guantanamo detainee as an en emy combatant and any conviction by a military commission. As of January 2008, 168 detainees have filed for review in the D.C. Circuit per the DTA and the MCA. These cases are handled by the Appellate Staff. Each case involves classified materials and presents serious issues of law and fact. The detainee couns el frequently seek emergency relief and expedition of their ca ses. Division attorneys anticipate that as many as 350 DTA cases will be filed in the court of a ppeals. In addition to the numerous DTA cases, the Guantanamo detainees have, in even greater nu mbers, filed habeas cases in district court. Over 350 detainees have filed su ch actions. Those actions have led to more than 100 related appeals filed in the D.C. Circuit, which are all ha ndled by the Appellate Staff. The viability of the habeas cases (and the relate d appeals) is currently unclear. On February 20, 2007, the D.C. Circuit decided in Boumediene that the MCA applie s to the habeas cases brought on behalf of aliens held at Guantanamo Bay and that the MCA is not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. The Supreme Court, however, granted certiora ri to review the court of appeals decision and heard the argument in December 2007. A decision is expected by June 2008. Appellate Staff Quick Facts 59 Authorized Attorney FTE - 2007 1,274 Cases Pending on January 6 10 11Torts Branch Federal Programs Federal Programs Quick Facts 109 Authorized Attorney FTE - 2007 1,398 Cases Pending on January 6 While other branches handle cases that directly involve the defens e of monetary claims and the recovery of monies owed to the government, mo st of the Federal Programs Branch's cases are not monetary. The attorneys annually handle hundreds of de fensive cases that are of unparalleled importance because of their far- reaching repercussions for government programs and policies. For example, they defend challenges to executive orders an d federal statutes, such as the Equal Pay Act and the Child Online Prot ection Act. Also, the Branch is currently handling several controversial housing-related laws uits as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Although a minority of their cases, the Branch prot ects the public fisc by defending government policies and programs involving th e distribution of monetary re sources and benefits. In addition, the Branch defends fede ral agency officials and actions. Eight states and the District of Columbia sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for a penalty assessed to them for failing to comply with child support enforcement program requirements as stated in their federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Fa milies (TANF) grants. In March 2007, the court agreed with the government that HHS reasonably interpreted TANF when it informed the states that they became subject to the pe nalty after failing to meet the requirements for two consecutive years. In another case, Students for Sensible Drug Policy Foundation v. Spellings , plaintiffs claimed that a provision of the Higher Edu cation Act of 1965, as amended, which suspends eligibility for federal financial aid for students who have been convicted of drug-related offenses, is unconstitutional. In granting the government's motion to dismiss this case against the Secretary of Education, the court cited the rational basis of the statute - deterring drug-related offenses on college campuses. The Branch's docket also includes a number of challenges to military policy, antiterrorism laws, and national security measures - most notably the hundreds of habeas co rpus actions filed on behalf of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Federal Pr ograms attorneys are working to get these cases dismissed in light of the MCA, which recognizes an opportunity for review in the D.C. Circuit. Related appeals are being handled by the Divisi on's Appellate Staff. Also, attorneys are handling challenges to the Departme nt of Defense's base closures. The four distinct sections within the Torts Bran ch are organized according to different areas of tort law: Environmental Torts, the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA), Constitutional and Specialized Torts, and Aviation and Admiralty Torts. The caseload includes traditional tort suits, such as alleged malpractice at federal medical facilities, environmental contamination cases, and maritime accident litigation. In addition to suits filed in federal courts, the Branch handles thousands of administrative claims every year. The Branch also administ ers the Vaccine Injury Compensation and Radiation E xposure Compensation Programs. One of the issues faced by the Torts Branch is how to deal with environmental contamination caused by various government activities. Although Congress has provided funds to clean up such contamination, tort suits are often brought against the United States seeking damages above and beyond the funds available. The Civil Divisi on works diligently to protect the public fisc when such lawsuits lack legal merit. Currently, Environmental Torts attorneys are representing the United States' interests in the World Trad e Center (WTC) litigation, which consists of approximately 6,000 administrative claims alleging personal injury following efforts to clean up the WTC Disaster Site, as well as five lawsuits. In Re World Trade Center Disaster Site Litigation represents the consolidation of these personal injury tort cases being brought against the City of New York and the ci ty's four primary contractors fo r the WTC recovery and cleanup, and numerous other entities. These claims seek, in aggregate, more than $1 billion. The United States has been named as a direct defendant in only three of the consol idated cases - and none have been properly served. However, if suits are brought, the litigation would be very resource- intensive. Torts attorneys also handle Bivens cases, which involve federa l employees who are personally sued for actions taken within the scope of thei r employment. Over the past 11 years, multiple allegations have been filed against federal officials in Cobell v. Kempthorne, including several Secretaries of the Department of the Interior (DOI) and other DOI officials. Several years ago, the district court held then-Secretary Gale Nort on and then-Assistant Secretary Neal McCaleb in contempt, for, among other things, failing pr operly to undertake an accounting project. However, the Bivens attorneys secured a decision from the appeals court that vacated the contempt ruling. Effective repres entation of such employees allows public servants to carry out their duties without fear of pers onal liability for their actions. The FTCA, enacted in 1946, allows citizens to sue the government in a federal court for injuries allegedly caused by the \"negligent or wrongful act of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or empl oyment.\" For any claim brought under the FTCA, the claimant must first file an administrative claim against the agency allegedly at fault. 12 The Branch's FTCA Staff is representing the government in over 300 lawsuits that have been filed as a result of the flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana on August 29, 2005, causing several breaches in the levees and flood walls surrounding the New Orleans area. It became one of the costliest natural disasters ever experienced in the United States. Nearly 490,000 administrative claims Source: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/photogalleries/ New_Orleans_flood/photo3.html have been filed with the Army Corps of Engineer s (the Corps). Claimants and plaintiffs seek compensation for personal injury, death, and proper ty damage suffered as a result of the failure of the flood protection system. They allege that the Corps negligently failed to build adequate flood protection and that the Co rps' negligent design, construc tion, and maintenance of a navigable waterway worsened the impact of Hurricane Katrina's storm surge. The tort suits against the United States, many of which are styled as class actions, are consolidated with hundreds of other cases under the umbrella caption In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation . One case, Robinson v. United States , has been designated as a \"test\" case. On January 11, 2008, the plaintiffs and the United States file d cross motions for summary judgment in Robinson on the issue of the United States' im munity pursuant to the Flood Control Act of 1928. The court ordered the parties to pr oceed with all merits discovery and to be prepared for a September 2008 trial of Robinson. Trials of other cases involving the United States are scheduled fo r spring and summer 2009. The Civil Division is working closely with the Corp s to ensure that the administrative claims are processed efficiently and that the United States receives the best possible representation in the litigation. The Corps agreed to reimburse th e Department of Justice during FY 2007 and FY 2008 for the costs that the Corps would have incurred for claims processing and discovery. In FY 2009, the three scheduled tria ls will require an unprecedented level of litigation support to manage millions of paper and electronic docum ents. A ruling against the government could ultimately lead to billions of dollars in tr easury losses and legal precedents that will have significant adverse conse quences in the future. 13Commercial Litigation Torts Branch Quick Facts 125 Authorized Attorney FTE - 2007 18,139 Cases and Administrative Claims Pending on January 6 (excluding Hurricane Katrina administrative claims) The Commercial Litigation Branch is the largest in the Civil Division and is divided into five sections: Intellectual Property, Corporate/Financial, Civil Frauds, Foreign Litigation, and National Courts. Most of the cases are defensive and involve billions of dollars in claims filed both by and against the government . These cases often involve protracted proc eedings, high monetary stakes, complex damage theori es, and large eviden tiary collections. The section with the largest caseload and most of ten the litigation with th e highest stakes is the National Courts Section. These attorneys represent the government in cases filed in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC) and the Court of Appeals fo r the Federal Circuit, which are national courts located in Washington, D.C. Nati onal Courts attorneys are also re sponsible for litigation filed in the Court of International Trade, a na tional court located in New York City. National Courts cases often involv e billion-dollar contra cts and large corporat ions with virtually limitless litigation resources. A massive group of lawsuits embodying enormous financial stakes is known collectively as the Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation. \"Spent nucl ear fuel\" is a byproduct of commercial nuclear utilities and defense activ ities. Because the fuel continues to emit radiation after it no longer produ ces energy for potentially thousands of years, it must be safely stored. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to accept the fuel at a fede ral facility. In 1987, Congress designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the repository site. DOE entered into 76 contracts with utilities and agreed to begin accepting their fuel starting in January 1998 in exchange for the utilitie s' quarterly fees. 14 Because of delays in preparing the Yucca Mountain site, DOE has been unable to begin acceptance and most likely will not be able to do so until at least 2017. It is conceivable that the repository will not be ready until the 2050s, causing the government's liability to grow exponentially. To date, 66 cases seeking $50 billion in damages have been filed in the CFC alleging a partial breach of contr act. Trials are expect ed in up to 13 case s in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The cases are scientifically complex, ma king them both labor- and resource-intensive. Litigation support services, which include co llecting, organizing, a nd reviewing massive amounts of paper, are critical to the government's defense. The following serve to further exemplify the enormity of the cases that National Courts addresses on a regular basis. The Winstar cases made history in 1995 when some 400 financial institutions sought about $30 billion for alleged losses arising from banking reforms enacted in the 1980s. The successful defense of these ca ses by National Courts attorneys has limited plaintiffs' damage awards to six cents on the do llar. Following the 1988 legislation restricting prepayment of Housing and Urban Developmen t-insured mortgages on low-income housing, 325 plaintiffs filed constitutional takings cl aims, with over $2 billion at issue. In Amber Resources Co. v. United States, the CFC awarded 40 oil and gas lessee s $1.1 billion in restitution for an alleged material breach in their leases, but this decision has been appeale d. Finally, attorneys are defending the Air Force in a $1 billion contra ct dispute with Northrop Grumman over the termination for convenience of the Tri-Service Stand-Off Attack Missile , a highly classified stealth missile. The Corporate/Financial section is handling one of the largest cases ever filed against the government. Cobell v. Kempthorne is a multi-billion dollar claim filed against the Department of the Interior. Plaintiffs - 300,000 Native Americans - seek a full accounting of their Individual Indian Trust accounts. Legislativ e efforts to resolve the litigati on have failed. A new district court judge conducted an eviden tiary hearing from October 10-15, 2007. The parties have filed post-trial documents and are awaiting the court's decision. The Office of Foreign Litigation attorneys retain and manage foreign counsel to represent the United States in cases filed in foreign courts. Mo st of these cases are defensive and arise from a range of actions including antiterrorism activities abroad, the war in Iraq, military redeployments, and commercial transactions. Th e Office's affirmative efforts are aimed at fighting cross-border fraud that targets American citizens, such as telemarketing fraud. The Branch also handles a wide variety of litig ation involving patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other related matters. For example, when patent infringement claims threatened a cessation of BlackBerry service, Intellectual Property attorneys worked to ensure that the government would be exempt from an in junction against use of the service. The most significant defensive suits are brought by major co rporations seeking substantial recoveries for the government's use of patented inventions, such as night vision compatible displays used in military aircraft in Honeywell Internati onal v. United States . Affirmative litigation enforces government-owned patents, trademarks, copyrights, and patent indemnity agreements. Commercial Litigation Branch 1,451 Pending Fraud Cases by Agency (as of January 2, 2008) HHS: 740 Interior: 88HUD: 53GSA: 24 Education: 47 Through affirmative litigation, Commercial Litiga tion attorneys recover lo sses from those who perpetrate fraud against the government and misu se taxpayers' monies. Working with the United States Attorneys' Offices, Branch attorneys reco ver millions, and often billions, of dollars each year from individuals and companies who have defrauded the government by violating the terms of federal contracts, grants, lo ans, subsidies, Medicare, and other federal health insurance programs. The chart above details the number of pending fraud cases by federal agency for which the Frauds staff is wo rking to recover money (as of January 2, 2008). In FY 2007, settlements and judgments in suits and investiga tions of fraud against the Federal Government exceeded $2 billion. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the govern ment has increased spending to address homeland security concerns and to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghani stan. In order to ensure that this increase in funding has its intended effect and is not diverted by fraud, the Division has also 15 increased efforts to detect, aggressively invest igate, and pursue individuals and entities that engage in procurement fraud. A significant portion of fraud cases are filed under the \" qui tam \" provision of the False Claims Act. The Act, as passed in 1863 and amended in 1986, defines and establis hes liability for fraud perpetrated against the government. Under the qui tam provision, a citizen with knowledge of such fraud can sue on behalf of the governme nt. Of the 1,451 cases pending, 78 percent were filed under the qui tam provision. In FY 2007 alone, the De partment recovered more than $1.4 billion in qui tam cases - 70 percent of total recoveries. The Division's base budget is devoted almost ex clusively to defensive litigation - cases that require representation to ensure that the government does not lose hundreds of billions of dollars in adverse judgments and settlements. Thus , funding for affirmative cases has increasingly relied on external sources, mainly the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control account (HCFAC) and Three Percent Fund. The HCFAC account is a ppropriated from the Medicare Trust Fund. It is distributed in amounts that the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney Ge neral jointly certify as necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. Three Percent resources fl uctuate annually in accordance with the level of r ecoveries. In 2007, the DOJ lead ership's Health Care Fraud Initiative increased resources to the Civil Di vision from both HCFAC and the Three Percent Fund. This allowed the Division to hire an additional seven people devoted to heath care fraud. Commercial Branch Quick Facts 269 Authorized Attorney FTE - 2007 8,388 Cases Pending on January 6 Consumer Liti gation The Office of Consumer Litigation enforces federal consumer protection laws. Most enforcement suits involve fraud perpetrated by manufacturers and distributors of misbranded, adulterated, or defective consumer goods. Success in these cases safeguards consumers from dangerous or worthless products and from unfair and deceptive trade practices. Consumer also handles a growing number of health care fraud-rela ted cases, some civil but mostly criminal. In the summer of 2007, the resources available for th ese cases were virtuall y maxed out. However, the shortfall was alleviated when the Department implemented its Health Care Fraud Initiative in 2007. It provided HCFAC resources for Consumer's criminal cases and additional Three Percent Fund money for Automated Litigation Support services. Most of the Office's cases are affirmative and are filed on re ferral from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Co mmission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National High way Traffic Safety Administra tion. The Office handles civil penalty cases brought under consumer protection statutes as well as cases concerning fraudulent activities that extract billi ons of dollars from unsuspecting consumers through deceptive advertisements and sales and through unfair cred it practices. All together, the Office's affirmative litigation generates hundreds of milli ons of dollars in recoveries for the United States. 16 Many of the major affirmative cases handled by the Office of Consumer Litigation deal with protecting the public from busine ss opportunity scams. One group of cases that exemplifies this work arose from a fraudulent scheme to se ll a business involving DVD vending machines. American Entertainment Distributors, Inc. (AED ), defrauded consumers across the United States of approximately $19,000,000. Eleven defendants, including owners, salesmen, and AED representatives, have been convict ed and given sentences ranging from one to ten years in prison. Additionally, a number of the defendants have been ordered to pay back millions of dollars in restitution. The president of AED has thus far been given the strictest sentence of ten years and one month in prison, and was ordered to pay $1 2,000,000 in restitution. AED is one of a series of prosecutions over the past tw o years involving fraudulent bus iness opportunities which have led the Office to bring charges against almost 80 individuals, 69 of whom have already been convicted. Prison terms have stretched to more th an 15 years in prison, and a total of more than $100,000,000 in restitution has been ordered in these cases. The Office also defends challenges to consumer protection laws. Such su its include those filed by major drug manufacturers challe nging the FDA's approval of gene ric versions of some of the most widely-used, name-brand medications. In Biovail Laboratories v. FDA , the court rejected Biovail Corporation's challenge to the FDA's approval of a generic version of Biovail's blockbuster drug, Wellbutrin XL. The court agreed with the FDA that Biovail's claim that this product was not bioequivalent to the patented drug was unfounded and denied injunctive relief against the government. Consumer Litigation Quick Facts 30 Authorized Attorney FTE - 2007 324 Cases Pending on January 6 Office of Immi gration Liti gation Established in 1983 to achieve central contro l over immigration litigation, the Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) upholds the enforcem ent actions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOI R). With its unique expertise in immigration law, OIL provides the government with the best possible defense in district court cases and against challenges to re moval orders filed in circuit courts by illegal aliens, many of whom are criminals. DHS's Customs and Border Protection and Immi gration and Customs Enforcement divisions estimate that more than 11,000,000 illegal aliens reside in the United States. It is therefore not surprising that in addition to de fending counterterrorism efforts, much of the Office's attorney time is devoted to the growing num ber of petitions filed in circu it courts that seek to overturn removal decisions issued by DHS and EOIR. OIL's share of federal court litigation is now so large that immigration cases comprise approximate ly one-third of the cases handled annually by the Civil Division. Vigorous defense of these cases is critical to national security and the safety of our communities. 17 18caseload burden. ddition to fulfilling a key role in addressing the public's widespread desire to gain control he 110 Congress has proposed bills that would overh aul current immigrati on statues. Thus OIL's caseload is directly tied to DHS's immigr ation enforcement efforts and to the immigration adjudication rates of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in EOIR. Thus, as DHS continues to increase its immigration enforcement effort s and the BIA continues to adjudicate large numbers of removal cases each year, OIL's caseloa d will continue to grow into FY 2009. OIL's caseload for FY 2007 exceeded 22,000, and this number is expected to incr ease to nearly 26,000 in FY 2009. This growth is also fu eled by the sh arp rise in the percentage of removal de cisions that aliens appeal to the federal circuit courts. Congress demonstrated its support for immigrati on activities and provided funding for the Division to hire OIL attorneys in FY 2006 and FY 2007. Congress and the administration again have shown their s upport for increased funding in the passage of the most recent appropriations bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, provides $10,000,000 in emergency funds and $9,000,000 in permanent resources to further alleviate OIL's Source: LatinAmericanStudies.org In a over the Nation's borders, the Office's docket often includes sensitive and difficult cases, some of which involve fundamental questions concerning the authority of the Executive and the respective roles of Congress and the courts in immigration matters. One of the most significant items of legislation passed by Congress was the REAL ID Act of 2005. There are a number of components to this act. Each component work s towards tightening controls on aliens in the United States and also provides for more flexibility for executive decisions in regard to border control. While this Act has remained controversial, OIL has time and again defended its constitutionality, one recent example being Iasu v. Smith. In December 2007, the Ninth Circuit held that the REAL ID Act was not an unconstitu tional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus as applied to the alien's citizenship claim. The Eritrean alien raised this claim for the first time in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the district court after the effective date of the REAL ID Act. The court of appeals held that the district court properly dismissed the alien's habeas petition under the REAL ID Act, and concluded that it also lacked jurisdiction to review the citizenship claim because the statute creating jurisdiction over nationality claims only applies to claims made on direct review of a final order of deportation. thTfar, these bills have not been passed. However, such a development would likely increase the Office's caseload as without the current statutes, aliens would have more legal le verage in their efforts to protest the court's removal decisions.

There were two primary concerns: 1) individuals injured by vaccines faced an inconsistent, expensive, and unpredictable tort system for compensating claims; 2) the risk of tort lit igation threatened to reduce the number of vaccine manufacturers that could viably meet market demands. Recognizing that the \"vaccination of children against deadly, disabling, but preventable infectious diseases has been one of the most sp ectacularly effective public health initiatives this country has ever undertaken,\" Congress acknowl edged a responsibility \"to ensure that all children who are injured by vaccines have access to sufficient compensation for their injuries.\" 1 Tcompensation system for persons suffering injury or death allegedly attr ibutable to certain vaccines. Administered by the Department of Health and Huma n Services (HHS), DOJ, and the Office of Special Masters within the Court of Federal Claims (CFC ), the Program is intended to provide a more expeditious, less costly way for resolving claims . An individual claiming a vaccine-related injury or death must file a petition for comp ensation with the CFC before pursuing any civil actio n against a manufactur er or physician. To ensure that compensation is aw arded to those whom Congress intended, claims are closely examined for legal and medical sufficiency, with the recognition th at eligible claimants should be compensated fairly and expeditiously. Special Masters conduct hearings as necessary to determin e whether a petitioner is entitled to compensation and, if so, how much. Tthat is used to pay awards to individuals injured by vaccines, in addition to claimants' attorneys' fees. The Trust Fund is funded by an excise tax imposed on each purchased dose of a covered vaccine. Since the inception of the Program in 1988, more than $1.7 billion in compensation ha s been awarded to over 2,100 claimants who would have otherwise stood little chance of recoveryAdditionally, costly litigation against drug manufacturers and health care professionals who administer vaccines has nearly ceased. As a re sult, the supply of vaccines has stabilized, and development of new vaccines has increased. By protecting the Trust Fund against claims by those who have not suffered a vaccine-related in jury, the Division helps to preserve the Fund for future deserving claimants.

R In passing the Radiation Exposure Compensatio apology and monetary compensation to individuals who suffered di sease or death as a result of exposure to radiation released during atmosphe ric nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, and underground uranium mining operations from the 1940s to the 1970s. This program was designed as an alternative to litigation, in that the statutory cr iteria did not require claimants to establish causation. If claimants meet the cr iteria specified in the Act, compensation is awarded. RECA provides fixed payments in the following amounts: $50,000 for individuals who lived \"downwind\" of the Nevada Test S ite; $75,000 for individuals pr esent at test site locations; and $100,000 for uranium miners, mill workers, and ore transporters. S$1.2 billion has been awarded to 18,885 claimants (a s of January 6, 2008). The vast majority of claims are filed by people who live in the Four Corners region - Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. This area had the greatest concentration of uranium ore, and both the mining and production industries were centered there. The \"downwind\" regions, counties in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, account for thousands of claims in connection with the fallout from above-ground nuclear weapons testing. Since its inception, various gr oups have sought to pr essure Congress and the Executive Branch to expand or otherwise change the scope of the Program. In July 2000, RECA Amendments extended compensation to new ca tegories of beneficiaries, added compensable diseases, expanded both the years and geographic areas covered, and lowered th e exposure level that miners must demonstrate to receive compensation. These statutory changes caused an influx of new claim filings and a substa ntial increase in awards. A National Academy of Sciences 2005 study recommended an overhaul of the Program that would base compensation on an exposure dose assessment for all victims regardless of geographic region. Such changes would require legislative amendments to the current statute. In this case, the claims examination process woul d dramatically expand and change. Bills were also introduced in this Congress to include Idaho, Montan a, and Guam as covered downwind areas. In FY 2006, the RECA Program was evaluated with OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate,\" and is working to implement the improvement actions recommended by OMB. For more information, see page 34. 21 Office of Mana gement Pro grams The workload of the Civil Divisi on is as broad and diverse as the activities of the 200-plus federal agencies it represents. In addition to its role in defending and promoting the laws, policies, and programs of the United States, th e Division protects the public fisc. Key to ensuring the Division's continued success in these matters is responsive management capable of providing executive leadership and promoting performance and fiscal responsibility. The Office of Management Programs (OMP) serv es this purpose. OMP is comprised of five administrative offices, which contribute to the effec tive management of the Division. Office of Planning, Budget, and Evaluation As the largest litigating division of the Department of Justice, the Civil Division is responsible for processing the largest number and value of financial transactions in the General Legal Activities appropriation. The Office of Planning, Budget, and Evaluation (OPBE) effectively and efficiently allocates resources accordi ng to enacted appropri ations and agency reimbursements. In October 2007, the Civil Division successf ully transitioned to the Department-wide Consolidated Debt Collection System. Within OPBE is the Communications Unit, which provides a service to the general public by coordinati ng responses to approximately 2,000 congressional and public inquiries each year. Office of Litigation Support The most direct way OMP promotes performance is through its Automated Litigation Support (ALS) program. This program is run by the Of fice of Litigation Support (OLS) through large contracts for support activ ities. The ALS progra m provides a reliable, e fficient, and secure means of converting millions of pages of unorganized paper and electronic evidence into fully searchable imaged-enabled databases available to attorneys on their desktops or while they are traveling. For example, the photo to the right shows just a small number of the boxes of paper related to the Hurricane Katrina litigation. Other critical benefits of the ALS program include the ability to quickly engage qualified subject matter consultants, IT specialists, paralegals, and trial presentation consultants, who are esse ntial to the successful handling of the Civil Di vision's highest-stakes cases. OLS has provided indispensable suppor t to the Division's larg est defensive cases, including Winstar , Spent Nuclear Fuel, and Hurricane Katrina, as well as to major affirmative matters, such as the Pharmaceutical fraud cases. Office of Policy and Management Operations The Office of Policy and Manage ment Operations (OPMO) manages the Justice Consolidated Network (JCON) office automation system. JCON provides Civil Division staff with computer workstations, printers, scanners, and networ k equipment, which allow access to e-mail, document storage, office application software, legal research applications, such as Westlaw, 22 23 Lexis/Nexis, and the Internet. The Civil Di vision's centralized records management staff manages the creation, maintenance, retrieval, and lawful disposition of all the Division's official litigation case files. These amount to almost 25 9,000 file sections for activ e cases and more than 1,646,000 file sections for cases clos ed over the past 30 years. Office of Administration Responsive administrative support is just as crucial as litigation and technological support. The Office of Administration (OA) provides many se rvices to the Civil Division, including recruitment, hiring, employee as sistance, incentives, training, labor relations, procurement, facilities management, security, and providing office furniture, equipment, and supplies. The Office of Administration assisted the Depart ment in acquiring replacement office space and then planned a major move of 300 employees in 2007. The new space will be less expensive, more secure, and closer to other Division faci lities than that being vacated. OA's endeavors have surely played a role in the Civil Divi sion ranking 13 out of 222 agency subcomponents in the \"Best Places to Work in the Federal Government 2007\" rankings.2 Office of Management Information Successful management of the Civil Division's ever-expanding caseload is essential to ensuring efficiency in all stages of litigation. The Office of Management Information (OMI) maintains CASES, the Civil Division's automated case in formation tracking system , which contains the basic data for over 700,000 open an d closed cases. Attorneys ca n access CASES directly from their desktop computers to obtain case-relate d information and enter case-related time. Managers can search the databa se or generate reports devel oped to their specifications and available on the Division's intranet. Such information is useful in mon itoring caseload activity and time expenditures, tracking li tigation histories, analyzing caseload trends, and evaluating future resource requirements. OMI is also part icipating in the development and implementation of the Department-wide Litigation Case Management System (LCMS). The Division is expected to transition to LCMS in late FY 2009. 2 The Partnership for Public Service and American Un iversity's Institute for the Study of Public Policy Implementation using data from the Office of Personnel Management's Federal Human Capital Survey, bestplacestowork.org /BPTW/rankings. 24PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCES TABLE Decision Unit: Department of Justice - Civil Division - Legal Representation DOJ Strategic Goal II: Prevent Crime, Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People.

Quality assurance efforts include: regular interviews with attorneys to review data listings for each case; input screens programmed to preclude the entry of incorrect da ta; exception reports which list data that are questionable or inconsistent; attorney manager review of numerous monthly reports for data completeness and accuracy; and verification of representative data samples by an independent contractor. Despite these measures, some data limitations do exist. Most significantly, incomplete data can cause the system to under-report case terminations and attorney time. Some performance successes can be attributed to litig ation where the United States Attorneys' Offices were involved. Performance Indicators 2, 5, and 6: Favorable resolutions include court judgments in favor of the government, as well as settlements. All Workload and Performance Indicators: All workload actuals and workload estimates exclude more than 9,000 Harbor Maintenance Tax Cases, as well as over 489,000 Hurricane Katrina administrative claims. These cases have been removed to avoid skewing the data. ISSUES AFFECTING FY 2007 PERFORMANCE Performance Indicator 1: The number of cases terminated in FY 2007 was lower than exp ected due to the unpredictable nature of litigation. For example, the timing of judgments and other court decisions are up to the judge's discretion. Performance Indicator 5: In FY 2007, there was an unusually large number of unfavorable district court decisions in immi gration cases. These cases are often very complex and hard-fought by the government. Performance Indicator 11: Longer processing times reflect the expectation that the 4,800 vaccine program cases currently pend ing in several omnibus pro ceedings will begin to be resolved in the coming years. As these cases are finally resolved, they will increase significantly the average processing time for all cases completed during these years. Performance Indicator 14: The RECA statute permits on-site participants sufficient time to elect whether or not to accept an award under RECA because i f they accept the award they are ineligible to receive any payment or medical benefits under EEOI CPA, even if they qualify. As a result, process ing times for on-site participants have increased and the performance target was not met. ISSUES AFFECTING SELECTION OF FY 2008 AND FY 2009 ESTIMATES Workload Indicators 1, 2, and 3: The workload is measured by summing the number of cases pending at the beginning of the year and new cases that the Division rec eives. Because 89 percent of the Division's caseload is defensive, the si ze of the workload is externally driven. Between FY 2006 and FY 2009, the workload is expected to increase by 13 percent. This increase is primarily the result of pending immigration cases, as well as additional Hurricane Katrina-relate d cases and World Trade Center disaster site administrative claims, all of which are defensive and are beyond the Division's control. Output Indicator 1: The increase in estimated terminations is due to the exp ected resolution of thousands of Vieques administrative claims. Performance Indicators 2 and 3: Vaccine Injury Compensation Program cas es are excluded from these measures.

Between FY 2003 and FY 2007, more than $64 bill ion was saved as a re sult of the Civil Division's successful defense against unmeritorious claims. In FY 2007 alone, the Division defeated over $10 billion in unmeritorious claims . Significant victories include the following: Winstar Of the 103 cases fully resolved to date, 75 resulted in zero damages paid to the plaintiff. For example, an appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment awarding damages of $435,000,000 in Long Island Savings Bank, FSB v. United States . Long Island Savings Bank sued the government alleging breach of contract and related claims. 29 Defense Department Contracts In 1991, the Navy terminated for default a multi-billion dollar contract with General Dynamics and the Boeing Co. for the development of an A-12 stealth fighter ai rcraft. The contractors challenged this termination. After initially prevailing before the trial court, the Federal Circuit overturned the $1.2 billion award and remanded the case to trial in 1999. In 2001, the trial court held that the contract had been properly terminated for default. In May 2007, the Court of Federal Claims upheld this determ ination in favor of the government. If the judgment is affirmed on appeal, the contract ors will be required to return to the government over $2.6 billion, which includes or iginal payments of FY 2007Defensive Cases Closed ($ in Billions) Dollars Sought Dollars Awarded Jet Fuel Litigation In September 2007, the Court of A ppeals for the Federal Circuit rejected fuel suppliers' claims that Department of Defense jet fuel contracts were illegal because they violated the Federal Acquisi tion Regulation's economic price adjustment provision. This rejection prompted the contra ctors to enter into settlement agreements. Plaintiffs originally estimated their claims to be worth approximately $3 billion. Over the last five years, the Division has also made significant affirma tive recoveries totaling $13.5 billion. Most were the result of procurement and qui tam health care fraud matters. The following cases are particularly noteworthy: Health Care Fraud In September 2007, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) settled allegations involving its drug marketing and pricing practices by agreeing to pay the United States over $515,000,000. The government alleged that BMS knowingly paid illega l remuneration to physicians and other health care providers to induce them to purchase BMS drugs, promoted the sale and use of Abilify for pediatric use and to treat dementia-related psychosis - both \"off-label\" uses, and set and maintained fraudulent and inflated prices for a wide assortment of oncology and generic drug products. FY 2007Affirmative Cases Closed ($ in Billions) Dollars Sought Dollars Recovered Procurement Fraud Sioux Manufacturing Co rp. settled allegations of procurement fraud by agreeing to pay the United States $1,900,000. The government accused the company of failing to follow specifications in making Kevlar , a protective material for military helmets and body armor used by the United States militar y. In a similar case, Hexcel Corporation agreed to pay the United States $15,000,000 to resolv e allegations related to its role in the manufacture and sale of defective Zylon bu llet-proof vests to federal law enforcement agencies. The government alleged that Hexcel used Zylon fiber that it knew to be defective and degraded quickly when exposed to heat, light, and humidity. OxyContin Prosecution The Purdue Frederick Company pled guilty to the felony of misbranding the painkiller OxyContin. Purdue 's top three executives pled guilty to misdemeanor misbranding of OxyContin from 1996 to 2001. The court accepted these pleas on July 20, 2007. The case, United States v. Purdue Frederick Company, et al., involved Purdue's misrepresentations to health care pr oviders that OxyContin was less addictive, less subject to abuse and diversion, and less likely to cause withdrawal problems than other pain medications. In sentencing the defendants, the court imposed fines, pe nalties, and restitution payments totaling $634,515,475 which will be paid to various entities, including $276,000,000 forfeited to the United States and $160,000,000 paid to federal and state government agencies to resolve liability for false claims made to Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. 30 31The following cases are representative of the non-monetary suits handled by Division attorneys on a daily basis: Designation of Foreign Terrorists and Their Supporters In Global Relief Foundation v. Snow , a district court granted the government's motion to dismiss, thereby upholding the designation of Global Relief Foundation as a \"Sp ecially Designated Global Terrorist.\" The court found that the evidence showed that Global Relief Foundation \"assisted in, sponsored, or provided financial, material or other technological suppor t to, or in support of, other designated terrorists.\" In addition, in Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey , the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a federal statute that criminalizes the provision of material support or resources to designated terrorist groups if the donor knows of the group's designation or that it en gages in terrorism. Challenge to United States Nuclear Weapons in Italy Plaintiffs in this case, including an Italian anti-nuclear weapon organization, filed an action seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the United States to remove all nuclear weapons, if any, from its base in Aviano, Italy. The United States obtained a stay on all proceedings pending a determination by Italy's Supreme Court of Cassati on on whether or not Italian courts have jurisdiction to hear such a challenge. The United States disputed the Italian courts' jurisdiction, asserting sovereign immunity under customary international law, as well as the rights and obligations of the United States and Italy under vari ous treaties, including the NATO treaty. Deceptive Advertising On November 7, 2007, the court ruled in United States v. Baby Tenda, that a Baby Tenda crib/high chair distributor had falsely and repeatedly claimed in advertisements that the company's sales s hows were sponsored by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The court foun d that such tactics violated the mail fraud statute civilly, and that the company was responsible. The court also criticized the company's \"deceitful and reprehensible\" practice of luring potential customers to sales meetings by tricking them into believing they were coming to a government sponsored safety seminar. Pharmaceutical Safety In Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals v. Food and Drug Administration , the court granted the United States' motion for summary judgment against the pharmaceutical company on actions brought against Hi-Tech's dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The court also denied Hi-Tech's motions for summary judgment and dismissed Hi-Tech's complaint for declatory relief against the Food and Drug Administration's enforcement of its rule, which declares that dietary supplements which contain ephedrine are adulterated, and thus unlawful for commercial sale . The court ruled that it must defer to the agency's regulation that the supplement is adulterated. Strategies to Accomplish Outcomes The Civil Division has achieved extraordinary succe ss despite internal and external challenges. This is due in large part to the use of the following innovative strategies: Retain cases that require coordi nation at the seat of governme nt or subject matter expertise possessed by the Civil Division, as well as ca ses assigned to nationa l and foreign courts. Improve information dissemination between the Civil Division and the United States Attorneys to promote and maintain uniform litigation positions. Work with client agencies, as well as law enfor cement entities, such as the FBI, to ensure the best possible representation of the government's interests. Recruit and retain a high-caliber legal staff w ith expertise that will best promote successful litigation. Structure support sta ff to take full advantage of new technologies that promote efficiency and productivity. Maximize resources by improving cash manage ment and utilizing authority to obtain reimbursements. Develop new alternative funding sources. Invest in new technologies and litigation su pport services such as ALS to maximize productivity, meet court mandates, and prevail on behalf of the government. Results of the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) Reviews Civil Division During FY 2005, the Civil Division wa s assessed through OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) along with five other litigating components (ATR, CRM, CRT, ENRD, and TAX), collectively named the Gene ral Legal Activities Program (GLA or the Program). At the end of the assessment, the Program received a rating of \"Effective.\"3 This is the highest rating a program can receive. Program s rated Effective set ambitious goals, achieve results, are well-managed, and improve e fficiency. Other findings showed that: The Program effectively achieves its goal of resolving cases in favor of the government. Favorable resolutions, in turn, punish and deter violations of the law; ensure the integrity of Federal laws and programs; and prevent the government from losing money through unfavorable settlements or judgments. The Program collaborates effectively with its partners, notably th e U.S. Attorneys' Offices. The two programs work closely to share expertise, make referrals, and designate cases for prosecution, while mini mizing any overlap of responsibilities. The Program exhibits good management prac tices. This includes strong financial management, collecting and using performa nce information to make decisions, and holding managers accountable for program performance. 3 Programs undergoing the PART recei ve one of five ratings: Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate, 32 Ineffective, or Results Not Demonstrated. Additionally, to exhibit continua l improvement of its practices, the GLA components have taken steps toward completing the follow- up actions recommended by OMB: Implement a plan to conduct an independent evaluation. Establish leadership training and mentoring program to continue improving the quality of program management. Work with the Department's Chief Information Officer to evaluate and purchase litigation software that will improve productivity and efficiency. DOJ and HHS effectively collaborate to ad minister the Program jointly. The two agencies have a good working relationship and coordinate well with one another and with the judges who adjudicate the claims. The Program has made progress in achievi ng its annual perfor mance goals, but its performance on long-term goals has been inconsistent. In particular, the Program has experienced mixed results in ensuring that all eligible claimants are compensated and reducing the amount of time needed to process a claim. The Program's design contains flaws that hinder its ability to satisfy both claimants and vaccine manufacturers. Some of the de sign-related problems include loopholes allowing circumvention of the Program, extens ive delays in the processing of claims, and a large balance in the Program's Trust Fund that remains unspent. Seek an independent evaluation to assess the Program's effectiveness, impact, and design. Improve the way the Program projects its fi nancial liabilities in future years. Reduce claims processing time by increasing th e use of electronic f ile sharing between agencies, expert witnesses, and other parties. Vaccine Injury Compensation Program During FY 2005, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services were evaluated th rough OMB's PART on thei r respective roles in administering the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (the Program). The Program received a rating of \"Adequate.\" This rating describes a program that needs to set more ambitious goals, achieve better results, improve accountability or strengthen its management practices. OMB's findings include the following: DOJ and HHS will take the following actions to improve the performance of the Program: 33 Radiation Exposure Compensation Program During FY 2006, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (the Program) was eval uated with OMB's PART assessment. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate.\" OMB's findings include the following: The Program has developed ambitious a nnual and long-term goals focusing on outcomes that meaningfully reflect the purpos e of the Program. However, the Program must ensure that partners are committe d to achieving annual and long term goals. The Program's statutory scheme contains flaw s with respect to some of its claimant categories. Although the stat ute is founded on the scientif ically-based association between exposure and illness for occupationally exposed uranium workers, the same is not true for the other claimant categories. Ensure Program partners are expressly committed to achieving the stated annual and long-term performance goals of the Program. Develop a plan to tie resources to specific performance measures. Monitor the activities of the National Academ y of Sciences and lik e organizations that are studying the Act's eligibility criteria. DOJ is taking the following actions to improve the performance of the Program: 34 35E-Government Initiatives The Justice Department is fully committed to the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the E-Government initiatives that are integral to achieving the objectives of the PMA. The E-Government initiatives serve citizens, business, and federal employees by delivering high quality services more efficiently at a lo wer price. The Department is in varying stages of implementing E-Government solutions and services includin g initiatives focused on integrating government wide transactions, processes, standards adoptio n, and consolidation of administrative systems that are necessary tools for agency administration, but are not core to DOJ's mission. To ensure that DOJ obtains value from the various initiativ es, the Department activel y participates in the governance bodies that direct the in itiatives and we communicate regularly with the other federal agencies that are serving as the \"Managing Partners \" to ensure that the in itiatives meet the needs of the Department and its customers. The Depart ment believes that working with other agencies to implement common or consolidated solutions will help DOJ to reduce the funding requirements for administrative and public-facing systems, thereby allowing DOJ to focus more of its scarce resources on higher priority, mission related needs. DOJ's m odest contributions to the Administration's E-Government projects will facilitate achievement of this objective. A.

These costs, along with other internal E-Government related expenses (oversight and administrative expenses such as salaries, rent, etc.) are reimbursed by DOJ components to the WCF. The Civil Division's reimbursement amount is based on use of the system. The table below identifies the Civil Division's actual or planned reimbursement to the Department's Working Capital Fund. As such, the Division's E-Government reimbursement to the WCF is $250,000 for FY 2008. B. Benefits Many of these initiatives have not yet been implemented.

This request provides for a proposed 2.9 percent pay raise to be effective in January of 2009. This increase includes loca lity pay adjustments as well as the general pay raise. The amount requested, $3,211,000, represents the pay amounts for 3/4 of the fiscal year plus appropriate be nefits ($2,529,000 for pay and $682,000 for benefits). Annualization of 2008 pay raise . This pay annualization represents first quarter amounts (October through December) of the 2008 pay increase of 3.5 percent i ncluded in the 2008 President's Budget. The amount requested $1,136,000, represents the pay amounts for 1/4 of the fiscal year plus appropria te benefits ($894,000 for pay and $242,000 for benefits). Annualization of additional positions requested in 2008 . This provides for the annualization of 221 additional positions requested in the 2008 President's budget. Annualization of new positions extends to 3 years to provide for entry level funding in the first year with a 2-year progression to the journ eyman level. For 2008, this request includes a decrease of $5,068,000 for one-time items associated with the increased positions, and an increase of $24,976,000 for full-year costs associated with these additional positions, for a net increase of $19,908,000 Exhibit E - Justification for Base Adjustmentsend of line end of line Compensation Act.

The Department of State is in the midst of a 14-year, $17.5 billion embassy construction program, with a plan to build approxim ately 150 new diplomatic and consular compounds. State has proposed that costs be allocated through a Capital Security Cost Sharing Program in which each agency wil l contribute funding based on the number of postions that are authorized for overseas personnel. The total agency cost will be phased in over 5 years. The estimated cost to the Department, as provided by State, for FY 2008 is $50,974,159. The Civil Division currently has 1 position overseas, and funding of $11,000 is requested for this accoun t. DHS Security Charges. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to charge Basic Security and Building Specific Security. The request ed increase of $474,000 is required to meet our commitment to DHS. The costs associated with DHS security were derived through the use of an automated system, which uses the latest space inventory data. Rate increases expected in FY 2009 for Building Specific Security have been formulated based on DHS billing da ta. The increased rate for Basic Security costs for use in the FY 2009 budget process was provided by DHS. JUTNet. The Justice United Telecommunications Network (JUTNet) is a new system will provide a more reliable, secure, and economic conn ectivity among the many local office automation networks deployed throughout the Department, as well as a trusted environment for information sharing with ot her government agencies and remote users, fiel d agents, and traveling staff personnel. JUTNet will utilize uniform security, updated encryption protocols, and eliminate netwo rk inefficiencies existing with the current systems. Funding of $623,000 is required for this account.Postage: Effective May 14, 2007, the Postage Service implemented a rate increase of 5.1 percent. This percentage was applied to the 2008 estimate of $284,000 to arrive at an increase of $14,000. DecreasesGovernment Printing Office (GPO): GOP provides an estimate rate increase of 4%. Funding of $44,000 is required for this account. Changes in Compensable Days : The decrease costs of one compensable day in FY 2009 compared to FY 2008 is calculated by dividing the FY 2008 estimated personnel compensation $120,160,000 and applicable benefits $31,435,000 by 262 compensable days. The cost decrease of one comp ensable day is $579,000.Employees Compensation Fund: The $6,000 increase reflects payments to the Department of Labor for injury benefits paid in the past year under the Federal EmployeeHealth Insurance : Effective January 2007, this component's contribution to Federal employees' health insurance premiums increased by 10.6 perc ent. Applied against the 2008 estimate of $6,113,000, the additional amount required is $650,000. General Services Administration (GSA) Rent . A funding decrease of $116,000 is required for this account. Moves (Lease Expirations) . A funding decrease of $2,644,000 for one-time lease expirations in FY 2008.Retirement . Agency retirement contributions increase as employees under CSRS retire and are replaced by FERS employees. Based on U.S. D epartment of Justice Agency estimates, we project that the DOJ workforce will convert from CSRS to FERS at a rate of 1.3 percent per year. The requested increase of $116,000 is necessary to meet our increased retirement obligations as a result of this conversion.
