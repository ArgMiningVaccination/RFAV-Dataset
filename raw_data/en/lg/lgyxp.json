Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a survey jointly administered by the CDC and the Alabama Department of Public Health. Its purpose is to find out why some babies are born healthy and others are not. New mothers are randomly chosen to participate in PRAMS and will receive surveys in the mail. They can return the survey in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. Mothers may also do the survey over the phone if they prefer. Whether by mail or by phone, each mother who completes the survey will receive her choice of a package of disposable diapers, an insulated cooler, a manicure set, or a onesie for her baby (size 12 months). Mothers who receive a survey are encouraged to complete it. Each woman's experiences are different and can help improve the health of all our moms and babies. All responses are kept confidential to the extent of the law. For more information, go to [PRAMS](../prams/index.html) or call (334) 206-2923.
