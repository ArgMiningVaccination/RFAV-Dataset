Within 1 year after opening our doors we outgrew our space and relocated to a larger space in Jackson Heights, NY. Due to the 2020 pandemic, we relocated the clinic to Forest Hills, NY. Since opening, our clinic has grown to be the busiest clinic in Queens, and one of the busiest in all of NYC. Our mission is to offer quality acupuncture and other alternative medicine treatments at highly accessible rates. We pride ourselves on our ability to bring this ancient form of medicine to the middle/working class and the diverse population of New York City. In 2013, we changed our name to Comuni Acupuncture in anticipation of our future expansion plans outside of the borough of Queens. Help us to reach our expansion goals by spreading the word. The more the clinic continues to receive word-of-mouth and social media support, the faster we can achieve our dreams to expand to a location near you. Meet Our Doctors The Education of an Acupuncturist Often times, many do not realize the serious commitment required to become a Licensed Acupuncturist. Although New York State in the past did not designate the title of primary care physician to a Licensed Acupuncturist, there are numerous states that recognize acupuncturists as primary care physicians. The minimum degree to receive a New York State acupuncture license is the completion of a Masters of Science Degree in Acupuncture that is 4 years on top of their Bachelor's degree. The education of an acupuncturist consists of a 4 year, full-time Masters Degree program, plus 1-2 additional years for the Doctoral-level degree. Including the initial Bachelors degree, this means that an acupuncturist typically has completed 8-10 years of college studies. The curriculum studied is composed of both eastern and western (allopathic) medicine, herbal medicine, trigger point acupuncture, dry needling (which is a newly developed term for acupuncture), Tui-Na massage, nutrition, eastern philosophy, Tai Qi & Qi Gong, public health, evidence based medicine, healthcare systems, in addition to thousands of hours of internship experience. After completing at minimum a Masters program, the NCCAOM national board examinations need to be passed before being awarded a license in New York State. "}
