This ceremony is to hold space for those grieving any type of loss - a life, a loved one, a relationship, a favored situation. We offer this sound meditation as an invitation to come walk the path of mending together. At 10 am, we invite you to add an object that honors your loss \u2014 a flower, a candle, a photo, a poem, a memento \u2014 to our communal altar, and to set an intention. At 10:30 am, doors will close and the meditation will begin. Anderson Pugash, Ellian Raffoul and Dan Dowdell will take you on an intuitive sound journey using a curation of sacred and exotic instruments including crystal bowls, gongs, didgeridoo, flutes, chimes and crystal harps. Grief encompasses a range of emotions, and sound meets you where you are. It can help ease us into states of peace, forgiveness and love. It can also help us process anger, anguish, frustration, sadness and guilt. After, we'll share tea and each other's company. We kindly ask that you not inquire about an attendee's loss unless they offer it up freely.

A traumatic injury left me housebound and in constant pain for months. I could no longer avoid questions that quietly dogged me my whole life, and I could not go back to who I was. I stepped down as the chief executive of my hospitality company and spent years seeking answers amongst various wisdom traditions and healing modalities. Yoga became my path and nada yoga\u2014 the yoga of sound \u2014 became my offering. As the creationary force of our universe, sound is unique in its ability to infuse every cell in the body with energy and intention. It is ever-present and accessible to all, yet infinite in possibility. Working with sound has led me to answers and importantly, to greater contentment, peace and health. With deep gratitude, I offer sound meditation in the hope that all beings may find inner harmony and upliftment. Anderson studied sound healing at the Globe Institute. He is a disciple of non-dualist yoga and a Reiki Master Practitioner in the Usui Reiki tradition. Anderson is the co-founder of Palm House Hospitality which owns and operates Palm House, The Dorian, Bergerac, and Audio, and is a partner in the Flamingo Resort in Santa Rosa, CA. He received his BS in Economics from the Wharton School. Share "}
