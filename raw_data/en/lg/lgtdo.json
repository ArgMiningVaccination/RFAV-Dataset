As a complement to conventional treatments, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can help many conditions, including headaches, stress, fatigue and chronic degenerative diseases. Our credentialed practitioners take a preventive approach and include education as part of your healing plan. Viewing the body and illness as a reflection of the natural world, Chinese medicine sees most conditions as a balance of opposites: yin and yang, hot and cold. Your practitioner will work with you to identify the flow and imbalance of your body's chi (or qi, pronounced \"chee\"), the vital life force common to all living things. Acupuncture In Chinese medicine philosophy, blocked or imbalanced chi causes illness; acupuncture seeks to unblock and rebalance chi along pathways called meridians. Our licensed acupuncturists put very thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body to stimulate, disperse or regulate energy along the meridians. Other types of acupuncture may use heat, pressure or mild electrical current. Your integrative practitioner may suggest acupuncture for its potential to reduce chronic pain, nausea caused by chemotherapy, asthma and allergy symptoms and digestive disorders. Chinese Herbs Depending on your needs, your specialist may recommend Chinese herbs targeted for specific conditions, such as weak digestion or migraines or even [Common Colds and the Flu (PDF)](/pdf/services/holistic-integrative-medicine/colds.pdf). Our qualified practitioners have expertise in herbal medicine and can work with you to create an effective treatment plan. Qigong At some of our locations, we offer medical qigong, a Chinese meditative practice that uses slow, graceful movements and controlled breathing to promote chi circulation and enhance health. Qigong exercises and meditations can reduce the effects of stress and aging, boost energy and immunity, lower blood pressure and improve circulation. A qigong routine can also address specific health or emotional concerns, such as menopause or depression. The exercises are easy to learn and appropriate for all ages and physical abilities. "}
