A regular home prevention routine usually consists of brushing at least twice a day and flossing at least once per day. But did you know there are other tools to make taking care of your mouth a little easier? Depending on your needs, there is special toothpaste, rinses, and even flossing aids that can help you keep your smile bright and healthy for years to come. Crystal Dental can help you find the best tools to enhance your daily hygiene routine making your professional cleaning appointments shorter and less stressful. Another significant factor in your oral health is your diet. Acidic foods and drinks can erode enamel just as a balanced diet can help keep your teeth and gums strong and healthy. Regular professional exams and cleanings, a dedicated at-home hygiene routine, and a healthy, balanced diet can help prevent minor issues from becoming major procedures.

[Home Care](home-care.html) While excellent oral health is a partnership between you and our team, we depend on you to make sure your teeth and gums stay strong and healthy between appointments.
