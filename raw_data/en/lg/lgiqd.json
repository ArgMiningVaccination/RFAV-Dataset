To offer support for anyone who may share these concerns, Lisa, our homeopath has put together some simple self-help steps that you can follow, and is making tailor-made prescriptions for anyone who would like added protection. Most of us can deal with vaccines without any problem, but if your immune system is already working hard with existing health challenges, there is a slim chance that you find that the side effects are more unpleasant that you expected. If this is the case, it is important to note that the CHP gives the following advice on their website: Reporting of adverse events after immunization The Department of Health (DH) has an adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system which receives adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) reports to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. If you have any suspected adverse event occurred after immunization, please alert healthcare professionals.. to report the AEFIs to the DH if they considered that the AEFIs may be associated with the [vaccination. (https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/vaccine)](https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/vaccine) There are a few things that you can do to minimise your chances of incurring side effects when you have any vaccine, be it Covid or any other. The critical thing to do is give your immune system a big boost before and after each vaccination with optimal nutrition and taking these simple steps listed below: Step 1: Take the homeopathic remedy Thuja Occidentalis 30c - 2 days before vaccination and a few hours right after your shot. For those who are allergic, Histaminum helps with possible allergic skin reactions. These remedies (and more) can be ordered at our clinic. Step 2: One hour before being vaccinated, take a high dose fish oil supplement. This helps to prevent an adjuvant called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from causing inflammation (especially in the brain). Aim for 2-3gm. Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, anchovies and sardines provide about 1 gram of omega-3s in each 3.5-ounce portion. Step 3: Take 1000mg Vitamin C - 2-3 times daily between meals for 3 days around every vaccination. This powerful anti-inflammatory will protect your immune system. You can take more, but if you experience loose bowels, that is the sign that you have taken enough. Step 4: Take the herbal remedy Echinacea for a week before and a week after your dose. This gentle herb turbo-charges the whole immune system naturally. Please remember only to take it for 2 weeks at a time for optimal efficacy. Step 5: Apply an ice pack to the site of the vaccination and re-apply regularly throughout the day for 10-15 mins a time to reduce localised inflammation (and on consecutive days if it continues to hurt). Step 6: Take Vitamin E for several weeks to reduce any potential negative immune reactions. You can also adjust your diet to include foods that have a high content of natural Vitamin E, such as avocados, seeds, raw red bell peppers, etc. If you do have any concerns and wish to discuss these in more detail, please feel free to reach out to Lisa.
