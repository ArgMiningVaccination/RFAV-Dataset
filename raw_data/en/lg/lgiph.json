Naturopathic medicine combines safe and effective traditional therapies with the most current advances in modern medicine. Naturopathic medicine is appropriate for the management of a broad range of health conditions affecting all people of all ages. A licensed naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD, but also studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician also studies clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology, and counseling. A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician. There are 7 fully accredited medical schools for naturopathic medicine in North America. To practice in a licensed state, such as Montana, and to be a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Medicine, an ND must have graduated from an accredited medical school and passed the national board exams. Currently, 20 states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands have licensing or registration laws for Naturopathic Doctors. The only major opposition to licensing efforts has been from practitioners that have received their education and degrees from non-accredited, usually mail order, programs. Our national association has been vigilant in support of licensure that requires a 4-year nationally accredited postgraduate medical education and professional board exams. Licensed naturopathic physicians follow a set of principles that help us bring our shared vision to our patients. These principles are: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) The healing power of nature is the inherent self-organizing and healing process of living systems, which establishes, maintains and restores health. Naturopathic medicine recognizes this healing process to be ordered and intelligent. It is the naturopathic physician's role to support, facilitate and augment this process by identifying and removing obstacles to health and recovery, and by supporting the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) Illness does not occur without cause. Causes may originate in many areas. Underlying causes of illness and disease must be identified and removed before complete recovery can occur. Symptoms can be expressions of the body's attempt to defend itself, to adapt and recover, to heal itself, or may be results of the causes of disease. The naturopathic physician seeks to treat the causes of disease, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: - Naturopathic physicians utilize methods and medicinal substances, which minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. - Whenever possible the suppression of symptoms is avoided as suppression generally interferes with the healing process. - Naturopathic physicians respect and work with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling, for if this self-healing process is not respected the patient may be harmed. Doctor As Teacher (Docere) The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" is teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibility for health. Naturopathic physicians also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Health and disease results from a complex of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Naturopathic medicine recognizes the harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual as being essential to health. The complex nature of health and disease requires a personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. Naturopathic physicians treat the whole person taking all of these factors into account. Prevention Naturopathic medical colleges emphasize the study of health as well as disease. The prevention of disease and the attainment of optimal health in patients are primary objectives of naturopathic medicine. In practice, these objectives are accomplished through education and the promotion of healthy ways of living. Naturopathic physicians assess risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and make appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine asserts that one cannot be healthy in an unhealthy environment and is committed to the creation of a world in which humanity may thrive. Naturopathic Methods Naturopathic medicine is defined primarily by its fundamental principles. Methods and modalities are selected and applied based upon these principles in relationship to the individual needs of each patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are selected from various sources and systems and will continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge. Naturopathic Practice Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and treatment modalities: utilization of all methods of clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing including diagnostic radiology and other imaging techniques; nutritional medicine, dietetics and therapeutic fasting; medicines of mineral, animal and botanical origin; hygiene and public health measures; homeopathy; acupuncture; Chinese medicine; counseling; minor surgery and naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth), naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapies; the use of hydrotherapy; ultrasound, and therapeutic exercise. While most ND's are general practice, primary care physicians, many naturopathic physicians specialize in specific areas such as women's care or physical medicine. The practice of Acupuncture and/or Chinese medicine and naturopathic obstetrics requires additional education and licensure. Homeopathy is a modality used by practitioners of many disciplines, with varying expertise and by many ND's. Naturopathic Medicine is not \"alternative\" medicine but truly integrative medicine providing a comprehensive and nonexclusive approach to the best of traditional and conventional medicine. Naturopathic physicians acknowledge that patients often know what is wrong with them and need health care providers to listen carefully in order to help them interpret their symptoms and then facilitate an appropriate approach to wellness. ND's welcome and encourage patients to become educated and involved in their health care decisions because experience has shown that patients are then much more successful in attaining their health goals. Summer Body Care Summer Body Care Audrey Schenewerk, ND Summer is a time for projects, like moving, yard work, home improvements, etc. These activities can be fun, therapeutic and necessary for life; Here are some important tips for protecting your body while engaging in these activities. The garden that commands your attention may also be a bit hard on your hands, wrists and knees while you are kneeling by its side. Consider these ideas to minimize muscle fatigue and soreness: - Change positions frequently, squatting, kneeling, sitting, bending for long periods of time or repeatedly can be ergonomically unfavorable - When kneeling consider pads under knees and rear for support - Alternate hands when weeding or digging to prevent aggravation of overuse injuries - Try to rotate between types of gardening activities, allowing your body some recovery from repetitive motion - Frequent breaks with stretching and hydration Home improvements like painting, replacing fixtures and appliances may put significant physical demands on your body; here are several ideas to help you finish your projects feeling fine: - Again, changing positions or alternate repetitive motions as often as possible - Frequent breaks with stretching and hydration - Job share with friends and family, such as, you paint for them and they will help you move the kitchen appliances - Maintaining an overall active lifestyle will help your body adapt to the demands of your projects Moving can be annoying with the packing and unpacking, and the inevitable injuries received as you maneuver the dresser down the stairs or lift heavy boxes. Take a moment to protect your body with these ideasin addition to those mentioned above: - When packing use the smallest boxes for the heavier items - Furniture dollies or straps can really help your body manage oversized furniture safely - Use thigh and glute muscles to lift, rather than your back By the end of the weekend when your projects are complete, or at least for now you may be feeling the effects of your labors. The aches and pain may serve as a reminder to try some of the ideas above, next time, and focus on a little tender loving care now. Some ideas to minimize the aches and pains of summer projects include: - Epsom salt baths to heal overused or injured muscles - Ice, heat, or contrast hydrotherapy (alternating hot with cold) - Good restorative sleep - Anti-inflammatory supplements and medications, when appropriate - Massage therapy or other manual therapies - Physical therapy - Chiropractic care - Evaluation by your licensed medical provider as necessary Please be sure to find the care you need so next summer your body will be in top shape to complete the next round of projects. How to Avoid Known Cancer Causing Agents How to Avoid Known Cancer Causing Agents Danielle Phillips-Dorsett, ND There is much in the news, from time to time, about chemicals that are associated with cancer and this may be confusing and scary for you. Much is unknown about how cancers develop in the body; however, there are substances and exposures that are known to cause cancer in humans. These are documented and reported by the National Toxicology Program that publishes the Report on Carcinogens, released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Below is a summary of how to protect yourself and family from a few on the list, including trichloroethylene, which was just added last year. Industrial solvents: - Trichloroethylene, benzene and many other industrial solvents are listed by the National Toxicology Program as known carcinogens. Exposure has been linked with cancers of the liver, lungs, digestive tract, lymphoma and leukemia. Solvents are used in numerous products to remove grease in the automotive, manufacturing and even home care industries. It may come as a surprise that in our fair city of Billings, as in many cities, there are a substantial number of companies where workers need to be well-informed of occupational exposures to these carcinogens. Use of PPE (personal protective equipment) is required for good reason. It is reasonable to request that management provide safer cleaners when available. Solvents are the cause of the superfund site just outside Billings, where a now contained solvent plume contaminated groundwater. Radon: - Radon is a gas released from rock and can build up in the home if not properly vented. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. If your house has not been tested for radon, you will want to have it tested because the good news is you can do something about it if levels are unsafely elevated. The longer you are exposed to high levels of radon, the greater risk you are of developing cancer. And, if you are a cigarette smoker the risk is much higher when exposed to elevated levels of radon. If you are a renter, ask your landlord about radon levels, especially if you plan to live in the home long-term. There are several companies in Billings that can test this and most home inspectors will add this to their report. Styrene: - Styrene is a chemical used in the making of plastics and rubber and is also inhaled in cigarette smoke. This chemical has been linked to leukemia, lymphomas, and pancreatic and esophageal cancers. Since it can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin, anyone working with this material should wear gloves, respirators and work in a well ventilated area. Some Styrofoam containers have been determined to be microwave safe, with a non-significant amount of polystyrene released into the contents. AVOID using them to hold hot liquids or reheat food if they are not labeled as such. These are just a few of the long list the National Institute of Health Toxicology Program has put together. For the complete list of known human carcinogens go to their website at [www.ntp.niehs.nih.gov](http://www.ntp.niehs.nih.gov) \"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.\" -Maya Angelou Sun Exposure & Skin Protection Gazette Article: Sun Exposure & Skin Protection Jennifer Krieger, ND With the warm weather upon us, many Montanans answer summer's call by spending time in the great outdoors under the sun. However, repeated sun exposure has been linked to painful sunburns, skin cancer and is the number one cause of premature aging. It is important to protect your skin from the harmful and painful effects of the sun by following the simple preventative steps listed below. Staying out of the sun when it's the strongest, wearing protective clothing, and putting on sunscreen are your best bets to avoiding sunburns. Reduce your time in direct sunlight - the sun is strongest between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, and even cloudy skies can cause sunburns because up to 80% of the sun's rays can pass through clouds. Protective clothing such as long sleeved shirts and pants, sunglasses, large brimmed hats, and carrying an umbrella for instant shade offer protection too. There are even sun protective swimwear and clothing available with SPF (sun protective factor) built in. Make sure your sunglasses have ultraviolent lenses to protect your eyes. Polarized sunglasses are best if you are exposed to frequent high glare situations, such as spending excessive time on the water. Earth friendly and natural sunscreens are your best options for sunscreens since many contain harmful chemicals that are easily absorbed through the skin. Aim for a sunscreen that has a SPF of at least 15 or more. Sunscreens that are labeled \"wide spectrum\" or \"water resistant\" offer more protection. Be diligent though, and re-apply sunscreen every two hours or whenever you are exposed to water or are excessively sweating. Don't forget about your lips either, as they contain minute amounts of melanin (the skin's natural protective pigment from light) and are especially susceptible to burns. Try to find a lip balm that contains no gloss and has a SPF of 15 or more. Check the Environmental Working Group's website at [www.ewg.org/sunscreen/](http://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/) for their 2017 Guide to Sunscreens to determine how to select the safest and most effective sunscreen for your outdoor needs. There are even dietary options to help protect your skin from the sun's rays. Adding tomatoes to your diet has been proven beneficial since tomatoes contain high levels of the antioxidant lycopene. Lycopene has been shown to be effective in reducing the harmful effects of sun exposure in controlled trials. So add in tomatoes and tomato based drinks into your diet for an extra sun protective boost. Adding vitamin C and vitamin E for short periods of time have been shown to protect the skin from sun damage too. These vitamins are powerful antioxidants that can protect the skin because they have the ability to reduce the free radicals produced by the sun's ultraviolet rays. Aim for a combination of 2,000 mg of vitamin C and 1,000 IU of vitamin E daily for a short period of time (four to six weeks). So despite your best efforts to prevent sunburns, sometimes Mother Nature still wins. The expressed juice of the aloe vera plant is especially beneficial for soothing and cooling sunburns and reduces redness of the skin when applied topically to broken or unbroken skin. Apply aloe vera to sunburns and let dry. Re-apply as often as needed to help heal your burnt skin. Avoid direct sunlight and let your skin heal. As you can see there are many ways to take a proactive approach to help protect your skin. Enjoy your fun in the sun, Billings! References are available upon request. Sciatica Sciatica Patricia Holl, Chiropractor Have you ever had a 'burning sensation down the back of your leg? Perhaps you've experienced some numbness or tingling in your feet and toes? If so, you may have symptoms of 'Sciatica'. Sciatica is a condition caused by compression, irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve, which is both the longest and largest nerve in the human body. The sciatic nerve is made up of five smaller nerve roots which extend from the lower portion of the spine near the pelvis and join together to branch out on both sides of the body traveling down each leg. It then divides into smaller nerves which drape into the thighs, knees, legs and toes. Individuals suffering from sciatica may experience an assortment of symptoms. It generally manifests as a distracting pain originating in the low back or buttocks, and involves symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning, cramping and an achy soreness which can appear anywhere along the sciatic nerve path. Pain may be constant or intermittent. For some, the pain can be an intense \"shooting pain,\" firing down one or both legs. Others may experience only a dull ache or numbness traveling into the back of the thighs. Since the roots of the sciatic nerve emanate from the low back, any compromised structure in the low back can impose pressure on these nerve roots. While sciatica is often the result of spinal misalignment or bulging discs, other disorders known to cause sciatic nerve pain include inflammation, degeneration, or spinal canal stenosis, a condition in which the canal housing the spinal cord becomes narrowed. Sciatica can also occur as a result of faulty postural mechanics such as driving for prolonged periods of time or spending excessive time in a seated position in front of the computer. Additionally, insufficient stretching and exercise, heavy lifting, bending, twisting or inappropriate sleeping patterns can contribute to this condition. Sciatica has also been linked to a variety of non-mechanical conditions such as arthritis, tumors, vitamin deficiencies and even diabetes. The good news is that most cases of sciatica can be treated successfully. Because of its diverse causes, treatment for sciatica differs from patient to patient, and varies according to the cause and severity. Sciatica can usually be managed effectively with chiropractic treatment, physical therapy, acupuncture and massage therapy, in addition to modifying activities. The main goal in the treatment of sciatica is to decrease pain, increase mobility and restore normal functioning. Whatever the cause, it is important to seek treatment swiftly to avoid long-term damage. See your healthcare professional when the pain first begins. Our bodies never stop communicating with us. Listen closely, and revitalize your health. Sleep, A Foundation of Health Naturopathic Medicine: Sleep, A Foundation of Health By Jennifer Krieger, ND Perhaps you are one of the lucky ones that easily fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow, but difficulty sleeping is an extremely common symptom that patients report on a daily basis. When we sleep, our bodies are literally regenerating - our cells repair themselves, our livers detox, our muscles rebuild, fat stores break down, blood sugar stabilizes, and our brain cells are restored. With the start of the new school year, I would like to stress the importance of proper sleep hygiene, not just for children getting back into a routine but for everyone. The following are some easy and helpful tips to help clean up your sleep schedule and catch some restful shut-eye. Get Enough First things first, make sure you give yourself a schedule that allows you to clock enough hours of sleep. It is recommended that adults sleep seven to eight hours per night, children and teens nine to eleven hours, toddlers nine to ten hours per night plus two to three hours of naps during the day, and infants nine to ten hours plus a minimum of three hours of naps during the day. Routine Along with scheduling the time for sleep, create a routine. Maintain a schedule that allows you regular sleep and wake times, as this is consistent with your circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm follows your own biological, internal clock and is geared toward a natural pattern of sleep and awake. Circadian rhythm often follows the daylight, and we are innately designed to retire to bed at 10 pm and rise and 6 am. Avoid napping in the afternoon if it disrupts your circadian rhythm. On the weekends, it is best to rise at the same time as you would during the week, so no sleeping in (except for teens)! Stop consuming products that contain caffeine at least six hours before your bedtime. Do not eat large meals, consume alcohol, or exercise two to three hours before your bedtime. One hour before bedtime create quiet time and start winding down - no worrying, stressing, studying, working, bright lights, or electronics. During this quiet time, try a relaxing bath infused with a few drops of lavender, vanilla, or sandalwood essential oils and a couple of cups of Epsom salt. Maybe you want to enjoy reading a relaxing book, spend time journaling about the events of your day, or quietly chatting with a loved one. Bedroom Functionality Matters A healthy bedroom should be designed for its purpose, a sleep sanctuary! Ask yourself, what do I hope to accomplish in the bedroom? It is recommended that the bedroom be reserved for sleeping and intimacy only. Do worrying, planning, studying and other mentally draining tasks outside of the bedroom. A comfortable bedroom supports good sleep, and a nice place to start is to learn how to feng shui your bedroom. Feng shui is the ancient Chinese practice of functional design to help balance the energy of the room and harmonize one with their environment. One feng shui tip for example, is that the headboard of the bed should be placed against a sturdy wall and not under a window. Maintain a clean room, clean the linens on the bed weekly and find a new home for any unnecessary clutter. Electronics have electromagnetic fields that can disrupt our own electromagnetic energy. Alarm clocks, cell phones, computers, and televisions can have this effect on you and are best kept out of the bedroom. In the winter, use your electric blanket to warm up your bed before sleep and then click it off during the night. The removal of electronics can be extremely difficult to accomplish, so if you must have electronics in the bedroom, they should remain at a distance of at least three feet from the bed. Sleeping Position In nature, deer, sheep, and cattle tend to sleep north-south, directly in alignment with the Earth's electromagnetic field. Research studies have also demonstrated that when we are sleeping east-west we have far shorter cycles of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in comparison to the longer cycles of REM when faced north-south. REM sleep is the final deep phase cycle of sleep and is correlated with memory consolidation as well as with overall health and wellness. Position your bed so that you are sleeping north-south, ideally with your head facing north to optimize REM sleep. Other Tips & Tricks Here are some other helpful hints to help you nod off at night. Get at least thirty minutes of exercise daily for deeper quality sleep. Sleep with dark curtains over windows or with ear plugs or an eye mask, if needed. Wearing socks to bed helps promote circulation to your feet, and keeping your feet cozy helps keep you from waking due to being chilled. Applying a warm water bottle to your belly helps you to relax, calm nerves, and release anxiety. Reciting a mantra, prayer, meditation, or simply counting sheep helps you to calmly drift off at night. If you are lying in bed for more than 30 minutes awake, get out of bed and move to a mundane activity until you are feeling drowsy. Repeat this as often as necessary. Lying in bed worrying about the fact that you can't sleep and why you are still awake only perpetuates difficulties with sleeping. If you do happen to rouse from sleeping in the middle of the night, DO NOT turn on any lights at all as this completely disrupts your circadian rhythm cycle. In addition to these suggestions, there are numerous natural remedies; including acupuncture, homeopathy, and botanical blends (to name a few) that can help you get your sleep back on track. All in all, I hope I was able to shine some light on a few helpful hints and tricks to help you catch some ZZZs. Sweet dreams, Billings! References are available upon request. Introversion Introversion Audrey Schenewerk, ND Do you feel more sensitive or reactive to your environment? Does this sensitivity sometimes wear you out? Are you asking yourself, \"what's wrong with me, I should want to spend hours with this group of really fun people.\" Perhaps, you would prefer to go home, read a book, or watch a movie. These are characteristics of a perfectly normal, though minority, personality called introversion. Our society is geared for the extrovert and encouraged to achieve success. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist, explored the differences between introverts and extroverts in his book Psychological Types. Explaining that extroverts dive into the external world of people and activities, while introverts are drawn to thoughts, feelings and the meaning of their actions. He also explored what will recharge these two different groups, finding extroverts will engage in social opportunities when they are feeling a decline in energy while an introvert will seek time alone. An introvert's desire for restoration in a quiet and possibly solitary environment does not mean this person disregards other people or has social anxiety, rather they are likely sensitive to their environmental triggers. Jung's work led to the popular Myers-Briggs personality test, which is used in many universities to guide students in finding a profession and in companies to gain success. Society is telling us that loud, charismatic or assertive people are successful. In fact, there are many empowering training programs to make you a successful person by developing these characteristics. This is not true for everyone. Historically, we have introverts who have made enormous impacts on society, including Rosa Parks, Abraham Lincoln, Steve Wozniak, Eleanor Roosevelt, Dr. Seuss, and the list goes on. These people made quiet discoveries or caused change that influence our daily lives. How can you tell if you are an introvert? You can take Myers-Briggs personality test, or consider whether you have many characteristics listed below: - Prefer working alone, uninterrupted - Think before you speak, and often do not get a turn in conversation - Close people may find you to be a good listener - Prefer a deep conversation with 1-2 people rather than small talk with many - Think about ideas and goals rather than discussing and planning them with others - Feel drained by social interactions, even if the events were fun - Dislike conflict and prefer to resolve problems calmly If you want to explore more about how your shyness, or sensitivity may be beneficial, and how these traits may help you enjoy life and be successful, consider reading the book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain. As a self-proclaimed introvert, the author explores our extroverted society and where the introvert can grow, share their strengths and care for themselves while making a quiet but significant impact on society. As naturopathic physicians, we appreciate this acknowledgement to our diversity in strengths and preferences. We find that incorporating this into individualized care can support mental/emotional and physical health, while empowering your life. Dietary Fiber and Your Microbiota Dietary Fiber and Your Microbiota Dr. Danielle Phillips-Dorsett, ND Just when dietary fiber was becoming a cold, wet mess of oatmeal in your breakfast bowl, new exciting research is showing us why making the effort to incorporate fiber into each meal of the day is a foundation to good health. Americans average 15 grams of fiber daily, while it is recommended to get at least 28 grams daily by the FDA. So this means that most of us are not getting enough, negatively impacting our health in the process. New studies are pouring out about how whole grains, vegetables and fruit, high in soluble and insoluble fibers, can alter the gut flora in positive ways. The emerging thought is that a reason fiber is beneficial, such as, lowering cholesterol, lowering blood sugars, and maintaining a healthy weight is due to fiber feeding beneficial bacteria. Some forms of fiber act as pre-biotics, meaning they are the food source for the gut flora. Once these good bacteria are fed what they need to thrive, they can change metabolic factors in our gut, which then impact our health in positive ways. Cellular Metabolism published a study in 2015 showing fiber improved glucose metabolism (regulation of blood sugars) due to increasing abundance of Prevotella, a species of bacteria in the large intestine. A study published in BMC Gastroenterology showed that alterations of gut flora, by dietary fiber, improved metabolic markers in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (a condition with no known surgical or medication intervention). In the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, pre and probiotics altering the microbiota were shown to decrease harmful products in the blood of chronic kidney disease patients. And, there are many more studies like these. So, what to do about that? Fiber tips: - There is no fiber in refined grains, meat or dairy products. Sad, but this means you need to add, or even substitute, some oatmeal, vegetables or fruit for your morning cheesy eggs with bacon and hash browns. - When eating fibrous foods, it is important to get adequate water intake so that stool does not dry and become more difficult to pass. - When you start increasing fiber in your diet, do so slowly or you may experience either diarrhea or worsening of constipation. Over time your body will be able to tolerate fiber more easily. - Situations fiber may not be for you: when your doctor recommends a low-fiber diet, inflammatory bowel disease, certain cancer treatments, traveler's diarrhea, diverticulitis and after intestinal surgeries. Signs you may not be getting enough fiber in your diet: - Straining to have a bowel movement, bloating, or going more than 1-2 days without having a bowel movement. Note, prolonged or painful constipation may be a sign of a more serious health problem and you should seek medical evaluation. - Feeling hungry within an hour or two after eating and weight gain. Foods with more fiber will increase your satiety and results in less calorie intake per meal. Bottom line, fiber is important for many health reasons and most of us do not get enough. Eat your apple, kale, quinoa, beans, broccoli and drink plenty of water!! IBS and the Link to SIBO Gazette Article: IBS and the SIBO Link Jennifer Krieger, ND Have you been told that you have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and experience digestive problems that include diarrhea, constipation, passing excess gas, bloating, food sensitivities, heartburn and abdominal pain on a regular basis? IBS has long been attributed to stress and anxiety, but now we have discovered that there is another cause! It may surprise you to learn of a health condition that is recently gaining much recognition in the medical community called SIBO. SIBO stands for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and simply put, means you have too much of a good thing. We are hearing a lot about the use of probiotics to treat everything from bowel problems to autoimmune disease and even depression. Probiotics deliver forms of the healthy gastrointestinal bacteria that reside in your small and large intestine. These bacteria play crucial roles in helping with the digestion of food and supporting the function of your immune system. In a healthy gastrointestinal tract, probiotics are in regulated amounts. SIBO occurs when the bacteria from the large intestine migrate and overgrow in the small intestine. When there is too much of these bacteria in the small bowel, these bacteria can damage and compete with your own body's small intestinal cells to absorb the nutrients from the food you are eating. When this happens, the bacteria end up producing large amounts of methane and hydrogen gas, which can cause the symptoms of IBS. These hydrogen and methane gases are only produced by bacteria, and do not naturally occur in the human digestive tract. The causes of SIBO are vast, including but not limited to: chronic constipation, food poisoning, stomach flu, ANY abdominal surgery, high levels of stress and certain medications such as antibiotics, birth control pills, proton pump inhibitors and pain medications. Apart from IBS, SIBO has also been linked to a variety of other medical conditions such as: fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, food allergies, acne, chronic fatigue syndrome, heartburn, hypothyroidism, diabetes, depression, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and many other gastrointestinal disorders. SIBO is diagnosed with a simple breath test that requires minimal preparation and can be completed in the convenience of your own home over the course of a few hours. There are three main ways to treat SIBO. The first being with a specialized antibiotic prescription (you may have noticed those commercials that tout the benefits of taking an antibiotic for your IBS symptoms). The second being a more natural route with antibacterial herbs. The third way is with a specific diet called the elemental diet, in which you are essentially starving and killing off the bacteria by eliminating the foods that cause the overgrowth, like carbohydrates and certain sugars. After the overgrown bacteria have been addressed, further nutrient support is needed to repair the gastrointestinal tract. A special diet is usually recommended for long-term treatment, as well as using motility agents to help regulate the gastrointestinal tract's natural migrating motor complex (to help keep things moving on out). Specific probiotics are also selected to help maintain the good bacteria in healthy, low levels. The gut is the root of the tree, and if it's not happy, you're not happy. If you suffer from IBS or other chronic medical conditions, look towards the health of your gastrointestinal tract as SIBO might be the culprit. The Surprising Key to Resiliency The Surprising Key to Resiliency Danielle Phillips-Dorsett, ND Have you been feeling crushing anxiety, fatigue, or depression after a devastating event? Easily overwhelmed, quick to anger or finding it hard to connect to those closest to you? These may be symptoms your body needs help building resiliency. After decades in jail, Gandhi rose to be the leader of an entire country. We're not all Gandhi, but we do have it within us to handle adversity without it tearing down our world (at least not forever). Resiliency: The ability to recover quickly from disruptive change, or misfortune without being overwhelmed or acting in dysfunctional or harmful ways. When we face our own pitfalls in life, the feeling of hopelessness may hang on longer than welcome. This is why the concept of resiliency and resiliency training has been of particular interest to those working with military personnel, domestic first responders (police, fire, emergency response teams) and children who face trauma. It does not stop there; those struggling to handle a breakup/divorce, death in the family, terminal diagnosis, discrimination, and (the most recent election cycle!) are also prone to overwhelming emotion. While it is completely normal and desirable to mourn and have strong emotions; they do not need to turn into lifelong patterns or interfere with getting back to a fulfilling life. Studies are coming out from a wide array of professional journals, including the Journal of Emergency Management, Journal of Clinical Psychology, and the Journal of Youth and Adolescence, looking at resiliency interventions. What I find most interesting is that while the word 'resilient' is defining an individual's ability, these studies are showing that support is actually the key to resiliency. If you are not feeling very resilient, here are some ways to garner support: *Support your mental health: This of course includes traditional counseling- you are not weak, crazy or weird for going to a mental health professional!! It also includes self-compassion, meditation, EMDR (a technique to move the body through trauma), and NeurOptimal or other biofeedback systems to train the body to return to a natural state. *Support your general wellbeing with connection: This is all about interpersonal relationships. Cultivate the relationships with friends and family that nourish and lift you up. Find an organization, such as the Wounded Warrior Project (veterans) or Casting for Recovery (breast cancer thrivers), that targets a specific group for supportive activities. Or, check out [www.meetup.com/Billings](http://www.meetup.com/Billings) for over 30 open groups interested in a variety of activities. *Support your physical health: Are you sleeping through the night and waking rested, eating to nourish your body, eliminating (pooping) daily, moving (exercising) regularly, and taking time to fully relax throughout your week? If not, pick one area and focus on improving it. For support, seek out a practitioner trained to help with these foundations of health. Side note: It is easiest to cultivate support when you need it least. Take these periods of time to reach out to others that may need your support. We all become more resilient when those around us are also resilient. If you feel like a naturally resilient person, consider acknowledging the people and opportunities that have helped you through a particularly rough situation.
