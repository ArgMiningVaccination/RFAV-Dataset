How Your Diet Can Boost Your Mental Wellness and Brain Power. Your diet impacts so much more than just weight management. What you put into your body influences the health of every organ and body system.. including your brain and your mental wellness. Foods that are rich in omega 3 fatty acids (like fish and nuts) and fruits/veggies that are rich in vitamin B and D promote brain health and increase brain function. The hippocampus is the area in your brain that controls your memory, your ability to learn and retain information and skills, and your mental health. Studies have shown that people with healthy diets actually have a significantly higher volume hippocampal area than those with unhealthy diets - this volume correlates with how well the hippocampus functions. In fact, people who eat healthy diets rich in whole foods (fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, whole grains, etc.) are up to 35% less likely to develop depression. Comparatively, those who consume high fat, processed, sugary, and fried foods on a regular basis have a 65% increased risk of depression.
