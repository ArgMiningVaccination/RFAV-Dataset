You might have even had questions about Acupuncture detoxing the body. In this article we go over what happens to the body during and after Acupuncture, and whether or not it detoxes the body. So, does Acupuncture detox the body? Acupuncture has the potential to detox the body of drugs, alcohol, chemicals, and toxins, according to recent studies. Meanwhile, others report that Acupuncture simply decreases the side effects of a regular detox. Read on to learn more about Acupuncture and detox. Does Acupuncture Detox The Body? Some studies report that Acupuncture may play a role in detoxing the body, particularly in those with substance addictions. [One study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740547299000100) reported that those treated with Acupuncture were less likely to be readmitted for detoxification within 6 months, concluding that Acupuncture is a useful treatment as part of the detoxification process. Another [study](https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.170546030151901) reported that Acupuncture with electrical stimulation may be a useful tool for the withdrawal process, especially in preventing depression and anxiety. However, the general consensus is that further research is required in this area. In TCM Acupuncture, it is thought that Acupuncture improves the health of the liver, kidneys, and the digestive system, all of which help to remove waste and toxins from the body. Acupuncture essentially clears any blockages caused by toxins, increasing the flow of energy throughout the body, and bringing the body back to a regular balance. If you're interested in how interventions may have a role in detoxification, read our recent blog about [sports massage and toxins](https://breeze.academy/blog/can-a-sports-massage-release-toxins-and-make-you-sick/), and whether or not it can make clients sick. What Toxins Does Acupuncture Release? Acupuncture can help detox the body, releasing several different toxins. But, don't assume that \"toxin\" automatically means terrible things, it can literally be substances found in everyday items and life, including; - Food and drink (especially with an unhealthy diet) - Environmental toxins - Alcohol - Drugs (prescription or otherwise) - Other chemicals encountered in everyday life In Traditional Chinese Medicine, this can also refer to blockages of energy (Qi) that disrupts the regular flow of energy around the body. These blockages are said to be the cause of various ailments and wellbeing issues. How Long Does The Body Detox After Acupuncture? The detoxing effects of Acupuncture can last for around 3 days. During this time the body is cleansing and removing toxins and waste build-up from the body. Because of this, clients may report fatigue and discomfort. However, others can report feeling revitalised. To help with this discomfort that some experience during detoxification, we recommend rest and for them to take it easy for a few days post-treatment. A hot bath or shower before bed can help to ease any discomfort, and good hydration is key for strong, lasting effects. What Happens to The Body During Acupuncture? During an Acupuncture treatment, the [stimulation of the nervous system](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture) releases chemicals into the muscles, spinal cord, and brain, helping to stimulate the body's natural healing abilities. This, in turn, promotes physical and emotional well-being, particularly with continued treatments over a period of time. [Research funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28717380/) found that Acupuncture, when performed correctly, helps the body to release more nitric oxide at the points where the needles are inserted. This increases blood flow and triggers the body to release natural anesthetics which can create warming and cooling sensations. Other [NIH studies](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture) found Acupuncture to be effective in treating, or reducing/easing the symptoms of, the following; - Nausea - Pain - Addiction - Headaches and migraines - Menstrual cramps - Musculoskeletal issues - Osteoarthritis - Asthma In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed that disease and ill health is caused by disruptions to the flow of energy throughout the body (Qi). Acupuncture stimulates the appropriate part of the body, releasing the Qi that has built up and blocked the flow. The Qi is then free to flow through the meridians as normal. Can Acupuncture Reset The Body? Some argue that Acupuncture doesn't necessarily reset the body, but restores balance to the body. This is more in line with TCM Acupuncture than with Western medicine, restoring physical and emotional wellbeing. Some of the most common reported reasons for this include: Unblocking of Energy Flow In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture is said to remove blockages in the body that stops energy (Qi) from flowing freely and promotes health and wellbeing. If the Qi is healthy, then so is the body. Placebo Effect Some medical professionals believe the effects of Acupuncture to be no more than a placebo effect, but whether or not this is true remains to be said. However, a healing tool is a healing tool, placebo or not. Just because we don't fully understand the science behind Acupuncture doesn't diminish its effects. Stimulation of Nerves [Some believe](https://www.livescience.com/29494-acupuncture.html) that the stimulation of nerves during Acupuncture activates the body's internal healing mechanisms, where the brain sends signals to the area of concern to restore balance. What's more, the reported benefits of relaxation and reduction of anxiety and stress may allow the body to restore and repair uninterrupted.
