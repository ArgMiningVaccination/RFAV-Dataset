Here is some information on pet acupuncture if you are interested in this non-traditional pet therapy. What is Pet Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a Chinese medical practice that has been around for thousands of years. While it was originally developed for use in humans, doctors have found that this ancient tradition actually confers many medical benefits to pets as well. Pet acupuncture involve inserting fine needles into specific energy points in the body. The theory behind this is that pain or sickness can occur when the body's natural energy flows are disrupted. By placing acupuncture needles on specific energy points, it spurs a healing reaction within the body's cells. Benefits of Pet Acupuncture One of the main benefits that pets can receive from acupuncture treatments is pain relief. In animals suffering from a chronic pain condition or dealing with wound recovery, acupuncture can help to ease pain receptors in the body. This in turn helps an ailing pet to rest better and recover faster than just letting them heal on their own over time. Acupuncture can help to improve blood circulation in the body, which confers a variety of health benefits (better oxygenation of cells, increased energy levels, etc.). The procedure has also been shown to reduce inflammation caused by certain autoimmune diseases. It can also help a trained veterinarian to pinpoint the source of a pet's ailment, leading to better treatment outcomes.

The veterinarian inserts the acupuncture needles in energy points along the pet's body. Some animals react so well to the procedure that they become very relaxed.
