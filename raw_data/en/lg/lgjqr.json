Hi Gianna, what do you want your legacy to be? My goal has always been to help as many people heal as possible! I truly hope to help as many people who are suffering or who have been through some really hard times or trauma, know that they will make it through and they are stronger than they even know. I want to help as many people remember who they truly are, their own truth, and their divine purpose, because we all have that divine purpose and we are all worthy and deserving of living a life we love. The healing work that I have learned to help others with is meant to fully empower us all and remind us that we all have all of the answers we need within us. That's what I want my legacy to be, and for people to remember me by the healing work that I do with them, and if they ever forget how powerful they are, I hope my book Soul of a Spirit Warrior - A True Story of Healing, Survival, and Resilience continues to remind them. Alright, so for those in our community who might not be familiar with your business, can you tell us more? I have my own healing practice in Ocean Beach, San Diego. I was actually a really busy hairstylist for many years, but my true passion was in the healing arts. While I was busy making people's hair look gorgeous, I was also studying at the Tranquility School of Healing and training as a mentor. In 2016, I was involved in a severe car accident while driving home from yoga one evening. I was hit by a drunk driver driving the wrong way on the 5-north freeway. My life changed forever that night. I thought I was going to die... When I woke up a week later from a weeks-long coma in the ICU at Scripps La Jolla, I knew that I would no longer be able to do hair because the injuries were so severe, however, what I did learn very quickly was that once I healed myself through this trauma, that I would be able to help many other people through this type of thing, and I was determined to do so! I actually started seeing people out of my home first, helping them through trauma as I was also writing my book about my experience 'Soul of a Sprit Warrior - A True Story of Healing, Survival, and Resilience'. And then more and more people started to come and see me, so I eventually got a space to work out of in Ocean Beach where I now see and work with many different people of all ages. I am mostly mentoring people through trauma, inner child therapy and I also include different healing modalities such as energy healing, sound healing, and different breathing and meditation techniques. I also just created my own healing program called 'Spirit Warrior Training' which is a healing program designed to work one on one with me for 6 months as well as an online structure to help support students every step of the way through their healing journey. Plus I also now have my own line of crystal alchemy singing bowls called 'Infinite Blessings Angel Alchemy'. All of this was created out of trauma - that's what I want people to know! When no one else believed in me and the healing arts work I was doing, I believed in me, because I knew how much these tools helped me through my own healing experience and that's why I created this space for others. Any places to eat or things to do that you can share with our readers? If they have a friend visiting town, what are some spots they could take them to? My favorite spots in San Diego.... Well, I like to eat mostly plant-based, so I would want people to know about all of the incredible vegan eats there are around here! My fave vegan spots are Donna Jeans for an incredible vegan lasagna, The Plot for vegan sushi, and my new favorite spot with an Indian flair is called Greenhaus on Morena with a delish menu. I live on the bay at Crown Point so I would have to say my favorite thing ever to do which is so accessible is riding my bike along the beautiful bay over to the beaches. We are so blessed to live here Who else deserves some credit and recognition? My shoutout goes to my dear teachers who helped me along the way. First of all, I would like to thank the Tranquility School of Healing, which is where I did most of my training and learning in the healing arts and where I met my first teacher Alisha Olivier Park. And I would also like to thank my dear teacher Tara Johanssen who then helped me understand trauma at an even deeper level. It's also most important for me to thank our lineage of healers and those who came before us for centuries and centuries using these alternative and holistic medicines such as aromatherapies, sound healing, Reiki energy healing, and yoga. These practices have been passed down to us by our ancestors and we would not have them without the wisdom of our elders. So I honor and thank them each day for these beautiful practices.
