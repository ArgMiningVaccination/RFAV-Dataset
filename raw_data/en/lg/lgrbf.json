Their widening acceptance demands continual safety assessment. This review, a sequel to one our team published 10 years ago, is an evaluationofthefrequencyandseverityofadverseevents(AEs)reportedforacupuncture,moxibustion,andcuppingbetween2000and 2011. Relevant English-language reports in six databases w ere identified and assessed by two reviewers. During this 12-year period,117reportsof308AEsfrom25countriesandregionswereassociatedwithacupuncture(294cases),moxibustion(4cases),or cupping(10cases).Countryofoccurrence,patient'ssexandage,andoutcomewereextracted.Infections,mycobacterial,staphylo-coccal, and others, were the main complication of acupuncture. In the previous review, we found the main source of infection to be hepatitis, caused by reusable needles. In this review, we found the majority of infections to be bacterial, caused by skin contact at acupoint sites; we found no cases of hepatitis. Although the route of infection had changed, infections were still themajor complication of acupuncture. Clearly, guidelines such as Clean Needle Technique must be followed in order to minimize acupunctureAEs. 1. Introduction Traditionalacupuncture,which at acupuncture points [ 1], has become popular in the United States and the rest of the world in recent decades.Data released by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in2008 reported that 3.1 million American adults and 150,000childrenusedacupuncturein2007.Adultuseofacupunctureincreasedbyapproximatelyamillionpeopleinthefiveyearsfrom2002to2007[ 2].Thisincreasedusebringsattentionto thesafetyandqualityofthemodality. A number of large surveys on the safety of acupuncture havebeenconducted,mainlyinEurope.Mostreportedinci-dents have been fairly minor, and incidence rates were low.For example, in a prospective survey of 34,000 treatments by traditional acupuncturists, MacPherson et al. [ 3]f o u n d no serious adverse events (AEs) and 43 minor ones, a rateof 1.3 per 1000 treatments. In another prospective survey,Melchart et al. [ 4] found 7.1% minor AEs and 5 serious ones a m o n g9 7 , 7 3 3a c u p u n c t u r ep a t i e n t s .Th ea u t h o r so ft h e s estudies concluded that serious AEs seem to be rare and thatacupunctureisgenerallyasafeintervention.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Only original case reports of complications or AEs of acupuncture, moxibus-tion,andcuppingpublishedfrom2000to2011wereincludedin this review. Two authors independently screened thetitles and abstracts of all papers found from the initialsearch.Disagreementsbetweenthetwoauthorswereresolved throughdiscussion. Weexcludedmultipleinclusionsandanalysesofthesame AE as well as irrelevant studies. An irrelevant study wasdefined as a non-case report, such as a review, commentary,orclinicaltrial. AEs reporting infection, internal organ or tissue injury, and other severe consequences are categorized as \"compli-cations,\" defined as an added difficulty; a complex state;a disease or accident superimposed upon another without beingspecificallyrelated.Peripheralorsecondaryeffectssuch as syncope, nausea, or immune reactions are classified as\"adversereactions\"[ 5]. 2.3. Data Extraction. At o t a lo f1 6 1 3p a p e r sw e r ef o u n d ; 117 were relevant (Figure 1). When provided, we extracted author,yearofpublication,countryofoccurrence,numberofpatients affected, disease originally treated, preexisting con-ditions that might have contributed to the AE, the needlingsite, the reported AE and its outcome, the practitioner'straining, and the patient's status at followup. The majority ofthe reports did not give the date of the AEs. The data wereextracted by two independent coauthors, double checked toensurematching,andorganizedbywhethertheAEswere(1)complicationsor(2)adversereactions.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 Table1:Adverseeventsassociatedwithacupuncture,moxibustion, Adverseevents Pneumothorax 13Centralnervesystem 9 7 Othercomplications 7 Adverse reactions 10Moxibustion 4 Cupping 10 Total 308 3. Results Fortheyears2000-2011,atotalof117reportscontaining308 AEs associated with acupuncture (294 cases), moxibustion(4 cases), and cupping (10 cases) were identified from 25countriesandregions(T able 1). 3.1. Acupuncture Complications: Infections. At o t a lo f2 3 9 reported cases were infections associated with acupuncture. These include 48 individual isolated cases reported in 45 papers (Table 2)a n d1 9 1c a s e sr e p o r t e di nfi v eo u t b r e a k s (Table3).Incidentswerereportedin17countriesandregions. Koreareported162cases,Canada33,HongKong7,Australia8 ,J a p a n5 ,T a i w a n5 ,U K4 ,U S A6 ,S p a i n1 ,I r e l a n d1 ,France1,Malaysia1,Croatia1,Scotland1,Venezuela1,Brazil1, and Thailand 1. Most of the papers did not report thepractitioner'straining,but4casesweretreatedbyindividualswith no medical training or license [ 6,7]. One patient with a knee infectiondied due to renalfailure[ 8]. All other cases recoveredaftertheinfectionwastreated. 3.2. Mycobacterium Infection. Of the 239 cases of infection, 193 (80.75%; 153 from Korea, 32 from Canada, 5 from HongKong,1fromVenezuela,1fromBrazil,and1fromSpain)wereassociatedwithmycobacterium. In 2006, Song et al. reported an outbreak of 40 cases of infection in an Oriental medicine clinic in Republic ofKorea. Although disposable acupunctureneedles were used,the patients developed skin lesions at two or more sites onthe body; infections were confirmed by laboratory culture,clinicalsigns,andhistopathology.Allpatientsrecoveredafteractive treatment with antibiotics. Reportedly, these patientsreceivedhot-packtherapyandgelmassageafteracupuncturetreatment. No further cases were found in that clinic afterequipmentsterilization,andregulartowelchangeswereinsti- tuted. The authorsof thereportconcludedthatthe outbreakof infection was due to improper sterilization of equipmentapplied to the skin after withdrawal of acupuncture needles[52]. In2006,Tangetal.reportedanoutbreakofacupuncture- associated bacterial infection in Canada. Between April and December 2002, thirty-two patients developed cutaneousmycobacteriosis after visiting an acupuncture practice inToronto. Interviews with the patients and acupuncturistrevealed that needles were reused and kept in a container ofglutaraldehyde disinfectant prior to insertion. The solutionwas no longer available at the time of the investigation butwasprobablyimproperlydilutedwithtapwater[ 51]. In 2009, Koh et al. reported an outbreak of 109 cases of skin and soft tissue infection in an acupuncture clinic inRepublicofKorea.Mostpatientshadatleastoneskinlesion.Investigators determined that disposable acupuncture nee-dleswereusedandwereunlikelytobethesourceofinfection.Infectedpatientswerealltreatedbyaphysicaltherapycalled\"interferential current therapy\" or \"low-frequency therapy.\"The authors found that the diluted disinfectant used tosanitizethetherapeuticequipmenthadbeenpreparedseveralmonths earlier and was contaminated with Mycobacterium abscessus,thelikelysourceoftheoutbreak[ 54]. Woo et al. reported four cases of infection by alcohol- resistantmycobacterium,discoveredoveratwo-yearperiod,inpatientswithskinlesionswhowerereceivingacupuncturetreatment in Hong Kong (Table 3). The patients had clin- ical and/or radiological lesions at acupuncture points. The acupuncturists' training and whether disposable acupunc- ture needles were used were not reported. The authorsrecommended that proper infection control guidelines foracupunctureshouldbemandatoryandstrictlyimplemented[50]. 3.3. Staphylococcus Infection. Nineteen cases from 14 case reports concern staphylococcus infections associated withacupuncture[ 14,15,17,21,25,27,28,30,33,38,39,46,47,53]. Ofthese,ninepatientswereinfectedbymethicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA): six from Australia [ 53], one fromKorea[ 33], one from Taiwan [ 47], from Hong Kong [38]. IntheAustraliancase,Murrayetal.reporteda2008out- breakofeightcasesofinvasiveMRSA,sixofthemassociatedwithacupuncture(Table 3).Afterextensiveinvestigation,the authorsconcludedthattheoutbreakmostlikelyresultedfrom a breakdown in sterile technique during the acupunctureprocedureandthattheMRSAwasprobablytransmittedfrom the medical practitioner to the patients. At two time points fifteen months apart, that practitioner had been positivelycolonized with the MRSA strain that caused the infection[53]. 3.4. Other Infections. Other infections (31 cases) include septic arthritis [ 10,23,31,39], necrotizing fasciitis 2002 [ 50] HK 4 Alcohol-resistantmycobacteria Notspecified Recovered Tang 2006 [ 51] Canada 32 Mycobacteriosis Acupuncturist Recovered Song2006[ 52] Korea 40 Mycobacteriosis Orientalmedicalclinic Recovered Murray 2008 [ 53] Australia 6 MRSA Acupuncturist Recovered Koh 2010 [ 3.5. Acupuncture Complications: Organ and Tissue Injuries. Of 38 cases of organ or tissue injuries, 13 were pneumotho-raxes(Table 4);9werecentralnervesysteminjuries(Table 5); 4 were peripheral nerve injuries (Table 6); 5 were heart injuries (Table 7); 7 were other organ and tissue injuries (Table8).Thecasesweredistributedamongtencountries:10 from South Korea, 6 from the USA, 6 from Taiwan, 5 fromJapan,3fromtheUK,2fromGermany,2fromHongKong,1fromAustria,1fromIran,1fromSingapore,and1fromNewZealand. Although most papers did not report the trainingbackground of the practitioner, 3 cases were reportedlytreatedbyindividualswithnomedicaltrainingorlicense[ 55- 57]. 3.6. Pneumothorax (Table 4).Of 13 cases of pneumothorax [58-70] associated with acupuncture, the USA reported 3,t h eU K2 ,H o n gK o n g2 ,J a p a n2 ,S i n g a p o r e1 ,G e r m a n y1 , Taiwan 1, and New Zealand 1. Most of these were reported byemergencyroomphysicians.Themajorpatientcomplaintswere dyspnea and chest pain; pneumothorax was confirmedbyX-ray.Allbutoneofthe13patientsrecovered.A72-year-oldwomandied90minutesafteranacupuncturetreatment;autopsy confirmed cause was needle penetration ofthethoraciccavity[ 60]. 3.7.CentralNervousSystemInjury(Table 5).Therewerenine cases of central nervous system injury, including five spinalcord injuries [ 55,73-75,77] and four of brain injury [ 56,71, 72,76]. Twoofthespinalinjurieswerecausedbymigratingbro- ken needles [ 55,75]; the others to needle insertion; the medulla injury was caused by a (Table 6).Four reported cases o fperi p h eraln erv ein j uryw er ur etreatment [ 78-81] ,o n ee a c hi nJ a p a n ,K o r e a ,t h eU S A ,a n d the UK. The injured nerves were the peroneal nerve viaacupuncturepointGB34themediannerveviaPC5andPC6,thefacialnerveviaST7andST8,andtheL5nerverootviaabrokenneedleinthelumbarregion.Allpatientsrecovered. 3.9. Heart Injury (Table 7).Five cases of heart injury include two of cardiac tamponade [ 82,83], one of the hemopericardium [ 57], one embolism [ 84], and one myocardial injury [ 85]. Of these, two were due to the migration of embedded needles [ 83,84]a n dt w ow e r e due to needle insertion [ 57,82]. Two were caused by an acupuncturist or TCM practitioner, and one by an \"unau-thorized acupuncturist\" [ 57]. The status of two practitioners was unreported. Three patients recovered; outcome was notreportedintheothertwocases. 3.10. Other Organ and Tissue Injuries (Table 8).Seven cases of other organ and tissue injuries were found: a pseudoa-neurysm of the abdominal sheath hematoma [90],earhematomas[ 91],andapoplitealarteriovenousfistula [92]. The patient with acute traumatic pancreatitis had been treatedwith13cmneedlesplacedatthreesitesontheanteriorabdominalwall.Abdominalcomputedtomographyrevealedsmall multiple gold acupuncture needles on the anteriorabdominal wall and back muscles. The patient's conditionquickly improved with fasting and intravenous fluids [ 88]. Onepatientdied[ 89]. 3.11. Other Complications of Acupuncture. Seven other complications associated with acupuncture were reported(Table9): bilateral hand edema [ 93], sites [ 99]. The localized argyria and pancytopenia were caused by needles embedded 20 and 17 years earlier,respectively [ 96,98 ], in a type of Japanese acupuncture reported in our previous review [ 5]. The epithelioid granulomas were caused by silicone coating on the needles[94]. The scars were due to a hot needle technique in which theneedleswereheatedinfirebeforeinsertion[ 99]. 3.12. Adverse Reactions Associated with Acupuncture. Ten cases of adverse reactions from acupuncture were found(Table10): three of syncope from two reports [ 100,101]; two of galactorrhoea (spontaneous milk flow) [ 102,103]; one of bilateralnystagmus[ 104];oneofpyodermagangrenosumdue toimmunereaction,inwhichthetissuebecamenecroticanddeep ulcers eruptive lichen 107]; one of spontaneous needle migration [ 108]. These unusual cases are uncommonly seen in regular acupuncture practice. The case report authorspostulated that these AEs were likely caused by a rare physi-ologicalreactiontotheacupunctureneedle.Forexample,thecase report of spontaneous needle movement involved the acupuncture needles having \"spontaneously moved deeper as far as the hilt, travelling an extra depth of 5-10mm,\"whichwasobservedrepeatedlyonthesamepatient.Althoughthere was no resulting complicating in this case, the authorscautioned that this could have caused serious complicationsiftheneedleshadbeenplacednearavitalorgan[ 108]. Thesyncopecasesoccurredimmediatelyorseveralmin- utes after a first acupuncture treatment; the patients weresittingorsemirecumbentduringtreatment[ 100,101]. 3.13. Complications Associated with Moxibustion. Four AEs associated with moxibustion were found (Table 11): bruising [109], burns \"untrained individual\" p e r f o r m e dt h et h i r d[ 110]; there was no information on the fourth[109]. 3.14. AEs Associated with Cupping. Ten AEs associated with cuppingwerefound(Table 12):fourfromTurkey,threefrom Korea, two from Taiwan, and one from the UK. Most wereminor: keloid scarring [ 113], burns were serious: acquired hemophilia A [ 118], stroke 14 hours after cupping on the back and neck [ 119], factitious panniculitis [ 120], reversible cardiac hypertrophy [ 121], and iron deficiency anemia [ 122]. These last two cases involved cupping with bleeding [ 121,122]. In six cases, there wasnoinformationonpractitionertraining;intheotherfour,treatmentwasself-administered. 4. Discussion Our primary objective in reviewing case reports of AEsassociated with acupuncture has been to identify individualc a s e sa n do u t b r e a k so fA E sa n dt oa n a l y z et h e i rp o s s i b l ecauses, in order to minimize future acupuncture AEs andenhance safe practice within the profession. How do theobjectivesandresultsofthisreviewfitinthecontextofotheravailable literatures on the safety of acupuncture? Incidence rates for major AEs of acupuncture are best estimated from largeprospectivesurveysofpractitioners.Fourrecentsurveysof acupuncture safety among regulated, qualified practition-ers, two conducted in Germany [ 4,123]a n dt w oi nt h e UnitedKingdom[ 3,124],confirmthatseriousadverseevents after acupuncture are uncommon. Indeed, of these surveys,covering more than 3 million acupuncture treatments alltogether, there were no deaths or permanent disabilities,a n da l lt h o s ew i t hA E sf u l l yr e c o v e r e d[ 125]. Thus, it can be concluded that acupuncture has a very low rate of AEs,when conducted among licensed, qualified practitioners inthe West. Recent systematic reviews of RCTs of acupunc-ture [126-128], in which the no 128],althoughone ofthesesystematicreviewsofRCTsseparatelyexaminedcasereportsofAEsassociatedwithacupunctureandhadfindingscomparable to ours. However, any medical intervention hasthe potential to cause damage, particularly when adminis-tered by an untrained or unqualified practitioner, or in anunregulatedsetting.Ourobjectivewasthustoidentifysignalsthat might suggest the potential for AEs of acupuncture,whenadministeredinspecificsettings,orwhenusingspecificacupuncture styles, and also to compare the patterns of AEsin the past 12 years with the patterns identified in the 35-year period covered by our first review. Comparing the newdata with that of the previous review shows the emergenceof some important new patterns, which may be relevant for futureregulationandpolicymaking. Although the majority of the AEs are still infections, t h er o u t e so fi n f e c t i o nh a v ec h a n g e d .O u rp r e s e n tfi n d i n g sinclude239AEsfrominfection;191occurredinfiveoutbreaksofbacterialinfectioncausedbyskincontactwithunsterilizedequipmentanddirtytowels,inunhygienicclinicalsettings.Inourpreviousfindings,hepatitiscross-infectionsfrompatientto patient due to reused needles (94 cases reported in fouroutbreaks) were the most frequent source of infection. Sincethe introduction of disposable needles, hepatitis infectionshaverarelybeenreported,whichisanimportantachievementthat has resulted from the greater regulation of acupuncturepractice, particularly the requirement in recent years, bacterial infections, including MRSAandmycobacterium,havebecomepervasiveinhealth-caresettingsingeneral[ 129].Suchinfections,apressingcon- cern for all medical practitioners, including acupuncturists,resultfrompoorhygiene.Hygienicclinicalsettings,sterilizedequipment, and clean supplies are critical for preventingfuturesuchinfections. Pneumothoraxisstillthemostcommonorganandtissue injury. There were also cases of spinal cord injuries dueto short, small needles embedded laterally along the spinein the Japanese practice known as okibari.Th ep u t a t i v e mechanism responsible for this AE is that the imbeddedneedles used in the Japanese okibariacupuncture technique c o ul ds po n ta n eo u s l ym i gr a t ewi th i nth eti s s u e ,wi thso m eo fthemmigratingtothespinalcordtocausespinalcordinjury[130]. However, this AE has significantly decreased since our previous review, in which 11 cases due to this practicewere found. In the present review, we found organ injuriesmainly to be associated with faulty needle insertion. Heart i n j u r i e sc a nb ef a t a l ,a l t h o u g hn od e a t hw a sr e p o r t e di nt h efive cases we found. Acupuncture training programs mustenhancestudentknowledgeofanatomyateachacupuncturepoint. Supervised clinical internships must provide rigoroustraininginneedledirection,depthofinsertionwithattentiontothesizeofthepatient,andmethodsofmanipulation. Three cases reported deaths attributed to acupuncture [8,60,89] .T w ow e r ed u et oo r g a ni n j u ri e s[ 60,89], and one tension pneumothorax following acupuncture. Thefinding of the autopsy also suggested the patient that mayhave been injured by the insertion of the needles into thelungs during the previous acupuncture treatments. The sec-ond organ injury death, from Korea, reported that a 68-year-oldwomandiedofmassivehematemesisresultingfromaortoduodenal fistula. The autopsy showed an (3mo) abdominal aorta, caused by a deep insertion with a 15cm long acupuncture needle into the abdomen [ 89]. The third casewasreportedfromScotlandinwhicha69-year-oldmandied from an infection after acupuncture treatment at thethigh [8]. The patient was later found to have a preexisting pancytopenia(i.e.,lowwhitebloodcellcount),resultinginani n c r e a s e ds u s c e p t i b i l i t yt oi n f e c t i o n .Th ec a s er e p o r ta u t h o r ,who is also the practitioner, admitted that the patient's skinattheacupuncturepointwasnotcleanedpriortotheneedleinsertion and later found local muscle infection which ledto septicaemia. The patient died a few weeks later froma multiorgan failure. These three unfortunate death casessuggest that biomedical knowledge such as anatomy andmicrobiology is needed in order avoid organ injury and infection.Skincleansingshouldalsoberequired,particularly forthosepatientswithimmunecompromisedcondition. There were only a handful of cases reported by practi- tionerswhoperformedtheacupuncture[ 8,100,101,103,104, 108]i n c l u d i n gad e a t hr e p o r t[ 8]. The rest of the cases were reported by investigators who were not the acupuncturistswho performed the treatment. Most cases of AEs did notreportthequalificationofthepractitioner.Wewouldsuggestthat future report on AEs of acupuncture should include theinformationonthetrainingqualificationofthepractitionersandtheprocedureusedforthetreatment,suchaswhetherornotcleanneedletechniqueswereused.Acupuncturesafetypracticeguidanceorguidelinessuch as Clean Needle Technique (CNT) appear to have played acriticalroleinminimizingthenumberofAEsassociatedwithacupuncture practice [ 129] .I nt h eU n i t e dS t a t e s ,C N Tw a s firstaddressedbytheNationalCertificationCommissionforAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine in 1984.

In our previous review, about half of the 202 cases ofAE that we identified were from the USA. However, as ourpresent review shows, AE cases reported from the USA arenow rare. Of the 308 cases we found, only 13 were from theU n i t e dS t a t e s ,a n do u to f2 3 9c a s e so fi n f e c t i o n ,o n l y5a r efrom the United States. It should be noted that there werevery few case reports of AEs from China included in thisreview, although acupuncture is widely practiced in China.We are aware that cases of AEs associated with acupuncturep e r f o r m e di nC h i n aa r el i k e l yt ob er e p o r t e di nC h i n e s e12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine language case reports, which are not reflected in the present reviewduetolanguagelimitation.W earecurrentlypreparingaseparatereviewonAEsreportedinChina.
