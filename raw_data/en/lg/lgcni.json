Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||16 Years - 55 Years| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria:1. Men and non-pregnant women, ages 16 to 55 years inclusive. 2. Subjects with physician-diagnosed peanut allergy or documented history of peanut allergy. Note: If subject does not have documented history in their medical record but is reasonably suspected of having peanut allergy and is deemed to otherwise be a good candidate for this trial, the screen testing (peanut specific IgE, SPT, etc.) may be used to establish the peanut allergy and the PI may subsequently document the peanut allergy to fulfill this inclusion criterion. 3. Subjects with weight 31.25 kg at Screening. Subjects who fall outside of this range may be included at the discretion of the investigator. 4. Subjects with a documented history of non-severe anaphylaxis (Grade 3) to peanuts, including mild wheezing or dyspnea without hypoxia. 5. Subjects with peanut specific IgE > 5 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP at Screening. Subjects who have previously been on OIT for peanut allergy and who do not have peanut specific IgE 5 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP at Screening may be included at the discretion of the investigator, OR Subjects with a positive skin prick test (SPT) to peanut with a change in wheal diameter 3 mm as compared to a negative control (50% glycerin) at Screening. Subjects who have previously been on OIT for peanut allergy and who do not have a positive skin prick test (SPT) to peanut with a change in wheal diameter 3 mm at Screening may be included at the discretion of the investigator. 6. Subjects who are self-reported to be on a peanut free diet with no suspected peanut exposure, including any peanut food challenge, for at least 14 days prior to Screening and agreement to continue restriction to peanut exposure during the study. 7. Female subjects and male subjects and their female spouse/partners who are willing to practice a highly effective method of contraception that may include, but is not limited to, abstinence, sex only with persons of the same sex, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner, vasectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, licensed hormonal methods, intrauterine device (IUD), or use of spermicide combined with a barrier method (e.g., condom, diaphragm) starting at Screening and continuing to Day 60. 8. Female subjects who agree to not breastfeed starting at initial Screening and continuing to Day 60. 9. Female subjects who agree to not donate ova starting at initial Screening and continuing to Day 60. 10. Subjects who are willing and able to provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written informed consent. 11. Subjects who are willing to perform and comply with all study procedures. 12. Male subjects who agree to not donate sperm starting at Screening and continuing to Day 60. Exclusion Criteria:1. Subjects with history of severe anaphylaxis to peanuts defined as neurological compromise or requiring intubation. 2. Subjects with peanut specific IgE 100 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP at Screening. 3. Subjects who have received administration of vaccinations in the following timeframe: - - Any live vaccine (other than intranasal Influenza) within 28 days prior to Screening. - - Any subunit vaccine within 14 days prior to Screening. - - Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2020: Personalized management to control symptoms and minimize future risk requiring treatment Steps 4 or 5 (Appendix 3) OR; - Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 80% of predicted, or ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 75% of predicted, with or without controller medications (only those able to reliable perform spirometry. - - One overnight admission to a hospital in the past year for asthma OR; - Emergency room visit for asthma within 6 months prior to Screening OR; - History of two or more systemic corticosteroid courses within 6 months of Screening or one course of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months of Screening to treat asthma/wheezing OR; - Prior intubation/mechanical ventilation for asthma/wheezing. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. The Escalation Phase will consist of multiple cohorts (4 subjects per cohort) to identify a safe and tolerable dose(s). The Expansion Phase will consist of up to 40 additional subjects who will receive either a Placebo or CNP-201 at a safe and tolerable dose as determined from the Escalation Phase. One or more dose levels may be explored in the Expansion Phase. Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at screening will be enrolled into the study. In the Escalation Phase, each cohort of four - (4) subjects will receive CNP-201 by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days #1 and #8. - (7) days after the second administration of CNP-201 or Placebo, subjects must return to the clinic for collection of safety labs, PD measurements, and assessment of AEs and medication changes. Arms Experimental: CNP-201 1 mg intravenous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8: 1 mg CNP-201 Experimental: CNP-201 2 mg intravenous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8: 2 mg CNP-201 Experimental: CNP-201 4 mg intravenous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8: 4 mg CNP-201 Experimental: CNP-201 8 mg intravenous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8: 8 mg CNP-201 Placebo Comparator: Placebo 200 ml intravenous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8: CNP-201 Placebo Interventions Drug: - CNP-201 CNP-201 is comprised of purified peanut extract (PPE) drug substance dispersed within a negatively charged polymer matrix of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles at a target concentration of ~5 g of PPE per mg of PLGA.
