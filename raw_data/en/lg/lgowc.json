Chronic pain is a widespread issue and you are not alone. Our treatment experts at Integrative Health and Injury Center are here to help you get to the bottom of your chronic pain issue. If you are like most of our patients, you have been to multiple different doctors, including your PCP, pain specialists, neurologists and more and been unsuccessful in finding an answer for your pain. While steroid injections, opioid pain medication, muscle relaxers, nerve blocks, radiofrequency nerve ablation and surgery all have a time and a place in dealing with chronic pain they are not always the answer. Our clinic focuses on natural and alternative methods of pain management that you will not find at a traditional doctor's office. Our treatment methods include: - Atlas Orthogonal Adjustments - A specialized chiropractic adjustment on the C1 vertebrae. Whether you've been in a car accident or had some other traumatic injury, a gentle adjustment of the atlas can make all the difference in your neck and back pain and headaches. This technique was invented by Dr. Roy Sweat out of Atlanta and is only performed by a select few doctors in the state of Arizona. Dr. Peter Gariboldi has over 30 years' experience using this technique to get thousands of patients out of pain and back to their life. - Perineural Injection Treatment - This treatment takes a fresh approach to the treatment of chronic pain. Invented by Dr. John Lyftogt, a medical doctor from New Zealand, this injection technique focuses on treating your pain at the site of your peripheral nerves. It is a safe and effective injection that involves a glucose solution and treats the bodies peripheral nerves that are not functioning optimally. Chronic pain comes from these peripheral nerves when they are inflamed, also known as neurogenic inflammation. When the glucose solution is injected around the nerves, they soak up the glucose and begin to heal, reducing pain and returning nutrients to the damaged surrounding tissue. These injections are designed to be a safe and first line approach before more invasive injections or surgery are performed on the body or various joints. - Personalized Diet Plan - Chronic pain is deeply rooted in a body-wide inflammation problem and a proper diet can make all the difference in the world in getting out of pain. In the US, convenience rules and fast food joints line almost every intersection. Food is medicine and getting back to the basics with nutrition is always a part of your treatment plan for chronic pain at our clinic. Dr. Gariboldi believes that a whole foods, plant based diet where at least 80% of your calories are coming from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. Diet is the basis of reducing body-wide inflammation and getting out of pain and feeling your best - Professional Line Supplements - While we prefer that our patients get most of their nutrients from food, there are cases when supplementation is needed to address nutrient deficiencies. Our doctors at IHI center will look over your lab work and diet history and help you fill in the holes of missing nutrients that can complete your diet plan and get you out of pain. Our goal is to get you the highest quality supplements at the best price and not have you taking a ton of pills every day.

While you have probably heard of IV antibiotics or fluids for dehydration, at Integrative Health and Injury Center we focus on nutrient IV therapy. IV Therapy is a more effective and therapeutic way to introduce nutrients to the body than taking the same substances by mouth. The gastrointestinal system does not always absorb substances optimally and instead of taking multiple pills daily, an IV can get you all the nutrients you need more effectively in under an hour. Our medical experts formulate the perfect combination of nutrients and vitamins to help you recover and feel your best.
