As the Founder, Owner and Chief Doctor at Blue Heron Traditional Chinese Medicine, Julia is licensed and registered with the CTCMA in B.C. Julia is also a certified Dao Yin Qi Gong instructor and has over 18 years experience working therapeutically with people, including over 13 years clinical experience in her own private TCM practice. Julia is a highly skilled and deeply accomplished martial artist. She has over 21 years of training in the three Chinese internal martial arts, including lineage teachings from Chen style Taijiquan, 6th Harmony 10 animal Xing Yi Quan and Yin Fu Ba Gua Zhang. She applies her knowledge of the principles, theory, and internal cultivation methods of the martial arts and Qi Gong to her Chinese medicine practice. Julia brings a fresh and inspired approach to the practice and application of TCM by combining her extensive knowledge of the body, mind and spirit with the skilful application of her classical training and background. She is able to treat a wide variety of disease, dysfunction and distress using acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, cupping and moxibustion and Chinese dietary therapy. Here is what Julia has to say about why Chinese medicine works: \" Chinese medicine is so effective because, as a medical system, it is founded on a dynamically balanced yin yang approach. This is a system which uses empirical data and scientific medical knowledge, combined with a deep understanding of the human spirit, emotions and energy for diagnosis and treatment. It provides, what I believe is a comprehensive and therapeutically effective model for treating illness and disease\". Her favorite areas of clinical treatment include; neurodivergence, pain management, autoimmune disease, oncology, gynecology, trauma and emotional disorders. Also, gastro-intestinal distress, fertility, addictions and many other internal diseases. Julia continues to study with accomplished Taoist masters continually deepening her understanding of the practical application of Taoism and the alchemical classics, to her clinical practice.

Frequently Asked Questions: Is Acupuncture Safe? Acupuncture is one of the safest medical treatments both conventional and complimentary on offer in Canada. According to the National Institute of Health consensus statements on acupuncture: In 1997, the National Institute of Health issued a consensus statement on acupuncture, which said, among other things: \"One of the advantages of acupuncture is that the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many drugs or other accepted medical procedures used for the same condition. As an example, musculoskeletal conditions such as, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, tennis elbow or epicondylitis are conditions for which acupuncture may be beneficial\" According to the retrospective studies of acupuncture treatment safety, \"The frequency and types of adverse events in 55,291 acupuncture treatments demonstrated that 99.8% of acupuncture is performed with no significant minor adverse effects...\" How Many Treatments Will I Need? The number of treatments will vary from person to person. Some people experience immediate relief; others may take weeks or months to achieve results. Chronic conditions usually take longer to resolve than acute ones. Treatment frequency depends on a number of factors: your constitution, the severity and duration of the problem and the health and abundance of your qi. An acupuncturist may suggest one or two treatments per week, monthly visits for health maintenance and seasonal \"tune ups\". What Does It Feel Like? The sensation caused by an acupuncture needle varies depending where the acupuncture needle has been inserted, you may experience a vague numbness, heaviness, tingling or a dull ache. Sometimes people experience a little pain as the needles are inserted, or a sensation of energy spreading and moving around the needle. This is called a qi sensation. All these reactions are good and indicate the treatment is working. Most people find the experience to be very relaxing, and experience a sense of deep peace and well being. What Should I Do Before/After A Treatment? Try not to have a large meal within 1 hour of your appointment, as the process of digestion may alter the pattern of your pulse and you may have to lie on your stomach. You should avoid alcohol and food or drink that colours your tongue such as coffee or strong tea. It is a good idea to wear loose clothing so that the acupuncture points, especially those on your lower limbs are easily accessible. After a treatment you are likely to be relaxed and calm. If the treatment has been particularly strong you may feel tired or drowsy and its worth bearing in mind if you plan to drive or use any other machinery soon after. Should I Tell My Doctor I Am Having Acupuncture? If you are currently receiving treatment from your doctor it is sensible to mention that you plan to have acupuncture. Your acupuncturist will need to know about any medications you are taking as this may affect your response to the acupuncture treatment. Always continue with medications prescribed by your doctor and never stop taking those unless told to do so by your doctor. Will My Insurance Cover Acupuncture? Insurance coverage varies from province to province. Contact your insurance provider to learn what kind of care is covered. Here are a few questions to ask: - Will my plan cover acupuncture? - How many visits per calendar year? - Do I need a referral? - Do I have a deductible? If yes, has it been met?
