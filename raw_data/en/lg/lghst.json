Greek, Roman and Chinese cultures have also been known to use crystals for healing and protection. Jade has been considered highly valuable in Chinese culture for thousands of years as a symbol of good luck, success and prosperity. Gemstones have also featured prominently in many religious texts like the Bible and the Koran. The New Age Movement Ushered in a Crystal Resurgence As humanity evolved, crystals, stones and gemstones have continued to play a role in several aspects of our lives.

This Business Is Bringing Crystals to the Forefront One brand that has helped bring crystals to the forefront of the fashion, lifestyle and wellness world is Crystals for Humanity. The company's co-owner Anjanette Sinesio says she's seen the power of crystals firsthand after witnessing the many benefits they've had on her own life and the lives of her clients. \"Clients have shared how crystals have helped them open up to self-love, how they found their soulmate, how they found courage to start a new business, how their skin cleared up, how they felt healthier, the list goes on,\" she says. Since 2016, Crystals for Humanity has been making waves with its line of stylish [Gem-Water](https://gem-water.com/collections/via-water-bottles) bottles, which are infused with crystals such as amethyst, aquamarine and rose quartz, and also double as a more sustainable alternative to plastic water bottles. Crystals for Humanity has also created jewelry, decanters, pet bowls, reusable crystal straws and much more. Transfixed by the World of Healing Crystals Sinesio has been transfixed by the world of crystals since the age of six, when she found herself being drawn to a beautiful amethyst geode while visiting her father in California. She would later go on to lead a successful career in the luxury jewelry industry, until launching her own business in 2006 along with two other partners. When the company launched its first collection at Bergdorf Goodman, Sinesio says she began feeling the pull to learn more about the energy and metaphysical properties behind the jewelry she was creating. \"For the first time I could actually see in action how the energy would affect clients,\" she says. \"There were times when clients would try on a piece of our jewelry and it was so clear this stone was theirs. I wish I could share the look on client's faces with you, how they were so impacted by the stones. It was like a magnet \u2014 the stone had found its rightful owner.\" Crystals 'Filled Our Life With Love and Abundance' After moving on from her first jewelry business, Sinesio launched her first line of Gem-Water bottles in 2016. She later re-branded to Crystals for Humanity to strengthen her focus on the crystals and help others learn about these powerful gems. Along with her husband Dominic Sinesio, she hopes to continue exposing more people to the healing powers of crystals through their creations. \"With all the work I've done with them for over 25 years, I could honestly say that they have transformed my and Dominic's personal lives, and the lives of many other clients,\" she says. \"They've filled our life with love and abundance. I have them with me always.\" How to Get Started With Crystals Interested in incorporating healing crystals into your spiritual wellness routine? There are a few ways to get started: 1.
