Flaxseed is known for being the plant containing the highest concentration of Lignans known as SDG (secoisolariciresinol diglycoside) Flax Hull is also different from eating the entire flax seed because this is concentrated flax shell in powder form. It would be equivalent to a few hundred times in quantity of the entire flax seed to take the same volume of concentrated flax hulls. Natural Lignans are Phytoestrogens (Plant Estrogens) that have been researched heavily over the course of the past 30 years. This original product is rich in lignans known as SDGs, which can help the body fight against diseases such as AIDS/HIV, Breast and Prostate Cancers, Cholesterol, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Hair Loss, Menopause and other types of illnesses. There is no other product available that can deliver a higher potency from a natural source. Many researchers have shown that lignans are beneficial to our health and boost our immune system, giving us the energy we need to fight off sickness and disease as well as the different toxins that our bodies are exposed to on a daily basis. The producer has cultivated this product using Ancient Grain Seeds, which means that this product is Non GMO and 100% all natural. It has a long shelf-life, is a high-quality product, and thanks to an Exclusive One Of A Kind Technology, Mechanical Extraction Process that produces a very concentrated pure lignan harvest, which is why ONE tablespoon of this product is equal in nutritional value to consuming 2 GALLONS or 6 lb. of flaxseed. No One has been able To Obtain Flax Lignans in High Quantity, Until a Farmer in the United States, North Dakota Invented The Mechanical Extraction Process. Research scientists have understood that inside the flax hull is a treasure chest of anti-cancer lignans, no one has been able to unlock those lignans without destroying the nutrient in them until a Christian farmer in North Dakota says that God answered him in response to prayer and showed him how to figured out how to isolate the hulls with the lignans intact, a process which had previously stumped medical scientists. Previously, removing the soft pulp resulted in its destruction, or more correctly, destroying much of its medical usefulness. His proprietary process extracts the Lignans in such a way that it provides approximately 700 times the cancer cell destroying capabilities of just plain flax. The farmer credits learning the secret to this process by attending the World Flax Conference held in Fargo, ND for years. It was this knowledge, research, and prayers that blessed them with the idea of inventing the world's first chemical-free method of mechanically separating the lignan-rich hulls from the rest of the flax in a manner that prevents rancidity and allows for a stable, effective product for consumer use. Our Original Flax Hull Lignans produce a pure lignan content of up to 65%. Each scoop of the product contains 150-300 mg of SDG per serving. That's 70 times the amount of SDG typically contained in the same amount of traditional flaxseed. In addition to their lignan content, flaxseed hulls contain high levels of Omega-3, 6 and 9, as well as off-the-charts antioxidants. Green Kale has one of the highest ORAC values (this is the measurement of a food's antioxidant content) at 1,770 per 100 grams. Original Flax Hull Lignans come in at over 19,600 per 100 grams. The hulls also contain 4.3g of fiber and 2.8g of protein in each tablespoon. And while the nutritional value of Original Flax Hull Lignans is certainly a bonus, the true value of the product is in its promise as a potent immune system booster to help support the prevention and treatment of disease. PHYTO (plant) estrogens in lignans of the flax help balance hormonal levels in both men and women. It is the SDG lignan that balances estrogen levels in the body. This is the reason why scientists have regarded it seriously by testing to see the influence of flax on cancer, an estrogenic condition. In short, estrogen causes cells to proliferate. Excess estrogen is not necessarily a good thing, however. There is actually \"good\" estrogen and \"bad\" estrogen. For example, we are exposed to too much estrogen in the environment through pesticides and chemical exposure, and through our diet (simple carbohydrates tend to increase insulin production, which in turn, increases the wrong kind of estrogen in our body). Flax lignans seem to encourage the good estrogen to be created, and at the same time discourage the bad estrogen from developing. Therefore, flax lignans appear to help create a balance of this hormone. During menopause, when the body may be low in estrogen, flax lignans can help the body think it has more estrogen thus helping relieve some of the uncomfortable side effects, such as hot flashes. Research has shown that people who consume a high intake of lignans in their diet have markedly lower cancer rates. Lignans not only have anti-cancer properties, they also have anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. Flax hulls contain potent nutrients that have the potential to enhance immune system functioning and are effective against many different diseases such as colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, lupus and more.
