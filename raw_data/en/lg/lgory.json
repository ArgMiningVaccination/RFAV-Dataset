What Is Herbal Medicine? Herbal medicine, or alternative medicine, is a product made from plants to treat illnesses or maintain a good quality of life. Alternative medicines are often referred to as nutraceutical supplements, which are plant- or food-based products used for internal consumption. Different Techniques Used in a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Environment Tablet manufacturers use various techniques to develop high-quality, uniform products: Natural Medicine Practices Herbal products come in a wide range of forms and can be consumed using common natural medicine practices like: - Swallowed in tablet, powder, or tincture-form - Brewed as tea - Applied to the skin as a gel, cream, or lotion - Added to bath water Common Herbal Medicine Types Alternative medicine is popular among American consumers today. The following herbal products are some of the most common used to treat illnesses and maintain health: Green Tea Green tea extract is used to improve energy, prevent arteriosclerosis and cancer, lower cholesterol, and help with weight loss. Ginseng Ginseng is a common herbal medicine used to purify the skin, balance the digestive system, decrease stress, and stabilize blood sugar. Ginkgo Biloba The Ginkgo biloba herb is typically used to prevent conditions related to aging, such as poor blood circulation and memory loss. St. John's Wort St. John's Wort is a popular alternative medicine labeled as a mood-enhancer that's used for treating mild to moderate depression. Alternative Medicine vs. Pharmaceuticals While alternative medicine and pharmaceuticals aim to improve the consumer's quality of life, there are significant differences between the two. Regulatory In the pharmaceutical industry, the FDA heavily regulates tablets and capsules. Prescription medications are required to undergo rigorous testing before approval and market launch. Herbal medicines aren't as regulated, so consumers have more freedom to choose these alternatives to improve their health. Cost Pharmaceuticals require a prescription and can cost more if you don't have adequate insurance coverage, while alternative medicines can be purchased over the counter without a prescription. This difference makes herbal supplements more affordable and accessible. Perception It's common for the consumer to view pharmaceuticals as a treatment for an existing condition and herbal medicines as a preventative aid to support and maintain overall health. Herbal Medicine and The FDA The FDA categorizes herbal medicine as food instead of a drug, so alternative medicine isn't heavily regulated or required to meet the same manufacturing, testing, or labeling standards as pharmaceuticals. Since herbal products aren't subjected to clinical trials or other testing and manufacturing requirements like pharmaceuticals, alternative medicine labels can't claim that the product will treat a specific, health-related issue. For example, green tea supplements are thought to be an excellent aid for weight loss. A green tea supplement label might say, \"supports healthy weight management,\" but the label can't claim that the product will make you lose weight.
