To become a practitioner of this popular mind-body therapy, you can begin by practicing yoga yourself and experimenting with various types of yoga, such as the Vinyasa, Kripalu, Bikram and Ashtanga styles. To become an instructor, you'll need to complete a yoga teacher training program that meets the requirements set by Yoga Alliance. Programs are offered at 200-hour and 500-hour training levels (yogaalliance.org). To meet these standards, you might enroll in a certificate program. Throughout your training program in this ancient tradition, you can learn about the anatomy and chakras of the human body, principles of alignment, Shambhala meditation, concentration, Sanskrit beliefs, the history of yoga and the psychological effects of practicing yoga. You'll learn how to teach others to unite their thoughts and bodily movements to reach a state of clear consciousness. If you complete the more rigorous 500-hour program, you can become an official Registered Yoga Teacher through the Yoga Alliance. What Education Do I Need To Be A Creative Art Therapist? This form of mind-body therapy is a profession that requires you to obtain a graduate education. Your bachelor's level work should include art and psychology courses to prepare you to enter a master's-level program in art therapy. When choosing a program, check to make sure it's approved by the American Art Therapy Association. You'll learn to integrate creative endeavors into a psychotherapy agenda to encourage mental well-being in individuals who are recovering from health problems; artistic expression is believed to help people raise self-esteem, resolve conflicts and improve social skills. Program requirements included practical work with patients in clinical settings. You'll be eligible to become a licensed professional clinical counselor upon earning your master's degree. With this designation, you'll be legally qualified to offer direct patient services and work in mental health institutions, nursing homes or corrections centers. After gaining professional experience in the field, you can seek additional credentials, such as the Registered Art Therapist. How Can I Learn Reiki? To learn this system of healing, which focuses on the balance of energies, you can enroll in workshops or short certificate programs, which may be offered by formal education institutions. Throughout your training, you'll learn about the locations of energy in the body, methods of finding and directing universal life force energy, ways that the body heals itself and how to use the power of human touch to help heal the body. The importance of the connection between the mind, body and spirit is emphasized. Your Reiki teacher will give you an attunement, which grants you access to the life energy. Through different courses, you can delve into the use of symbols, chanting and hand gestures in Reiki ceremonies. To become a Reiki instructor, you'll have to complete a series of prerequisite courses covering the basics of this practice and then partake in an initiation Reiki Master Teacher course. What Are Some Related Alternative Careers? If you decide to become a therapist, you could choose to focus your practice on an area other than the mind-body connection. For instance, as a career counselor, you would specialize in assessing client's strengths and weaknesses in order to help them make sound occupational and academic decisions. Like other therapists, career counselors need to complete a master's degree program and pass a licensure exam. Alternatively, instead of becoming a yoga instructor, you could choose to be an instructor in a type of exercise that focuses more heavily on physical fitness, like weightlifting or aerobics. While you only need a high school diploma for this job, it can help your job prospects if you are professionally certified. "}
