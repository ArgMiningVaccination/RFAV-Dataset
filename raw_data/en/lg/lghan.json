I have also enlightened the forum moderators on this so much so that is is now allowed to be talked about! Hope this helps them understand it even more too. I take CBD oil to help with my cancer. Cbd oil is taken by a dropper (bit like eye and nasel drops) but you put 1-2 drops under the tongue, hold there for 3 minutes then swollow, effects start after 20 minutes and last for 6-8 hours, so this can be repeated 2 or 3 times a day depending on condition. It says if no improvement is found the dose can be upped until a suitable level is found. And that these are recommended doseages and can be altered to suit each individual. I personally because have already had surgery only do 1 drop morning and night. If the cancer is still there or I have never had any side effects from the CBD oil. It has spread I would have thought it is best to do 2 drops 3 times a day. It says it has no side effects on the literature I have and that it is not possible to overdose. CBD oil works with your bodys natural system. The endocannabinoid system is a central regulatory system found in all mammels that affects a wide range of biological processes. It consists of a group of molecules known as cannabinoids as well as the cannabinoid receptors that they bind to. Cannabinoid binding sites exist throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant are CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly in the brain and immune system. So basically it helps your body to destroy the cancer cells and stop them growing. People have reported when they have lumps that they have shrunk and dissappeared over time. Some people prefer, like me, to do the chemo and cbd to make sure. I have no lump left to tell if it is shrinking it as have already had surgery to remove my affected breast. After loosing my mum 10 years ago and realising that there are no negative effects from trying CBD oil I thought what the hell might as well give it a go. After finding out it is genetic I will be making sure any relatives have the info on it and I would highly recommend I to them. It certainly hasn't done me any harm and I will probably keep on taking it after the chemo so that no cells have a chance on my other breast while I work out if to have surgery or not on that one. It can also be taken to help with a lot of other conditions such as epilepsy, rheumatism, psoriasis, diabetes, anxiety, acne, depression, neuropathic pain, obesity, autism (assuming you can get an autistic person to take it, it doesn't taste nice), MS, motor neuron disease, antibiotic resistant illnesses and the list goes on. My step sister in Holland took cbd oil for a rash that was all over her body and debilitatingly itchy. The doctors tried everything and couldn't make it go. The CBD oil cleared it up within a few days to a week my Dad said. It is amazing what it can help with. I get mine from (removed due to T and Cs) as after researching it found they have the best systems in place to make sure it has a full profile of the 80 cannabinoids from medical grade cannabis plants and they use no chemicals as it isn't mass produced. That is why it costs a little more but I think under the circumstances that less chemicals is better for our bodies and at least you know you are getting a good product. It is purely organic. I have done a lot of research on it and if anyone has any questions I will do my best to answer them. "}
