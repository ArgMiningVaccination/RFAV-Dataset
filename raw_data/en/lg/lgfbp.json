Could these natural remedies reduce ADHD symptoms? Learn what the research says. The [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends treating ADHD in children and adolescents with FDA-approved medications](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/guidelines.html), plus parent training in behavior modification and behavioral classroom interventions. Likewise, research confirms that \"stimulant medications are most effective, and combined medication and psychosocial treatment is the most beneficial treatment option for most adult patients with ADHD.\" Still, many individuals seek to augment their ADHD treatment plans with natural therapies ranging from nutrition and vitamins and herbs and fish oil. \"Parents and adults see me either because the ADHD medication isn't doing the job, or they want more improvement and can't increase the dosage without increasing side effects,\" says Richard Brown, M.D., associate clinical professor of psychiatry at [Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/education/physicians_surgeons), and co-author of the recent book [How to Use Herbs, Nutrients, and Yoga in Mental Health Care](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393705250/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393705250&linkCode=as2&tag=nhm00-20&linkId=2ff8c2dce784d030ab96c20bdd6cd026). Here are 10 of the most popular natural ADHD remedies \u2014 including foods, ADHD supplements, and herbs \u2014 and research findings for each suggesting whether adding them to your treatment plan might unlock better focus, attention, and motivation. Keep in mind that all ADHD treatment decisions should be made in consultation and coordination with a licensed medical provider. Foods for ADHD Focus Poor nutrition can cause a child or adult with [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/) to become distracted, impulsive, and restless. The right foods, on the other hand, can lessen those symptoms. Protein for ADHD Control Foods rich in protein \u2014 lean beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, nuts, soy, and dairy products \u2014 are used by the body to make neurotransmitters, the chemicals released by brain cells to communicate with each other. Protein can prevent surges in blood sugar, which increase hyperactivity. \"Because the body makes brain-awakening neurotransmitters when you eat protein, start your day with a breakfast that includes it,\" says [Laura Stevens](https://www.additudemag.com/author/laura-stevens-m-s/), M.S., a nutritionist at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) and author [12 Effective Ways to ADD/ADHD Child: Drug-Free Alternatives for Attention-Deficit Disorders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583330399/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1583330399&linkCode=as2&tag=nhm00-20&linkId=d86f25fe91d3ea2fb2ea98ecda14ebab). \"Don't stop there. Look for ways to slip in lean protein during the day, as well.\" [ [Free Download: Brain Food: Healthy Eating Tips to Counter ADHD Symptoms](https://www.additudemag.com/download/brain-food-healthy-eating-adhd/?src=embed_link)] Balanced Meals for ADHD Edward Hallowell, M.D., coauthor of the best-selling [Driven to Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684801280/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684801280&linkCode=as2&tag=nhm00-20&linkId=8df8b9786310484f0990dd2596af19bb), recommends dividing your lunch and dinner plate in the following way: Half of the plate should be filled with fruits and vegetables, one fourth with a protein, and the remaining fourth with a carbohydrate, preferably one rich in fiber \u2014 whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice. This combination of foods will minimize swings in behavior caused by hunger or by a shortfall of a particular nutrient. Fiber prevents blood-sugar levels from spiking and plummeting, which can increase inattention in people with [ADD](https://www.additudemag.com/add-adhd-symptoms-difference/). Dopamine-Boosting ADHD Supplements and Vitamins \"Many people's daily meals are deficient in key vitamins and minerals that may improve attention and alertness,\" says Brown. Supplements meant to boost dopamine levels (fish oil, viatmin D, etc.) can often fill in the nutritional gaps. Multivitamins/Multiminerals for ADHD If your child is a picky eater or eats lots of take-out food, he won't get the daily recommended value of vitamins and minerals. A daily multivitamin/multimineral will ensure that he does, no matter how finicky he is. - To purchase: [Hero's Yummi Bears Multi-Vitamin & Mineral](http://www.heronutritionals.com)are free of artificial colors and flavors, which increase hyperactivity in some children with ADHD. [ [Get This Free Download: What to Eat \u2014 And Avoid \u2014 to Improve ADHD Symptoms](https://www.additudemag.com/download/adhd-foods-to-improve-symptoms/?src=embed_link)] B Vitamins for ADHD Studies [1](#footnote1) suggest that giving children who have low levels of B vitamins a supplement improved IQ scores (by 16 points) and reduced aggression and antisocial behavior. \"Vitamin B-6 seems to increase the brain's levels of dopamine, which improves alertness,\" says Brown. - To purchase: Drugstore chains offer inexpensive high-quality, store-brand B-vitamin formulations. Many of the studies on vitamin B and ADHD used a Swiss formulation called Bio-Strath (available at vitacost.com. It comes in pill and liquid forms.) Zinc, Iron, and Magnesium for ADHD Zinc synthesizes dopamine and augments the effects of methylphenidate [2](#footnote2). Low levels of this mineral correlate with inattention. Iron is also necessary for making dopamine. In one small study [3](#footnote3), ferritin levels (a measure of iron stores) were low in 84 percent of ADHD children compared to 18 percent of the control group. Low iron levels correlate with cognitive deficits and severe ADHD. \"Adequate levels of magnesium have a calming effect on the brain,\" says Brown. While food intake is the safest way to increase mineral levels, a multivitamin/multimineral with iron will ensure that you or your child will get the daily reference value (DRV) of all three. Omega-3s for ADHD One study suggested that a subgroup of boys with ADHD are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids compared with those who have no symptoms of the condition. Another study [4](#footnote4) showed that omega-3s-found in cold-water, fatty fish, such as sardines, tuna, and salmon-tend to break down more readily in the bodies of patients with ADHD than in those without the condition. \"Individuals with ADHD who have low blood levels of omega-3s will show the biggest improvement in mental focus and cognitive function,\" says Brown. Talk to your physician about the [best omega 3 supplement](https://www.additudemag.com/fish-oil-for-adhd-symptoms/) for you or your child. - To purchase: Ned Hallowell recommends supplements from [OmegaBrite](http://www.omegabrite.com)and [Zone Labs](http://www.zoneliving.com). - Brown also recommends [Nordic Naturals](http://www.nordicnaturals.com). If your child has trouble swallowing pills, try the [Barleans Omega Swirl smoothie](http://www.barleans.com).

They act like stimulants without the side effects. Typically, adults and children who take ginkgo and ginseng improve on ADHD rating scales, and are less impulsive and distractible. Asian ginseng may overstimulate younger children. If this happens to your child, switch to American ginseng. Pycnogenol for Attention An extract made from French maritime pine bark, pycnogenol was found to improve hyperactivity and sharpen attention, concentration, and visual-motor coordination in students after one month, based on standardized measures and teacher and parent ratings [5](#footnote5). The herb pycnogenol is also rich in polyphenols, antioxidants that protect brain cells from free radicals. \"The first double-blind study on the herb was published in 2006, confirming its benefits,\" says Brown. \"Larger randomized trials, though, are needed.\" at [Nature's Best](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk). Rhodiola Rosea for ADHD Made from a plant of the same name that grows in the Arctic, this herb can improve alertness, attention, and accuracy. It can be too stimulating for young children, and is occasionally beneficial in children ages eight to 12. It is most useful, says Brown, for students in junior high, high school, and college, who have to complete long papers and spend hours reading. - To purchase: Rhodiola rosea is available from [Ameriden International](http://www.ameriden.com)and Swedish Herbal Institute-ProActive.
