Common causes for [dry eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-health-dry-eyes) include wind, sun, heating/air conditioning, computer use/reading, and certain [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx).This product may contain 1 or more the following ingredients: carboxymethylcellulose, glycol, among others. [Eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) lubricants keep the [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/ss/slideshow-eye-conditions-overview) moist, help to protect the [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/video/eye-anatomy) from injury and infection, and decrease symptoms of dry [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/ss/slideshow-eye-conditions-overview) such as burning, [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus), and feeling as if something is in the eye. How to use Natural Balance Tears 0.1 %-0.3 % Eye Drops Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions). Do not use a solution that has changed color or is cloudy. Certain brands (containing [glycerin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20275/glycerin+topical/details) with polysorbates, among other ingredients) may have a milky appearance. This is okay as long as the solution does not change color. Some [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) drops need to be shaken before use. Check the label to see if you should shake your product before using. Usually, drops may be used as often as needed. Ointments are usually used 1 to 2 times daily as needed. If using an ointment once a day, it may be best to use it at [bedtime](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/childs-bedtime). To apply [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/ss/slideshow-eye-conditions-overview) ointment/drops/gels: Wash hands first. To avoid contamination, be careful not to touch the dropper or top of the ointment tube or let it touch your [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/video/eye-anatomy). Always replace the cap tightly after each use. Tilt your head back, look up, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. For drops/gels, place the dropper directly over the eye and squeeze out 1 or 2 drops as needed. Look down and gently close your eye for 1 or 2 minutes. Place one finger at the corner of the eye near the nose and apply gentle pressure. This will prevent the [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) from draining away from the eye. For an ointment, hold the tube directly over the eye and gently squeeze a small strip (one-fourth of an inch or roughly 6 millimeters) of ointment into the pouch. Release the eyelid, close the eye, and slowly roll your eye in all directions to spread the medication. Blot away any extra ointment from around the eye with a clean tissue. If you are also using another kind of eye medication (such as drops or ointments), wait at least 5 minutes before applying other [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx). Use eye drops before eye ointments to allow the eye drops to enter the eye. If you wear [contact lenses](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/contact-lenses-colored-soft-hard-toric-bifocal), remove them before using most kinds of eye lubricants. Ask your doctor or pharmacist when you may replace your [contact lenses](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-vision-tv/video-how-to-avoid-contact-lens-discomfort). There are a few types of eye lubricants (some that contain polysorbates) that can be used while wearing contact lenses.
