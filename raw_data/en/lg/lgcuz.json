Hepatitis can be caused by many things such as a physical injury, bacterial infections, adverse drug interactions, and viruses. There are currently 5 viruses identified (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E) that specifically attack the liver and cause \"viral hepatitis\" or inflammation of the liver due to a virus. All of the hepatitis viruses cause a new or \"acute\" infection. But only the hepatitis B and C viruses can result in a \"chronic\" infection that increases the risk of a person developing cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer. | | Type of Viral Hepatitis | | Mode of Transmission / Prevention | | Hepatitis A (HAV) | | - Transmitted through contaminated food and water. - Recovery from an acute infection provides lifelong protection against a future exposure to HAV. - There is no chronic infection associated with HAV. - Good personal hygiene and proper sanitation can help prevent hepatitis A. - A safe vaccine is available for babies > 12 months, and children and adults. - The hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for people with hepatitis B. - No drug treatment is needed for an HAV infection. | | Hepatitis B (HBV) | | - Transmitted from an infected person to their newborn during childbirth, through other contact with infected blood (unsterile needles, shared personal items such as razors or toothbrushes), or unprotected sex. - A chronic infection can occur in 90% of infants exposed to HBV, up to 50% of young children, and 10% of adults. - HBV is the primary cause of liver cancer, which is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. - There is a vaccine for newborns, children and adults. - There are drug treatments but no cure for HBV. | | Hepatitis C (HCV) | | - Transmitted through infected blood, unprotected sex, and contaminated or unsterile needles. - A chronic infection can occur in 55-85% of infected adults. - HCV is the leading cause for liver transplants in the U.S. - There is no vaccine. - A cure for HCV was discovered and approved in 2013. | | Hepatitis Delta (HDV) | | - Transmitted through infected blood, unprotected sex, unsterile or contaminated needles and from infected woman to her newborn. - HDV infection is only possible if a person is already infected with hepatitis B or a person can be infected with both viruses at the same time. - A HDV co-infection with hepatitis B results in more serious and rapid liver damage. - The hepatitis B vaccine can prevent HDV. | | Hepatitis E (HEV) | | - Transmitted through contaminated water, food (particularly pork and shellfish), and blood products. - There is no chronic infection associated with HEV. - There is no approved vaccine in the USA, although China has produced and licensed a vaccine. - There is no drug treatment for HEV.
