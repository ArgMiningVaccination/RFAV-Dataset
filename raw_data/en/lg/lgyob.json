Learn more about: concepts These 4 whole medical systems share some concepts: - The body needs to be balanced physically, emotionally and spiritually to be healthy. - Ill health often has more than one cause. - The body has a vital energy reflecting its level of wellbeing. - The body can heal itself. - Health care is usually tailored to the individual. Beliefs behind Chinese medicine According to Chinese medicine, everyone has a vital energy or force in the body known as qi (pronounced \"chee\"). When healthy, qi flows easily through the body's meridians (pathways). If the flow of qi becomes blocked, the body's harmony and balance is affected, causing disease. Qi is made up of 2 opposite and complementary forces known as Yin and Yang. In Chinese medicine, the belief is that Yin and Yang are in everything. Yin is represented by water and Yang by fire. The balance between the 2 maintains harmony in your body, mind and the universe. Chinese medicine also uses the theory of 5 elements - fire, earth, metal, water and wood - to explain how the body works. These elements correspond to particular organs and tissues in the body.
