It starts with YOU. It is fueled by the power of knowing yourself and what will really work for you in your life. http://www.va.gov/patientcenteredcare/ 1 This booklet is a compilation of \"Zeroing In\" handouts covering each self -care ar ea of the Circle of Health , as listed in the table of contents below. While originally written for Veterans, Whole Health and cultural transformation are about each one of us \u2014employees and Veterans alike\u2014having the opportunity to consider what really matters to us and what we want our health for . It is about having the skills and resources to consider how to advance our own self -care . We all need to be empowered and equipped towards Whole Health . In doing this for ourselves, we also can be more effectiv e in supporting those we serve. Should you want information beyond that which you find in the \"Zeroing In\" handouts , at the back of this booklet is a list of additional handouts th at cover a number of self -care subtopics. For example, with respect to Food and Drink, there are handouts on topics such as gut health, probiotics and the Mediterranean Diet, to name a few, or for Spirit and Soul on hope and optimism, forgiveness and gratitude. There are also links to these additional handouts in each \"Zeroing -In\" document . Wishing you well on your Whole Health journey!

All areas are important and connected The body and mind have strong healing abilities. Improving one area can help other areas. The inner ring represents your mission, aspirations, or purpose. Your care focuses on you as a unique p erson. Mindful awareness is being tuned in and present. Your self -care and everyday choices make up the green circle. The next ring is professional care (tests, medications, supplements, surgeries, examinations, treatments, and counseling). This section includes complementary approaches like acupuncture and yoga. The outer ring includes the people and groups who make up your community Rate where you feel you are on the scales below from 1 -5, with 1 being miserable and 5 being great. Physical Well- Being 1 Miserable 2 3 4 5 Great Mental/Emotional Well- Being 1 Miserable 2 3 4 5 Great Life: How is it to live your day -to-day life 1 Miserable 2 3 4 5 Great What is your mission, aspiration, or purpose? What do you live for? What matters most to you? Write a few words to capture your thoughts: _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ 3 Where You Are and Where You Would Like to Be For each area below, consider \"Where you are\" and \"Where you want to be.\" Write in a number between 1 (low) and 5 (high) that best represents where you are and where you want to be. You do not need to be a \"5\" in any of the areas now, nor even wish to be a \"5\" in the future. Area of Self Care Where I am Now (1-5) Where I Want to Be (1-5) Work ing the Body: Our physical, mental, and emotional health are impacted by the amount and kind of movement we do. Moving the body can take many forms such as dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, and exercise. Recharge: Our bodies and minds must rest and recharge in order to optimize our health. Getting a good night's rest as well as recharging our mental and physical energy throughout the day are vital to well- being. Taking short breaks or doing something you enjoy or feels good for moments throughout the day are examples of ways to refresh. Food and Drink: What we eat and drink can have a huge effect on how we experience life, both physically and mentally. Energy, mood, weight, how long we live, and overall health are all impacted by what and how we choose to eat and drink. Personal Development: Our health is impacted by how we choose to spend our time. Aligning our work and personal activit ies with what really matters to us, or what brings us joy, can have a big effect on our health and outlook on life. Family, Friends, and Co -Workers: Our relationships, including those with pets, have as significant an effect on our physical and emotiona l health as any other factor associated with well-being. Spending more time in relationships that 'fuel' us and less in relationships that 'drain' us is one potential option. Improving our relationship skills or creating new relationships through community activities are other options to consider. Spirit and Soul: Connecting with something greater than ourselves may provide a sense of meaning and purpose, peace, or comfort. Connecting and aligning spiritually is very individual and may take the form of religious affiliation, connection to nature, or engaging in things like music or art. Surroundings: Our surroundings, both at work and where we live, indoors and out, can affect our health and outlook on life. Changes within our control such as organizing, decluttering, adding a plant or artwork can improve mood and health. Power of the Mind: Our thoughts are powerful and can affect our physical, mental, and emotional health. Changing our mindset can aid in healing and coping. Breathing techni ques, guided imagery, Tai Chi, yoga, or gratitude can buffer the impact of stress and other emotions Professional Care: \"Prevention and Clinical Care\" Staying up to date on prevention and understanding your health concerns, care options, treatment plan, and their role in your health Reflections Now that you have thought about what matters to you in all of these areas, what is your vision of your best possible self? What would your life look like? What kind of activities would you be doing? _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ Are there any areas you would like to work on? Where might you start? _________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ After completing the Personal Health Inventory, talk to a friend, a family member, your health coach, a peer, or someone on your healthcare team about areas you would like to explore further. 4 Zeroing In - Working Your Body: Energy & Flexibility Being active can help prevent all sorts of health problems, boost your mood, extend your life, and help you to do things that matter most to you. Here are some things to explore if you want Working Your Body to be a part of your Personal Health Plan. Key Points Keep safety in mind Do activities you enjoy! Work your body in all kinds of ways. Do you want more strength? Stamina? Flexibility? Balance? Tailor your actions to your goals It might be easier to keep with it if you choose to do activities with other people. Ask your clinical team for information and guidance. The VA has many experts who can help. Create a Personal Activity Plan. It can help to think about four areas (FITT): Frequency: How often do you want to exercise? A few times a week? Most days? Intensity: How hard will you work (based on your fitness level so far)? Type: What activity or activities do you want to do more? Time: How long will you do this each time? Use your answers to these questions to create a Working Your Body plan to follow. Activity Plan 5 Mindful Mov ement. Move your body with attention and intention: There are many types of mindful movement, such as yoga, tai chi, martial arts, walking, and even (done with attention) brushing your teeth, to name a few. Yoga includes many ways to h elp your mind and body work together. Most classes involve different poses. It is now covered by the VA. Tai chi comes from Chinese medicine and involves gentle movements. It is safe and can be good for balance and other health issues. VA will cover tai chi for some things now too. Track your progress. There are many smartphone apps and other resources that can help you follow your progress. The following are free phone apps (but may offer 'in- app purchases' for people to buy more content): SWorkit Gym Tracker Strong Workout Tracker MyFitnessPal Cyclemeter Jefit Strava Daily Yoga Take a class. Find out about classes you can take in your area. Consider yoga, tai chi, cycling, dance, kickboxing, zumba, or some other group exercise class. See if there are telehealth classes (classes where the teacher is online, teaching from a distance) that you can take. Work with an Expert. They can be great for safety and for motivation. Occupati onal Therapists (OTs). Among many things, OTs can help you with daily activities like cooking, cleaning, work activities, and working with your hands. Physical Therapists (PTs). PTs provide treatments, exercises and activities to help with physical probl ems like an injured muscle or joint. Recreational Therapists (RTs). RTs coordinate different activities that can both be fun and get you moving. Fitness Class Instructors. Instructors teach classes that might include dance, or boxing, or zumba, or martial arts, or many other options. See what is offered in your area. Personal Trainers. Trainers can help you set up a workout plan and make sure you do it safely and correctly. Many private gyms have them available. Note that for OT and PT, you likely need a referral from your provider. Mindful Movement Professionals Take a Class Track Progress 6 Make One Small Change. There are all sorts of opportunities. Think about what would work best for you and decide when you will start. Every little bit of activity helps. Here are a few more examples: Park father away and walk. Find a walking buddy. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Learn some basic stretches to do each day. Take dancing lessons. Sign up for a water exercise class, which might be easier on sore joints. See if Veterans get a discount at YMCA or YWCA classes. Check out some exercise videos from the library (remember not to overdo it!). Use your smartphone or smartwatch or some other device to help you track your activity. Keep dumbbells by the couch and use them as you watch TV. Stand up and move during each commercial break. Set a timer so you get up and move at least every 30 minutes. Play with the kids in your life. Do leg lifts or other exercises while sitting. Buy a machine you can pedal while you are seated. Take a martial arts class. Working Your Body Links You can check out the links below to get more information about Working Your Body: Whole Health Library Veteran Handouts .

They affect how your genes work, and your genes control how healthy you are and how long you live. Where are your favorite places to be, and why? Key Points Everyone reacts differently to the environment. How can you create a place where you can find peace and healing? Ask for additional support with your Surroundings if you need it. It might help to work on Surroundings with the people you live with, loved ones, your neighbors, or other members of your community. Always keep emotional surroundings and safety in mind to o. Improve Where You Live. No matter where you live (house, apartment, motor home, etc.), improving your home environment can improve your health. If you are homeless, the VA has resources to help. Be sure ask your health care team for support. Many VA's have experts who work with homeless Veterans. Think about your senses. Can you see well? Are noises too loud or too quiet? Are there bad smells? Is the temperature okay? A healthy living space should be dry, clean, free of pests and toxins, safe, and maintained. Air flow should be good. Improve Where You Live 10 Improving where you live includes cleaning up your neighborhood. Is there trash you can get rid of? A common space you can help fix up? Get More Organized . Keeping things need can help improve your mental state, improve cleanliness and hygiene, and improve safety. Are you able to clean your living space, or do you need help? Do you hold onto things that clutter your living area? Clutter can increase fall s and be a home for pests like roaches. The VA sometimes has volunteers who can help your organize. Improve Where You Work. Where you work may or may not be the same place as where you live. Some things at work may be out of your control, but even small changes can help. If you need extra training to get the job you want, some VAs have vocational training to teach you the skills. Ask your health care team about the resources at your VA. Does your work space cause you health problems? Is your body in a comfortable position? Are you at risk of injuries from doing the same movements all the time? Co-workers can affect your stress and health. Do what you can to get along with coworkers. Do you work so much that it leads to problems wi th other parts of your life? There are ways to help if someone is a workaholic. Improve Emotional Surroundings . How your surroundings make you feel is important for your mental health. Violence and abuse happens to about a third of people, fr om all races and genders. Do you live in fear? What resources do you need to feel safe? The news can have a negative effect on our emotions. Consider trying a media fast. PTSD, depression, anxiety, and other emotional problems are as important to handle as other health issues. What do you need to feel healthy and at ease? Create Healing Environments. Many things in your surroundings can support good health. To stay healthy or recover from illness, what kind of place is most helpful? Colors affect how you feel. Soft blues and greens can be calming. Yellows and reds might rev you up more. Sounds also matter. White noise can be very calming and help people sleep. Smells also affect us. Fresh air is a healthy, smoke and other air pollution are not. Focus on touch. How do your chairs feel to sit in? How is the temperature? Add little touches to make a place fee like home, like a plant, a family photo, or artwork. Organize Improve Work Emotions Healing Enviro n- ments 11 Reduce Toxins. Your body is constantly protecting you from toxins (poisons) in the environment. Keep your exposures to them as low as you can. Keep your areas free of smoke. Do not use products with a lot of chemicals in your home . Clean regularly to keep dust and pests out of your area. Drink plenty of water. This is a simple way to flush toxins out of your body. Spend Time in Nature . Studies show that time in nature helps us live longer, with fewer strokes and heart attacks. Green spaces can help our memory and speed up recovery after surgery. It helps to look at pictures or listen to recordings of nature if you can't get outside. Having plants in your home or workplace is another way to have nature near you Make One Small Change . Here are a few more suggestions you could put in your Personal Health Plan: Don't smoke Organize even just a small space in your home. Sweep a room. Clean out a closet. Add a personal touch to an area you sp end a lot of time in. Hang a picture or add other art. Don't use social media for 1 day. Spend 15 minutes in a park, or go on a hike. Listen to waves for 5 minutes on your computer/phone. Pick up five pieces of trash that you come across. Drink a glass of water. Eat a handful of vegetables Spray lavender oil next to your sleeping area Surroundings Links Whole Health Library Veteran Handouts .

Ways to live more fully may include being more optimistic, grateful, social, and resilient. You can learn new skills, find more balance, and figure out new ways to help others. Doing thi ngs like that improves your health, and helps you live longer. Key Points Keep asking yourself what you need to learn and grow in your life. Get support from someone you trust. Personal Development may require that take a deep look at your thinking patterns and personality. That can be hard. It helps to have support. Be patient with yourself. Choose a Personal Development goal that fits you. There are many options. No one way is better than the others. Build Hope and Optimism. Being a hopeful and optimistic person allows you to be less sensitive to pain, take care of yourself better, and live longer. You do not have to be \"fake.\" Just practice thinking about what can go right. Watch your thought patterns by practicing mindf ul awareness It can be hard to catch your own negative thoughts. Think about working with a mental health professional. Hope and Optimism 15 Setting and achieving goals can help you build feel more hopeful and positive. Find Balance. Consider how different parts of your life balance out in terms of time, how involved you are, and how happy or satisfied they make you. What do you do each day? Writing it out can show you how you spend your time. How much satisfaction does each activity you do give you? Some activities are necessary, but others aren't. What can you cut out without feeling like it is a big loss? Do you have too little time, or too much? Make sure you have time and energy to do what you need to do, and what you want to do. Create and Learn. Creating and learning keeps your mind and body healthy. It can help you earn more money too. There are many ways to be creative. Think about your hobbies and talents. Classes can be for fun or to learn important skills. Look into courses off ered by local colleges, rec centers, or park districts. Learning does not need to be in a traditional class setting. Consider watching a documentary, listening to a podcast, or reading an article. Give. Giving to others can be a powerful way to improve your own health too. Charity can be for strangers, or it can be to family, friends, and people you know. Giving does not have to be money. It can be a helping hand, time, or support. The VA has many volunteering and mentoring programs. Consider h elping other Veterans. You can even train to help out with Whole Health! Be Grateful (Count Your Blessings). Gratitude is a practice that asks you to focus on the good things already in your life, not having to do something new. The first step is being aware of people, actions, and events that happen in your life. Mindful awareness can help you notice those things. This can be hard, but remember that \"practice makes perfect.\" Gratitude is good for your health. Increase Humor. Laughing burns calories, decreases anxiety, and increases pain tolerance. Laughing lowers your stress hormones and increases your feel -good hormones. Consider laughter yoga. Think about things that you find funny and how you can include them in your life. Be More Resilient. The ability to bounce back helps to prevent health problems, especially mental health issues. There are many ways to be resilient. You might work on your attitudes and perspectives. A health psychologis t or other mental health professional can help you see patterns you follow that do not help you. Balance Create and Learn Give Be Grateful Increase Humor Be More Resilient 16 Having more positive emotions is another way of being resilient. The above topics like hope and humor can help with this. People and support systems can be im portant in bouncing back. Work with mentors. Look to role models. Make One Small Change. Here are a few examples of options: Make a schedule for yourself. Create a \"bucket list\" or plan your dream vacation. Listen to a podcast. Develop your hobbies and talents, including art, music, writing. Go to a comedy show, or watch a funny movie. Volunteer your time. Donate clothes, toys, and/or food. Consider a gratitude journal to write down what you are grateful for. Write a letter to s omeone you are grateful for. Do a random act of kindness. Some examples are putting change in someone's parking meter, paying for the coffee of the person behind you, or giving a random person a compliment. Identify a role model and what it is about them you admire. Write down your strengths. Try to be flexible in the way you think. Practice self compassion; be kind to yourself Personal Development Links You can follow the links below to learn more about Personal Development. Whole Health Library Veteran Handouts .

Good nutrition can help you feel better in all sorts of ways, and it can help prevent future problems as well. Here are things to explore if you want Food & Drink to be part of your Whole Health Plan. Key Points Figure out the way to eat that works best for you as an individual. Buying and preparing food are skills. What more can you learn? Eat a colorful diet with a lot of natural foods, especially vegetables and fruits. Really pay attention when you eat. Notice if you are hungry or not. You can adjust what you eat to help you with your health problems. Get support from dietitians. Create Your Own Food & Drink Plan. You are most likely to follow through with a plan for healthy eating if you take it slow and make one change at a time. Don't get caught up in \"good\" and \"bad\" labels. It's not just about how many calories - different sources of calories affect the body differently. Consider your budget and what you have access to. Is there a something it would be good to add more of to your diet? To remove? Food & Drink Plan 20 Can you change just one habit related to Food & Drink that you don't want to follow? Learn More About Preparing Meals. Many VA's offer classes where you can learn about buying food and preparing it. Consider taking a class. Buy whole foods, if you can. These are foods, like an apple, or a piece of fish, that really only have one ingredient in them. Learning to cook means you can rely less on fast food or eating out and know what is in the food you eat. Eat Mindfully. The more you pay attention to what you are eating, the more you will feel filled and satisfied. Some ways to eat more mindfully include: Really appreciate each bite. Take some time to use all your senses. How does the food look? What do you smell. What is the texture? Take a moment to think about all that has happened to get the food to you. Who grew it? Who gathered, butchered, or processed it? Wh o delivered it to the place where you bought it? Try not to do other things while you eat. Enjoy the company of others, but don't watch TV, or work, or read. Pay attention to when your body tells you it is feeling full. Tailor Your Eating to Your Health N eeds . Everybody has a diet they think you should be on. You have to ask what works best for you. Make sure you don't harm your body as you try different ways to eat. Different foods can help -or worsen - health issues. If you change your eating patterns, it can really help. Some examples: Type 2 diabetes is tied to eating patterns. Certain fats increase risk of heart disease and stroke. Some foods increase inflammation in the body, which is linked to problems like pain, depression, and memory loss. Some spices, like turmeric, can reduce inflammation. Alcohol can harm the liver. Certain foods can trigger migraines of gut symptoms. Foods can interfere with blood thinners. Some foods increase risk of kidney stones, reflux, or gallstones . Some foods can cause allergic reactions, including skin problems. Work w ith a Dietitian . The VA has dietitians who can guide you with making healthy nutrition changes that are supported by good research. Talk to your primary care team about whether a dietitian would be helpful. Some primary care teams have a dietitian as part of the team. Dietitians can guide you with tailoring your diet to your various health issues. A dietitian can help you with creating Food & Drink goals for your Personal Health Plan. Preparing Meals Eat Mindfully Eat to Your Needs Dietitians 21 Make One Small Change . There are all sorts of opportunities. Think about what would work best for you and decide when you will make the change. Choose things you feel sure you can do. Every little bit of activity helps. Her e are a few more examples: Add in an extra vegetable each day. Cut back on a favorite dessert like ice cream to only a few times a week instead of every day. Try a food you have never tried before. Only eat when you are hungry. Chew you r food a certain number of times with each bite. Go to a farmers' market. Some VA's have them on site. Change from soft drinks to water for some of your daily fluids. Think of your best meal ever. Ask what made it so great, and then try to bring some of those things into other meals. Cook a meal for someone. Try eating breakfast, if you usually skip it. Take time to eat lunch without working. Pay attention to pesticide levels in foods. Eat the \"Clean 15\" if you can. (See the links list.) If you eat out, choose a place with healthy options. Make sure you are getting enough of your daily vitamins and minerals and other nutrients. If you have an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating) ask for help. Do what you can to make sure eating is fun, not frustrating.

But \"not doing\" is also important to health. Relaxing, slowing down, finding ease, and taking pauses are important to our health as well. Here are some things to explore if you want Recharge to be a part of your Whole Health Plan. Key Points Resting allow s your body and mind to heal. It gives you time to pause and be mindfully aware. You can't work toward what really matters if you have never paused to think about what your values are! Good sleep is vital to our survival and our health. So are breaks at work and vacations. Ask your clinical team for information and guidance. Sleep Better. Good sleep helps you maintain a healthy weight, lay down memories, and flush your brain of toxins. Good sleep is linked to better mood, less heart disease and stroke, and less diabetes. It is also linked to living longer. If you have sleep problems, work with your primary team to rule out (and treat) sleep apnea, thyroid problems, restless legs, prostate or bladder problems, and other medical issues that can cause poor sleep. Sleep Better 26 There are many ways to improve sleep. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT -I) is one. It involves noticing your sleep patterns and practicing good sleep hygiene, which means avoiding anything that makes you less l ikely t o sleep. Some examples: o Too much light from a screen before bed, or from background lights can be a problem. Try a sleep mask. o Decrease noises with ear plugs or drown them out with white noise, like the sound from a fan. o Don't take too many naps during the day. o Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, if possible. o Don't drink alcohol before bed. o Don't drink too many other fluids either, and avoid caffeine. Take Breaks. Breaks are also important. If you are really busy, pause sometimes. If you are sitting a lot, take time move every 30 -60 minutes. Be sure to take vacations sometimes if you can, too. Try not to take work with you. Pause for longer breaks at work (15 minutes every few hours) and don't work through lunch. It might h elp to unplug from the news sometimes (do a \"media fast\"). Boost Your Energy. What lowers your energy? If you can, avoid those things. What increases it? If possible, do those things more. There are many ways to give your energy a boo st. Medications? Not the best way. o Be active - dance, garden, hike, go for a walk, lift weights, etc. o Laugh o Spend time with fun and inspiring people you care about o Find a good cause you believe in and support it Take Time Just for You. Even if you can just plan for a few minutes each day for yourself, that is important. It is like the oxygen mask on a plane. You need to meet your needs, or you won't be in any shape to help other people. If you are spending a lot of time taking care of someone else, taking time for you helps your health. Work with an Expert . Who would be helpful to have on your care team? Psychologists can help you figure out how to sleep better. Some of them are trained in CBT -I. There are sleep psychologists whose whole practice focuses on sleep. Sleep Consultants can offer help when it comes to screening or and treating sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. Different mind -body approaches, like meditation, might help you. See if classes are available at your VA. Acupuncture might help with sleep. Experts Take Breaks Boost Energy Time for You 27 Ask your provider about melatonin. It is on the VA formulary. It is a supplement that helps sleep without causing a lot of side effects. Make One Small Change. There are all sorts of possibilities. Start smal l with a goal you know you can reach, and build from there. Here are a few more examples of things that you could put into your Personal Health Plan: Change one sleep hygiene behavior, such as the time you go to bed. Set an alarm to rem ind you to take breaks. See how being active during different times of the day helps or harms your sleep. Work with problems like PTSD or anxiety so you can relax more. If you are taking care of someone who is ill, look into a respite care program where someone can help out so you can have a break. Plan a day off. Get a massage every so often. Use the CBT -I app. Cut down on caffeine. Take a three- day media fast. Learn how to take a power nap if your energy is dropping. Add one thing to your day that boosts your energy. Take one day where you don't do any work at all. Plan a dream vacation. \"Staycations\" can also be helpful.

Family and friends, the groups we are part of, fellow Veterans, our health care team members - when it comes to Whole Health, many people can support us. Key Points In addition to asking yourself what really matters, ask yourself who really matters. Explore how you can enhance connections with family, friends, fellow Veterans, and others in your community. Improving communication can help. Loving -kindness practices can help you feel more connected. Ask experts, like social workers, for help. Connect with Love Ones. Loved ones can include life partners, spouses, family members, friends, pets, and others. Having them in your life helps you live longer and deal with health issues better. Social capital is the amount of support you can get from others if you need it. It can help to think about who you turn to for different kinds of support. Who gives you affection or kindness? Who mentors, or advises you? Who offers you financial support? Who do you support? Loved Ones 31 As you think about relationships, try to notice what you feel, but don't let the feelings make you shut down. If possible, think about relationships you want to renew or heal. Connect with Other Veterans and Community. In t he Circle of Health, Community surrounds (and protects) everything else. No one supports Veterans better than their fellow Veterans. What support do you need? How can you support others? Volunteer work might be one option. Join a group or organization, like Veterans of Foreign Wars or Disabled American Veterans. If it feels appropriate to you, consider joining a spiritual community. Sign up for classes, or see if your V A site offers shared medical appointments, where Veterans can learn about a health topic together. Social media (Facebook, Twitter) and email are other ways to connect. Improve Communication. Communication styles inside and outside of th e military can be very different. There are different techniques you can learn, like how to listen better, how to read body language, and how to use \"I statements.\" Taking classes on communication skills is another option. Practice Compassion. Loving -kindness meditation is one way to focus on connecting. Compassion involves empathy - understanding what it is like to be in someone else's shoes, combined with taking action to do something to support them. Increasing compassion starts with self -compassion. Sometimes it is easier to feel compassion for others than ourselves. Work with an Expert . Social workers, vocational rehabilitation people, chaplains, and psychologists are some of the professionals who can help Veterans connect. As you think about relationships with others, it can help to ask what sort of formal social support you need, too. Some Veterans need help with housing, or getting coverage for medical bills, or applying for a support program. Social workers are skilled professionals who know the resources in your local community and what is offered at the VA. They can help you speak up for yourself, and some perform family/couples counseling. Working on relationships can bring up a lot of emotions. If you find you are struggling with your feelings or thoughts, ask for help. Make One Small Change . There are many options for connecting. Pick one and set a goal. It helps to start with something you know you can do - set yourself up for success! Working. He re are some more examples, in addition to what has already been covered: Go to a community event, like a ball game, a play or musical, a festival, or a fair. Take a class at a local college. Join an online interest group. Call someone y ou have not spoken to in a while, who you miss talking to. One Small Change Veterans & Community Communications Compassion Experts 32 Set up an account on Facebook or another site like it. If you are in an abusive relationship, seek help. Talk to a neighbor you have never met. Get a pet, work with a therapy animal, or volunteer at a local shelter. Strike up a conversation with someone in the VA cantina. Connect with former battle buddies. Look online at tips for how to communicate better. There are guides for doing that in relationships with loved ones and also at work.

You may belong to an organized religion, find your spirituality in service to other or through being nature, or base it on your past experiences. You may be unsure of what your spirituality is. Regardless, take time to focus on what brings meaning and purpose to your life. Doing so s upports good health. Key Points Be respectful of others' beliefs as you consider these issues. There is NO expectation that you believe a certain way. Always circle back to what really matters to you and let that inform your goals. People with a sense of purpose live longer. It is hard to do, but working with grief and moral injury, and going through recovery for addictions is very helpful. Forgiveness is also challenging, but rewarding. Ask chaplains, clergy, and other experts for help if you need it. Explore Values, Meaning, and Purpose. Whether you are spiritual and/or religious or not, keep an eye to what matters to you, as you create your Personal Health Plan. What do you value most of all? Why do you care about your health in the first place? People find their spirituality in different places, and each of us is unique. What brings you a sense of something bigger than yourself? What is meaningful in your life? Values Meaning Purpose 36 It is okay to feel like you don't have all the answers. Mystery is a part of spirituality for many people. Some people find their spirituality in religion, or in serving others, or in doing something they love. Consider if Spiritual Practices are for you. Spiritual practices are things you can do to stay co nnected with what really matters. They bring you a sense of peace and ease, and perhaps a sense of being part of something bigger than yourself. Some examples of practices include: Prayer Carrying something, a spiritual anchor, that reminds you to focus on the important things in your life. Taking part in ceremonies or holidays. Bringing meaning in through music and art. Pilgrimage; traveling to sacred places. Practicing compassion and generosity. Giving to others. Some types of meditation. Forgiveness Work with Grief, Moral Injury, and Recovery. All can lead to deep healing, but be gentle with yourself when you are dealing with these very emotional areas. Ask for help and support as needed. Grie f is normal, unless it begins to get in the way of fully living your life. In the military, bad things happen, but people do not always get a chance to fully grieve. Moral injury happens when someone did something, saw something, or could not prevent something that happened that was against their deepest beliefs. Moral injury happens a lot in war. Recovery -healing from addictions - often requires some very deep work. Twelve step programs are helpful. Explore Forgiveness. Forgiveness is NE VER about saying something that someone did to hurt you was okay. It IS about setting yourself free. Forgiveness is a process. There are books about how to do it, but it is best if you have support from a health care team member, like a psychologist or a chaplain. It starts with being able to forgive yourself. Work with and Expert. Because these areas can be hard to look at, it is good to ask for help and support. There are always chaplains available to help at the VA, and the VA has one of the best chaplaincies of any organization in the world. Chaplains can work with people form a variety of faiths and backgrounds, and if not, they can point you in the direction of someone who can help you just the same. If you belong to a religious group , ask clergy or others for help. Spiritual Practices Grief, Moral Injury, Recovery Forgiveness Experts 37 These professionals can help with topics like death and dying, the meaning behind illness, and feelings of spiritual anxiety, anger, guilt, loss, and despair. Make One Small Change. There are all sorts of possibilities. Start small with a goal you know you can reach, and build from there. Here are a few more examples of things that you could put into your Personal Health Plan: Join a spiritual community. Carry an anchor with you, like a photo of someone dear to you, a stone, a coin, a medal, a piece of jewelry - whatever reminds you of what matters most. Read something that inspires you, like scripture, poetry, or stories about those who have been able to rise above challenges. Do a random act of kindness each day. Tip well at a caf\u00e9. Help a person by the side of the road. Give someone flowers. Smile. Offer gratitude. One time to do this is as you are sitting down about to eat. Honor someone you have lost. Take time to admire something beau tiful. Do something generous. Cheer someone up. Make them laugh. Pray, meditate, or pause to tune in to the rest of the world.

There are tools you can use to make even better use of your min d's power. Key Points Your thoughts, feelings and beliefs affect your health in many ways. There are many different mind -body tools you can learn to manage stress and difficult emotions. Try different ones to see what is right for you. The VA covers meditation classes. It also covers, biofeedback, imagery, and clinical hypnosis for some problems. What you expect helps to shape what happens when you get a treatment or therapy. If your mental state is making it hard to live your life or be in control, g et help Relax! Work w ith Stress. Stress helps us survive, but \"fight or flight\" isn't a good place to be all the time. One thing all the different mind -body tools have in common is that they help you get the \"Relaxation Response.\" It is the opposite of being in fight or flight. Doing breathing exercises, like \"In for a count of 3, out for a count of 6\" is a quick way to help yourself relax. Stress 40 Ask yourself about the things that help you to relax in your life. What helps you feel calm? And who in your life helps you feel relaxed and calm? Try a Mind -Body Approach. There are many mind -body approaches to choose from, and studies have found that they can be quite helpful. Biofeedback uses equipment to track how your body responds to our mind's control. You can teach yourself to loosen tight muscles, change your heart rhythm, and other skills. Meditation includes many practices, and some are for reducing stress and buildi ng more awareness. Examples include sitting and watching your thoughts, doing body scans, sending compassion, and breathing. Guided imagery involves working with images to get more information about your health. The images that come up can give you ideas about how to improve your health. Clinical hypnosis is different from \"stage hypnosis.\" You always have control as you move into a state of trance. In that state, you can respond better to suggestions to do things that are good for your health. Improve Emotional Health. Don't forget about the \"Power of Your Heart.\" People who are happier live longer, with fewer health problems. Angry people have more health problems. Relaxing can calm emotions as well as thoughts. Mind -body skills ca n help you work with difficult emotions too, like sadness and depression, anxiety, and anger. It isn't about turning off feelings, it is about understanding triggers, being aware of how you act when you feel something, and then working with emotions in new , helpful ways. Work with Habits . Things we routinely do can be either healthy or unhealthy. A person can learn the habit of being optimistic (having a positive outlook), or be in the habit of drinking, using drugs, eating poorly, or gambling too much. If you are finding that a habit is making it harder for you to live your life, find help. Studies show that twelve- step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous can help. Work with an Expert. The VA has excellent mental health providers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers who can do counseling, substance use experts, and people who work specifically with suicide prevention, PTSD, sexual trauma, and other problems. Psychiatrists are medical doctors, and they know about medications, especially. Psychologists are more likely to work with psychotherapies. There are many different types of psychotherapy. One of the best- known is cognitive behavioral therapy. You take time learning how to notice your patterns and come up w ith ways to shift them or work with them. Your primary care team can help you find the right professional.
