Top 10 Ayurvedic Herbs for Muscle Growth 1. Ashwagandha for Muscle Growth Whether or not you're familiar with natural muscle growth supplements, there's a good chance that you've heard of ashwagandha before. The most popular of all Ayurvedic herbs, ashwagandha is often used in men's health supplements and in natural substitutes for synthetic supplements. [Ashwagandha ](/blogs/all/ashwagandha)is an Ayurvedic herb that is considered to be one of the most potent rasayana (rejuvenator) herbs in Ayurved. It is known for promoting health and longevity while revitalizing the body. Extensively researched for its therapeutic potential, the herb has been shown to promote improvements in performance, strength, and cardiorespiratory function. Studies show that the herb also works as an adaptogen, reducing cortisol levels, while it also boosts testosterone which promotes muscle growth. 2. Shatavari for Muscle Growth Shatavari is another Ayurvedic herb for muscle growth that is also categorized as a rasayana or rejuvenative. Commonly used in reproductive health formulas, Shatavari is also valuable as a natural muscle growth supplement because of its positive influence on energy levels and strength. Steroidal sapoins in the herb are also known to raise testosterone levels, while high levels of the amino acid asparagine can help with protein synthesis. [Dr. Vaidya's Herbobuild contains purified Shatavari extract and is only Rs. 499/-](/products/herbobuild-ayurvedic-muscle-gain-capsule) 3. Eleuthero for Muscle Growth Like ashwagandha, eleuthero is also a type of ginseng, but it comes from Siberia. Similar to its Ayurvedic cousin. This herb is an adaptogen that lowers stress levels and improves exercise or sports performance. This is because of a demonstrated effect of increasing VO2 max levels and endurance in studies. Eleuthero may also help improve performance through reduced recovery time as it helps in the breakdown of lactic acid, which accumulates during workouts to cause muscle soreness. 4. Guarana An exotic herb that is native to the Amazon, guarana is notable for its high content of caffeine, which is used to fight fatigue and increase alertness. What sets the herb apart from coffee is that caffeine from guarana is released slowly. This means that it works as a steady and sustainable stimulant, which is why it is now used in some nutraceutical products for athletes. It is claimed that the herb can increase fat burning and raise energy levels for improved athletic performance. 5. Bitter orange for Muscle Growth One of the biggest concerns for athletes and bodybuilders is fat burn without muscle loss. While anabolic steroids can ensure such results, they pose a serious risk of liver damage. Bitter orange extracts can help get you shredded without that risk thanks to the presence of natural plant alkaloids that are proven to reduce fat buildup without muscle loss. These results are attributed to its effect of naturally raising the metabolic rate, which increases calorie burn. 6. Safed musli for Muscle Growth Like many of the other herbs for muscle growth, Safed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) has long been used in Ayurved to treat a range of male sexual disorders, especially if related to low testosterone levels like erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. As a natural bodybuilding herb, safed musli however does more than raise testosterone levels. Some clinical investigations have shown the herb to help raise human growth hormone (HGH) levels. Considering the role of HGH in muscle mass increases, this is one ingredient that you'll want in any Ayurvedic medication for muscle growth. [Herbobuild contains Safad Musli and costs Rs. Growth Salab Punja (Dactylorhiza hatagirea) makes it to our list only because of its efficacy and importance in traditional Ayurved, but you won't find it in any supplements that are sold legally. This is because the herb is seriously endangered due to habitat loss and there are strict laws to protect it. Although primarily used in the treatment of digestive disorders and sexual dysfunction, some research has also shown it to be as effective as conventional treatments to raise testosterone, promoting muscle mass increase and higher energy levels. 8. Echinacea Echinacea is familiar to most naturopaths, as it is widely used in traditional medicinal systems to boost immunity and treat minor infections. From more recent research, it has been suggested that the herb may also help boost athletic endurance, making it a valuable natural supplement for athletes. The improved physical performance is linked to an increase in erythropoietin (EPO) levels, which is helpful in the regulation of red blood cell production. Improved red blood cell health and production ultimately boost endurance as it results in increased oxygen supply to muscle tissue. 9. Jiaogulan Jiaogulan or gynostemma is native to Asia and has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine, which shares a similarly rich history to Ayurved. Part of the cucumber family, jiaogulan may help improve performance endurance and reduce exercise fatigue because of a strengthening effect on cardiovascular function. As demonstrated in studies, the herb encourages the release of nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and improves cardio output. 10. Gokhru for Muscle Growth Gokhru is widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat a number of conditions including kidney disease, diabetes, and female reproductive disorders. However, in recent years the herb has become popular with competitive athletes and bodybuilders because of its proven effectiveness at raising levels of the male hormone testosterone without violating anti-doping laws and causing side effects. If you're part of any sports or athletic community, you'd probably hear of it as Tribulus Terrestris - its botanical name. Aside from boosting testosterone levels, research suggests that the herb may also increase anaerobic muscle power. [You can now buy Herbobuild with Gokhru (Tribulus Terrestris) for just Rs. 399](https://drvaidyas.com/products/herbobuild-50-capsules) Key Vitamins and Minerals for Muscle Growth There are a few key vitamins and minerals that are essential for muscle growth.

Vitamin C also helps to reduce inflammation, which can lead to muscular soreness and fatigue. - Magnesium is another mineral that is critical for muscle growth.
