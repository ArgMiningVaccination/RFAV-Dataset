Why get vaccinated against COVID-19? [The emergency phase of COVID-19 is over](/news/item/05-05-2023-statement-on-the-fifteenth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-pandemic), but the virus continues to spread and evolve. COVID-19 remains a threat, especially to older persons and adults with underlying health conditions. Safe and effective vaccines help ensure that COVID-19 does not result in severe disease and death. Vaccination protects against COVID-19 and reduces the likelihood of new variants from emerging. Take all COVID-19 vaccine doses, including booster doses, as recommended to you by your health authority. COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Strict precautions are in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy. Unprecedented scientific collaborations, extensive prior research and substantial public funding enabled swift COVID-19 vaccine development to be completed in record time - while maintaining high safety standards. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Through this process, we establish that COVID-19 vaccines remain safe worldwide. Read more on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines: Who should get vaccinated and boosted? On March 2023, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization (SAGE) updated the recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination in the context of the circulating Omicron variant and high population immunity. The updated recommendations outline three priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: high, medium, and low. The recommendations are summarized below. Further details are in this document: [WHO SAGE Roadmap for prioritizing uses of COVID-19 vaccines (March 2023)](/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Roadmap) High priority group Includes: For this group, WHO recommends receiving the primary series, first booster and additional booster doses 6 or 12 months after the last dose, depending on factors such as age and immunocompromising conditions. Medium priority group Includes: For this group, WHO recommends the primary series and first booster dose. Additional booster doses are not routinely recommended. However, health authorities may consider giving additional boosters doses when the benefits are warranted and there are no known safety issues. Countries may also offer additional booster doses in the routine programme based on population risks, disease epidemiology or health priorities. Low priority group Includes: Getting vaccinated: Specific advice Of note, not all COVID-19 vaccines are licensed for children. Please check the age indication in the [product-specific recommendations](/tools/covid-19-vaccine-introduction-toolkit/vaccine-specific-resources). A single booster dose during pregnancy - if more than 6 months have passed since the last dose, protects both the pregnant woman and the foetus while helping to reduce the likelihood of hospitalization of infants for COVID-19.

More serious or long-lasting side effects after COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare. If you experience difficulty in breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored to detect and respond to rare adverse events. If you do get COVID-19 after vaccination, you are more likely to have mild or no symptoms than if you hadn't been vaccinated. Your COVID-19 questions answered Vaccine facts Vaccine myths vs science "}
