It's designed to stimulate the healing mechanisms of the body and can bring many health benefits to you both physically and psychologically, including assisting with fertility and reproductive issues. Originating in Ancient China more than [2,500 years](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm) ago, it was passed down through generations and was introduced to societies all over the world. TCM made contact with the Western world at the beginning of the [17th century](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12216556) and became increasingly popular in America during the [1970s](https://tuftscope.squarespace.com/s/Traditional-Chinese-Medicine.pdf). Since then, TCM has had a positive impact on modern medicine. The [Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12216556) found that the cooperation of TCM and modern medicine is more efficient for the cure and prevention of disease than each of them separately. TCM [treatments](https://tuftscope.squarespace.com/s/Traditional-Chinese-Medicine.pdf) include: - Tai chi - Qigong (exercise) - Acupuncture - Cupping - Herbal medicine These practices have been modernized but still maintain their roots in Eastern philosophy. For example, [TCM herb formulations](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/153148/) have been effective treatments for illnesses for many centuries. TCM and modern medicine has gradually formed a consensus and agreed on the 'pharmacology' and 'mechanism of action' of many of these Chinese herbs. TCM treatments can help improve: - Fertility - Kidneys - Liver - Overall nutrition [TCM practitioners](https://tuftscope.squarespace.com/s/Traditional-Chinese-Medicine.pdf) believe that health is dependent upon the body harmoniously maintaining a state of balance between internal and external stability. Therefore, TCM diagnosis and treatment aims to detect and correct imbalances that are present in the body. Studies have shown that TCM can help improve fertility and reproductive health. Unlike Western Medicine, which focuses on manipulating ovulation, surgical procedures, and artificial reproductive technologies, TCM focuses on assisting the body to [self-correct](https://www.mother.ly/life/5-ways-to-use-the-best-of-chinese-medicine-to-boost-your-fertility) using natural remedies. TCM has an individualized approach specific to each patient and their individual symptoms. Philippa Youngs, a Chinese medical practitioner, says that \"a multidisciplinary approach explores optimization of natural fertility.\" Ultimately, since it's integration into communities all over the world, TCM has had a very positive effect on modern medicine. It uses natural methods to correct imbalances in the body and treat disease. The profound impact on fertility has been ground-breaking. TCM is helping women fall pregnant naturally. "}
