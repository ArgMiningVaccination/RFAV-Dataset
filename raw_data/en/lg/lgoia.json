Dr. Huntoon's promise is he will help you get to the source of your Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and will help you get rid of it once and for all. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the herpes virus family. It is one of the most common human viruses. EBV is found all over the world. Most people get infected with EBV at some point in their lives. EBV spreads most commonly through bodily fluids, primarily saliva. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis, also called mono, and other illnesses. Symptoms Symptoms of EBV infection can include Many people become infected with EBV in childhood. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, will feel better in two to four weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months. Know that feeling better and not having sub-clinical EBV infection are one in the same once you have EBV until properly remedied. After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened Immune Systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates. EBV Spreads Easily EBV is spread by saliva through Transmission EBV spreads most commonly through bodily fluids, especially saliva. However, EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations. EBV can be spread by using objects, such as a toothbrush or drinking glass, that an infected person recently used. The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist. The first time you get infected with EBV (primary EBV infection) you can spread the virus for weeks and even before you have symptoms. Once the virus is in your body, it stays there in a latent (inactive) state until properly remedied. If the virus reactivates, you can potentially spread EBV to others no matter how much time has passed since the initial infection. Treatment Diagnosis Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging since symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About nine out of ten of adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection. There is no specific treatment from the medical perspective. It is something you will learn to live with.
