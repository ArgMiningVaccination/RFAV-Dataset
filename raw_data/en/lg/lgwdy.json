Insurance Coverage* Currently we are contracted with: Aetna Culinary Health Fund MGM Resorts (UMR) Sierra Health and Life Sierra Healthcare Options Teacher's Health Trust TriWest UMR United Health Care We are currently in the process of joining the network of other insurances, so stay tuned and contact our office for possible updates. Your insurance policy is a contact between you and your insurance company. While we are happy to assist you with billing them directly, we need you to provide the following information prior to your treatment, which can be obtained by calling your insurance company directly, getting in touch with your company's human resources department, or by reviewing your plan documents: - Confirmation that you have acupuncture as a covered benefit on your policy. Acupuncture is not considered an \"essential health benefit\" and as such, is not always included in your list of benefits. - Your deductible amount. The deductible is the amount of money that you must spend out of your own pocket before insurance will begin covering your claims. During the deductible period, all out of pocket costs are collected at the time of service according to the insurance company allowed amounts for the procedures that are performed. - Your copay or co-insurance amount for acupuncture. If you do have acupuncture benefits, then typically there is a per visit copay (a set amount) and/or a co-insurance (a % of the allowed amount). Copay is a fixed amount you pay for a health care service, usually when you receive the service. Coinsurance amounts represent the amount you are responsible for after your deductible is met and insurance starts covering treatment. - The number of allowed acupuncture visits per year. Most plans that include acupuncture as a benefit will only cover a certain number of visits per year. We Accept Personal Injury Liens! If you were injured in an accident, we may be able to help you. Before you call the office to book an appointment, make sure to get authorization from your attorney to seek acupuncture treatment for your case. "}
