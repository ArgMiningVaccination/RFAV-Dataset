Fluorouracil (5FU), folinic acid (leucovorin), oxaliplatin and nivolumab are used to treat locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the esophagus, stomach -esophagus junction, or stomach . How do these drugs work? Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin work by interfering with dividing cells and preventing an increase in the number of cancer cells. Leucovorin works by enhancing the effect of fluorouracil and strengthening fluorouracil's ability to reduce the number of cancer cells. Nivolumab helps the body's immune system target cancer cells to stop them from growing. INTENDED BENEFITS This therapy is being given to destroy and/or limit the growth of cancer cells in your body. This treatment may improve your current symptoms, and delay the onset of new symptoms. It may take several treatments before your docto r can judge whether or not this treatment is helping. TREATMENT SUMMARY How are these drugs given? Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and nivolumab are given directly into the vein (IV). You will receive nivolumab, oxaliplatin and leucovorin at the clinic by a chemotherapy nurse . Oxaliplatin and leucovorin are mixed separately into two IV bags, which are then given to you at the same time. You will then receive a dose of fluorouracil given directly into the vein through a syringe. You will also be gi ven an additional dose of fluorouracil over 46 hours, or 2 days, using a disposable infusion device called an INFUSOR\u00ae or \"baby bottle\" . The infus ion device delivers the fluorouracil slowly and continuously to your body over the 46 hour time period. Please see a copy of \"Your INFUSOR\u00ae - A Guide for Patients\", available through your chemotherapy nurse. The infus ion device is connected to your veins by either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC Line) or a PORT -A-CATH\u00ae. If using a PICC lin e, this is inserted in your upper arm. If using a PORT- A-CATH\u00ae, this is inserted under the skin of the chest using local freezing. The insertion would be done several days before your treatment starts and would be removed once the treatment program is fi nished. The chemotherapy nurse will connect the infus ion device to your PICC or PORT -A-CATH\u00ae at the clinic and then you can go home while your treatment is delivered over the 2 days. BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 2/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: You may return to the clinic after 2 days for the nurse to disconnect t he infus ion device, or you will be instructed how to disconnect yourself at home. Some people may be instructed to go to their local hospital to be disconnected, or may have a home care nurse provide this service, if available. You will then have a two w eek rest period. This total 14 days or 2 week period of time is called a \"cycle\". Each treatment will take about 4 hours. This includes a dressing change if you have a PICC line. If you have a PORT- A-CATH\u00ae, a dressing change is not needed, so your treatment will take less time. Your first treatment will probably take longer, as the nurse will review information on the chemo therapy and immunotherapy drugs and infus ion device with you. What will happen while I am being treated? A blood test is done within one month of starting treatment. A blood test is also done before Day 1 of each cycle. The dose and timing of your treatment may be changed based on your blood test results and/or other side effects. Your very first treatment will take longer than other treatments because a nurse will be reviewing the possible side effects of your treatment plan and will discuss with y ou how to manage them. It is a good idea to bring someone with you to your first treatment appointment. Please bring your anti -nausea drugs with you for each treatment. Your nurse will tell you when to take them. You may also need to take anti -nausea drugs at home after treatment. It is easier to prevent nausea and vomiting than to treat it once it happens, so follow directions closely. The calendar below outlines your overall treatment plan for each 2 week cycle. C Y C L E 1 DATE TREATMENT PLAN Week 1 nivolumab, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil IV on Day 1 + fluorouracil infusion over 46 hours starting on Day 1 Week 2 no treatment C Y C L E 2 DATE TREATMENT PLAN Week 1 nivolumab, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil IV on Day 1 + fluorouracil infusion over 46 hours starting on Day 1 Week 2 no treatment Treatment may be continued as long as you are benefiting from it and not having too many side effects from treatment and for a maximum of 2 years for nivolumab, as determined by your oncologist . BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 3/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: OTHER INSTRUCTIONS It is very important to report side effects immediately to your doctor. Do not manage side effects at home without first speaking with your doctor. Be aware that symptoms may be delayed and can develop months after your last dose. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PA TIENT Tell your doctor if you have ever had an unusual or allergic reaction to the following drugs before starting this treatment: 1. oxaliplatin, cisplatin 3. leucovorin 4. nivolumab The drinking of alcohol (in small amounts) does not appear to affect the safety or usefulness of nivolumab, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or leucovorin. Nivolumab, fluorouracil may cause sterility in men and menopause in women. If you plan to have children, discuss this with your doctor before beginning treatment. Nivolumab, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin may damage sperm and may harm the baby if used during pregnancy. It is best to use birth control while undergoing treatment and for 5 months after the last dose. Tell your doctor right away if you or your partner becomes pregnant. Do not breast feed during treatment. Tell doctors, dentists and other health professionals that you are being treated with nivolumab, oxaliplatin, fluorourac il and leucovorin before you receive any treatment from them. Other important things to know: Before you are given nivolumab, talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you: have an active condition where your immune system attacks your body (autoimmune disease), such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis. take other medicines that make your immune system weak. Examples of these may include steroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone. had an organ transplant, such as a kidney transplant. have any other medical conditions. What other drugs or foods can interact with this treatment? Other drugs may interact with leucovorin and oxaliplatin. Other drugs such as warfarin (COUMADIN\u00ae), phenytoin (DILANTIN\u00ae) and fos phenytoin (CEREBYX\u00ae) may interact with fluorouracil. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before you start or stop taking any other drugs including all prescription and nonprescription medicines, steroids or other medicines that lower your immune response, vitamins, and herbal supplements. BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 4/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: Special note: Heart Problems: Serious heart problems can occur when starting fluorouracil. These can rarely be fatal. Problems such as chest pain, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, or heart failure can occur. Having a history of heart problems with capecitabine, a related chemotherapy drug, is a risk factor, as is having a history of prior angina (heart pain) or heart attack. Seek medical attention promptly if you experience feelings of heavy pressure or pain in the chest, trouble breathing, significant worsening leg swelling, or marked lightheadedness. These symptoms can occur within days after starting fluorouracil. If your symptoms are severe, you may need to call for emergency help. Nivolumab may cause serious immune reactions against your own body (autoimmune) affecting many parts. What is the most important information I should know about SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS? Nivolumab can cause serious side effects in many parts of your body. These side ef fects are most likely to begin during treatment; however, side effects can show up months after your last treatment with nivolumab. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of serious side effects listed in the table below or your symptoms get worse. Do not try to treat or diagnose symptoms yourself. Getting medical treatment right away may keep the problem from becoming more serious. The following side effects were most frequently reported with nivolumab: Very common (more than 1 in 10 people) diarrhea itching, rash joint pain feeling tired feeling less hungry cough BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 5/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS How common is it?

This may occur rarely. These symptoms will disappear in a few hours, and may not require treatment. If you have these symptoms with a 2 -hour infusion, your next treatment may be given over 6 hours. Allergic reactions may very rarely occur. Signs of an allergic reaction are dizziness, feeling faint, confusion, shortness of breath, and wheezing. This may occur immediately or several hours after receiving the drugs. It can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. Tell your nurse if this happens while you are receiving the drugs or contact your doctor immediately if this happens after you leave the clinic . Oxaliplatin and fluorouracil will burn if it leaks under the skin. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if you feel burning, stinging, or any other change while the drug is being given. Your white blood cells will decrease after your treatment. They usually return to normal after your last treatment. White blood cells protect your body by fighting bacteria (germs) that cause infection. When they are low, you are at greater risk of having an infection. To help prevent infection: Wash your hands often and always after using the bathroom. Take care of your skin and mouth. Call your doctor immediately at the first sign of an infection such as fever (over 100\u00baF or 38\u00baC by an oral thermometer), chills, cough, or burning when you pass urine. Your platele ts may decrease during or after your treatment. They will return to normal after your last treatment. This is common. Platelets help to make your blood clot when you hurt yourself. You may bruise or bleed more easily than usual. To help prevent bleedin g problems: Try not to bruise, cut, or burn yourself. Clean your nose by blowing gently. Do not pick your nose. Avoid constipation. Brush your teeth gently with a soft toothbrush as your gums may bleed more easily. Maintain good oral hygiene. Some medications such as ASA (e.g. ASPIRIN\u00ae) or ibuprofen (e.g. ADVIL\u00ae) may increase your risk of bleeding. Do not stop taking any medication that has been prescribed by your doctor (e.g. ASA for your heart ). For minor pain, try acetaminophen (e.g. TYLENOL\u00ae) fi rst, but occasional use of ibuprofen may be acceptable. BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 8/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Nausea and vomiting may occur after your treatment and may last for 24 - 48 hours . If you are vomiting and it is not controlled, you can quickly become dehydrated. Some people have little or no nausea. You may be given a prescription for an antinausea drug(s) to take before your chemotherapy treatment and/or at home. It is easier to prevent nausea than treat it once it has occurred, so follow directions closel y. Drink plenty of liquids. Eat and drink often in small amounts. Try the ideas in Practical Tips to Help Manage Nausea* Tell your healthcare team if nausea or vomiting continues or is not controlled with your antinausea drug(s). You may feel tingling or a loss of feeling in your hands, feet, nose, or throat. They may be made worse by exposure to cold. This is very common after oxaliplatin treatment. These problems often disappear after a few hours or days. Avoid cold air if possible. Protect yourself from the cold, which can cause or worsen these symptoms. Wear gloves, socks, and something that covers your mouth and nose when outside in cold weather. Do not drink cold beverages or eat cold food for a few days after treatment. Be careful when walking on uneven surfaces or doing activities that need you to balance or be steady. Try the ideas in Coping With/Preventing Oxaliplatin Cold Dysesthesias*. Talk to your healthcare team if symptoms continue for more than a week, or you have trouble with buttons, w riting, picking up small objects, walking, or have fallen. Sore mouth may occur during treatment. This is common. Mouth sores can occur on the tongue, the sides of the mouth or in the throat. Mouth sores or bleeding gums can lead to an infection. Brush your teeth gently after eating and at bedtime with a very soft toothbrush. If your gums bleed, use gauze instead of a brush. Use baking soda instead of toothpaste. Make a mouthwash with \u00bc teaspoon baking soda AND \u00bc teaspoon salt in 1 cup warm water and ri nse several times a day. Try soft, bland foods like puddings, milkshakes and cream soups. Avoid spicy, crunchy or acidic food, and very hot or cold foods. Try the ideas in Food Ideas to Try with a Sore Mouth.* BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) GIGAVFFO XN 9/12 Developed: 1 Nov 2022 Revised: OTHER SIDE EFFECTS DURING TREATMENT MANAGEMENT Pain or tenderness may occur where the needle was placed. Apply warm compresses or soak in warm water for 15 -20 min s. several times a day. Fever may occur shortly after treatment. Fever should last no more than 24 hours. Take acetaminophen (e.g. TYLENOL\u00ae) every 3 - 4 hours. Fever which occurs more than 48 hours after treatment may be the sign of an infection. See \"white blood cells\" above. Your skin may sunburn easily. To help prevent sunburn: Avoid direct sunlight. Wear a hat, long sleeves and long pants or skirt outside on sunny days. Apply a sun block lotion with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Refer to Your Medication Sun Sensitivity and Sunscreens* or the BC Health Guide for more information. After sun exposure, if you have a severe sunburn or skin reaction such as itching, rash, or swelling, contact your doctor. Loss of appetite and weight loss sometimes occur. Try the ideas in Food Ideas to Help with Decreased Appetite .* If loss of appetite is persistent and you have other symptoms of hepatitis , tell your doctor as soon as possible. (see the table for serious side effects during nivolumab treatment) Tiredness and lack of energy may occur. Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you are feeling tired. Try the ideas in the handout titled Fatigue/Tiredness* Hair loss is uncommon with fluorouracil and rare with oxaliplatin and nivolumab. If you experience hair loss, your hair will grow back once you stop treatment. Colour and texture may change. If hair loss is a problem, refer to Resources for Hair Loss and Appearance Changes.* Abnormal heart rhythm (QT prolongation) rarely occurs. Minimize your risk of abnormal heart rhythm by: Always checking with your pharmacist and doctor about drug interactions when starting a new medication, herbal product, or supplement. Tell your doctor immediately or get emergency help if your heart is beating irregularly or fast, or if you feel faint, lightheaded, or dizzy. *Please ask your chemotherapy nurse, pharmacist, or dietitian for a copy.
