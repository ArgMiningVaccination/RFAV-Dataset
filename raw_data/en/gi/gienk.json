The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 11 RETIREMENTS Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis Dr. Anagnostakis joined the staff of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in 1966 as a Technician I in the Department of Genetics. In recognition of her scientific contributions, she quickly rose thr ough the ranks to Assistant Scientist and eventually to Scientist. Over the years, Dr. Anagnostakis worked on a variety of problems, but concentrated on the genetics of fungi, particularly those that cause corn smut, Dutch elm disease, and Chestnut blight . Beginning in 1968, Dr. Anagnostakis worked tirelessly toward the goal of restoring chestnut trees to a prominent place in the Connecticut forest. In 1972, she imported hypovirulent strains of the Chestnut blight fungus from France and began to use thes e for studies on biological control of Chestnut blight. Her numerous studies on the basic biology of both the virulent and hypovirulent strains of the fungus earned her international recognition. Sandy's work to introduce resistance into both orchard and timber chestnut trees through breeding is yet another side of her multi - faceted program. Throughout her tenure, she maintained the Station's collection of species and hybrids of chestnut, which is recognized as one of the largest and finest collections i n the world. Due in large part to Sandy's efforts, hypovirulence is beginning to slowly become established in the forest. Her competence, her contagious enthusiasm, and her engaging personality brought Sandy numerous accolades from many who share d her dr eam of restoring the chestnut. For 48 years, Dr. Anagnostakis energetically and ably served the international scientific community as well as the citizens of the State of Connecticut \u2014through her dedication and commitment to science and tirelessly fulfilli ng the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station's motto of \"Putting Science to Work for Society.\" We honor Dr. Anagnostakis and her contributions on the occasion of her retirement. Dr. Neil A. McHale Dr. Neil McHale joined the staff of The Connecti cut Agricultural Experiment Station in 1983 as an Assistant Geneticist in the Department of Biochemistry & Genetics. In recognition of his scientific contributions, he quickly rose through the ranks to Associate Geneticist and in 1994 became a Full Scient ist and Head of the Department of Biochemistry & Genetics. Over the years, Dr. McHale's took a genetic approach to elucidating processes in photosynthesis and in plant development. Dr. McHale asked a simple question about a complex problem - which genes in plants are necessary to develop a leaf - nature's ultimate solar panel. During his career, Dr. McHale deftly combined traditional and modern technologies including, chimeric plant generation, advanced histological and microscopic analysis, genetic screens and modern transgenic and molecular techniques. His research discovered a new gene, Lam-1, that controls how leaves expand in a lateral direction. Lam-1 is one of the master reg ulatory genes that controls plant development. Through his efforts he also discerned how lam -1 works and interacts with other master regulatory genes in laying down the foundation for leaf development. Although his work centered on the species Nicotiana sylvestris, the impact of his findings was widely applicable to all higher plants, since they share the same genes for leaf development. This basic research opened the door for future engineering of plant shape and development. 12 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 For 32 years, Dr. Neil M cHale energetically and ably served the international scientific community through his publications in seminal scientific journals including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Plant Cell and Development. In particular, his work reflected the long legacy of plant genetics at the Experiment Station in pursuit of basic and applied science. Dr. McHale's work was a prime example of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station's motto of \"Putting Science to Work for Society.\" We honor Dr. McHal e and his contributions on the occasion of his retirement. Dr. Richard B. Peterson Dr. Richard Peterson joined the Experiment Station staff in 1979 as an Assistant Biochemist in the Department of Biochemistry & Genetics, and devoted his entire career of 35 years to studies on the molecular foundations of photosynthesis. His insights and landmark publications earned him a rapid promotion to Associate Biochemist in 1982, then in 1992 he was promoted to Biochemist. It was the hallmark of Dr. Peterson's career that he kept his eye on the key developments in a rapidly moving field, and made adjustments necessary to stay at the cutting edge. His journey began in the world of plant biochemistry, focusing on the underling mechanisms that regulate photosynthe tic efficiency. Eventually his work moved into the world of biophysics, seeking here to understand how plant leaves avoid the damaging effects of sunlight, while still capturing the energy that drives photosynthesis. Finally his attention turned to the C 4 pathway for photosynthesis, a remarkable adaptation allowing grasses to maintain high levels of photosynthesis in semi -arid environments. What these areas of work had in common was their enormous potential to improve the primary productivity of agricult ural plants. As powerful new tools became available to attack each of these subjects, Dr. Peterson was eager to exploit them, ever ready to realign the program, always wanting to be there when the big breakthrough arrived. He could easily have remained encapsulated in a technical world understood only by his colleagues, but every Plant Science Day he could be found regaling groups of citizens eager to hear about the latest breakthroughs in modern plant biology. So it is with some sadness but a much large r measure of gratitude that we acknowledge Dr. Peterson's tireless devotion to the Experiment Station and his advancement of plant science as we honor him on the occasion of his retirement. Ms. Roberta Milano -Ottenbreit Ms. Roberta Milano -Ottenbreit jo ined the staff of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in 1989 as Executive Secretary to the Director. During the course of her 25 years she loyally served three different Directors with high levels of professionalism and dedication to the Expe riment Station. A superb secretary, she prepared and maintained agency documents, filed notices with the Secretary of State's office, typed countless letters, manuscripts and reports including the Experiment Station's annual \"Record of the Year\". She competently organized arrangements for the Station's annual \"Spring Open House\" and \"Plant Science Day\" events at Lockwood Farm and reserved Jones Auditorium and other conference rooms for civic group meetings. Each year, she spearheaded the Station's United Way Campaign. Ever conscientious and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 13 dependable, she quickly adapted to changes in computer technology and the demands of the job continually offering good ideas for improvements. Her work was always neat, accurate and error -free as she strived for qual ity, always caring to do a good job. Ms. Ottenbreit was polite and courteous with co- workers and state residents who called upon the Station for assistance or information. She exhibited endless patience and understanding to diplomatically solve problems and ensure harmony in the workplace. Her work ethic, competence, cheerful outlook, and way of keeping operations moving smoothly were special qualities that will surely be missed. A true ambassador for the Experiment Station and the State of Connecticut, we honor Ms. Roberta Milano- Ottenbreit and her contributions on the occasion of her retirem ent. 14 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 PLANT SCIENCE DAY 2014 The weather on Plant Science Day 2014 was beautiful, warm, and clear.

Cecarell i, Farm Manager, Rollin J. Hannan, Jr., and Michael M. McHill, who worked on the plots, grass, trimming and set up. The barns, buildings, and grounds were cleaned by the Maintenance crew - Bancroft Nicholson, Supervisor, Brian Hart, Ronald A. LaFrazier, a nd Michael A. Scott. They also delivered all items needed for the day to the farm. Tent set -ups were done by Vickie Bomba -Lewandoski, Tia M. Blevins, Steven J. Sandrey, Peter W. Trenchard, and Roberta M. -Ottenbreit, who also helped the Maintenance crew. Students from the Sound School, under the supervision of teacher Chaz Mavrelion, helped set up the main tent by washing tables and chairs and putting them in place. At 10:45AM Director Theodore G. Andreadis introduced D r. Mike Hoffmann, Director, Cornell University Agricultural Experiment S tation and Associate Dean, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and Professor of Entomology at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY as the Samuel W. Johnson Memorial Lecturer. He gave a talk on Climate Change and Agricul ture: No Longer Business as Usual. Following Dr. Hoffmann's talk, Dr. Andreadis and Governor Dannel P. Malloy presented the Century Farm Award to Holdridge Farm Nursery of Ledyard, Connecticut. Holdridge Farm Nursery, located in Ledyard, was started in 1912 by Judge Samuel Holdridge as a vegetable farm and as a mail order nursery for strawberry plants. His son, Paul Holdridge, Sr., added bare-root fruit trees and eventually a full line of nursery stock. A small store was built at the home farm at Ge er Hill in 1941. Paul Holdridge Jr. and Alden Holdridge, the third generation on the farm, each added their own initiatives. Paul Jr. expanded the retail sector and added hard goods. Alden took over management of the growing operations and shifted from field -grown to container -grown nursery production. Currently, Holdridge Farm Nursery is the largest garde n center and wholesale n ursery in Southeastern Connectic ut. It is run by Shari Hewes, daughter of P aul Jr. and fourth- generation of the Holdridge family on the farm. Holdridge Farm Nursery grows vegetable plants, annuals, perennials, nursery stock and contract nursery stock on 60 acres of which 16 acres are un der irrigation for container production, and nearly 2 acres of greenhouses. The retail ce nter in Ledyard Center is a landmark known for locally grown quality nursery stock and plants. After the Century Farm Award was presented, Will Rowlands, President of the Experiment Station Associates, gave a few remarks and invited all in the audience to join the Associates. At 11:50AM the Honorable Governor Dannel P. Malloy, who is also the President of the Station's Board of Control, spoke to the crowd. Plant Science Day 2014 was a very big success that was enjoyed by a record number of visitors - due to the hard work of the entire Station staff. 22 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 23 24 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 EVENTS HELD AT THE STATION JENKINS -WAGGONER LABORATORY RIBBON -CUTTING CEREMONY The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 25 Remarks from Station Director, Dr. Theodore Andreadis On behalf of the Board of Control, it is an honor and privilege for me to welcome you here today on this special occasion as we gather to dedicate and celebrate the opening of the newly renovated and constructed addition to the Jenkins- Waggoner Laboratory. This historic building which was originally constructed back in 1932 has served us well over the course of the last 80 years and many scientific advances have been made within these walls. However, the interior of the building had exceeded its useful lif e and we were dearly in need of more space. The renovation and new addition now provide us with state -of-the art laboratories and additional space creating an ideal venue for our staff to address the many challenges that lie before us and allow us to utili ze the latest advances in biotechnology, genomics and molecular biology as we address the important issues of the day that impact agriculture, public health and the environment and help us to more effectively serve the citizens of the State. I am delighted that the Governor Malloy could be with us today, but before I introduce the Governor, I would like to acknowledge some of the special guests who have joined us here this morning: Dr. Paul Waggoner, former Director of the Experiment Station and the man we honor here today, who for 64 years has served the Station, 25 years as Director . He has traveled over 2,000 miles from Seattle, WA to be with us today. He is a ccompanied by his two sons Von and Dan, b rother Wayne , granddaughter Katherine, a nd Great Granddaughter Elizabeth. Also in attendance is Mr. Bud Salemi, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Administrative Services, Division of Construction Services ; three members of the Station's Board of Control, Mr. Terry Jones, who serves as Vice -President , Mr. St even Reviczky, Commissioner of Agriculture, and Ms. Joan Nichols ; Dr. John Anderson, Former Director and Distinguished Scientist, CAES and his wife Marylyn and Ms. Susan Wahlen, Deputy Commissioner, DEEP I would like to give you a bit of history about this building. The original building was constructed back in 1932 as a WPA project during the early years of the Great Depression at a cost of a mere $50,000, half of which was appropriated by the General assembly and the other half from Experiment Station Bo ard funds. Remarkably, it was completed in only one year. The architect was Douglas Orr, who was born in Meriden, CT, attended Yale University and designed many public buildings in the New Haven area and elsewise including the Eli (former Southern New En gland Telephone), One Church Street (former New Haven National Bank), and the Robert A. Taft Memorial in Washington DC. At that time the Experiment Station was expanding and excerpts from former director William Slate in the Annual Report of CAES noted that \"for the past 10 years the staff had been living under crowded conditions that made scientific work extremely difficult and at times ineffective\". At that time the Jenkins Laboratory was devoted to research in four biological sciences, botany, entomology, plant breeding and forestry. It was named for Dr. E dward H. Jenkins, the Station's 3 rd Director who was for 55 years a member of the Station Staff and for 23 years Director. While this building served us well for over 80 years, I think it is fair to s ay that serious consideration of the need for renovating this historic building and creating additional laboratory space began some 10- 15 years ago when it became increasing more difficult to maintain the standard of excellence in our scientific work that we had been accustomed to and to employ the latest technologies in molecular biology that would allow us to stay on the cutting edge of science and address the key issues of the day that impact agriculture, public health and the environment and effectively serve the citizens of the State. I am not exaggerating when I say that, the roof was leaking, mold was growing in the ground floor, the interior walls of building were virtually crumbling, the mechanical systems (heating, cooling, and electricity) were antiquated and in poor working conditions, we were not ADA compliant, and more space was sorely needed. 26 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 While it was clear to many of us who worked in the building that something had to be done, it was the vision and sheer determination of my predecessor, t he late Dr. Louis Magnarelli that was the driving force behind this project, and without his efforts it would never have come to fruition. It is of course most unfortunate that Lou did not have the opportunity see the completion of this wonderful building where he began his career working with mosquitoes, ticks and vector -borne diseases , but I am delighted that his wife, Dr. Sharon Magnarelli is able to be with us this morning and share in the celebration. In honor and recognition of Lou's contributions t o the Station over his 37 year career as a scientist and Director, we have erected a patio at the east entrance to the building which is beautifully decorated and I invite you all to visit. Now, while we are here to celebrate the opening of the laboratory, it is of equal significance that we are here to pay homage to the man whose name it bears. Dr. Paul Edward Waggoner. Dr. Waggoner began his career at the Experiment Station on July 1 st, 1951. He arrived in New Haven traveling from Ames Iowa, with his w ife Barb and young son Von, who accompanied him here today in an old Plymouth hauling a homemade trailer that he purchased for $50, loaded with a table, chairs and a refrigerator. Finding housing was scarce they took refuge in Bragheri's cabin camp in Nor th Haven for about a month and then took up residence in the Yalesville section of Wallingford and eventually settled in Guilford where their second son Dan was born. Dr. Waggoner was brought to the Stat ion by then director James Hors fall to study the ef fects of radiation on plant disease and his job was financed by the Atomic Energy Commission. A ccording to his own admission, this position provided him with a deferment from the Korean War. Paul had previously served in the Army Air Corps during the 2nd world War as a meteorologist. He was assigned to the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and began his career in this very building which now bears his name. He worked alongside C hief Pathologist , Albert Diamond with whom he experimented with tomat oes and wilt disease caused by Fusarium and explored the effect of radiation on disease susceptibility in potatoes. I should note that Paul's first published paper was in 1949 and was entitled: \" The influence of weekly cumulative rainfall and temperature on potato late blight epiphytotics in Iowa \", and was published in Plant Dis ease. Rep orts. However, according to Horsfall, Paul was much more interested in climatology than plant pathology and in 1956 the Department of Soils and Climatology was established and Paul was made the Department Head. During the years that ensued Paul made many significant contributions including: He initiated watershed research on the physics and meteorology of aerial dispersal of fungus spores using the blue mold fungus of tobac co (1956). He initiated studies in forestry and hosted a conference on suburban forest ecology, which remains an important subject area that we continue to focus our research efforts today (1962). In a publication entitled Plants, Shade and Shelter , Waggon er showed how trees, thickets parking lots and beaches affected human behavior (1963) He was a guest of President Lynden B. Johnson at a White House conference on Natural Beauty and in 1966 he received an award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Bioclimatology\". In experiments in forests he showed that modifying leaf stomata (these are the tiny openings in the epidermis of a plant, through which gases and water vapor pass and permit the absorption of carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis from the air, as well as the removal of excess oxygen) openings could alter the hydraulic cycle and conserve soil water (1964 -1979) . Based on this work he then proceeded to make a computer simulation of the micro climate in a forest and demonstrated the impact of leaf area upon the temperature and evaporation in the canopy (1968) . Perhaps his defining scientific achievement was his composition of the first computer simulation program modeling the epidemic of plant disease EPIDEM (1969) . He rose quickly through the ranks and was appointed Vice Director in 1968. Four years later in 1972 became the 6 th Director of the Experiment Station serving under three Governors unti l his formal retirement in 1987. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 27 Under his tenure as Director, many significant advances were made in this very building including the use of hypo virulence techniques for biological control of chestnut blight, the development of computer models to calculate long- distance aerial transport of plant diseas e spores, the first isolations of Lyme disease agents from wildlife and the first antibody tests for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, and work on biological control of the gypsy moth that led to the discovery of the fungal pathogen, Entomophaga maimai ga that resulted in its demise and continues to this day to keep this exotic pest in check, and I think it is fair to say, the Station flourished. And finally, in recognition of his accomplishments he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978 , one of the highest honors an American Scientist can aspire to. And on a final note, I was informed just this morning in an e -mail from Dr. Jesse Ausubeldo, Director, Program for the Human Environment at The Rockefeller University who wanted me to know that within the next few days they would be submitting to a peer -reviewed journal a new paper, \"Converging Evidence of Global Greening,\" of which Paul Waggoner is a co -author. So Dr. Wagner, in recognition of your accomplishments, 64 years of service to the Station, and guidance of this venerable institution we salute you and commemorate this building in your name. 28 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Remarks from Dr. Paul Waggoner Your Excellency, Governor Malloy, when I arrived in 1951, John Davis Lodge was governor, and like you, he was elected as its president by The Station Board of Control. I can, therefore, address you as Mr. President. And I can thank that line of Boards and presidents for appointing me, 64 years ago, as an Assistant Scientist, and now for putting my name on the Je nkins -Waggoner Lab. My thanks also encompass my late wife Barbara, and my two sons, who are here with a granddaughter and great granddaughter. Also I thank colleagues in science and greet personal friends who are here. From the Station, I extend its gra titude to the army of citizens who bring nibbled, wilted and rusted crops and ornamental trees to our labs, as well as red spots and welts raised on their arms and legs by ticks and mosquitoes and bedbugs . Collections by this volunteer army of scouts ofte n start and inspire our useful discoveries of invasive insects, weeds, spores and insect -borne pathogens. And so I end by thanking you again for this great honor, and by extending my best wishes to the future collaborative effort of the army of citizens and those who work in The Station, and wish them both well on the many discoveries that lie ahead. Waggoner's Highlights at the Station (In his own words) On July 1, 1951 I began work in the laboratory at the point where the Board of Control has now attached the Jenkins Lab to the Waggoner Lab, a nice coincidence. Six years after Hiroshima, I came to work on a radiation project with the chief plant pathologist, asking whe ther after an atomic bomb, plants would die of radiation sickness. I began badly by disabling the brakes on a Station auto on a steep hill at Lockwood Farm when burying a radioactive waste for its short half -life. That's a poor beginning on a path to become director in 21 years. After 8 years I was, nevertheless, asked to lead a department of Soils and Climatology. During the next 13 years, superb young scientists joined me. Personally, I combined my experience in climatology with plant pathology. A wet climate encourages mildews to attack plants. A famous example is the Irish blight of potatoes (that probably encouraged Governor Malloy's ancestors to come to America.) Earlier I had devised a tedious and fallible forecast for blight from historical records of weather and blight. In 1969 with the collaboration of James Horsfall, I composed EPIDEM, the first simulator of plant disease written for a computer. Combining computers and experiments on the life stages of a pathogen, EPIDEM showed how to ta ke advantage of experiments about the life stages of the pathogen and remove the tedium from disease forecasting. Horsfall joked that he had done the collaborating and I the labor in our collaboration. During the same years, I combined my experience as a weather forecaster in the Army Air Corps with knowledge of the physics of plants to show that the microscopic pores in leaves could control the hydrologic cycle that dried out fields, forests and ultimately reservoirs. Doctrine at the time said that the perimeter, not the open width of the pores, controlled drying. In the lab with a colleague, we proved this doctrine was wrong. And with others, first in barley in England and then in pine in a State forest in Voluntown, we proved it was wrong outdoors, universally. The tiny, invisible pores in leaves do control the hydrologic cycle. The discoveries about leaf pores and disease forecasting won me election to th e National Academy of Sciences. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 29 In the 1970s, I understudied the director, beginning at the daw n of the environmental era with leading Governor Dempsey's Committee on the Environment. From that committee grew a Task Force to Preserve Agricultural Land, which begat the CT law for the preservation of prime farm land, which the CT Department of Agricu lture has moved forward to preserve thousands of acres of prime land. During my 15 years as director, the country survived riots, shootings and bombs, even in New Haven and at Yale, next door to The Station. The Station gained from the General Assembly a State charter to perform research on plants and their pests \u2014especially insects \u2014soil and water. Also for chemical analysis. The greatest change during my direction was not sudden change but instead evolution. In my beginning in 1972, the CT's oak -rich fo rests were stripped of leaves by voracious gypsy moths, even more thoroughly than they had periodically been since the beginning of the 20 th century. Scouting for the eggs and opposing enthusiasm for widespread spraying of DDT preoccupied the Station and its entomologists. Fortunately, the Station discovered a microbe, likely introduced from Asia a couple generations earlier by Station scientists that stopped the moths without DDT. Bugs, however, are always with us, and Station entomologists, contribute d to the discovery that the new affliction of Lyme disease was spread by spirochetes carried by deer, mice and ticks on their way to our legs. Then Station scientists isolated the newly arrived West Nile virus in CT, the first isolation of this dangerous disease in the entire western hemisphere. What was my co ntribution to this evolution? A greater role in analyzing food safety, growing trees toppling onto highways and wires, new plant pests, and weeds growing in CT waters, matching the State's need for useful discovery. Before and after retirement, I might point the direction and then stay out of the way. Since retirement, a partnership at Rockefeller has allowed me to analyze how scientific discoveries and tastes have kept humanity's needs and income within global capacity, especially for crops, forests and water. Governor Dannel P. Malloy Mr. Terry Jones 30 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Connecticut Tree Protective Association's 2015 Arbor Day Celebration The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) and the newly renovated Jenkins -Waggoner Laboratory were selected for the CT Tree Protective Association's (CTPA) 2015 Arbor Day Celebration on Friday, April 24, 2015. The event was coordinated by Charlie Iselin, Chair, CTPA Arbor Day Committee, and Dr. Sharon M. Douglas, CAES. CTPA celebrates Arbor Day each year by planting a tree with the assistance of the winners of its Arbor Day Poster Contest. F ifth grade students in every county of Connecticut were asked to submit posters based on the theme My Favorite Tree in My Town . Poster winners from each county were invited to the tree planting ceremony at CAES, during which the posters were on display and each winner was recognized for their artwork. Winners also participated in the redbud planting and a ll winni ng posters were posted on the CTPA web site ( www.ctpa.org ). Dr. Theodore Andreadis presented welcoming remarks and following the tree planting ceremony, many attendees enjoyed tours of Jenkins- Waggoner led by Dr. Douglas and Ms. Vickie Bomba -Lewandoski and heard about CAES research programs and services from Dr. Jeff Ward, Dr. Gale Ridge, Ms. Lindsay Patrick, Dr. Lindsay Triplett, Dr. Claire Rutledge, Dr. Doug Dingman, and Mr. John Shepard. EVENTS HELD AT LOCKWOO D FARM 2014 C onnecticut -FFA Forestry Career D evelopment Event On November 21, 2014, the Department of Forestry & Horticulture marked its 3 rd year hosting the 2014 Connecticut -FFA Forestry Career Developmen t Event at Lockwood Farm. The F orestry Career Development event evaluates students' knowledge of forest management practices, tree and wood products identification, forest mensuration, map reading skills, and industry safety standards. Thirty- two students from 8 State FFA chapters part icipated in the event. The students took a 50 question exam, testing their general knowledge of forestry and the forest. They then had to identify 25 pieces of forestry related tools and equipment, followed by a 20 specimen tree identification exam , and finally a forest pests identification practicum. The students were then allowed to participate in two team events - Timber Stand Improvement and T imber Volume Cruising exercises. The 4 -student team from E. O. S mith High School Agricultural Education Prog ram finished in first place and will represent Connecticut in regional and national competition at the 2015 Eastern States Exposition and 2015 National FFA Convention in Louisville, KY. Dr. Scott Williams, Michael Short, J. P. Barsky, and Megan Floyd in t he Department of Forestry & Horticulture organized and oversaw the event. Former Station staff members Emily Picard and Vikki Christian were on hand as teachers. Nick Zito, former Station staff mem ber and current The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 31 Regional Water Authority F orester, assist ed with tree measurem ents. Richard Cecarelli, Research Farm Manager, opened up the barns and cottage to allow their use in the event. EVENTS HELD AT THE VALLEY LABORATORY Christmas Tree Twilight Meeting The annual Christmas Tree Twilight Meeting was h eld at the Valley Laboratory on the evening of July 22, 2014 in cooperation with the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association. Forty growers attended the meeting which featured CAES scientists presenting talks and answering questions at Christmas tr ee plantings on the farm. Speakers and topics were the following: Dr. Sharon Douglas, \"Christmas tree diseases 2013\"; Dr. Richard Cowles, \"Insect pest management and the fir genetic improvement project\"; Dr. Todd Mervosh, \"Weed control options in the sum mer\"; and Mr. Thomas Rathier, \"Impact of weather extremes on conifers.\" Growers having pesticide applicator licenses received 2 hours of re -certification credits for attending this meeting. Jim Preste helped with preparations for the meeting. Tobacco Research Meeting One hundred and ten people attended the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station's annual Tobacco Research Meeting held at the East Windsor Scout Hall on February 24, 2015. Dr. Jim LaMondia and Director Ted Andreadis welcomed growers and spoke about re search topics and recent developments at the Station. The meeting addressed a wide variety of issues of concern to growers. Jim LaMondia spoke about the CORESTA pesticide residue program and strategies to reduce pesticide residues in wrapper leaves and r esearch on management of tobacco pathogens including poty viruses, black shank, target spot and blue mold fungicide resistance. Thomas Rathier spoke about soils, microbial activity and tobacco. Jim LaMondia spoke about common molds in cured tobacco. Bil l Leahey spoke about CT tobacco labeling and marketing and incorporation of the Connecticut -Massachusetts Tobacco Growers Association. Colleen Kisselburgh discussed tobacco insurance program changes and Ross Eddy of the Farm Services Administration provid ed updates on FSA services to growers. Jane Canepa- Morrison, Michelle Salvas, Nathaniel Child and Jim Preste assisted with much of the behind the scenes work for the meeting. The meeting qualified for pesticide applicator re- certification credit in Conne cticut and Massachusetts and 65 persons received credit. THE STATION IN THE COMMUNITY Two Bedding Plant Meetings Held The UCONN -CAES Spring Bedding Plant Meetings co- organized and co- sponsored by Drs. Wade Elmer and Yonghao Li from CAES and Ms. Leanne Pundt from UCONN, were held on F ebruary 3 in the UConn campus in Torrington and on February 5 in Vernon.

ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Analytical Chemistry has two long -standing programs with the CT Department of Agriculture (DoAg) involving the analysis of feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds : Analysts : John Ranciato, Craig Musante Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in the late 1890s. Products for household pe ts and commercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from DoAg. Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn report findings to the product dealer and/or manufacturer. Results : From July 1, 20 14 to June 30, 2015, we received and completed analysis of 47 feed samples. These samples are analyzed for parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, fiber, and select micronutrients. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigation al allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 15 (32%). Analytical findings are turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response . Joint funding with the Department of Agriculture is currently being sought from the FDA; this would expand the feeds program and bring certain aspects under ISO accreditation. 92 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 b. Fertilizers : Analysts : John Ranciato, Craig Musante Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875. Products from residential and commercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from DoAg. Analytical results are reporte d to DoAg, who in turn reports findings to the product dealer and product manufacturer. Results : From July 1, 201 4 to June 30, 201 5, we received and completed analysis of 71 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Associatio n of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 40 (56%). Analytical findings are turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response. c. Analysis of seaweed samples A collaborative project with the DoAg Bureau of Aquaculture has continued into a third year and involves the chemical and microbial analysis of seaweed being grown commercially in CT for sale to restaurants. Chemical analysis happens in the Department of Analytical Chemistry; the microbial analysis happens at the Department of Public Health (DPH) Laboratory Environmental Microbiology Section. During the current reporting period, 2 samples were received for analysis of pesticides by both liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC -MS; GC -MS), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and select heavy metals. Results are then reported to DoAg Aquaculture staff for a decision on regulatory action. All samples analyzed by our Department since program inception have been judged suitable for sale on the basis of chemical analysis results. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 93 2. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted for the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to public s afety. The results of these analyses are reported in a timely fashion and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues deemed unacceptable by regulatory agencies. a. Pesticide residues in food : Analysts : Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer, Kittipath Prapayotin - Riveros, Michael Cavadini Summary : As part of a Market basket program, we determine concentrations of agrochemicals in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale i n CT and assure compliance with established tolerances. Market basket survey samples are collected by DCP Inspectors and results are published in an annual Station B ulletin available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . Results : From July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, a total of 84 samples of food were analyzed for pesticide residues. Of the 84 samples analyzed, 46 (54.8 %) contained a total of 119 residues. Of these 46 samples, there were 3 samples each containing one violative residue. There were 52 different pesticide active ingredients found at an average concentration of 0.143 \u00b5g/Kg , and the average number of pestic ide residues per sample was 2.58 . With US FDA funding and support, the Department has received new equipment and is now 4 years into a 5-year effort to bring the Market basket program under the scope of ISO 17025 Accreditation. Impact : The Department of Analytical Chemistry's Market basket program serves as the sole surveillance and monitoring effort in the state, assuring that the food supply within CT is safe and free from chemical adulteration. b. Miscellaneous samples Analyst : John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015 , 63 consumer complaint samples were submitted for analytical requests such as foreign material identification, as well as possible product adulteration or tampering. For some samples, we rely on the expertise in other CAES D epartments, including Plant Pathol ogy & Ecology, Entomology, and Forestry & Horticulture. 94 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content Analyst : Terri Arsenault Goal : To provide % ethanol content for label registration and taxation purposes. Summary : We analyzed 4 products such as beers, wines, and liquors for ethanol content. Results were submitted to DCP in support of label registration. b. Beverage authenticity Analyst : Terri Arsenault Goal : To determine if products offered to customers at CT establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : 24 alcoholic products were examined for authenticity; 11 samples were found to not match the chromatographic profile of comparison authentic samples. These results are returned to the DCP Division of Liquor Control, who determine appropriate regulatory action. A conductivity meter that was supplied of Liquor Control inspectors for field determination of vodka authenticity continues to be successfully used. Elemental profile as determined by inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry or optical emission spectroscopy is now also used during adulteration investigations. 4. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) Analysts : Joseph Hawthorne, Brian Eitzer Goals : To ascertain the extent of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. Common matrices include soils, water, oil, sediments, and surface wipes. Additional matrices this year included paint chips, cardboard, and Speedy- Dry. Summary : From July 1, 2014 t o June 30, 2015, 25 samples were analyzed from pre -existing sites and/or spill locations in CT. Sample collection is performed by the DEEP PCB Enforcement Unit as part of mandatory long -term monitoring of these areas. The findings are reported to DEEP fo r assessment of continued regulatory compliance. b. Analysis of pesticides Analysts : Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault, Michael Cavadini Goals : To ascertain pesticide concentration associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Additional samples are analyzed in support of DEEP surface and groundwater monitoring programs. Matrices include soils, waters, oils, sediments, and surface wipes. Water, vegetation , and soil samples can now be analyzed for glyphosate using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Summary : From July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, 137 samples wer e analyzed under this program. Impact : The analysis of samples collected from surveillance programs for soil, surface/groundwater and sediments, as well as those that are part of active misapplication The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 95 investigations, enable DEEP to enforce current state a nd federal regulations on pesticides and to promote overall environmental health. c. Analysis of lobster tissue for synthetic pyrethroids Analysts : Walter Krol, Jason C. White Goals : To determine the presence and quantity of synthetic pyrethroids in lobster tissues co llected from Long Island Sound. Summary : After preliminary results from a DEEP -funded University of CT Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering (CESE) study could not be confirmed by our laboratory, DEEP initiated the formation of a steering committee which includes members of CAES, CESE, several divisions of DEEP, EPA, the Pyrethroid Working Group, and a representative from Earthplace . Under the auspices of this committee, both CAES and CESE are jointly conducting a full method validation study. The study is currently underway , and once complete, the validated method will be applied to lobsters collected from Long Island Sound. 5. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples for FDA Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Analysts : Craig Musante, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Christina Robb, Walter Krol, Kitty P.- Riveros, Joseph Hawthorne, Michael Cavadini , Jason C. White Summary : The Department of Analytical Chemistry continues its work with the FDA under a cooperative a greement that enables research and analyses on chemical contaminants such as pesticides, poisons, toxins, and heavy metals in food. The Department is currently participating in an FDA -led multi- lab validation of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method to determine arsenic and 9 other heavy metals in a range of food matrices . Staff scientists are also participating in FDA - lead Working Groups on the mycotoxins and chemotherapeutics; in both cases, the goals of the Working Groups are to develop more sensitiv e and robust analytical methods in food for the contaminants of concern. Lastly, Dr. Brian Eitzer and Ms. Terri Arsenault are both serving as instructors for FDA courses on LC -MS and GC -MS FERN methods, respectively; these training courses are open to FDA staff and other state laboratories. Impact : The Department 's participation in FERN has resulted in the acquisition of significant funding to support staff, including post -doctoral researchers, and highly sensitive analytical equipment . In addition to being used for FDA work, those unique resources are also directly applied to a range of state programs in a manner that directly benefit s the citizens of Connecticut. b. Analysis of samples for municipalities and other groups Analysts : Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Walter Krol, Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, Department staff analyzed 250 samples for municipalities or other groups. As in previous years, this included the analysis of soils from schools (Foodcorps) and various other locations (community gardens, municipal property) for heavy metals. In addition, we provided analytical support for a Quinnipiac University project analyzing for organic contam inants in a local stream. We 96 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 also analyzed a number of toy cars for the New Haven Department of Health. These toy samples were from the home of a child with high blood levels; our analysis showed lead at concentrations well below the regulatory limit. Impact: The findings of low levels of lead in painted toys allow environmental health inspectors to focus their investigation on other potential sources of contamination. In addition, analysis of soil samples on elementary school grounds allows staff to ma ke appropriate decisions about the location of student vegetable gardens. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Analyses related to pollinator decline - Department of Entomology Analyst : Brian Eitzer Summary : In research projects conduct ed in collaboration with Dr. Kim Stoner in the Department of Entomology , as well as State Bee Inspector Mr. Mark Creighton, we determine concentrations of agro chemicals in pollen, bees, and wax to ascertain possible relationship to bee health and colony de cline . We have developed high resolution LC-MS methods for low level detection of specific pesticides of concern , including neonicotinoid insecticides. During the July 1, 2014 to June 1, 2015 period, 174 samples were analyzed during the current period. See the Research section below for additional details . b. Analysis of pesticides in tobacco leaves - Valley Laboratory Analysts : Brian Eitzer Summary : A cooperative project with Dr. James LaM ondia at the Valley Laboratory has continued into a third year; the focus is on assessing application strategies that will reduce pesticide residues on tobacco leaves while providing protect ion from pathogens of concern. More information on this project c an be found in the Valley Laboratory section of this document. c. Elemental Analysis - Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology Analyst : Craig Musante Summary : In conjunction with Dr. Wade Elmer of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology , element al analysis of 204 samples of various crops grown in the presence or absence of nanoscale micronutrient amendments was conducted. Additional details on this project can be found in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology section of this document. 7. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES Analysts : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Joseph Hawthorne , Christina Robb, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Michael Cavadini Summary : Annual proficiency testing samples related to our FDA FERN work, FDA ISO Accreditation program , as well as performance evaluation samples for our polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) regulatory program and the AAPCO Check Sample program (pesticide formulations) were completed during the reporting period. All of these testing regimes serve to ensure accura te and reliable laboratory results. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research projects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental studies. Research is often stimulated by our service work and in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. F OOD SAFETY Improvement of analytical methods for determination of pesticide residues in food The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 97 Investigators : Brian Eitzer , Terri Arnab Mukherjee, Jason C. Wh ite Summary : We continue to participate in or lead several FDA coordinated research projects. Two of these projects involve validating the use of high resolution LC -MS platforms for screening applications, including both pesticides and FDA FERN methods for poisons and toxins. We have received a new GC -MS system this year and will be comparing its performance in chemical ionization mode to that of the GC-MS/MS system for the detection of pyrethroids in seafood. We are also continuing our pursuit of ISO Accreditation, which will be required for future FDA FERN participation. Last ly, we are involved in a n FDA -lead research project on the use of LC -MS platforms for the detection of mycotoxins and chemotherapeutics in various food matrices. The overall go al of these projects is to develop robust and accurate methods that FDA could deploy as part of large- scale surveillance programs. Impact : The development and validation of new, more sensitive equipment and analytical techniques will enhance pesticide sur veillance activities in the state and serve to better protect the food supply against incidental or intentional adulteration. Project 2: Nanoparticle fate in agricultural systems Investigators : Craig Musante, Roberto De La Torre- Roche, Joseph Hawthorne, Alia Servin, Jason C. White Summary : Nanomaterials (NM) have at least one dimension less than 100 nm (one billionth of a meter), and this small size results in unique physical and chemical properties not observed at the bulk scale. Nanotechnology takes advantage of these unique and useful nanoscale properties. Current nanomaterial use is ubiquitous; over 1600 NM -containing products are commercially available in areas such as electronics, health -care, cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Of special concern to our laboratory is the use of nanomaterials in agriculture, including pesticide and fertilizer formulations. Also of concern is the presence of nanomaterials in biosolids, which are often applied to agricultural fields to ai d plant growth. From a regulatory perspective, nanomaterials are largely considered to have equivalent risk to that of corresponding bulk materials. However, recent data out of our laboratory and others ha ve suggested that this assumption may not be true and that NM may behave differently in a toxicologically significant fashion with respect to food safety . A lack of understanding regarding the fate and effects of nanomaterials in agricultural systems is troublesome given that food crop contamination cou ld be a significant uncharacterized pathway of human exposure. Two USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) competitive grants are funding research to define the impact (physiological and molecular toxicity, accumulation) of NMs on food crops, with a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plants. Recent work has shown that certain nanoparticles transfer through a terrestrial food chain (soil to zucchini to crickets to spiders) at significantly greater levels th an does the equivalent bulk material. A visiting Post- doctoral Fellow from the University of Parma is conducting a transcriptomic study of several crop species exposed to copper, cerium , and lanthanum metal oxide nanoparticles in an effort to isolate sens itive biomarkers of exposure. Such biomarkers could then be 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 employed on a wide scale to provide meaningful information on NM distribution and effects in the environment. Additional c o-investigators on this work include colleagues at the University of Massachusetts, Texas A & M University, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry , Southern Illinois University -Carbondale, University of Texas El Paso, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, The University of P arma in Italy, The Institute of Experimental Botany in the Czech Republic, Hasselt University in Belgium, and the University of Carthage in Tunisia. Impact : Our research has previously demonstrate d that the toxicity of nanomaterials to crop species can be significantly greater than that observed for the corresponding bulk material . Current investigations have also shown the nanomaterials may also transfer from one trophic level to the next, presenting significant potential for food chain contamination. L astly, molecular investigations are now being used to develop more sensitive endpoints of exposure and to provide more useful information in support of accurate and meaningful risk assessments. 2. E NVIRONMENTAL MONITORING /REMEDIATION Project 1: Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with weathered persistent organic pollutants (POPs) Investigators : Joseph Hawthorne, Nele Eevers (Hasselt University, Belgium), Jason C. White Summary : Endophytic bacteria are microorganisms that reside inside plants and are known to be important to crop metabolism and health. In a series of collaborative experiments with investigators at Hasselt University in Belgium, endophytic bacteria were isolated f rom zucchini cultivars that had previously been shown to accumulate significant quantities of weathered persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from soil. In pure culture, these bacteria were shown to have the ability to biodegrade DDE, a common persistent m etabolite of the legacy insecticide DDT. In field trials currently underway, zucchini plants were inoculated with these unique microorganisms prior to planting in DDE -containing soils. The ability of these microbes to promote plant growth and contaminant degradation is currently being assessed. Impact: The capacotu to degrade or accumulate weathered POPs is a unique ability seemingly restricted to C. pepo (zucchini/pumpkin). The current investigations are designed t o understand key plant -bacterial inter actions in an effort to optimize remedial potential . Project 2: Analysis of Pesticides in Connecticut Pollen - Baseline Survey Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology) Summary : We are continuing our research into how honey bees get exposed to pesticides during foraging. As honey bees forage, they can be expose d to the pesticides used in residential areas or agricultural fields from which they collect pollen and nectar. During the past year, we have used traps to collect pollen balls from the bees as they return to the hive. These traps are The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 99 set out for the entir e season, with pollen collection occurring at approximately two -week intervals. As might be expected, during the course of a season, pollen bees collect pollen from a wide variety of pla nts which can bloom at different times. The pesticide load in the pollen of those plants can also vary widely , both in which pesticides are found and how much of them are found. Long -term studies such as this provide baseline inform ation , which allow s us to understand how honey bee pesticide exposure changes with time. Impact : Honey bees are being exposed to pesticides. Long -term monitoring from the same hives and locations provides baseline data that can be used to assess temporal trends and changes in pesticide exposure. Project 3: Pollination security for fruit and vegetable crops in the N ortheast Investigators: Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology), Anne Averill (Un iversity of Massachusetts), Frank Drummond (University of Maine), Bry an Danforth (Cornell University ). Summary : We are par ticipating in a multi- year study to examine pollination security in specialty crops. Four crops are being studied : apples in New York, cranberries in Massachusetts, blueberr ies in Maine, and cucurbits in Connecticut. Among the factors being examined for each crop is the role of pesticides. Samples of bees (multiple species), plant materials (nectar, pollen, flowers), and bee- collected pollen are being analyzed for pesticid es. These results are then analyzed along with the other factors being monitored to assess synergistic or antagonistic effects. Impact : Knowledge of pesticide exposure to pollinator communities and the resulting ability of those communities to pollinate crops can be used to g uide farmers in the proper use of pesticides to insure not only crop pollination but also protection from pests and pathogens. Project 4: Quantifying exposure of honey bees and bumble bees to neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen of or namental plants Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology), Dr. Richard Cowles (Valley Laboratory), Dr. Douglas Dingman (Department of Entomology) Summary : This is a new project that has multiple funding sources. The potential harm to pollinators caused by neonicotinoid pesticides is a topic that has been the focus of much recent attention. This attention has led to public calls for \"bee safe\" plants. The nursery and bedding plant industry is concerned because they use some of these compounds to protect their plants but need to sell those plants to the public. However, there is a dearth of information on which nursery plants are visited by pollinators and how much of these pesticides may be present in the nectar and pollen of these plants under current agricultural practices. This study aims to fill this information gap, studying both the visitation of pollinators to nursery plants and examining how much of these pesticides can get into the nectar and pollen of model ornamenta l plants. Impact : Knowledge of which plants are being visited by pollinators and the concentration of pesticides in those plants will allow the nursery and bedding plant industries to modify their pesticide use practices in ways that will mitigate the imp act on pollinators. 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/ Internet Inquiries : We receive approximately 200- 250 call s and emails from the public each year requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and the environment, heavy metals in food, soils, a nd consumer products. In some instances, we refer the caller to a more appropriate CAES department or state agency. Station Bulletins and Fact Sheets : Station Bulletins are typically published annually by our Department. These bulletins are available i n printed form and on the CAES website ( www.ct.gov/CAES ). They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. Fact sheets are articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widesprea d interest. These are also available on our website and in printed form. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 101 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and plant regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Kenneth A. Welch Insect Information Office (IIO) . Staff in this office answer insect -related questions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations . All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a majo r applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, wood- boring insects, invasive insects, and honey bees and other bee pollinators. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricu ltural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part, to ensure our nursery industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Connecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting 48,000 full and part -time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conduct a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests, some o f regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Cooperative A gricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. In addition, we participate in a Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program supported by the USDA. For plant diseases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plant Disease Diagnosti c Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation (and any defoliation by other insects) and a gypsy moth egg mass survey. The results of our plant and forest surveys for 2014 may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summaries of our regulatory activities. The Office of the State Entomologist and the Apiary Inspector also oversee registration of beekeepers and inspectio n of honey bee colonies for pests and disease. The staff of the Department of Entomology also take a lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events and at health and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celebrating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, the Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Norwalk - Wilton Tree Festival, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. During January of 2015, the Department of Entomology moved into the newly renovated and expanded Jenkins -Waggoner Laboratory. The Insect Information Office in the new addition has a laboratory, office, public reception, and a climate controlled collections room. The Insect Information Office (with summer assistant Ellie Clark) . 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Service Activities Insect Information Office: Dr. Gale Ridge assisted by Ellie Clark oversees the Insect Information Office. Insect identification services date back to nearly the inception of the institution startin g with the first Annual Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that it was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insects.....and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultur al Science for the use and advantage of the citizens of Connecticut .\" Since 2000, there has been a trend from traditional communication such as mail and visitors to phone/cell phone calls and the internet. Phone calls remain the primary citizen contact. The office serves private citizens, pest management professionals, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, charities, manufacturing, the hospitality industry, housing authoritie s, museums, municipalities, libraries, state government, and the media. Between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015, the insect inquiry office handled at least 8,549 recorded inquiries (Table 1). In addition, as part of the CAPS summer trapping program, Dr. R idge identified 8,000 bark beetles in the family Scolydidae. During the fall of 2014 there were unusually high yellowjacket and other wasp activity, due to an early dry spring allowing more over - wintering queens to survive through to nest building. There were 947 categories of inquiries including insects, arachnids, animals, use of pesticides, insect damage, general entomology, and horticultural issues. Of these, 32% were related to man and medical issues, 65% natural resources, 2% food related, and 1% undetermined. Bed and bat bug inquiries remain the leading inquiry with 2,701 (31%) of the identifications performed by the office (Table 2). In order of numbers, the second highest query were wasps and bees, then beetles which included inquiries about the emerald ash borer, followed by gypsy moth, white grubs, termites, and ticks. This year , there was an outbreak of the gypsy moth causing widespread defoliation of several species of Table 2. Number of bed bug inquiries from 1996 - 2015. Table 1. Number of inquiries from FY 2004 -2015. 050010001500200025003000 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 20140200040006000800010000 Gypsy moth caterpillars killed by Entomophaga maimaiga . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 103 trees, primarily oaks, throughout Connecticut. This was weather related , caused by two consecutive early dry springs during 2014 and 2015. This either prevented or reduced inoculation of the caterpillars by the spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Entomophaga maimaiga, which needs moisture to infect the insects. In addition to this, an incursion of winter moth in eastern Connecticut towns from Rhode Island compounded defoliation. In March 2015, Dr. Ridge identified the Southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann , a destructive pest of primarily pine, collected f rom Wharton Brook State Park on the North Haven -Wallingford town line. The office continued to lead in public outreach, introducing a new Spanish interpretation service. There were numerous state- and New England- wide presentations and training programs for bed bugs, the emerald ash borer, and the Asian longhorned beetle. The Connecticut Coalition Against Bed Bugs (CCABB), chaired by Dr. Ridge , continued to publish public education outreach material, provide a bilingual service, sponsor a bed bug bill board in Hartford, provide 550 statewide public transportation bus posters about bed bugs, and hold a bed bug forum number VIII, held in October 2014. The office continues to build collaborative relationships and led projects with local, state, and federal agencies, to better serve the needs of the citizens of Connecticut. With worldwide trade and travel increasing, we are at an increased risk of foreign plant species, plant diseases, and insect pests being introduced into the United States. The I nsect Inf ormation O ffice provides a vital service in the identification of new potential pests. CAPS and Forest Pest Programs: The Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey and Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Project (FPSOP), supported by the USDA -APHIS -PPQ and overseen by State Survey Coordinator Katherine Dugas and Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Victoria L. Smith, are two programs that provide for pest survey and educational outreach on the identification and risks posed by a number of potential invasive insects and plant diseases. With worldwide trade and travel increasing, we are at an increased risk of foreign plant species, plant diseases, and insect pests being introduced in the U.S. In Connecticut, the CAPS program has largely conducted surveys in nurseries, Christmas tree farms, state parks, and conservation and public lands. In 2015, CAPS is surveying for a number of oak and maple insect pests and the plant pathogen Phytoph thora ramorum . This includes the biosurveillance program for exotic beetles related to the emerald ash borer using the native Cerceris wasp . Additional grape and orchard commodity surveys are supported by the Farm Bill. The FPSOP program main objective is outreach and education about forest pests and also works with the national Don't Move Firewood Campaign an d Connecticut Master Gardeners. Bird and Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a par tnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Most maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff. Th e garden is open to the public Monday- Friday 8:30 a.m. -4:00 p.m., it is closed on the weekends and state holidays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut gardens. Plants are labeled for easy identification. The Bird & Butterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the \" Nature Conservancy Open Days Directory for New England. \" Jeffrey Fengler and Jane Canepa- Morrison o bserved 13 different butterfly species, 13 species of birds, and 15 other species around the garden on Plant Science Day August 6, 2014.

It consisted of a variety of presentations by Station Staff and the University of Connecticut Cooperator s on various aspects of research and findings of concern to foresters in the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, USDA -APHIS -PPQ, and the forest health community. Tia , and Pet er Trenchard participated in the Eastern Chapter of the Horticultural Inspection Society Systems Approach to Nursery Certification exercise on September 30 -October 1, 2014, at the Valley Lab of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (Windsor, CT) and Monrovia Nursery (Granby, CT). Thirty inspectors from nine states participated. On the evening of Sept. 30, participants met in the Gordon Taylor Auditorium of the Valley Lab, to discuss the goals of the exercise, and to meet our hosts at Monrovia, V ice-president Greg Schaan and production Manager Sali Borelli. At Monrovia on the morning of October 1, various teams were faced with mock situations in the nursery, such as pathogen finds or trace -backs, and they applied principles of the systems approach to each situation. At noon, teams met with Monrovia personnel, to discuss how the nursery would approach each situation. Following lunch at the Valley Lab, CAES researchers Dr. Sharon Douglas , Dr. Robert Marra , and Dr. James LaMondia discussed current findings on boxwood blight, development of best management practices, and management of the disease in nurseries. Participants also had the opportunity to examine actual infected boxwoods, to see the symptoms of disease first -hand. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 105 Research Activities Integrated Tick Management (ITM) Dr. Kirby C. Stafford, Dr. Scott C. Williams (Forestry & Horticulture), Dr. Goudarz Molaei (Environmental Sciences), and postdoctoral scientist Dr. Laura E. Hayes began the third year of a field study in Redding, CT, aimed at estimating the effectiveness of integrated and individual management strategies in red ucing tick populations and human exposures to tick -borne diseases in residential areas. Treatments in the ITM study are 1) natural product application (rodent bait box distribution and the spray applications of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anis opliae under product name -tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) populations and 3) a combined treatment with both natural product application on individual properties and deer population management. David Whitman (Connecticut Tick Control, LLC) and Dr. Anthony J. DeNicola (White Buffalo, Inc.) undertook natural product application and deer population management, respectively, within assigned residential areas. Heidi Stuber and Michael Short assisted with sampling of black -legged tick ( Peromyscus leucopus) populations in the four residential areas where the field experiment is being conducted. Heidi Stuber is assisting with the laboratory testing of field- collected samples of ticks an d white -footed mouse serum for evidence of pathogen exposure. Results from the first two years of the study showed the combined bait box and M. anisopliae applications reduced nymphal blacklegged tick populations on residential properties by an average of 78%. Effectiveness of deer population management and natural product application treatments, both alone and in combination on tick populations and disease parameters for the three years of interventions will be compiled and analyzed in the final project year. This project is funded by a cooperative agreement (i.e., grant) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the period from 2012 through 2016. Rodent Targeted Vaccine (RTV) A residential field study of oral Lyme disease bait targe ting the reservoir mouse and chipmunk hosts was begun in spring 2015 by Drs. Kirby C. Stafford, Scott C. Williams, and Goudarz Molaei working with U.S. Biologic Inc. The Lyme disease vaccine is an OspA based vaccine which has been shown to reduce the prev alence of infection in the rodent hosts and subsequently in the blacklegged tick population in the laboratory and an initial forest plot study. However, a new bait formulation has not been evaluated, especially in a residential setting. The bait is deliv ered in bait boxes to quantify delivery and consumption. There are 11 home sites receiving the RTV bait, 10 home sites receiving the bait and applications of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Met52), and 11 control (untreated properties) . Studies using the biomarker Rhodamine B in untreated bait in 2014 at the participating properties showed that the bait formulation was readily consumed by nearly 90% of the mice. Bait consumption in 2015 has been high. Blood samples from live -captured mice will be tested for response to the vaccine and ticks collected from the homes will be tested for the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi , and the pathogens that cause anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Impact : Lyme disease continues to be a major public health concern with around 300,000 cases in the United States each year. Integration of several tick reduction strategies and evaluation of new methods should help provide homeowners and small communities with information on ways to reduce tick numbers or the prevalence of infection sufficiently to reduce the risk of disease. Fig. Open bait box with the RTV bait 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Quantifying exposure of honey bees and bumble bees to neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen of ornam ental plants Neonicotinoid insecticides are controversial because of their capacity to move throughout the plant, including into pollen and nectar, and because several of the insecticides in this class, including imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, a nd dinotefuran, are highly toxic to bees. Although this group of insecticides has a very wide range of agricultural and landscape uses, considerable recent attention has been focused on use on nursery and bedding plants, including public protest demonstra tions at retailers of ornamental plants demanding labeling of plants treated with neonicotinoids. Nursery and greenhouse growers have not been able to respond to this public attention to neonicotinoid insecticides due to a lack of information about the ext ent to which these insecticides move into nectar and pollen when applied according to current industry practices. A multidisciplinary team of CAES scientists, Dr. Kimberly Stoner, Dr. Richard Cowles, Dr. Brian Eitzer, and Dr. Douglas Dingman, assisted by Dr. Alejandro Chiriboga of the University of Connecticut, are conducting several interrelated studies to fill this information gap. Among the studies being conducted are: measurement of imidacloprid in the pollen and nectar of rhododendrons treated according to current nursery practice, measurement of the effects of variation in rate and timing of application of neonicotinoids in the pollen of sunflowers and the nectar of milkweed (model plants for evaluating the movement and rate of decline of pesticide r esidues in herbaceous plants), and collection of pollen from bumble bee and honey bee colonies placed at three commercial nurseries in the state to evaluate pesticide exposure and to identify ornamental plants used by these bee species. These projects are funded by grants from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Horticulture Research Institute. Pollination of Pumpkin and Winter Squash in Farm Fields in Connecticut Pumpkin and winter squash require insect pollination i n order to set fruit. Female flowers are separate from male flowers, although both are borne on the same plant . Dr. Kimberly Stoner, assisted by Morgan Lowry and by seasonal workers, has measured pollen deposition on pumpkin or squash stigmas (female flower parts) on 67 sampling dates in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 on 20 different fields, including organic and non- organic farms, and farms with and without honey bee hives on site. According to the scientific literature, 1500 to 2000 pollen grains per stigm a are sufficient for complete fruit set and full fruit weight in pumpkins. Pollen deposition was higher than this range on all but one sampling date (at the Griswold Research Station in 2012) , in a field that was lost to a plant pathogen soon afterwards. In 8 trials at our 3 research farms, we have confirmed that supplementing the natural level of pollen deposition on pumpkin stigmas does not increase fruit set, fruit weight, or seed number (which is generally correlated with fruit weight). This confirms that the natural level of pollination we are getting in Connecticut pumpkin and winter squash is more than sufficient for good yield. The majority of bee visits to pumpkin and squash flowers were from bumble bees, particularly the common eastern bumble be e, Bombus impatiens , with 66% of overall visits, 64% of visits to male flowers, and 68% of visits to female flowers. The squash bee, Peponapis pruinosa , made 22% of visits to all flowers, 23% of visits to male flowers, and 16% of visits to female flowers, and the honey bee, Apis mellifera, made 11% of visits to all flowers, 9% of all visits to male flowers, and 21% of all visits to female flowers. We have found that the level of pollen deposition is more closely related to the number of visits of bumble bees to the female flowers than to several other variables (total bee visits, total bee visits to female flowers, and visits from the other two species), so we are currently studying behavior of bees at the female flowers in more depth using timed observations, video recording of bee behavior, and collecting bees of all three species visiting female flowers to determine how much pollen they are carrying. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 107 Documenting Bee Diversity in Connecticut Because of concerns about honey bee health and the recent drastic reduction in range and abundance of several species of bumble bees, there has been an upsurge in CAES projects surveying bee abundance and diversity in various environments, including our own research farms and campus, diversified vegetable farms, coastal habitats, and natural areas such as the White Memorial Conservation Center and the Salt Meadow Unit of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refu ge. As a result of this increased collection effort, Tracy Zarrillo, in collaboration with Dr. John Ascher of the National University of Singapore and the American Natural History Museum, Dr. Jason Gibbs of Michigan State University, and Dr. Kimberly Ston er of CAES, has identified 13 new state records - bee species not previously known to have been collected in Connecticut. In many cases, these new records indicate range extensions for species previously known from further south or west. In other cases, the lack of previous records may be due to previous taxonomic confusion, rarity, or restricted habitat. Protecting honey bee hives f rom American Foulbrood Disease Dr. Douglas W. Dingman, unassisted, continued investigations on the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, of the disease American of honey bees and Nosema ceranae . He continued examination of the genetic diversity (i.e., maternal lineage) of hon ey bees within Connecticut. P. larvae enolase proteins obtained from different genotypes, and demonstrating amino acid sequence differences, have been purified. Enzyme kinetic studies have shown no significant difference in activity rate (i.e., Km values) between enolases to support a role of the enzyme in virulence differences between the various genotypes. An investigation using qRT -PCR analysis of P. larvae enolase expression is being started. Mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis has continued for invest igation of honey bee genetic diversity in Connecticut. Results remain at five mitochondrial profiles identified (Type C1, C11, C12, M4, and O2) with Type C predominating. A correlation of hemolytic activity to genotype of the various P. larvae isolates ha s been performed. Findings differ from recently published reports and are in agreement with older reports on phenotype/species association. Detailed analysis, via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, is being used to differentiate larvae and Paenibacillus pulvifaciens . B. laterosporus strains have been identified as P. larvae in the literature and in stock repositories. This misidentification continues to cause confusion regarding phoenotype/genotype as sociations. Workshops to train Connecticut beekeepers on microscopic analysis of honey bees for nosema presence, and for estimation of infection rate within a bee hive (sequential sampling), are continuing. Entry of registered Connecticut beekeepers into t he multi -year database for years 2007 -2013 has been completed. Apiary registrations for 2014 ar e being added to the database. Impact: Diseases of honey bees, caused by bacterial and fungal infections (i.e., American foulbrood (AFB) and nosemosis, respect ively) cause considerable economic loss to beekeepers and agriculture. Beekeepers, by being aware of the prevalence of these two diseases, can make informed decisions on control and treatment procedures of the diseased hives. Advancing knowledge pertaini ng to P. larvae provides information to aid development of approaches for lowering the impact of these diseases. An understanding of maternal lineage of bees helps to associate phenotypic traits to genotypes. This will make tracking, selecting, and propa gating the genetics of healthy bees easier. 108 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Molecular identification of plant pollen Dr. Douglas W. Dingman, assisted by Brianna Williams (summer helper), has begun development of a simple molecular technique to easily identify plant pollen. This techni que will employee the use of in situ hybridization by hybridization probes constructed for a specific pla nt based on the DNA sequence of the ITS2 region in the plant 45S rRNA gene. Sequences for the 45S rRNA gene are being gleaned from the DNA database Ge nBank and are being aligned to identify regions of unique DNA sequence. Genomic DNA is being extracted from known plant samples for construction and testing of hybridization probes. Oligonucleotide primers are being devised and constructed for 45S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing for plants lacking this sequence data. Synthesis of digoxygenin labeled hybridization probes is being performed. Construction and testing of a hybridization probe for plants in the genus Rhododendron is being started. Impact: Accurate identification of plant pollen is important to many different scientific investigations. Development of an easy and accurate technique to identify pollen will improve the ability and speed with which plant pollen is identified. Currentl y, the standard method of identification is via microscopic examination and identification based on morphology by specially trained individuals. Biosurveillance for Exotic Buprestidae and the Wasp Watcher Program The wasp watcher program was begun in the spring of 2010. Cerceris fumipennis is a native digging wasp that provisions its nest with adult Buprestidae, including emerald ash borer. It is used as a tool for detecting and monitoring emerald ash borer and other invasive buprestid species by intercepting its prey as female wasps return to their nest. The wasp was responsible for the first detection of EAB in Con necticut, and remains our main tool for detecting and monitoring EAB in the state. We have also used this system to examine the native buprestid fauna of Connecticut, and have detected over 70 species of beetles with this tool. Of these, 21 are new state records. We are in the 6 th year of our Wasp Watcher program. Over the course of the program we have trained 125 watchers. In 2015, 36 watchers from previous years are signed -on, 10 for their 6th year, as well as 20 new watchers. Since 2010, Watchers have collected over 6,000 beetles and detected EAB in 15 new towns. Classical Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer Following the detection of EAB in Connecticut, the determination was made to join the USDA APHIS/ PPQ biological control program for EAB . In May 2013, Dr. Claire Rutledge began releases of the gregarious endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi and the egg Middlebury and Prospect, CT. The parasitoids are shipped from the USDA APHIS emerald ash borer mass- rearing Wasp Watchers at White Memorial Conservation Center pose with the first Emerald Ash Borer detected in Litchfield, CT in July 2014 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 109 facility in Brighton , Michigan. In 2014, two additional sites were added, Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, and Sherman, CT. In 2015, releases were started at two more site s, Cromwell Meadows, in Cromwell and White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield, and releases were continued at Sleeping Giant and Sherman. Middlebury and Prospect were moved to the next stage of the project, which is recovery to determine if the parasitoids have established in Connecticut. Phero mones invasive longhorn which attacks members of the cedar family. First detected in 2008 by scientists at CAES, the beetle is a secondary pest of highly stressed arborvitae. This project focused on the chemical ecology of C. rufipenne in collaboration with Drs. Chris Maier, CAES, Lawrence Hanks, UIUC, and Jocylane Millar, UC Riverside. A male -produced pheromone was identified in 2007. The pheromone 3R - hydroxyketone is shared by several members of the subfamily Cerambycinae, for whom it acts as an aggregation pheromone. A second compound was detected this spring in studies in Japan that synergizes the pheromone. Trapping in spring 2015, by Dr s. Rutledge and Maier has showed that the pheromone in combination with the synergist is high ly attractive to both male and female C. rufipenne . This data will allow better detection of this invasive beetle as it continues to expand its range in North America. Southern Pine Beetle in Connecticut, expansion of geographical and host range Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been a major pest of the timber industry in the south for years. It has been moving northwards from Honduras over the last 400 years. It was discovered in Long Island , NY last fall. A presentation to foresters from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection at the Forest Health Workshop in March 2015 resulted in discovery of SPB in Connecticut on March 17, 2015 on Red Pine in Wharton Brook State Park. Since this initial discovery, we have detected SPB across the state except Tolland and Windham Mattutuck State Forest in Plymouth, CT showing ash trees being killed by emerald ash borer. This forest is the site of a new research project examining the potential for combining pesticide treatment with biological control to preserve more mature trees than biological control alone. This project is in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts, Michigan State University and USDA APHIS.

We are currently working to understand some basic questions about this beetle in Connecticut, where is it, how successful it is at overwintering, how many generations does it have here, what host species it is attacking, and how it is interacting with those hosts. This work is being done in collaboration with Dr. Adriana Arango, CA ES. Surveys for Invasive Insects The brown marmorated stink bug ( Halyomorpha halys ) is an invasive bug from Asia that was first discovered in Connecticut in 2008. The nymphs and adults feed on many vegetable, fruit, nut, and legume crops. Severe crop damage from feeding by stink bugs largely has been restricted to t he mid - Atlantic region and the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Chris T. Maier, with assistance from Morgan Lowry, Tracy Zarrillo, Katherine Dugas, Gale Ridge, and Rose Hiskes, is investigating the di stribution of this invasive stink bug in Connecticut . Based on specimens brought or mailed to the Station and on those collected on the tree of heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ), they have determined that the stink bug has spread across Connecticut. This non -native stink bug now occurs in at least 118 towns. The abundance of stink bugs has increased steadily since 2008, and now the brown marmorated stink bug is considered to be a pest of fruit and vegetables grown in Connecticut. Other new finds by Dr. Maier include a Russian wood- boring sawfly ( Xiphydria ). The exotic sawfly was dead branch of black willow ( Salix nigra) that was collected in Canaan in 2014. The longhorned beetle, kindly identified by Serge Laplante, had been in the insect collection at the Experiment Station since 1989. The species was collected inside of a new house constructed with timber from the western United States. Apparently, the beetl e hitchhiked to Connecticut in lumber from the West. To date, no established populations of the beetle have been found in Connecticut. Wild Host s of the Spotted Wing Drosophila The invasive spotted wing drosophila ( Drosophila suzukii ) poses a serious th reat to many fruit crops. The larval infestations of this vinegar fly can destroy especially small fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, which are commercially grown on Connecticut farms. Over the past 4 years, Dr. Mai er, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, has sampled unsprayed fruits on wild and ornamental plants to discover which ones are infested by larvae. Thus far, they have reared adults of the spotted wing drosophila from 39 fruiting species distribute d in 19 plant families. Large larval infestations typically occur in the fruits of American The wild hosts of the spotted wing drosophila may contribute to the buildup of populations that later injure valuable agricultural crops. Impact of the Lily Leaf Beetle The lily leaf beetle ( Lilioceris lilii ) feeds upon Asiatic and Oriental lilies that are grown in flower gar dens in Connecticut. Both the larvae and the bright red adults of this European beetle devour the foliage and the flowers of lilies, sometimes killing plants. Although this invasive beetle prefers Asiatic true lilies, it Fig. Inner ba rk of a southern pine beetle infested red pine from Wharton Brook State Park. You can see adult galleries, larval galleries (round) and the blue stain fungi, which the beetle carries and helps to kill the tree. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 111 has spread from gardens into the wild where it now threatens the health of native lilies, such as the Canada lily ( Lilium canadense superbum ). Based upon the examination of populations of wild Canada lilies in July of 2014, the lily leaf beetle occurs in 83% of the wild stands. In 2014, Dr. Maier, with assistance from Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, conducted an experiment to measure the impact of feeding by the lily leaf beetle upon wild Canada lilies. In Canaan, Connecticut, they infested individual caged lilies with 10, 5, or 0 (control) newly hatched larvae in May and then recorded plant weight in late summer to reveal differences among experimental groups. Similar to the 2013 results, as few as five larvae sometimes defoliated individual plants. The f inal dry weight of plants was significantly higher in uninfested plants than in those provided with 10 or 5 larvae. Lilies initially infested with 10 larvae had a dry weight of only 24.4% of that of the controls, and those with 5 larvae had a weight of 55 .3% of the controls. The bulbs also showed a very similar trend in weight reduction. Thus, feeding by the lily leaf beetle has a severe negative effect upon the weight of wild Canada lilies, particularly those with higher larval density. Experiments are being planned to determine the effect of infestation upon the flowering and the surviva l of wild lilies . Cages with wild Canada lilies infested with the larvae of the lily leaf beetle. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut Dr. Maier and his assistants continued to make progress in their long- term study of the identity, the distribution, and the host range of longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae). To gather biological data, they 112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 capture native and non -native wood- borers in traps baited with sex pheromones or host volatiles, rear adults from wood infested by larvae, collect adults on flowers, and examine label data on adult specimens in museums. In 2013 -2014, they ascertained the seasonal flight activity of over 25 common species by capturing adults in bait ed traps and on flowers. To date, they have reared 92 species of longhorned from dead wood; the rearings have provided new state records for Connecticut and many new host records . They also have developed a database, which now has over 15,200 entries. B iological data compiled in this database will assist in developing management plans for destructive species of longhorned beetles. Ultimately, Dr. Maier will produce an annotated checklist to the longhorned beetles of Connecticut.

NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulatory services are coordinated and conducted through the Office of the State Entomologist, whose members are State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford, Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Victoria Smith, Plant Inspectors Peter Trenchard, Stephen Sandrey, Jeffrey Fengler, and Tia Blevins, Apiary Creighton, and State Survey Coordinator Katherine Dugas . Nursery Inspection and Certification Two-hundred two nurseries were certified to conduct intra - and interstate business. There were 697 nursery inspections during the growing season. Nursery Insects and Diseases The most important diseases and pests foun d in nurseries (in order of prevalence) were aphids on various trees and shrubs, boxwood leaf miner, imported willow leaf beetle, and lily leaf beetle. Japanese Beetle Certification to Canada Eight Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 35,686 plants to Canada in 2014. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 113 Nursery Dealer Permits Nursery dealer permits were issued to 182 firms. One -hundred fifty of these companies operate individual outlets. The remai ning businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 597 outlets. Phytosanitary Certificates Two-hundred seventy nine phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to destinations outside the United States: Product Quantity Apples (Cartons) 6,000 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas) (# Bags) 262 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas) (Kilos) 9 Chinese Tree Peony (plants) 30 Greenhouse plants Rhizomes 122 Cuttings 102 Nursery stock Unrooted cuttings 231 Plants (B and B) 19,623 Bare root plants 14,773 Orchids (plants) 2,845 Perennials Bare root plants 1,037 Potted plants 12 Seeds (bags) 335 Seeds (kilos) 24 Seeds (pallets) 10 Seeds (vials) 1 Tobacco Bales 52,306 Bundles 25,946 Cartons 33,900 Pounds 100 Walnut shells (bags) 3,717 Walnut shells (drums) 332 Special Inspections Six inspections were made for 48 individual plants to assist homeowners moving out of state.

There were two PPQ 525 Permits (Permit to move soil) approved in CT. There were three Controlled Import Permits issued. Post Entry Quarantine In 2014, there were three facilities approved for Post Entry Quarantine. Boxwood Blight Boxwood blight was d etected at one nursery on plants that originated in North Carolina. Plants were destroyed and the area disinfested. No boxwood blight was detected at any production nursery on plants originating in CT. Home owners continue to report boxwood blight on pl ants in landscapes. Efforts continue to educate landscapers about boxwood blight and its consequences. Chrysanthemum White Rust In 2014, we inspected 133,855 plants for CWR, caused by Puccinia horiana. No positives were detected. Gypsy Moth We observed defoliation due to Gypsy Moth on 1,337 acres, mostly in New Haven County, in 2014. In November and December 2014, a gypsy moth egg mass survey will be conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7 -mile grid (102 sites) throughout Connecticut . Asian Longhorned Beetle We conducted 120 inspections of 10,007 trees in all counties of Connecticut for presence or signs of ALB infestation. No evidence of ALB was found. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid and Hemlock Scale This pest has been present in CT for many years, and continues to cause patchy damage and decline among the remaining population of hemlocks. Statewide in 2014, 186 acres were affected by HWA. Scale insects, such as elongate hemlock scale and circular scale, are increasing in some areas. Over 9,146 acres statewide were affected by elongate hemlock scale. Ramorum Leaf Blight ( Phytophthora ramorum ) There forward actions involving P. ramorum in CT in 2014. Potentially infested host material was shipped to many private home owners. A total of nine samples were collected; one was found to be positive. All positive materials were destroyed by disposal in the municipal waste stream, which leads to incineration. Daylily Rust During 2014 we sur veyed daylilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of daylily rust, caused by Puccinia hemerocallidis. Seventy six inspections (67,322 plants) were conducted. Spotted Lantern Fly There was one trace- forward action involving spotted lantern fly ( Lycorma delicatula) . Stone and stone products from an area where SLF had been detected were inspected for presence of egg masses. Marble, slate, and granite stones were unpacked, carefully moved, and examined. Numerous dead brown marmorated stink bugs wer e found. Host plants of SLF in areas adjacent to stone yards were also inspected. Emerald Ash Borer Emerald ash borer has been detected in six of eight counties; the quarantine for this insect was extended statewide to encompass all of Connecticut in December 2014. Detections efforts include trapping using purple panel traps and monitoring of Cerceris colonies. During aerial survey, we mapped 2,456 acres defoliated by EAB, and expect acreage and mortality to increase in the coming months and years. Map of the distribution of EAB detected by town as of June 30, 2015. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 115 Map of the forest health aerial survey for 2014 noting detectable defoliation in Connecticut by the emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, winter mot h, elongate hemlock scale, among others . Apiary Inspection There are currently one thousand eighty registered beekeepers maintaining 6,400 hives. In 2014, nine hundred fourteen hives were inspected. American foulbrood was detected in six hives; these were destroyed by burning. Colony inspection determined Varroa mite infestation and the viral complex associated with Varroa infestation as the primary reason for colony mortality. CT beekeepers continue to lose colonies overwinter in higher numbers; the Bee Informed Winter Loss report for CT in 2014 was 39.45%. These losses are slightly higher than regional and nationwide trends. The viral pathogens that cause deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and even the rare chronic bee paralysis virus (CPBV) were detected in Connecticut as part of the USDA Honey Bee Pests and Diseases Survey. Due t o high winter losses in 2014, local beekeepers struggled to replace losses with package bees from southern states. Despite these challenges, beekeeping interest is still strong with over 700 new beekeepers being trained this winter. There were one hundre d four Apiary Certificate of Health Inspections performed. Three certificates were issued for export out of Connecticut , and one hundred one certificates for interstate movement of honey bees. Forest Health Survey During the summer and autumn of 2014, we examined 51 permanent, one -acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determ ined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long- term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to refl ect increasing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. This year is the final year of this long -term study; forest health plots will be replaced by short - term (5 year) plots to examine the death/replacement of trees due to emerald ash borer. Emerald Ash Borer Gypsy Moth Winter Moth 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Asian Longhorned Beetle Asian Longhorned Beetle was a target in the Wood Boring/Bark Beetle survey, through the CAPS Program in 2014. Visual surveys for signs of ALB were conducted at numerous locations statewide. We examined many thousands of trees in CT for signs of infestation. In addition, insects submitted by arborists and homeowners as possible ALB have been examined. All surveys and identifications, thus far, have been negat ive. About 100 inquiries from citizens have been answered via email concerning ALB ( CAES.StateEntomologist@ct.gov ). White spotted sawyer and western conifer seed bug are most frequently accused of being ALB. Locust Leaf Miner The locust leafminer ( primarily a pest of black locust. Adults skeletonize and eat holes in the leaves; whereas, larvae mine the tissue between the upper and lower -leaf surface (mining damage is the most destr uctive). Under outbreak conditions, whole hillsides turn gray or brown, often suggesting fall color change. Outbreaks of the locust leafminer are generally more spectacular than destructive. In 2014, slightly over 460 acres were affected by locust leafmi ner, in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties. Winter Moth Damage due to feeding by winter moth larvae has been concentrated in coastal New London County, and continues to increase. Over 7,440 acres were affected in 2014. Parasitoids of winter moth have been released in this area, but their effectiveness in reducing populations has not been significant as yet; a lag time of up to 5 y ears is expected. Thousand Cankers Disease With a limited walnut resource in Connecticut , there is no monitoring program for Thousand Cankers Disease, even though this disease is the subject of a number of newly - enacted quaranti ne regulations for many states. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 1 17 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES I. Environmental Chemistry (Joseph Pignatello) A. Sorption of Contaminants to Envir onmental Particles 1. Interactions of Triazine Herbicides with P yrogenic Carbonaceous Materials. Triazine herbicides are used world -wide in agriculture to control broadleaf and grassy weeds. They have low to moderate tendency to adsorb to soil , moderate solubility in water, and low volatility, making them vulnerable to leaching. In the U.S., triazine herbicides, especially atrazine, simazine and prometon, are frequently detected in ground and surface waters at concentrations up to several hundred microg rams per liter. Exposure to some triazine herbicides can lead to adverse human health and ecosystem effects, including hormone disruption (atrazine) and damage to testes, kidneys, and thyroid (simazine). Effective approaches for mitigating the leaching o f triazine s from agricultural fields are clearly needed. Biochar, which is made by anaerobic pyrolysis of biomass wastes , has attracted attention as a soil amendment for reducing the physical and biological availabilities of soil -borne chemicals, among ot her functions . Because of its high porosity, biochar addition to soils increases adsorption of herbicide compounds, which can reduce their leaching , but also decrease their efficacy in weed control. Chars are also naturally present in soil as the charred products of fires. The objective of this study was to systematically probe key physical -chemical properties of the biochar and key electronic and steric properties of the triazine herbicides that govern the overall rate and extent of adsorption. The study was aided by the use of reference compounds and reference ad sorbents. In one study ( Xiao and Pignatello, Water Research, 2015, 80, 179- 188) adsorption of triazine herbicides and several reference hetero cyclic aromatic amines from water onto a temperature series of hardwood biochars (300 - 700 oC, labelled B300 out ratio , O/C atomic ratio , mean minimum aromatic fused ring size, surface area, microporosity (0-2 nm effective but correlated well with a sum of microporosity and mesoporosity (Figure 1) . Steric effects were evident by the negative influence of solute molecular volume on adsorption rate. Adsorption rate maximized for the biochar with the greatest mesoporosity- to-total- porosity ratio, suggesting that mesopores are important for facilitating diffusion into pore networks. The cationic forms of amines adsorb more slowly than the neutral forms . To further probe steric and electronic effects, adsorption on a biochar (B400) was compared to adsorption on graphite \u2014a nonporous reference material with an unhindered, unfunctionalized graphene surface\u2014 in comparison with reference compounds (benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, quinoline and 1,3-triazine). Relative to benzene, the surface normalized adsorption of triazine herbicides was disfavored on B400 (favored on graphite) by 1119 kJ/mole, depending on herbicide and concentration. It is estimated that steric suppression of B400 adsorption comprises 6 kJ/mol of this difference, the remainder being the difference in polar electronic effects. Based on the behavior of the reference amines, the difference in polar effects is dominated by electron donor -acceptor (EDA) interactions with sites on polyaromatic surfaces, Fig. 1 Experimental versus predicted values of the reduced biochar carbon -normalized distribution coefficient K b-C,r by the weighted sum of micro porosity mesoporosity 101102103104105106107108101102103104105106107108 1:1 line Benzene NaphthaleneSymbols open, 0.001 filled, Cr = 0.01 Atrazine QuinolineObserved Kb-C,r Predicted Kb-C,r118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 which are more electropositive and/or more abundant on graphite. Overall, our results show that mesoporosity is critical, that adsorption rate is a function of solute molecular size an d charge, that steric effects in the solute largely suppress equilibrium adsorption, and that EDA forces play a role in triazine polar interactions with the biochar. 2. +- Interactions Between (Hetero -)aromatic Amine Cations and Graphitic Surfaces. A study was done on triazine herbicides and industrial compounds of a class of ionizable compounds known as hetero cyclic 2015, 49, 906914 ). We found that these compounds at pH values where they are cation ic can act as acceptors in forming + electron donor -acceptor (EDA) interactions with the electron- rich, polyaromatic carbonaceous encompass biochar, black carbon, and graphene. The + EDA interactions combine a cation force with a EDA force resulting from charge polarization of the ring's quadrupole. Adsorption on a biochar and reference adsorbent graphite was conducted of triazine herbicides, substituted anilines, heterocycli c aromatic amines, as well as amines whose charge is insulated from the aromatic ring. When normalized for the hydrophobic effect (expulsion of nonpolar molecules from water) , the adsorption increased with decreasing pH as the amines became ionized, even on graphite which has no significant fixed or va riable charge. A potential cationic acceptor (quinolinium ion) was competitively displaced more effectively by the acceptor 2,4 -dinitrobenzene than by the donor naphthalene. The maximum electrostatic potential of organocations computed with density functional theory was found to be a strong predictor of the + EDA interaction free energy component (Figure 2) . The + EDA interaction was disfavored by electropositive alkyl substituents and charge delocalization into additional rings. Amines whose charge was insulated from the ring fell far out of the correlation (more positive free energy). Identifying and characterizing this novel + EDA interaction on PCMs will help in predicting the fate of organocations in both natural and engineered systems. 3. Competitive Sorption Used to Probe Strong Hydrogen Bonding Sites for Weak Organic Acids on Carbon Nanotubes. In previous papers we proposed that exceptionally strong H -bonds, known as ()CAHB, form between weak acid groups on a solute and acidic carb oxyl or hydroxyl groups on a surface. These bonds are known as negative charge -assisted hydrogen bonds, ( )CAHBs . The reaction leading to their formation can be depicted as A + H+ + O-surf = (A HO-surf). Weak acid compounds are us ed in many technological, commercial , and agricultural applications , and their adsorption to carbonaceous surfaces often plays an important role in their fate, hazardous effects, and remediation in the environment. This paper advances understanding of the ()CAHB for ionizable compounds on carbonaceous surfaces through the use of various techniques including competitive adsorption experiments . In this study (Li, Gamiz, Wang, Pignatello, and Xing, Environ. Sci. Tech nol. 2015, 49, 14091417 ), we employed competition adsorption and other types of experiments to show that sorption of AH on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be described conceptually by a dual specific/non- specific domain model, where one domain involves ( )CAH B sites that can become saturated. The CNTs included carboxyl -enriched 600 2. The change in the + EDA component of the total Gibbs free energy of adsorption of organic amines on graphite as a function of their electrostatic potential Ep,N computed at nitrogen. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 119 (C-CNT), hydroxyl -enriched (H -CNT), and observed in single- solute adsorption, including the stoichiometric release of hydroxide upon sorption of carboxyate or phenolate anions, were consistent with trends in the previous studies and pointed to the formation of ()CAHB. It was shown that 3,4- dinitrophenolate formed ( )CAHB more efficiently than 2,6- dichloro- 4- nitrophenolate due to alleviation of st eric hindrance to approach by the ortho chlorines. Competition against a ( )CAHB -capable target compound was greater when the competitor was also ( )CAHB - capable than when it was not (e.g., benzoate as target vs 3,4-dinitrophenolate or nitrobenzene as competitor; phthalate as target vs methyl benzoate or p-tolyl acetate as competitor) (Figure 3). The findings will contribute to a better understanding of adsorption mechanism of ionizable compounds on carbonaceous materials in both single - and multi- solute systems. Figure 3. Competition experiments comparing displacement efficiency (DE) of two co -solutes against a target on C -CNT at pH 4 .0 and pH 6.0. The competitors are 4- methylbenzoate (MBA) and p -tolyl acetate (PTA). In each pair of graphs, solid lines in the upper graph are best -fit exponential [y = a + exp(bx+c)] or linear [y = a + bx] curves, and in the corresponding lower graph are the first derivatives of those curves . B. Bioavailability of Contaminants in Environmental Particles . 1. Bioacessibility of PAHs in Fuel Soot Assessed by an in vitro Gastrointestinal Model: Effect of Including an Absorptive Sink . Soot or black carbon is a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuel s and biomass . It distributes widely in soil and sediments and is especially abundant in areas affected by frequent vegetation fires or near sources of intense fossil fuel burning . Soot, especially fuel soot, often contain s high levels of PAHs, a well -known class of carcinogens . Soot can enter the human digestive tract via dermal contact with soil or other environmental particles and then hand- to-mouth activities. Young children are especially susceptible to soil ingestion by this route; the amount of soil ingested by 95% of children in developed countries is estimated to be up to 200 mg/d. Other routes of oral exposure to soot -borne PAHs include Sorbed competitor (mmol/kg)0 20 40 60 (mmol/kg)0 20 40 60 80 MBPh vs PTApH = 4.0120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 consumption of charred particles in grilled and fried food, intake of soil or dust particles clinging to vegetables, and the swallowing of expectorant containing inhaled atmospheric soot particles. The level of expos ure to PAHs through ingestion of soot will depend on local sanitation conditions, PAH concentrations, and bioavailab ility of PAHs in the soot within the digestion tract . In this study ( Zhang, Pignatello, Tao and Xing, Environ. Sci. Technol. 2015, 49, 39053912), we investigated the bioaccessibility of 11 PAHs in a composite fuel soot sample using an in vitro digestive model that included s ilicone sheet as an absorpti ve sink during the small intestinal digestion stage. The sheet was meant to simulate the passive transfer of PAHs in lumen fluid across the small intestinal epithelium , was postulated to pr omote desorption PAHs from the soot by steepening the soot-fluid concentration gradient. We show that the presence of silicone sheet during a 4- h default digestion time significantly increased the apparent bioaccessi ble fraction ( Bapp, %), defined as the sum in the sheet and digestive fluid relative to the total PAH determined . The ability to increase B app for most PAHs leveled off above a sheet -to-soot ratio of 2.0 g per 50 mg, indicating that the sheet is an effective absorptive sink and promotes desorption in the mentioned way. Enhancement of B app by the sheet correlated positively with octanol -water partition coefficient ( Kow), even though the partition coefficient of PAH between sheet and digestive fluid (which contains bile acid micelles) correlated negatively with Kow. It was hypothesized that PAHs initially in the soot exist in labile and nonlabile states. The fraction of labile PAH still sorbed to the soot residue after digestion and the maximum possible (limiting) bioaccessibility (Blim) could be estimated by varying the sheet -to-soot ratio. We show conclusively that the increase in bio accessibility due to the presence of the sheet is accounted for by a corresponding decrease in fraction of labile PAH still sorbed to the soot. The Blim ranged from 30.8 to 62.4% , independent of molecular size. The nonlabile (i.e., biologically inaccessible) fraction of individual PAHs , which ranged from 69.2 to 37.6% in this case , is quite large and needs to be taken into account in risk assessment . Figure 3. The in vitro human digestive model for measuring bioaccessibility of chemicals in ingested soot and soil particles. C. Pollution Prevention and Remediation 1. Reduction of Nitroaromatics Sorbed to Black Carbon by Direct Reaction with Sorbed Sulfides . Black carbon from soot deposition and wild fires is abundant in sediments and an important sink for organic contaminants. Previous research has suggested that black carbons (graphite, activated carbon, biochar) mediate the degradation o f nitrated compounds by sulfides by at least two different pathways: The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 121 reduction involving electron transfer from sulfides through conductive carbon regions to the target contaminant (nitroglycerin) and nucleophilic substitution by sulfur -based intermediates formed by sulfide oxidation (RDX). In this study (Xu, and Mitch Environ. Sci. Technol. 2015, 49, 34193426) , we evaluated the applicability of black carbon -mediated reactions to a wider variety of contaminant structures, including nitrated and halogenated aromatic compounds, halogenated heterocyclic aromatic compounds, and halogenated alkanes. Among these compounds, black carbon- mediated transformation by sulfides over a 3- day timescale was limited to nitroaromatic compounds. The reaction for a series of substituted nitroaromatics proceeded by reduction, as indicated by formation of 3- bromoaniline from 3 - bromonitrobenzene, and an inverse correlation of log k obs with energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E LUMO). The first -order rate constant log k obs was correlated with sorbed sulfide concentration, but no graphite mediated reduction of 3- bromonitr obenzene was observed in the presence of sulfite, thiosulfate or polysulfides. No reduction occurred in an electrochemical cell containing sheet graphite electrodes in which the reagents were placed in separate compartments. The results suggest that black carbon -mediated reduction of sorbed nitroaromatics by sulfides involves electron transfer directly from sorbed sulfides to sorbed nitroaromatics rather than electron transfer through conductive carbon regions , as was observed in a previous study for nitr oglycerine . Further research will be required to determine the precise role of graphene surface in mediating this oxidation -reduction reaction. Figure 4. Graphite surface -mediated redox reaction between sulfide ion and nitroaromatic compounds. The electron is apparently not transferred long distances along or through the graphite sheets. 2. Re-oxidation of Photo- reduced Polyoxotungstate by Different Oxidants in the Presence of a Model Pollutant\u2014 Kinetics and Reaction Mechanism. Polyoxometalate ions (POMs) have been studied as photo- oxidation catalysts for organic and inorganic pollutants due to their effectiveness and stability. The combination of light, the catalyst, and a bulk oxidizing agent, such as oxygen gas or hydrogen peroxide, leads to the generation of reactive oxidant species such as hydroxyl radicals that degrade the pollutant. Litt attention has been paid to the step involving reaction of the bulk oxidant with the one -electron reduced form of POM, i.e., POM . Electron transfer between POM and a bulk oxidant (or substrate) is also an important step in many processes besides water purification, including selective redox reactions, electrochemical catalysis, and photocatalytic water splitting. In this study ( Yang, Pignatello, Qu, and Xing, J . dioxygen the presence of the model pollutant 2- propanol (\"RH\") under various conditions, and the stoichiometries and rate laws were established. A unified chain reaction is proposed (Figur e 5) in which the rate- limiting step is outer -sphere one -electron transfer to XOOX to yield OX (OH, SO 4 or 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 CH 3CO 2). This step is found to be proton- assisted when the leaving group OX is a strong base (OH), but independent of [H+] when the leaving group is a weak base (O 2, SO 42). The rate of this step follows the order, PAA > MS > O 2 > HP > DS at pH 1.3, but O2 > PAA > MS > HP > DS at pH 4.1. The chain includes a number of POM-regenerating steps that , with some bulk oxidants (especially MS and DS), leads to further consumption of bulk oxidant and transformation of pollutant . These steps were identified through effects of conditions on reaction stoichiometry, order with respect to [POM], and suppression by POM. Chloride ion \"short -circuits\" th e chain by reducing OX and forming Cl2, which scavenges POM. The results provide insight into POM -catalyzed redox reactions in water purification and selective redox applications and will lead to intelligent choices of bulk oxidant for POM -photocatalyzed water purification .

Synthesis and Application of a Quaternary Phosphonium Polymer C oagulant to Avoid N -Nitrosamine Formation. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drinking water sources reacts with chlorine disinfectants to produce halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs), such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids that are polymers as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) are widely used for coagulating and removing negatively -charged particles such as DOM from drinking water. Their use, however, has been linked to the for mation of potent carcinogen s, N-nitrosamines as byproducts during chloramine -based drinking water disinfection. In this study (Zeng, Pignatello, Li, and Mitch, Environ.. Sci.. . Technol was synthesized such that the quaternary nitrogen (N) atom of polyDADMAC was substituted with a phosphorus (P) atom. Formation potential tests revealed that even under strong nitrosa tion conditions polyDADEPC and related lower order based compounds formed oxygenated and not nitrosated products. Bench -scale jar tests using three different source waters further demonstrated that polyDADEPC achieved coagulation performance comparable to commercial polyDADMACs for particle and DOM removals within the typical dose range used for drinking water treatment. This work highlights the potential use of a phosphonium coagulant polymer, polyDADEPC, as a viable alternative to polyDADMAC to avoid nitrosated byproduct formation during chloramination. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 123 Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program (Dr. Philip Armstrong, Dr. Theodore Andreadis, John Shepard, Michael Thomas, Michael Misencik, Angela Bransfield) Mosquito- borne viral diseases constitute an annual threat to human health in Connecticut. A comprehensive surveillance program complemented by science- based controls and timely public outreach are the most effective ways of protecting the public and reduc ing the risk of human disease. Experiment Station scientists and technicians monitor mosquitoes and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) activity at 91 locations throughout Connecticut from June - October. The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is used to assess the t hreat of WN virus and EEE to warn the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. In 2014, statewide mosquito trapping was conducted from June 2 t hrough October 15. Approximately one -third of the sites were located in densely populated residential locales along an urban/suburban corridor in the coastal southwestern corner of the state extending up through the Connecticut River Valley. Trap sites t ypically included parks, greenways, golf courses, undeveloped wood lots, sewage treatment plants, dumping stations, and temporary wetlands associated with waterways. Trapping locations in the other regions of the state were established in more sparsely po pulated rural settings that included permanent fresh -water swamps (red maple/white cedar) and bogs, coastal salt marshes, horse stables, and swamp -forest border environs. Mosquito trapping was conducted with CO 2 (dry ice) -baited CDC miniature light traps equipped with aluminum domes, and gravid mosquito traps baited with a lactalbumin- yeast - hay infusion . Traps were placed in the field in the afternoon, operated overnight, and retrieved the following morning. Trapping frequency was minimally made once ev ery ten days at each trap site over the course of the entire season. Adult mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning in an ice chest lined with cool packs. Mosquitoes were immobilized with dry ice and transferred to chill tables wh ere they were identified to species with the aid of a stereo microscope (90X) based on morphological characters. Female mosquitoes were pooled in groups of 50 or fewer by species, collection date, trap type, and collection site and stored at - 80 oC until processed for virus. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of West Nile virus (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and other mosquito- borne arboviruses of public health importance. Virus isolates from m osquito pools were tested for WN, EEE, Flanders (FL), Jamestown Canyon (JC), Cache Valley (CV), (TVT), Highlands J (HJ), LaCrosse (LAC), St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE), and Potosi (POTV) viruses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) or standard RT -PCR using virus -specific primers. All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio- Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. In 2014, a total of 229,097 mosquitoe s (12,678 pools) representing 39 species were trapped and tested from 91 locations statewide. A total of 68 isolations of WN virus were made from 7 mosquito species: 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Culex pipiens = 52, 1, Culiseta melanura = 1, Ochlerotatus trivittatus = 1, collected at 20 sites in 15 towns in 5 counties (Fairfield, Hartford, Litchfield, New Haven, and New London). The first positive mosquitoes were collected on July 10, and the last on October 8. The majority of WN virus activity was detected in densely populated urban and suburban regions in southern Fairfield county. Six cases of WN were locally acquired (3 = encephalitis/meningitis, 3 = fever) with no fatalities. The age range was 23 to 63 years, and the median age was 46 years. Date of onset ranged from August 18 to October 6. Human cases were temporally and spatially consistent with WN virus isolations from mosquito pools. No horse cases of WN were reported. There were no EEE i solations made from mosquitoes, and there were no equine or human cases reported. Other mosquito- borne viruses isolated included: Cache Valley (CV) = 25 isolates from 7 species (July 28 - October 8); Jamestown Canyon (JC) = 23 isolates from 9 species (June 5 - August 18); Trivittatus Virus (TVT) = 1 isolates from 1 species (July 30). Participation in the statewide surveillance program provides timely information about levels of virus activity in the mosquito population which is used to monitor virus am plification within enzootic transmission cycles, and assess risk of human infection. This information is used inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide vector control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks. In addition, this large -scale sampling effort also informs out understanding of the ecology of mosquitoes and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 125 mosquito- borne viruses. Additional studies on the role of different mosquito species to serve as vectors of viral pathogens may be used to target anti -vector interventi ons more effectively. Epidemiology of Mosquito -borne Viral Diseases I. Spatial -Temporal Analysis of Cache Valley Virus (Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus ) Infection in Anopheline and Culicine Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Northeastern United States, 1997 - 2012 (Theodore G. Andreadis, Philip M. Armstrong, John F. Anderson, Andrew J. Main) Cache Valley (CV) virus is a mosquito -borne bunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae , genus Orthobunyavirus ) that is enzootic throughout much of North and Central Amer ica. White -tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus have been incriminated as important reservoir and amplification hosts and the virus has been found in a diverse array of mosquito species but the principal vectors are unknown. Dr. Theodore Andreadis, Dr. Ph ilip Armstrong and Dr. John Anderson conducted a 16-year study to identify the primary mosquito vectors in Connecticut, quantify seasonal prevalence rates of infection and define the spatial geographic distribution of CV virus in the state as a function of land use and white -tailed deer populations which have increased substantially over this period. CV virus was isolated from 16 mosquito species in 7 genera, almost all of which were multivoltine and mammalophilic. Anopheles punctipennis was incriminated as the most consistent and likely vector in this region based on yearly isolation frequencies and the spatial geographic distribution of infected mosquitoes. Other species exhibiting frequent temporal and moderate, spatial geographic patterns of virus isolation within the state included for An. walkeri, Culiseta melanura, and Oc. cantator. Other species with CV virus were equally distributed throughout urban, suburban and rural locales, and infection rates were not directly associated with the localized abundance of white -tailed deer possibly due to their saturation throughout the region. Virus activity in mosquitoes was episodic with no consistent pattern from year t o year and fluctuations in yearly seasonal infection rates did not appear to be directly impacted by overall mosquito abundance. Virus infection in mosquitoes occurred late in the season that mostly extended from mid- August through September when adult mosquito populations were visibly declining and were comparatively low. Findings argue for a limited role for vertical transmission for the perpetuation of CV virus as occurs with other related bunyaviruses.

Emergence of a New Lineage of Cache Valley Virus ( Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus) in the Northeastern United States (Philip M. Armstrong, Theodore G. Andreadis, John F. Anderson) Cache Valley virus (CVV; Family Bunyavidae, Genus Orthobunyavirus) is a mosquito- borne zoonosis that frequently infects humans and livestock in North and Central America. In the northeastern U.S., CVV transmission is unpredictable from year -to-year and may derive from the periodic extinction and reintroduction of new virus strains into this region. To evaluate this possibility, we sequenced and analyzed numerous CVV isolates samp led in Connecticut during an 18 year period to determine how the virus population may change over time. Phylogenetic analyses showed the establishment of a new viral lineage during 2010 that became dominant by 2014 and appears to have originated from sout hern Mexico. CVV strains from Connecticut also grouped into numerous sub- clades within each lineage that included viruses from other U.S. states and Canada. We did not observe the development and stable persistence of local viral clades in Connecticut wh ich may reflect the episodic pattern of CVV transmission. Together, our data support the emergence of a new lineage of CVV in the northeastern US and suggest extensive dispersal of viral strains in North America. Cache Valley virus occurs throughout much of North and Central America where it frequently infects humans and livestock. The development of severe disease occurs rarely in humans but is potentially life- threatening with symptoms ranging from fever to encephalitis. In addition, CVV is responsibl e for epizootics in sheep, causing fetal death and congenital defects in these animals. Despite its importance as a medical and veterinary pathogen, little is known about the genetic relationships of CVV variants circulating in nature. In this study we s equenced and compared the phylogenetic relationships of over 70 isolates of CVV sampled from Connecticut over an 18 year time period. This approach allows us to track the origin, spread, and persistence of viral strains in the northeastern US, information that may help us develop more effective public health interventions against the virus. C. Performance of Real -time RT -PCR Assays to Detect West Nile virus in Mosquito Pools (Nicole Herman and Philip M. Armstrong) Mosquito surveillance for West Nile viru s (WNV) provides an effective early warning system to assess environmental risk of human infection and guide mosquito control and other disease prevention efforts as needed. Many surveillance programs use only real -time RT -PCR assays to screen mosquito po ols for West Nile virus infection. To evaluate the performance of these molecular assays, we tested 90 WNV positive mosquito pools and 90 controls using three assays in a blinded- comparison. WNV -positive mosquito pools that failed to amplify were sequence d to identify any mutations in the primer or probe binding sites. Of the three assays, the assay by Tang et al. 2006 had the highest sensitivity and specificity. Only one strain that failed to amplify had mutations in the critical primer/probe binding regions, so most false negatives are likely due to other factors. The three assays performed well but with one assay outperforming the other two. 11190 An punctipennis New Haven 2003 Cache Valley virus 856 Alberta Canada 2003/2005 Cache Valley virus 1156 Alberta Canada 2003/2005 Cache Valley virus F14002 Cs inornata North Dakota 2005 10311 Oc 2008 Cache Valley virus F14064 North Dakota 2005 Cache Valley virus W20826 Ae vexans North Dakota 2005 Cache Valley virus CK102 Sheep Texas 1981 3351 Ae cinereus Litchfield CT 1998 Cache Valley virus F12108 North Dakota 2005 Cache Valley 2008 Cache Valley W08491 tarsalis An punctipennis Fairfield CT 2003 Cache Valley virus 807270 Human North Carolina 1995 2956 An punctipennis 1998 3477 An punctipennis Fairfield CT 1998 Cache Valley virus MI801450 Horse Michigan 1980 CtAr560-79 Oc triseriatus New Haven CT 1979 Cache Valley virus Ar785912 An quadrimaculatus Ohio 1978 Cache Valley virus 90P686 Human Panama 1990 Cache Valley virus RU68 Oc sollicitans New Jersey 1982 Cache Valley virus Ar662126 An quadrimaculatus Ohio 1966 Cache Valley virus MN550 Cs inornata Manitoba Canada 1981 Playas virus 75V3066 mosquito Ecuador 1975 Cache Valley virus 6V633 Cs inornata Utah 1956 Cache Valley virus 1508A52 Cs inornata North Dakota 1952 Cache Valley virus 69V2152 Cs inornata Oregon 1969 Tlacotalpan virus Valley albopictus New Jersey 10081 CT Ae Ae albopictus Fairfield CT 2014 Fort Sherman virus 86MSP18 Human Panama 1985 0.01 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 127 WNV has emerged as the dominant mosquito- borne viral disease in North America since its introduction into the New York City area in 1999. In response to this disease threat, mosquito- based surveillance programs have been implemented to track virus distribution, and assess risk of human infection. This activity is accomplished by collecting mosquitoes from endem ic sites, sorting them into pools by species, and testing pooled specimens by either cell culture and/or molecular assays. Viral cell culture is the gold standard for detection of virus in tissue samples. However, many labs performing arbovirus surveilla nce do not have the resources for cell culture and instead rely exclusively on molecular techniques such as real-time PCR. Formally comparing West Nile virus cell culture results from the Connecticut Mosquito Surveillance Program to results of the more co mmonly used real -time PCR diagnostic techniques will provide useful information on test sensitivity and specificity. Concrete data on PCR sensitivity can advise public health organizations with recommendations for best practices and can be used to help estimate the burden of false negative test results. Epidemiology and Population Genetics of Mosquitoes A. Population Genetics of Culiseta melanura , the Main Vector of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in Eastern USA and Canada ( Goudarz Molaei, Theodore G. Andreadis, pathogenic mosquito- borne zoonosis that is responsible for occasional outbreaks of severe disease in humans and equines, resulting in high mortality and neurological impairment in most survivors. In the past, human disease outbreaks in the northeastern U.S. have occurred intermittently with no apparent pattern ; however, during the last decade we have witnessed recurring annual emerg ence where EEEV activity had been historically rare , and expansion into northern New England where the virus had been previously unknown. The underlying factors responsible for this sustained resurgence are unclear. Although Cs. melanura is considered th e principal enzootic vector, the role this species plays in epidemic/epizootic transmission to humans and equines is not well defined. Despite the extraordinary importance of Cs. melanura in the EEEV transmission cycle, little is understood about the popu lation genetic structure of this species. Due to potentially low gene flow and local adaptation, populations of Cs. melanura may differ in vector -host interactions and vectorial capacity with profound impacts on public health and vector control. We are i nvestigating population genetics of Cs. melanura, with the objectives to : 1) examine spatial and temporal variations in population genetic structure of Cs. melanura, 2) evaluate the potential impact of variations in population genetic structure of Cs. melanura on the risk of human and equine infection in EEEV foci, and 3) investigate the occurrence of population structuring and gene flow patterns. This research project will elucidate previously uncharacterized yet fundamental features of the population genetic structure of Cs. melanura, reveal how it might impact vector -host interactions and vectorial capacity of this species, and provide a basis to understand the involvement of Cs. melanura in epidemic/epizootic transmission of EEEV to humans and equines. B. Dynamics of Vector -Host Interaction and the Role of Avian Species as Superspreaders of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus as an Emerging Public Health Threat in the Northeastern United States (Goudarz Molaei, Michael C. Thomas, Tim Muller, Jan Medl ock, John J. Shepard, Philip M. Armstrong, Theodore G. Andreadis ) Detailed knowledge of the vector -host interactions of mosquito populations in nature is essential for evaluating their vectorial capacity and for assessing the role of individual vertebrates as reservoir hosts involved in the maintenance and amplification of zoonotic agents of human diseases. We studied host associations of Cs. melanura in four EEEV foci in the northeastern U.S., identified vector host 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 preferences as the most important tran smission parameter, and quantified the contribution of preference - induced contact heterogeneity to enzootic transmission. This study identified a few avian species that may serve as superspreaders of EEEV. Our study elucidated spatio -temporal host species utilization by Cs. melanura in relation to avian host community. This research provided a basis to better understand the involvement of Cs. melanura and avian hosts in the transmission and ecology of EEEV and the risk of human infection in various virus foci. C. Vector -Host Interactions of Culiseta melanura in a Focus of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Activity in Southeastern Virginia (Goudarz Molaei, Philip M. Armstrong, Charles F. Abadam, Karen I. Akaratovic, Jay P. Kiser, Theodore G. Andreadis) The mid -Atlantic region remains an important focal area for EEEV transmission since the initial discovery of the virus in 1933, during an equine epizootic in Virginia and neighboring states. A number of freshwater swamp complexes are located throughout this region that support dense populations of Cs. melanura mosquitoes and large aggregations of migratory and permanent bird species. This includes the Great Dismal Swamp and surrounding communities, which constitute an established EEEV focus in southeastern Virginia. Residential and commercial developments have fragmented much of the swamp perimeter, leaving large pockets of swamp habitat interspersed w ith human populations. This landscape provides ideal conditions for human infection by bringing virus -infected mosquitoes from swamp habitats into close proximity with residential areas. An earlier investigation in southeastern Virginia found that Cs. me lanura comprised >95% of EEEV -positive mosquito pools during a five -year surveillance period. Despite its importance as a vector, the blood -feeding patterns of Cs. melanura have not been evaluated in this region by molecular methods. Such analyses are cr itical to identify specific avian hosts involved in enzootic cycling of virus and to evaluate the potential for Cs. melanura to act as an occasional vector of EEEV to mammalian hosts. We investigated the transmission cycle of EEEV in southeastern Virginia by determining the host -feeding patterns of Cs. melanura during a season of intense virus transmission. D. Insights into the Recent Emergence and Expansion of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in a New Focus in Northern New England, USA (Goudarz Molaei, Philip M. Armstrong, Alan C. Graham, Laura Kramer, Theodore G. Andreadis ) Vermont is a newly emergent region for EEEV activity that is located on the northern boundary of the geographic range of the virus. EEEV was first isolated in Vermont during a 201 1 outbreak on an Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae ) farm in Rutland County. The first confirmed human cases of EEE occurred in state during the subsequent year and the virus was also detected in 10 Cs. melanura pools from the same region of Vermont. Neutrali zing antibodies to EEEV were also found during serosurveys of white - moose ( Alces americanus) sampled throughout Vermont. Otherwise, little is known about the ecology of the virus in this region of the U.S. A colla borative research project research was undertaken to 1) characterize the host -feeding patterns of Cs. melanura and evaluate its role in enzootic maintenance of EEEV in wild bird populations during an epidemic in Vermont, 2) assess the potential involvement of Cs. melanura in epidemic/epizootic transmission to humans and equines, and 3) identify key avian species as hosts for mosquitoes which also support amplification of EEEV. E. An Integrated and Individual Tick Management Program to Reduce Risk of Lyme D isease in a Residential Endemic Area ( Kirby C. Stafford III, Goudarz Molaei, Scott Williams) Lyme disease (LD) represents the most frequently diagnosed human tick -borne disease in North America. A variety of prevention and control methods, including pers onal protective measures, habitat modification, applications of biological and natural compounds, and host -targeted control measures, have been examined for reducing tick abundance and risk for LD. We are investigating the efficacy and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 129 associated costs of several existing and new tick control measures individually and in the framework of the ITM approach to reduce the number of infected ticks in the inland LD endemic neighborhoods in Redding Connecticut. The primary aim of this CDC -funded project is to de velop, implement, and evaluate individual and integrated tick management (ITM) approaches to reduce the entomological risk of LD. In addition, an enhanced LD decision support system will be constructed by incorporating the new findings obtained from the proposed project. The primary Objectives of the project are to: 1) Develop a reduced risk/integrated tick management (ITM) approach to tick control, 2) Measure efficacy of individual methods and an ITM approach to reduce infected ticks, infected reservoirs , and questing tick populations, 3) Determine most effective timing and method of implementation of each tick control method and analyze costs for individual components of an ITM program, and 4) Create a \"LD decision support system .\" By incorporating entomological data and other information acquired by the proposed project into our decision support system, we will provide guidance on the most effective control measures that will help stakeholders to protect themselves in an environment ally safe manner. The approach and findings generated from this project will easily be extended to other LD endemic regions. F. Evaluation of a Lyme disease Vaccine (Rodent -Targeted Vaccine, RTV) in an Integrated Pest Management Framework (Kirby C. Staf ford III, Goudarz Molaei, Scott Williams) The paucity of cost -efficient strategies to limit tick -borne pathogen exposures is becoming increasingly problematic for public health in the northeastern U.S. as incidence rates of tick -borne diseases continue to rise and new tick -borne pathogens emerge. We have initiated a collaborative research project to investigate the effectiveness of a rodent -targeted vaccine (RTV) in controlling Lyme Borreliosis in two residential neighborhoods during 2014- 2016 in Redding CT. Properties in one neighborhood will receive the RTV treatment only (delivered in rodent bait boxes), and properties in the other neighborhood will receive the RTV treatment in combination with applications of the biological tick control compound based on the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Met52). Baseline tick and mouse data has been collected during May -June 2014. We have started are delivering RTV, using bait boxes to study properties. We will repeat the RTV application in the final year of the stu dy, 2016. Spray applications of Met52 are also underway on the study properties in the RTV+Met52 neighborhood (experimental plot), for comparison purposes. Tick Testing Program (Goudarz Molaei, Saryn Kunajukr) Tick-associated illnesses, including Lyme disease (LD), pose a major threat to human health in Connecticut. LD is the most prevalent arthropod- associated disease in the U.S., with an estimate of 300,000 cases per year. In 2013, Connecticut had the 5 th highest number of confirmed cases of LD and 4th highest incidence rate of 58.7 per 100,000 persons in the U.S. In 2014, Connecticut has had 1705 confirmed and 641 probable cases of Lyme disease. In addition, 170 and 76 human cases of babesiosis and anaplasmosis, respectively, have been reported. The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis , is the and respectively. The Tick Testing Progra m at The CAES was established in 1990 as a service to local health departments and districts. The objectives of this program are to: 1) examine ticks for evidence of infection with tick -associated pathogens in order 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 to better understand epidemiology of ti ck-associated illnesses in Connecticut, 2) inform residents of any potential health risk as a result of tick bites, and 3) assist physicians and residents concerning treatment. In the past, testing was limited to the LD agent, but in view of increasing human cases of tick -related illnesses in the state, testing has been expanded to include Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophillum in addition to LD pathogen. This represents a significant enhancement of the tick testing services. Molecular methods are used to test ticks for evidence of infection with pathogens. Genomic DNA is isolated from engorged nymph and adult ticks and screened by taking advantage of three diagnostic genes, Flagellin, 16s ribosomal DNA, and osp A (outer surface protein A). Each year an average of 3,000 ticks are submitted for testing. From July 2014 until the end of June 2015, the Tick Testing Laboratory has received 2879 ticks, representing 5 species, the majority of which were blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis . Of 1950 were tested positive for LD agent. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (Gregory Bugbee) We are quantifying the locations of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determining their effects on native plant communities, establishing baseline data to track their spread and providing information that is critical for management strategies .

Surveillance and Monitoring: Since 2004 the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (CAES IAPP) has completed aquatic vegetation surveys of 219 Connecticut lakes and ponds (Figure 1). A total of 38 water bodies have been resurveyed at least five years later to determine how invasive plants are changing the quality of lakes overtime. In fiscal 2014- 15, Greg Bugbee and Jennifer Fanzutti (Figure 2) mapped native and invasive aquatic vegetation in seven new and 12 previously surveyed water bodies (Table 1). In addi tion, Lake Candlewood, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the eighth consecutive year to determine the effects of alternate year deep and shallow winter drawdown on ). Lake Zoar, was surveyed for the fifth time to track changes in the population of invasive species. We established transects in each water body, using global positioning systems to quantify changes in native and invasive aquatic species abundance and distribution. We collected water samples and analyzed them for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, clarity, alkalinity, conductivity and phosphorus. This data, along with watershed information, is being used to investigat e the factors that influence the susceptibility of water bodies to certain invasive species. We archive dry specimens of all plant species in the CAES herbarium for future reference. We designed our Invasive Aquatic Plant Program to utilize the latest dig ital technology to rapidly and comprehensively report our findings to the public. Lake survey maps and other data are published online within days of their completion ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Figure 1 . Locations of invasive plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds as found in CAES IAPP surveys from 2004 - 2014. 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Nearly 60 percent of the water bodies contain one or more invasive plant species and some lakes contained as many as four invasive species (Figure 1). The most common invasive plants are Eurasian survey of Fence Rock Lake, in Guilford, discovered Connecticut's first infestation of Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa) and our resurveys in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 found the population expanding (Figure 3). We have since found Brazilian waterweed in Lower Moodus Reservoir (East Haddam), Staffordville Reservoir (Stafford Springs) and Mono Pond (Coventry). We are working with the local lake associations and the CT DEEP to develop and test novel control strategies. Our surveys provide one of the most complete aquatic plant and water chemistry databases available. This has allowed us to model the risk of invasion for water bodies that currently do not contain specific invasive species. This model can be used by reso urce managers and policy makers to improve monitoring protocol and early detection and rapid response efforts. When we group lakes by the presence on invasive aquatic plants we found they occurred in two distinct groups: This model was further refined wi th addition of 1) fanwort and variable watermilfoil and 2) curlyleaf pondweed, minor naiad, and Eurasian watermilfoil. When we compared the occurrence of each group with water chemistry we detected highly significant differences. The fanwort and variable watermilfoil group preferred lakes with lower conductivity, alkalinity, and pH than the curly leaf pondweed, minor naiad, and Eurasian watermilfoil group. Finally, we developed a mathematical model based on lake water chemistry that could predict which lakes contained the invasive species with nearly 80 percent accuracy . Hydrosoil characteristics such as organic matter content, pH and conductivity to suggest the first filter to invasion is water chemistry followed by the make -up of the hydrosoil. Table 1. Lakes and ponds surveyed by CAES IAPP in fiscal 2014 -15 (* = resurvey). Figure 2 . Jennifer Fanzutti assessing the aquatic Plant community in Gardner Lake. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 133 B. Control Technology: The goal of this objective is 1) to research novel means of control that minimize herbicide usage and protects native vegetation and 2) investigate non -chemical management options such as winter water level drawdown. 1. Herbicides. Novel met hods of chemical control with herbicides can rapidly remove invasive plants and begin to restore native plant communities to aquatic ecosystems. Bashan Lake - East Haddam, CT - We are in the 14th year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2, 4 -D to control variable watermilfoil in Bashan Lake. We have largely restored the lake to preinfestation conditions. Our resurvey of Bashan Lake in 2014 found an approximate 99 percent reduction in variable watermilfoil and an increase i n desirable native species from 12 to 19. Lowering of the lake by 18 feet in late 2014 for dam repairs and the prospect for the refilling take up to two years, leaves the future conditions in question, however our work has documented past conditions for c omparison. Fence Rock Lake - Guilford, CT - CAES IAPP discovered Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake in 2009 and has since documented its yearly expansion (Figure 3). Because this plant is the first documented case of large scale invasion of this plant in CT and no information is available on its control, we arranged for testing the herbicide diquat (6,7- dihydrodipyrido (1,2- a:2',1' -c) pyrazinediium dibromide) in the summer of 2014. The herbicide was applied by bottom injection to the shoreline areas of the lake in July. Pre and post treatment vegetation surveys on over 100 georeferenced points in September (Figure 3, right) found 100% control. A survey in July 2015 will determine long term efficacy on both the Brazilian waterweed and nontarget desira ble native plants. Figure 3. Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake in 2013(top left), pretreatment (top right) and post treatment (bottom right) in 2014 (top right). 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 2. Winter water level drawdown . Candlewood Lake - Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Sherman, CT. Lake Candlewood's aquatic plant community is dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil. W inter water level drawdown is used to manage the watermilfoil. Using state- of-the-art global positioning systems, we have documented the success of the drawdowns each year since 2007. The winter drawdown protocol consists of alternate year shallow (1m) and deep (3m) water level reductions. Drawdown timing and duration varies depend ing on the hydrogenerating needs of FirstLight Power Resources. These variables and inconsistencies in winter weather result in differences in milfoil control. The coverage of milfoil shows a negative relationship to drawdown depth and duration (Figure 4 ). Our yearly report to The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FirstLight Power Resources, CT DEEP, Candlewood Lake Authority and other stakeholders Figure 4 .

Outreach - We strive to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, prevention and management of invasive aquatic species. We make every effort to engage citizens, lake associations, and other stakeholders. CAES scientists have organized several workshops (Figure 6) on the identification of invasive aquatic plants. We also gave presentations to professional organizations such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society and the Connecticut Invasive Plant Working Group, numerous lake associations, town meetings and student groups such as the Connecticut Envirothon. We have made all our information freely and readily available via our website (Figure 6). Included are all our digi tized interactive lake maps, our complete herbarium and publications (http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Our invasive aquatic plant control and outreach efforts have resulted in the protection of lakes and provided sc ientifically proven methods for use by others. Our workshops have trained hundreds of citizens to recognize and report new infestations in order to prevent future problems and the associated control expenditures. Soil Testing Testing soil samples for fe rtility and suggesting methods for growing better plants are a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Gregory Bugbee tested 5,481 samples and answered approximately 1,600 related inquiries . The soil testing services and recommendations made by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state. This provides direct economic and environmental benefit to the suburban community by r educing nitrogen runoff into soil and water. Evolutionary Biology Virus Genome Analysis Reveals Control of Oak Silkworm Development (Dr. Charles Vossbrinck) Antheraea pernyi nucleopolyhedroviruses (AnpeNPVs) Antheraea pernyi . Comparative genomics of NPVs has focused on differences in the genomic structure among species and very little about genetic diversity within the AnpeNPV is known. To examine the genetic diversity of g eographical AnpeNPV strains we sequenced the genome of an AnpeNPV (AnpeNPV -H) isolated from Henan province, China and performed a comparative analysis with two previously sequenced isolates (AnpeNPV -L and AnpeNPV -Z) from Liaoning province. The AnpeNPV -H strain is 125,605 bp and contains 146 open reading frames of which 95 are identified as 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 functional proteins and 51 are annotated as hypothetical proteins. The three strains have the same gene composition except that s even of the unidentified ORFs are compl ete in some isolates but not in others. There are more than 200 SNPs between AnpeNPV -H and other two strains, 85% of which were found in coding regions. Non-synonymous changes of three protein- coding genes ( odv-e56, p94-like, and egt protein ) have higher evolutionary rate (i.e., dN /dS > 1), suggesting that they might have experienced positive selection or have undergone a relaxation of purifying selection. Finally, we show evidence of genetic recombination between AnpeNPV strains. This study reveals the level of intra -species variation and lends insights into the dynamics of the genomic architecture within strains of the Antheraea pernyi nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AnpeNPV). Virus -Vector Interactions A. Deer Tick Virus Population Dynam ics during Infection of Ixodes scapularis Ticks (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Phil Armstrong, Dr. John Anderson, Angela Bransfield) . Deer tick virus (DTV) is an emerging tick -borne virus which can cause encephalitis and has caused numerous human cases in New England over the last couple of years. DTV is maintained in nature in a transmission cycle between deer ticks ( Ixodes scapularis; primary vector of Lyme disease) and small woodland rodents, most likely white -footed mice. However, deer tick nymphs and adults can transmit the virus to larger mammals such as humans. Because little is relatively known about this virus, we here at CAES are conducting experiments to investigate the ecological forces allowing the virus to emerge, adapt and persist within New En gland transmission cycles. Previous studies indicate that DTV is a variant of another tick -borne virus, Powassan virus which is maintained between woodchucks and Ixodes cookei ticks. This divergence occurred thousands of years ago when Powassan virus became fixed in the new transmission cycle between Ix. scapularis ticks and white -footed mice resulting in the emergence of DTV. The evolutionary forces allowing this transmission shift are unknown. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 137 Therefore, we are examining how DTV populations evolve dur ing infection of deer ticks in order to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary potential of this virus and viruses like it. These studies are currently underway with results expected in the next couple of months. Image from discovermagazine.com. B. Identifying West Nile Virus Receptors in the Mosquito Gut ( Dr. Doug Brackney, Mike Misencik) The emergence and re- emergence of arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) over the last 40 years constitutes a continued and significant public health threat. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) was introduced into North America in 1999 and has since been responsible for 41,762 human cases and 1,765 deaths. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics for the majority of these viruses. Further, while traditional mosquito abatement programs have had some success in limiting the transmission of arboviruses, concerns about public and environmental safety, the development of insecticide resistance, cost and political instability have greatly limited their application. Therefore, the development of novel strategies to curb their transmission is greatly needed. To this end, novel vaccines strategies targeting the vector, not the pathogen, are being considered. While traditional vaccines are designed to elicit pr otective immunity against a specific pathogen, anti -vector vaccines aim to disrupt critical events within vectors that are important for life or pathogen transmission. The initial events mediating the interaction between arboviruses and the mosquito midgut are poorly defined. To date, no midgut receptors have been identified and the involvement of mosquito midgut carbohydrates during viral infection has not been investigated. Establishing the mechanisms by which viruses are able to bind to and infect mid gut epithelial cells will greatly contribute to our understanding of this critical event and may lead to the development of novel control strategies. To address these deficiencies in knowledge we are characterizing the luminal midgut proteome and determining the importance of midgut carbohydrates during the initial stages of WNV infection of the mosquito. Mosquito Microbiota A. An Ecological Based Approach for Paratransgenesis Systems in Mosquitoes ( Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Blaire Steven) The presence of host associated microbiota (the collection of bacteria living on or in animals) is a commonality shared among all animals including mosquitoes. Because of their importance in mediating mosquito development and their ability to influence di sease transmission there is considerable interest in understanding these relationships. It is currently known that the mosquito microbiome is composed of ~50-200 bacterial species and that this community is temporally dynamic with large shifts in community composition between different life stages. This suggests that mosquito microbiomes, in their natural state, are composed of complex and dynamic communities. However, while informative, these studies have been descriptive and have failed to empirically test the ecological mechanisms mediating microbial colonization, development, stability or transmission. Despite these knowledge gaps, efforts to utilize this host-microbiome relationship for the purposes of controlling mosquito- borne diseases have alread y been tested. This approach, known as paratransgenesis, utilizes symbiotic microbes to express anti -pathogen effector molecules within the mosquito. Mosquito paratransgenesis attempts thus far have focused on employing a single paratransgenic strain. A key condition impacting the success of mosquito paratransgenesis is the assurance that paratransgenic strains are resilient to replacement by competing environmental strains. Studies in mice suggest that low complexity microbiomes are unstable, easily invaded and quickly replaced by environmental competitors. However, it remains unknown if mosquito based paratransgenic mono -cultures will remain stable in the presence of competing environmental bacteria and conversely, whether complex paratransgenic commu nities are more resilient to invasion and replacement. Another important consideration when assessing the feasibility of mosquito 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 paratransgenesis is the likelihood that such approaches can be introduced and propagated amongst natural populations. Curren t literature suggests that mosquito microbiomes, at least in part, can be transmitted transovum and that members of this community can colonize emerging larvae. The implications of these findings are profound and may provide a drive mechanism by which par atransgenic bacteria can be transmitted trans -generationally. However, the implications of these findings have not been examined in the context of paratransgenic communities. Furthermore, the transmission efficiency or stability of these communities has not been assessed. Filling these fundamental gaps in knowledge will be critical if we are to fully harness the potential of novel paratransgenic countermeasures. Our goal is to better understand the ecology of the microbiome within vector mosquitoes. The objectives of this proposal is to define the stochasticity of microbial colonization, the stability of microbial populations over the life of the mosquito (including transovum transmission), and to test the predictions of a community ecology based approa ch on the development of paratransgenic strategies. Environmenta l Microbiology A. Effects of Sudden Vegetation Dieback on Soil Microbial Ecology and Greenhouse Gas Emissions ( Dr. Blaire Steven and Dr. Wade Elmer) Recently, cases of sudden vegetation dieback (SVD) have been observed across coastal wetland s of the North Eastern U.S.A. The development of SVD appears as a sudden die- off of the local plants, often occurring in as little as one season. Because SVD also kills the propagative rhizomes of th e dominant plants (generally Spartina alterniflora ), the sites often remain devoid of plants for several years. The causes of SVD have yet to be discovered, but the loss of plants can have dramatic cons equences on wetland ecosystems. Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, fixing an equivalent amount of carbon per area as tropical rain forests. This productivity is supported by the photosynthesis done by wetland plants. When the plants die , this carbon is no longer fixed from the atmosphere and SVD sites have the potential to switch from net sinks of carbon from the atmosphere to net sources. The release of carbon is due to soil microorganisms that recycle the material produced by the plants, which ultimately ends up as CO 2. We are monitoring cases of SVD throughout Connecticut and Rhode Island. As part of this assessment we are measuring soil gas fluxes to determine the extent that SVD affects soil carbon cycling as well as characterizing how the soil microbial communities respond to SVD. Our preliminary data indicates that SVD alters both the composition and functioning of the microbial communities. We have found that sites of SVD have an increased colon ization by algae, suggesting that microbial populations are providing compensatory photosynthesis to the wetlands. However, this is unlikely to redress for the amount of carbon fixed by the plants. We have also found that specific bacterial groups, namel y bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, are significantly less abundant in SVD sites. These bacteria are known to be associated with the breakdown of plant derived carbon. Their reduction in the SVD sites suggests that carbon cycling differs between SVD affected and healthy soils. In this regard, SVD offers a unique opportunity to develop metabolic models of how carbon is processed in wetlands. Taking a microbial view of S VD will hopefully provide insight into the causes and consequences of SVD as well as generating data to better represent wetlands in global climate change models.

Development of Molecular Tools to Monitor Freshwater Algal Blooms (Blaire Steven) A fr eshwater algal bloom is a visible increase in the photosynthetic biomass in a freshwater body (Figure 2). These blooms have dramatic effects on water quality, recreation, and ecology. In certain circumstances, the bloom organisms produce toxins that can affect animal or human health. Clearly, the ability to monitor and predict the development of algal blooms will be critical to managing Connecticut's freshwater resources. The term \"algae\" refers to a diverse group of organisms. Algae encompasses all photosynthetic biomass in the water column. This ranges from small macroscopic plants all the way down to cyanobacteria (formerly referred to as blue- green algae). Thus, characterizing the populations that make up a bloom requires taxonomic knowledge across a broad range of organisms and a wide- ranging knowledge of biology. Furthermore, traditionally the characterization of alga blooms was performed through microscopi c investigation of algal cells. This required specialized taxonomists with extensive training in algal identification and often resulted in discrepancies in algal characterization between investigators. Molecular methods for algal identification offer ro bust, reliable, and standardized methods to identify algal species. Additionally, through genetic means it will be easier to identify those species capable of producing toxins and that may therefore pose a threat to health. Finally, and most importantly, molecular methods are extremely sensitive and can detect algal biomass at exceedingly low concentrations. This is critical to predicting the composition of algal blooms before they happen rather than responding to them after they have occurred. We are de veloping methods based on sequencing conserved algal genes to identify and characterize the algae that occur in Connecticut freshwaters. To our knowledge this will be the first freshwater algal inventory performed in the state and the first molecular base d survey performed anywhere. With developments in high- throughput sequencing we will be able to build comprehensive characterizations of the algae occurring in Connecticut's freshwaters and build a better framework for predicting and managing freshwater a lgal blooms. C. Mapping the arboreal microbiome and determining the metabolic pathway for in -tree methane production (Blaire Steven and Robert Marra) Recent work has established that trees and downed wood produce methane, an important climate forcing gas. The scale of the resulting fluxes from this source a re as of yet, not resolved. Forest climate offsets are projected to become a $20 billion market. To date, observations suggest that methane emissions from living trees vary with stand age, species, and in the case of woody debris \u2014decay class, indicating e missions can be managed alongside carbon as part of a more holistic climate mitigation effort. Heartwood is non- living tissue that accumulates as trees age (Figure 3). Heartwood disease promotes decay and, with it, methane production, but it has been ove rlooked in atmospheric budgets when considering whether living trees are a significant global methane source. Assuming even conservative Figure 2 . An algal bloom in Candlewood Lake, CT. (Photo courtesy of Greg Bugbee, CAES) . Figure 3 . (a) Heart rot revealed after felling a timber tree, (b) microflaring of trunk methane released from an upland oak during tree coring. (Photo courtesy of Kris Covey, Yale University) 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 published estimates, methane production could lead to a ~20% reduction in the overall climate benefit of carbon sequestration in forests. As heartwood decay and methane production is driven by internal microorganisms, including archaea, bacteria and fungi, a microbial view of living wood methane production will shed light on the controls of methane production in trees. We are currently performing work to associate the bacterial and fungal populations from recently felled trees to levels of heartwood rot to better understand the interactions between bacteria, fungi, and trees. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 141 DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including how trees respond to novel pests and a changing climate, innovative forest management practices, the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed landscapes, and novel specialty crops. Southern Pine B eetle E xpanding into New England The recent outbreak of southern pine beetle (SPB; Dendroct onus frontalis Zimmermann) and its associated pathogenic fungi such as Ceratocystis minor in Long Island (NY) opened the bridge for SPB expansion into New England forests where several native and pl anted pine species are growing . SPB in Long Island primarily attacks pitch pine ( Pinus rigida); however, reports in New England have shown beetle attack also in red pine ( P. resinosa ), white glauca) . SPB is a serious pest of pines adapted to the southern United States; the furthest north this beetle had previously been recorded was Pennsylvania and New Jersey . However , changes in precipitation and temperature associated with climate change might be playing an important role in SPB population dynamics and expansion . Since SPB was detected on Long Island in October 2014 and in Connecticut in March 2015, i t has been found in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in summer 2015. The presence of SPB in New England represents a serious potential health threat to conifers that could have ecological impacts in forest and urban areas. The southern pine beetle is a bark beetle that is a primary pest that can attack and overcome healthy vigorous tre es when its population is large, and a secondary pest of weakened trees when beetle populations are low . Upon attacking a tree, SPB introduces several fungal species to the host phloem tissue to overcome tree resistance by disrupting water and nutrient mo vement within the tree . As beetles attack, trees attempt to defend (induced defense) by releasing resin flow (primary response) to pitch out the beetles, followed by a hypersensitive response (necrosis around the infection site) to contain fungal growth, and finally periderm formation for wound healing . These modifications are primarily modulated by chemical changes in monoterpene composition, phenolic and hormone accumulation, which highly vary between and within species, and are strongly dependent on the physiological status of the tree . Understanding plant defense mechanisms of our native and introduced conifer species is crucial for species conservation and beetle control . Although some mechanisms are constitutive, i.e., always present, others are in duced in response to beetle feeding and/or pathogen infection. It is likely that anatomical and biochemical responses to insects are crucial in the defense process, since plant responses often coincide with physiological processes for plant resistance . Thus, Drs . Adriana Arango and Claire Rutledge began a study of different anatomical (resin ducts formation) and chemical responses of red, white, scots and pitch pines, and Norway spruce attacked by SPB . In addition they will examine whether there is a correlation between changing climate conditions and SPB range expansion. This experimental work was Healthy pitch pine forest in Lyme. 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 conducted during spring and summer 2015 in several infested areas of Connecticut and Long Island. Anatomical and physiological characteristics were character ized by collecting core borer samples and inner bark for determination of monoterpenes and hormones content . Surveys of beetle presence and survival across Connecticut have been recorded in order to determine beetle success in northern climatic conditions . Preliminary results show differences in resin ducts occurrence in the secondary xylem of mature established trees. High amount of preformed (RD) and induced resin duc ts (TDR) were found in white pine, followed by pitch and red pine respectively . Presence of resin ducts can be correlated to higher resin flow that can prevent beetles from becoming established in the tree . Previous studies have shown that even though beetles are not pitched out immediately after arrival to the tree, the rate of gallery construction is related to the amount of resin encountered by the beetles . Accordingly, and based on our field observations, we can hypothesize that red pine might be the more sensitive species to SPB under low beetle populations . Compared with Long Island, where nearly 1,500 acres of pitch pine have been devastated, beetle population s in Connecticut seem low and scattered throughout the state, with about 250 attacked trees . This could be related to the lower temperatures encountered in Connecticut during the last winte r. Although SPB was first spotted in March 2015, SPB probably arrived in fall 2014. However, more surveys of SPB presence and phenotypical studies of these conifers are necessary to determine the possible permanent establishment of SPB in New England. In addition, basic questions such as the number of beetle generations per year, and the probability of new infestations remain unanswered . Cross sections of secondary xylem showing annual rings and vertical resin ducts . New England areas showing SPB attacks in different conifer species (circles), and positive traps for Massachusetts and Rhode Island (squares). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 143 Deicing and Salt Toxicity in Urban Trees Salt application, mainly sodium chloride along with calcium and magnes ium chlorides, spread as moistened salt or mixed with sand, is a common practice for deicing roads in southern New England. Between 40 -80 tons of salt per lane mile are applied on highways, from which 75- 90% enters roadside soils by runoff, splash, or air borne mist . As the salt content increases in the soil, soil structure changes and compaction can occur . Although maximum salt concentration is with in 10 m distance from the road, airborne salt spray can directly cause plant damage up to 50 m distance from roadsides . Using these rates and assuming the salt settles within 10 m of the highway, salt loading could average 2.3- 3.4 kg/m -2. Many important trees and shrubs species growing in street and highway roads (e.g., sugar maple, red maple, flowering dogwood, American sycamore, pin oak, honey locust, and eastern white pine) are very sensitive to high salt concentrations . Several studies suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and biochar applications might alleviate salt stress in plants by numerous mechanisms that improve rhizospheric and soil conditions, enhance nutrient acquisition, alter physiological and biochemical properties of the host, and increase water absorption capacity . Considering that species growing in urban settings are often closer than 10 m distance from the road where salt concentrations are highest, it is crucial to determine to what extent roadside trees are impacted by salt application , and to assess the potential ability of mycorrhizae and biochar to facilitate tree establishment and survival on saline or salt -affected sites. Based on these assumptions, Drs . Adriana Arango, Blaire Steven, and Wade Elmer are studying the impact of deicing application by evaluating soil salt concentration and microbial population to determine salt effect on plant performance . Three urban sites in New Haven with high automobile traffic (Whitney Ave nue and Sachem St reet), near a park and residential a rea (New H aven Country Club at Hartford Turnpike), and near a parking lot (Criscuolo Park at James St reet), were chosen using sugar maple ( Acer saccharum ) as plant model . At each location, soil samples (1 and 5 meters away from the road) were collected before, during and after snow fall to estimate soluble salt concentration . In addition to soil, roots were collected to analyze microbial population and determine salt effect after deicing applications . Beginning in summer 2015, physiological analyses of sugar maple response to salt toxic conditions will be examined and the effectiveness applying biochar and mycorrhizas for salt detoxification capacity will be evaluated. Soil sample collection at 1 and 5 meters from the road. Soil collected at 40 cm depth around tree roots. 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 It has been shown that soluble salts higher than 1500 mg/L can cause salt toxicity in trees by inducing physiological drought and plant damage . In our study, preliminary results of s oil total soluble salt found concentrations higher than 1500 mg/L after deicing applications for all three sites. Highest concentration of salt occurred during March (Julian days 70 to 90) when snow banks melted . This high concentration may have a toxic effect on root development as the tree prepares for spring growth. This study will continue during the winter of 2015- 2016. It will also include an examination of microbial populations and phenotypical analyses that are needed to correlate soils salinity levels with plant development in urban areas . Examination of a suitable mycorrhizal and biochar applications may allow us to develop better care practices for trees growing near roads were salt is used for deicing .

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 145 Forest Management The value of the forest to Connecticut is much more than the timber and other forest products . First and foremost, forests protect watersheds, aquifers and groundwater supplies that provide the bulk of our clean drinking water . Trees also provide air polluti on control, acting as giant filters to remove dust, particulates, and some airborne chemicals. In addition, trees cool our environment in the summer by recycling water and reflecting sunlight . Forests contribute to the character of Connecticut and add to our enjoyment throughout the year. The current epoch, described by many as the Anthropocene, finds human- mediated disturbance regimes creating novel plant community species complexes across significant swathes of the landscape . These new regimes include disturbance intervals that range from seasonally mowed hayfields to forests harvested every several decades, historically high local deer populations, nearly complete suppression of wildfire, and invasions by non- native plants . In addition, exotic insect s and diseases have devastated some native species in our region including the American chestnut, eastern hemlock, elms, and soon, ashes. Roadside Forest Management Less appreciated are the distinctive environmental conditions associated with roadside forests . These long, linear edge forests form a unique, hitherto unseen ecotone . The higher wind speeds associated with edge forests are amplified by vehicular traffic, especially along highwa ys with heavy truck traffic . Salt spray during the winter months can negatively impact sensitive evergreen species. While sodium chloride salt has been linked to sugar maple decline, calcium and magnesium chloride salts may have the opposite effect . Lastly, the periodic pruning of branches over utility wires or those extending into the traffic safety zone, along with removal of saplings and shrubs in those zones, precludes development of the characteristic soft edge that develops following a natural microburst or forest harvest. There are an estimated 7,600 miles of Connecticut roads that transverse forested landscapes. If we assume that the influence of a road extends 100 feet into the surrounding forest, then approximately 5% of our forests, or 92,000+ acres, can be considered roadside forests. The benefits of roadside trees are numerous and roadside forests, in part, define Connecticut's sense of place . However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential societal costs of losing power and communication along with road obstruction during severe weather. Although the expanse of roads and utility corridors through forested areas is enormous , proactive management has been minimal . Historically, management of roadside forests has largely been limited to utility pruning of branches within specified distances of lines, and occasional hazard tree removal . Few, if any, resources have been invested on management of the surrounding forest . The 100 feet of forest immediately adjacent to utility lin es and roads has traditionally been excluded from management activities, both by utility tree crews and by the managers of adjacent woodlands due to the understandable liability concern from accidently dropping a tree on a power line or the road. Roadside trees line many Connecticut roads and highways. 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward, with the ass istance J.P. Barsky, is part of a private/public/NGO partnership 'Stormwise' that is characterizing and develop ing management protocols for roadside forests . This partnership includes the private sector (Eversource Energy, United Illuminating, Connecticut Water Company), public and quasi -public entities (UConn, CAES, CT DEEP Forestry, CT DOT, South Central CT Regional Water Authority, Town of Manchester, NRCS), and NGO's (Audubon CT, CT Forest and Park Association, White Memorial Foundation) . Our goal is develop forest management protocols that will lead to responsibly managed, ecologically healthy, and aesthetically pleasing roadside forests. To characterize roadside forests, Dr. Ward and colleagues at UConn are completing the establishment of ten 1.6 ha (4.0 ac) demonstration areas located throughout the state . At each area, all trees with diameters greater than 12.7 cm (5 in) have been mapped and detailed information is being collected on their size, health, and factors that c ould predispose them to fail such as decay or lean . To examine the shrub stratum, all woody plants taller than 120 cm (4 ft) have been tallied by species and size on smaller subplots that are 10 and 30 m (33 and 99 ft) distant from utility lines . Vegetat ion shorter than 120 cm, including herbaceous guilds and invasives, have been assessed by measuring percent cover . These permanent plots will be periodically examined to monitor the dynamics of roadside plant communities both with and without Stormwise management. Similar adaptive management protocols to manage trees in roadside forests were developed by the State Vegetation Management Task Force (SVMTF) led by T homas Degnan and Jeff rey Ward, and by faculty at UConn. The proactive approach of Stormwise i s to foster healthy, storm -resistant roadside forests by melding arboricultural (individual tree care) and silvicultural (forest management) practices . Relative to trees, Stormwise vegetation management ideas are based in three very basic concepts: 1. Trees with room or space to grow are healthier trees. 2. Tree branches and twigs will grow and develop toward the sunlight. 3. Trees with the freedom to move in the wind will become more wind -firm. Our vision is to preserve the aesthetic benefits of forested roadsides while reduc ing damage during future severe storms and increas ing habitat diversity . Immediately adjacent to utility and road corridors, trees are pruned using ANSI A300 and at -risk trees are removed . To the interior, crop tree management is used to develop trees with wind- firm, open- grown characteristics along with subcanopies of short stature trees, native shrubs, and herbs . This is achieved by promoting the growth of open grown trees with crowns that are wide rather than tall, such as those in open fields . Species with decurrent growth (Acer, Fagus, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 147 Quercus) will be favored, while those with excurrent growth (Betula, Liriodendron, Pinus, Populus) will be selectively removed. Eight study areas have been established along 5 km of roadside fo rests. Lessons learned on tree selection and coordination from implementation at three areas are being incorporated into treatments scheduled at the remaining sites. Results of treatments and monitoring will be used to inform communities and stakeholders about the management of roadside forests. Impact: The storms in 2011 were estimated to have caused Connecticut more than $3 billion in economic losses. CGS Sec 16 -234a(4) recognized our work by designating the Right Tree -Right Place lists as the state s tandard of trees and shrubs compatible with utility infrastructure. Replacing urban/suburban roadside trees as they die with shorter Right Tree - Right Place species will impose not additional costs to property owners and towns . Recognizing the importanc e of our work for their forest management programs, Connecticut Water Company, the Town of Manchester, White Memorial Foundation, CT DEEP, and CT DOT have provided land and personnel assistance to establish the demonstration areas. Precommercial Crop Tree Release An underappreciated component of precommer cial crop tree release (PCT), indeed any crop tree release, is the inevitable partial release of trees other than selected crop trees (i.e., non -crop trees) . While the response of released crop trees i s increasing ly understood, few studies have examined the response of the non-crop trees . The effects of precommercial crop tree release at canopy closure on upper canopy persistence, mortality, and diameter growth over 25- years were examined on seven stud y areas established in Connecticut . Each area had nine 26 ft x 26 ft plots for each of two treatments: PCT and unmanaged controls . Sixty -three crop trees per acre were released by cutting all stems that had crowns adjacent to the crop trees. This result ed in the inadvertent partial release of 380 upper canopy, non- crop trees per acre . Diameters and crown classes of all stems (DBH > 0.8 inches) were measured annually (n=4,828) . For those stems in upper canopy at canopy closure, partial release did not i ncrease the proportion that remained in the upper canopy, excepting a small increase for red maple . Partial release increased proportion of both intermediate and suppressed oaks that ascended into the upper canopy . Partial release reduced mortality of bo th oaks and birches in the intermediate and suppressed crown classes . Partial release had no (oak) or minimal (<0.4 inch for red maple, birch) effect on 25- year diameter growth . Precommercial crop tree release can be used to increase survival and growth of quality oak saplings without deleteriously impacting stand diversity and growth. Impact: The increased diameter growth provided by precommercial crop tree release should optimize potential stand value and result in at least a 4% real rate of return by decreasing the time needed to reach minimal diameter of grade or veneer sawtimber. 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Cut Oak Stump Resprout Study When cut down, many tree species put root energy reserves into forming new sprouts from latent buds on the stump . In the past, t hese stump resprouts are a n integral part of a regenerating forest . However, in Connecticut, it is not known how many of these resprouts successfully reach the upper canopy largely due to overbrowsing by white -tailed deer . As a result, Drs. Scott Williams and Jeffrey Ward, in collaboration with the Wildlife Division of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, selected five sites throughout the state (Bozrah, Burlington, Guilford, Litchfield, and Madison) where timber management has recently occurred . Three of the five sites were recently clearcut for New England cottontail ( Sylvilagus transitionalis ) habitat, a fourth was part of a timber sale, and the fifth is part of a forest stand rehabilitation project . A total of 187 oak stumps were identified, measured, and numbe red. We used 6' fence to individually enclose half of the stumps, effectively isolating them from browsing deer . Additionally, half of those stumps fenced from deer have three 8\" x 12\" holes cut into the fence at ground level to permit cottontail rabbit access to resprouts . In spring 2014, a n additional 10 resprouting stumps were fenced at each location except for Guilford to improve sample size as only about half of monitored stumps actually produced sprouts . We will be able to determine the impact browsing deer have on limiting regeneration of oak resprouts and will be able to determine what impact rabbits are having as well after several growing seasons. While still too early to differentiate impacts to oak regeneration by rabbits and deer, some di fferences are evident in those stumps that were fenced and those that were not . One year after fences were erected, there were 111 stumps that had viable sprouts. Stumps that were not fenced averaged more resprouts/stump (17) than did unfenced stumps (10) . However, the average height of resprouts inside fences (59\") was nearly double those that were not fenced (32\") . Effectively, rabbits and deer will continue to browse available resprouts and keep them suppressed while fenced resprouts will continue to grow and have the potential to rejoin the forest canopy. Impact: Oak is a valuable commodity for both the timber industry as well as a source of hard mast for native wildlife species. Protecting new oak stump sprouts with portable cages could be a viabl e alternative to area- wide fencing for maintaining oak as a significant component of forests in areas with high deer abundance . Deer Herbivory Exclosure Study One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vegetation protected from white -tailed deer ( to unprotected plots . Drs . Scott Williams and Jeffrey Ward are collecting vegetation data within sixteen deer exclosures and sixteen adjacent control plots th roughout the state . Deer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within . Growth rates and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation . The project is a colla borative effort with The Nature Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures (and adjacent control plots), at Burnham Brook Preserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement in Salem, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 149 and Devil's Den Preserve in Weston . We are also including four of our own exclosures on South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Plots have been sampled for herbaceous species cover in spring of 2006 - 2015. Late summer sampling was conducted from 2005 - 2014 and included all w oody and herbaceous plants . Preliminary data analyses indicate that herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than control plots . Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plots . All loca tions will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2015. Results from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. Impact: Overabundant herds of white -tailed deer negatively affect forest regeneration by repeated herbivory. This in turn will negatively affect the future of the timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut . The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut uses these data to scientifically justify and document the results of their deer management program by educating their constituency on the negative impacts of overabundant white -tailed deer on the very forest flora and fauna they are charged with protecting . The Nature Conservancy also uses these dat a as a benchmark with which to monitor and compare noticeable browse damage on other properties which may require deer reduction. Interaction of Deer Browse Impacts and Barberry Infestations While both invasive species and cervid herbivory are recognized as locally important drivers of plant community dynamics, few studies have examined whether their effects on plant community structure and dynamics are synergistic, additive, or antagonistic. Beginning in 2007, Drs . Jeffrey Ward and Scott Willi ams began a study examining the interaction of invasive shrubs and cervid herbivory, primarily Japanese barberry Zimmermann) respectively, on development of herbaceous and shrub layers. At three locations, invasive shrubs were either treated three times (I 3, initial mechanical cutting in March followed by directed flame of new ramets with propane torches in July and October), once (I 1, single mechanical cutting in March), or we re not treated (I 0). After the initial mechanical cutting, half of each treatment area was protected from deer herbivory with a 2.3 m polyethylene fence (F -fenced, U -unprotected) resulting in six treatment combinations I 3F, I 3U, I 1F, I 1U, I0F, and I 0U. Within each of the six treatment combinations, percent coverage estimates for all shrub, vine, and herbaceous species were completed at ten 4 m2 sample points in early summer from 2007- 2013. Species were combined into nine guilds for analysis: annuals/biennials, short perennial forbs, tall perennial forbs, ferns, graminoids, native woody shrubs, invasive shrubs, native woody vines, and invasive woody vines. Repeated measures analysis found no significant invasive control -browse exclusion interaction in changes of cover over the 6 -year period for any guild, indicating no synergistic effects . However, changes in cover were influenced by invasive control for short perennial forbs, invasive shrubs, and native vines; by browse exclusion for graminoi ds and annual/biennials; and by both invasive control and browse exclusion (i.e., effects were additive) for invasive vines and native shrubs. Using volume as an alternative metric, invasive control -herbivory exclusion interactions were noted for invasive vines, native shrubs, tall perennial forbs, and graminoids . For the first three guilds, volumes were greater only with both invasive 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 shrub control and herbivory exclusion. Graminoid cover was also greatest where invasive shrubs were controlled, but in c ontrast, outside of the exclosures. Our results suggest that deer at high densities function as keystone herbivores that create underutilized growing space by intensively browsing susceptible species, especially native shrubs. Invasive shrubs initially e stablish as passengers in degraded systems. The invasive shrubs were able to become the predominant species because while they are browsed, they are able to continue to grow . Once invasive shrubs have formed well -established thickets, they function as backseat drivers because the recalcitrant thickets quickly recover from a disturbance that kills all aboveground tissues - regardless of whether herbivore pressure is high or absent . These recalcitrant thickets severely limit growth of shorter stature speci es by capturing most of the available light, and as other studies have shown, by altering soil biota and chemistry . Until the introduction of effective biological controls, it is likely that invasive shrubs will continue to dominate sites where they are established and spread across the landscape. Impact: Both the invasive shrub Japanese barberry and native white -tailed deer can have detrimental impacts on Connecticut's native forested ecosystems. Information on invasive control and growth characteristic s has been provided to media outlets ( WNPR, WFSB -3, Landscape Architecture magazine, CT Post, The Daily Voice, Brainerd Communications), numerous associations (CT, NY, VT, MA), 10 government agencies (CT, VT, WI, NC), 8 towns, and 9 private companies/utili ties. Restoration of native communities was important for 83% of land trusts that implemented invasive control programs on at least 925 acres in Connecticut since 2010. Japanese Barberry Infestations Serve as a Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks In many Connecticut forests with an overabundance the dominant understory shrub. This exotic invasive provides habitat favorable to blacklegged tick ( To determine mouse and larval tick abundances at six replicate sites, Drs. Scott Williams and Jeffrey Ward have been trapping mice since 2007 in unmanipulated dense barberry infestations, areas where barberry was controlled, and areas where barberry was minimal or absent . The number of feeding larval ticks/mouse was recorded . Adult and nymphal ticks were sampled along permanent draglines within each treatment area, retained, and were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease in humans and pets. To date, there have been 2, 134 white -footed mice captures. The number of captured mice did not differ between treatments. However, the average number of feeding larval ticks per mouse was highest on mice captured in dense barberry ( 6.1 larvae/mouse) . Adult tick densities in dense barberry (23 0/acre) were higher than in both controlled barberry (118/acre) and no barberry (68 /acre) areas. Ticks sampled from full barberry infestations and controlled barberry areas had similar infection prevalence with B . burgdorferi , 53 and 49% respectively . Adult tick infection prevalence with B . burgdorferi varied widely between treatments and study areas, but was lowest in areas where barberry was absent and generally lower where barberry was controlled . This in concert with the overall reduction in the adult tick cohort in areas where barberry was controlled resulted in 14 8 B. burgdorferi -infected ticks/acre in dense barberry, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 151 69/acre where barberry was controlled, and 40 /acre where barberry was absent. Results indicate that managing Japanese barberry will have a positive effect on public health by reducing the number of B. burgdorferi -infected blacklegged ticks that can develo p into motile life stages that commonly feed on humans . Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for several more years to monitor long -term effects of controlling Japanese barberry . Impact: This research scientifically documented the negat ive impacts an invasive plant has on human health . Forest managers have used it to strengthen their argument for the increased need to control invasive plants . Applied invasive plant control will also reduce the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme di sease in humans and domesticated animals. In the past five years, 69% of land trusts responding to our survey in spring 2015 indicated that they have treated barberry on 530 acres and other invasive species on another 800 acres . In addition, various enti ties in the states of Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont have used these results to educate and in part to justify equipment purchase and initiate or reinvigorate invasive plant control programs . Lastly, towns in Connecticut as well as the states of Delaware and Maryland and the Province of British Columbia have used our research linking deer and invasive plants to justify their respective deer management programs. Deer Repellent Trial Herbivory by white -tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) can be the source of significant agricultural, nursery, and managed landscape damage. Where deer cannot be managed by regulated hunting, repellents may be a reasonable alternative. Dr . Scott Williams, assisted by Michael Short, is testing a repellent formulation (Bobbex\u00ae) on produce that is often grown in backyard vegetable gardens including beans, tomatoes, and bell peppers . Commercial deer repellents currently available are not registered for use on produce meant for human consumption due to potential allergens included in formulations . However, this experimental formulation does not contain these allergens. Two garden plots utilizing raised bed construction were located in residential areas with a known large local deer population based on aerial survey data and homeowner reports . One plot is on private property near Mulberry Point in Guilford, CT and another on Gallows Hill Road in Redding, CT . At each location, there are three treatments: positive control (fenced plants), negative control (no treatment), and treated plants (sprayed with repellent as dictated) . At each location, there are 4 plants each for each treatment . Tomato, pepper, and bean plants were germinated in a greenhouse at the appropriate time, hardened off in a cold frame at Lockwood Farm, and transplanted to field study plots . Plants will be treated with the repellent formulation as dictated throughout the study . The e xperiment will run for 60 days, through June and July and into August if needed. Plants will be checked weekly, or as needed to rate damage. Marketable produce will be harvested once a week or as needed . Count and weight of marketable produce will be determined in the field with harvest continuing through August . Field plots at each location will measure approximately 12' x 16' (192 ft 2) with approximately 4' spacing between treatments . Repellent effectiveness will be defined as the dry mass difference for each cohort for each treatment. Impact: Browse damage from overabundant h erds of white -tailed deer cause the Connecticut nursery and landscape industry $1.5- $2 million in direct damages to plants prior to sale at nurseries and garden centers as well as $1 million in lost sales to homeowners discouraged by repeated deer damage annually . Formulations to limit deer damage could limit Connecticut nursery loses by $1.1- $1.5 million and could improve sales by $750,000 annually. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 New Crops Program Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers durin g a time of changing agriculture in Connecticut . Today, about 11,000 acres on 733 farms in Connecticut are devoted to vegetable production with a cash value of 30.2 million dollars . This compares to 19.1 million dollars from 582 farms in 2002. Seventy -nine percent of these farms are less than 100 acres in size; sixty -three percent are less than 50 acres in size. With numerous small farms, there is a need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops . In addition, small farm sizes in Connect icut have resulted in marketing shifts from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 313 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms, where a variety of fruit, vegetables, nursery stock, and Christmas trees are offered . About 36 of these are open all year . Nearly 20% of these farms offer pick -your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of harvest labor . These savings are passed on to the consumer . The development of a network of farme rs' markets in Connecticut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' markets must be \"Connecticut Grown .\" Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonab le prices to urbanites who cannot travel to the farms . Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups are generally sold at these markets. According to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, there were 143 farmers' markets in 2013, attended by over 400 farmers compared to 87 markets in 2007, a 64% increase . As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connecticut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops . Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vege tables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands . A recent survey of vegetable growers by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station showed that over 70 vegetable crops are currently being grown in Connecticut . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers since 1982 . Over 50 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 publications . Results have been, and continue to be, communicated to growers at meetings and farm visits . Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include globe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes , specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos . Research included cultivar trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut . Crops that were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. Specialty Pepper Trials: Specialty peppers include both hot and sweet varieties of unusual shape, size, or color . Colored peppers have extra flavor, nutrition, and aesthetic appeal, and therefore command a higher market price. Most colored peppers are obtained by leaving the fruits on the bush until they reach mature color (red, yellow, orange) . Others, such as banana pepper, are pale yellow even when immature. Green bell peppers are high in vi tamin C (one medium green bell pepper contains 177 percent of the RDA for vitamin C) . As they mature and sweeten (turn color), the vitamin A content rises 9 -fold while the vitamin C content doubles . In 2014, Dr . Maynard evaluated 10 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 153 varieties of specialt y peppers on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: King Arthur's Hybrid (red) (6.4 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields followed by Early Sunsation (yellow) (5.6 lbs/plant), Lilac (red) (4.6 lbs/plant), and Golden Calwonder (yellow) (4.3 l bs/plant) . At a retail price of $2.49/lb, there is a potential crop value of $101,233/acre . The long -term benefits of growing specialty peppers include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands . In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume colored bell peppers . Fifty -three percent of Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now growing specialty peppers. Specialty Melons Trials: Specialty melons may b e defined as members of the cucurbit family whose fruit may be large, have unique flavors, and command a high price in the marketplace . In commercial trade, specialty melons are often referred to as \"mixed melons\" and include canary, Crenshaw, casaba, Christmas, and Persian melons . In 2014, Dr . Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of eleven cultivars of specialty melons at Windsor and Lockwood Farm . Included in the trials were three galia cultivars, two canary cultivars, two cultivar . Three honeydew cultivars were also included because they demand higher prices in the marketplace than cantaloupe. Impact: Early Dew (honeydew) (19.1 lbs/plant), Arava (galia) (canary) (12.2 Earl Hybrid (Crenshaw) (16.6 lbs/plant), and Savor (charentais) (9.4 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields . Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and profits for the grower . For honeydew melons, by growing the cultivar Early Dew instead of Honey Brew, the grower can produce 18,876 more pounds per acre or 4,390 more melons per acre . At a retail price of $2.50/melon, the grower could potentially gross almost $11,000 more per acre by growing Early Dew instead of Honey Brew . The long- term benefits o f growing specialty melons include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands . Almost half of all vegetable growers in Connecticut grow melons. Broccoli Trials: Broccoli is one of the most popular vegetables all over the world and has long been regarded as one of the super foods packed with tremendous health benefits . Cultivar trials of broccoli were first conducted at the Experiment Station in 1986- 1988 with additional trials in 1993- 1995 and 2000- 2002. In these trials, over 100 cultivars were evaluated . Most of the cultivars tested are no longer available from seed companies. To evaluate yield and quality of broccoli cultivars released since 2002, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars for spring harvest at Windsor and Mt . Carmel. Impact: Maximo (1.3 lbs/head), Avenger (1.3 lbs/head), Blue Wind (1.2 lbs/head), and Imperial (1.2 lbs/head) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $1.99/lb, there is a potenti al crop value of $25,508/acre . Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and profits for the grower . By growing Avenger instead of Concord, the grower can produce almost 8,500 more pounds per acre to gross almost $17,000 more per acre . The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers in the spring, especially those who attend farmers ' markets in urban areas. Over half of all vegetable growers in Connecticut grow broccoli. Sweet Corn Trials: Among all vegetables grown in Connectic ut, sweet corn ranks first in acres grown and cash value. Supersweet corn trials were conducted from 1995 to 1998 at CAES . Of the 22 cultivars evaluated, only 5 remain for sale . Trials including new varieties developed in the last 15 years will provide important information to the over 300 Connecticut farms who grow sweet corn. In 2014, Dr . Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of 5 varieties of sweet corn planted May 1 and June 1 at Windsor and Lockwood Farm . In addition, cool soil percent germinati on will be determined from the early (May 1) planting. 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Impact: Temptation had the greatest germination (92%) at Windsor for the early May 1 planting while Xtra Tender 274A had the greatest germination at Lockwood Farm (75%) . Espresso (129 ears/20 ft) had the greatest yields when averaging both plantings at both sites followed by Quickie (102 ears/20 ft) . At a retail price of $0.60/ear, there is a potential crop value of $67,431/acre . Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and profits for th e grower . By growing Espresso instead of Xtra Tender 274A, the grower can produce over 75,000 more ears per acre or over $45,000 more per acre . The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers in the spring and early summer, especially those who attend farmers ' markets in urban areas. Kabocha Trials: Kabocha is a generic term for squash in Japan, but in North America, kabocha is a specific type of winter squash . It has a hard, dull, bumpy dark green shell marked with pale, celery green striations . Round with a flattened top, it ranges from one to eight pounds, but generally averages two to three pounds . It has a brilliant yellow -orange flesh with a naturally sweet flavor and texture similar to pumpkin and sweet potato. Kabocha is harvested when immature with dry, bland- tasting, pale yellow flesh . It must be ripened for about 6- 12 weeks after it is harvested in order to enhance sweetness and maturity with a bright orange color . Two cultivars of kabocha were included in our winter squash t rials in 1997- 1998 but there are now over 20 cultivars on the market including both regular and new smaller (1 lb) personal -sized types. In 2014, Dr . Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of eleven cultivars of kabocha squash. Included in the trials were 8 short -vined and 3 long -vined varieties as well as 3 personal -sized varieties. Impact: Geisha (17.2 lb/plant) and Gold Nugget (12.8 lb/plant) had the greatest yields . Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and grower profits. By growi ng Geisha instead of the traditional Autumn Cup, the grower can produce 71,874 more pounds per acres . At a retail price of $0.69/lb, the grower can gross almost $50,000 more per acre by growing Geisha . The long -term benefits of growing kabocha squash inc lude an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands . Almost half of all vegetable growers in Connecticut grow winter squash. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Depart ment of Agriculture survey noted that sweet potato is one of the most popular specialty vegetables. Sweet potato is called yam in the South. North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading US producers, but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut . This crop has both a high market value and an expanding market . In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C . In 2014, Dr. Maynard evaluated four cultivars that have short maturities (90 days) at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Beauregard (2.3 lbs/plant) averaged the greatest yields with 77% of the tubers rated at number 1 or Jumbo in size . This is in comparison to the other cultivars where only about half of the tubers were rated number 1 or Jumbo. At a retail price of $0.79/lb, there is a potential crop value of $26,565/acre . Beauregard is the most popular cultivar grown in Connecticut with forty -one percent of the surveyed vegetable growers including sweet potatoes at their farms. The long -term benefits of growing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. Sweet potato field The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 155 Sheet Composting of Oak and Map le Leaves Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer unde composed leaves on their fields and simply plow the leaves under . This is called sheet composting . Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants . There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting operation . This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predominance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr . Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994- 2013 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling . In 2014, eggplant was grown with all plots receiving the same amount (1300 lbs/A) of 10 -10-10 fertilizer . Yields from plots amended with oak leaves were compared to plo ts amended with maple leaves and the unamended controls . The greatest eggplant yields were from plots amended with oak leaves (12.4 lbs/plant) followed by plots amended with maple leaves (9.7 lbs/plant) and the unamended control plots (7.6 lbs/plant) . On ion yields from the plots amended with oak leaves were greater (5.4 lbs /10 ft row) than yields from plots amended with the unamended control (3.7 lbs/10 ft row) and maple leaves and (2.4 lbs/10 ft row) . Lettuce yields from the leaf-amended plots were vir tually the same (0.8 lbs/head) compared to the unamended control (0.7 lbs/head). Impact: Many Connecticut homeowners are now disposing of their oak and maple leaves in their gardens without worrying about any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens. Incorporating tree leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the soil and reducing the volume of material in the solid waste collection and disposal system . 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Sonic and Electrical Resistance Tomography in the Assessment of Internal Decay in Living Northern Hardwoods The goal of Dr. Robert E. Marra's project , funded with a Nat ional Science Foundation grant through the EaGER (Early Grants for Exploratory Research) program, is to evaluate the use of sonic and electrical resistance tomography (SoT and ERT, respectively) in the assessment of the extent and magnitude of internal dec ay in living trees. SoT measures differences in the velocity of sound, which correlates to the extent of decay. ERT measures differences in electrical conductivity, which correlates to the amount of water present, and can identify incipient stages of decay. Last year's field work at Great Mountain Forest (GMF), in Norfolk, CT, was completed in early July of 2014, where Dr. Marra and co- PI Dr. Nicholas Brazee of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, performed tomography at three cross- sectional levels (50, 100, and 150 cm above ground) on approximately 18 trees of each of the three principle northern hardwood species - American beech ( Fagus grandifolia After trees were felled and \"cookies\" cut at the tomographic cross -sections, the cookies were air -dried for several months. With assistance from Mr. Michael Ammirata, the cookies were then planed, sanded, and photographed, for direct comparison to tomographic images (Figure 1) . From each cookie, wood was volumetrically sampled along three transects, taking samples that represented different levels of decay as indicated by SoT color category (Figure 2). Over 500 wood samples were analyzed by Gas Chromatographic Elemental Analy sis (GCEA) for carbon (C) content, which was used to calculate C density (concentration of C by volume), the data from which allowed us to confirm the hypothesis that C density decreases with sonic velocity, and that tomography alone (i.e., without destructive sampling) can be used to estimate C loss. Figure 1. SoT (top right), ERT (bottom right) images, and photograph of the cookie associated with the tomography (middle right) from the 50cm level of a sugar maple sampled at the Great Mountain Forest research site. Images in upper left and lower left show the t omograms overlaid with a semi -transparent version of the cookie photograph. Colors in the SoT image progress from dark brown, which indicates high sonic velocities typical of dense, nondecayed wood, through decreasing velocities represented respectively b y green, magenta, and blue. Colors in the ERT image progress from red, which indicates high resistance to electrical current, to dark blue, which indicates a low level of resistance to current. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 157 Dr. Shawn Fraver, a forest ecologist and dendrochronologist at the University of Maine, and co-PI on this project, estimated the ages of a subset of the trees used in this study. Based on his analysis of tree rings, the trees on the site ranged in age from 68 years old (a yellow birch) to 192 years old (a sugar maple). The tree ages will be used to calculate a lifetime rate of C loss. Impact: As forests are increasingly looked upon to sequester and store atmospheric carbon, it is essential that all components of carbon cycling be considered in the carbon balance models that are used to assess and quantify the role of fores ts in carbon sequestration. The results of this project will constitute an important first step in Dr. Marra's long- term goals of addressing these critical missing components, and contributing data that will be relevant to other ecologists and carbon bala nce modelers. Bacterial and Fungal Community Diversity Associated with Internal Decay The goal of this project is to use next -gen sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the bacterial and fungal diversity associated with a temporal gradient of decay. The hypothesis is that the microbial communities will change along the gradient. This project takes advantage of the many tree stumps remaining after the tree removals described in the \"Internal Decay\" project described above. In November 2014, Dr. Marra returned to the Great Mountain Forest site to take wood samples from each of three sugar maple stumps. After removing 1 -2 cm from the exposed surface, samples were obtained by drilling deeply into the stumps along radial transects that ranged from wood with no visible signs of decay near the perimeter, towards the center and more advanced stages of decay (Figure 3). DNA has been extracted from these wood samples; nex -gen sequencing and bioinformatics will be completed in collaboration with Dr. Blaire Steven. This preliminary study will be used to provide \"proof -of-concept\" data for a grant proposal that will address a larger sample that includes, in addition to sugar maple, yellow birch and American beech. Impact: Little if anything is known about the ecology and diversity of the microbial communities associated with internal decay in trees. This \"pilot\" project will be the first to explore this uncharted territory, using the tools afforded by next-gen sequencing and bioinformatics. Figure 2. Technician M. Ammirata drilling wood samples for GCEA analysis. Figure 3. A sugar maple stump used in sampling for a metagenomics study of microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversity associated with internal decay. Sampling occurred along three transects, A, B, and C, extending from areas with no (or little) evident decay near the perimeter (\"1\") to more advanced decay (\"4\"). 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Species Diversity of Fusarium found on Spartina alterniflora in North America, China, and South America. Dr. Marra completed an extensive phylogenetic analysis of 24 Fusarium isolates cultured by Dr. Wade Elmer from Spartina alterniflora growing in salt marshes in North America, South America, and China (S. alterniflora is native to only eastern North America). The Maximum Likelihood 1000- bootstrap analysis used partial gene sequences of DNA -directed RNA polymerase II subunits 1 ( RPB1 ) and 2 (RPB2 ), together comprising nearly 4 kilobases of informative sequences; these gene regions are well established for their informativeness in phylogenetic placement at higher taxonomic lev els. Included in this alignment and analysis were sequences from nearly 800 isolates, provided by Dr. Kerry O'Donnell, USDA -ARS. The 24 isolates from S. alterniflora were chosen based on their phylogenetic placement in an earlier study using morphology and partial sequences from the translation elongation factor ( EF-1) gene. Nine of these isolates were previously identified as F. palustre , the pathogen of S. alterniflora recently identified by Elmer and Marra. Each of the remaining 15 isolates was ch osen as representative of an EF-1 clade whose phylogenetic placement was ambiguous. The RPB1 /RPB2 analysis revealed several important findings: (i) two of the putatively F. palustre isolates (one from Connecticut, the other from China) are actually F. armeniacum , and another, from Louisiana, is likely a new species; (ii) an isolate from China that clustered with, but is distinct from, F. kyushuense, is likely a new species; (iii) an isolate from a Connecticut saltmarsh that clusters near to, but distinct from, F. palustre , yet is morphologically distinct from F. palustre , is likely a new species; (iv) of the seven isolates from Argentina, each representing a different EF-1 clade, at least three isolates likely represent a new species, while the other four belong to well-established but poorly resolved species complexes. Impact: These findings reinforce the growing understanding that the Fusarium genus is exceedingly compl ex, and that morphology alone cannot identify species richness within the genus. Furthermore, while highly conserved genes such as EF -1 are considered appropriate for species resolution, within the Fusarium genus it is not necessarily sufficient for this purpose. Neonectria Canker caused by Neonectria ditissima (prev. Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) continues to be researched by Dr. Marra. This project focuses on the ecology and genetics of the causal agent of perennial target canker, the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima . The goal is to gain a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, population dynamics, and host -interactions of N. ditissima , particularly with respect to its princip al hosts, black and yellow birch ( Betula lenta and B. alleghaniensis ). Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an essential component to effective management strategies. Dr. Marra has developed the field techniques and laboratory tools necessary to the study of this fungus and the disease it causes, and has used these tools and methods to examine the relationship between mating system and genetic structure. Previously, Dr. Marra developed and used a set of 13 polymorphi c microsatellite markers to study mating and genetic differentiation in N. ditissima from two nearly adjacent sites at West Rock Ridge State Park in New Haven, CT. This study revealed a paradoxical juxtaposition of high levels of genetic diversity alongsi de high levels of selfing and biparental inbreeding. The results confirm an earlier hypothesis that N. ditissima has a \"mixed mating system\" (selfing and outcrossing occurring in the same population). In order to test the hypothesis that these observations of selfing are possibl y the result of high levels of biparental inbreeding, we continue the process of evaluating putatively self -fertilized sets of progeny using AFLPs. Impact: Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 159 caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer. Our efforts to more fully understand the biology and natural history of N. ditissima is an important contribution in the fields of mycology and evolutionary biology, and will contribute to the identification and utilization of control strategies. An important result of this research is that they are the first to demonstrate, in a fungus, empirical support for theoretical models that posit the importance of biparental inbreeding to the evolutionary stability of mixed mating. Boxwood Blight Building on previous work developing and optimizing realtime PCR and other nucleic acid- based assays for blight pathogen, Calonectria pseudonaviculata of the Boxwood Blight Working Group, with assistance from M. Ammirata, has for the past year been focusing on the transcriptomics of fungicide resistance. The ultimate goal of this project is the development of rapid realtime allelic discrimination assays targetin g gene mutations associated with reduced sensitivity to the two princip al classes of fungicides\u2014 demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and the control of boxwood blight. This work has been predicated on observations of r educed sensitivity to select DMIs and QoIs reported for a European clade of C.ps. known as G2, which has since been elevated to separate species status, and named C. henricotiae (Ch). The reported fungicide sensitivity differentials are being tested in th e laboratory using in vitro radial growth assays on solid media amended with the target fungicide at different concentrations (Figure 4). Results have confirmed that among the DMIs tested to date, Ch has reduced sensitivity, relative to Cps, to tetraconaz ole and propiconazole, but not tebuconazole, and among the QoIs tested, reduced sensitivity to kresoxim -methyl but not pyraclostrobin. The absence of \"cross- resistance\" \u2014 reduced sensitivity to all fungicides within a class based on identical modes of actio n within the class \u2014 for both DMIs and QoIs suggests that the mechanisms for reduced sensitivity in Ch are complex, and require further study. The CYP51 gene paralogs, CYP51A and CYP51B , are known in other plant and human fungal pathogens to mediate resistance to DMI fungicides. With the genome sequences of both Cps and Ch available for Figure 4 . Sensitivity of C. henricotiae (Ch) and C. pseudonaviculata (Cps) to increasing concentrations DMI fungicides, propiconazole (top) and tebuconazole (bottom). Ch has reduced sensitivity to propiconazole, but not tebuconazole, demonstrating the absence of cross -resistance within the DMI class of fungicides. 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Figure. A storm in October 2014 with wind gusts exceeding 40 mph destroyed the netting used to protect grapes from bir ds study, Dr. Marra along with colleague Dr. Jon Hulvey at the University of Massachusetts Amherst took a comparative genomics approach to explore the relationship between CYP51A and CYP51B gene sequences and differential sensitivity to tetraconazole and propiconazole. An important finding from this research is that CYP51A in Cps, but not Ch, has an interna l stop codon, and is therefore nonfunctional. Therefore, only the CYP51B gene product is expressed in Cps . Since both genes are known to have redundant functions, the expression of only CYP51B in Cps. may partially explain the increased sensitivity to te traconazole and propiconazole. The CYP51B gene is not implicated in the observed differential sensitivity because the amino acid sequences of the CYP51B protein are identical between Cps and Ch. However, it is possible that differences between Cps and Ch in CYP51B expression levels may play a role in differential sensitivity between the two species. In anticipation of the need to explore the entire transcriptome for differences in gene expression related to fungicide sensitivity, Dr. Marra and M. Ammirata have been experimenting with reliable methods for extraction of RNA of a quality suitable for next -gen sequencing. A valuable conclusion from these efforts has been the importance of how the fungal tissue is handled prior to extraction. Impact: Boxwood is an important part of the landscape in the United States and in Connecticut, where it is also a significant part of the wholesale nursery industry. Because of the heavy reliance on fungicides among growers and landscape professionals for the con trol of boxwood blight, the likelihood of the development of resistance is great. Molecular markers targeting resistance genes will permit the detection of resistance in its incipient stages, thereby informing management strategies and reducing the risk o f that resistance becoming established in the population. Winegrapes in Connecticut Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino is continuing the project, \"Coordinated wine grape variety evaluations in the eastern USA,\" which was ini tiated by Dr. Nail in 2008. Thirty -two different winegrape varieties are planted at Lockwood Farm (Hamden, CT) and the V alley Laboratory (Windsor , CT). These plantings are evaluated for plant vigor, fruit yield and chemistry , and relative susceptibility to disease. The intent of this project is to provide a coordinated approach to the evaluation and dissemination of knowledge gained by cooperator evaluation of existing and newly released wine grape varieties in the eastern USA. The coordination is fostered by cooperator involvement in the USDA/CSREES proj ect, \"NE and clones\" (http://www.ngwi.org/ ). Over the past 7 years, more than 60% of the tender vinifera cultivars (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Dornfelder) have died due to sub- zero temperatures in January before adequate protecti ve snow cover was established. The maintenan ce of the 1- acre plot at Lockwood Farm in Hamden has presented some logistic difficulties. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 161 . Impact: Growers are informed as to the relative merits of winegrape cultivars before planting. The planting of a vineyard requires a large investment ($3,000/acre) with no expected return for at least 3 years. Thus the choice of a suitable cultivar is critical to the eventual success of such an enterprise. Mod eling for Plant Diseases Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his work on 3D Lagrangian Stochastic Simulation for turbulent flows in hedgerow canopies in collaboration with Dr. D. E. Aylor. These simulations are program med in Microsoft Visual Studio. The verification of such models demands direct measuremen t of turbulent wind statistics. 3D-sonic anemometers are deployed in the vineyard to collect this information. Impac t: Improved models of spore dispersal enable better predictions of the spread of disease. Remote -Sensing Weather Stations Dr. Ferrand ino has maintained three remote- sensing weather stations located on the CAES research farms (Hamden, Windsor, and Griswold, CT). In the past year , a number of sensors have proved faulty and had to be replaced, however all sites are operational now. Weather data from the CA ES farms and Gouveia Vineyards are available at: https://www.hobolink.com/s/d0696 313715dd96f86b25f3552cc1f47 . This link is available on the CAES website. Each weather station measures temperature, relative humidity, sunlight, wind speed and direction, rainfall, leaf wetness , and soil temperature every 15 minutes. The data are sent back to a central location once per hour where it is accessible via the Internet. The resultant data are used to calculate disease risk assessment reports, which are made available to growers via Internet post ings and direct Email alerts. On-site weather station data are used to calculate Anemometers measure wind information in a 'Pinot gris' vineyard at Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT . Weather station at Newport , RI. 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 disease risk assessments, wh ich are delivered to the winegr ape growers on a weekly basis. Early in the season, disease risk assessments are also used in conjunction with scouting of each vineyard to assess inoculum levels that are critical for primary infections. Impact: Growers a re aler ted when disease risk is high. Early fungicide sprays are more efficacious and may reduce the need for later applications reducing overall use of chemicals. Monitor and Prevent Streptomycin Resistance in Fire Blight Pathogen Populations in New England Fire blight, caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora, is one of the most serious diseases currently limiting apple and pear production in Connect icut and in the United States. Application of the antibiotic streptomycin during bloom is by far the only management option available that provides a high level of control efficacy. The intensive, long- term use of streptomycin, however, has resulted in the evolution of streptomycin resistance in E. amylovora . Since the first report in California in 1971, streptomycin resistance has been commonly detected in E. amylovo ra in most apple producing regions of the United States, including Washington, Oregon, Michigan, and New York, making streptomycin ineffective in these locations. In 2014, severe fire blight outbreaks occurred throughout Connecticut and New England. Growers suspected that the streptomycin resistance may be present in the New England region. Funded by the NE -IPM Center, Dr. Quan Zeng is performing a regional survey to understand the streptomycin susceptibility of the fire blight pathogen populations in Ne w England. Fifty -two fire blight diseased samples as well as 55 apple and pear flower samples were collected and tested for the presence of E. amylovora and the streptomycin resistance gene strA -strB. Our results suggested that all E. amylovora isolates collected from CT, MA, VT, ME, RI, and NY ar e susceptible to streptomycin. However, the streptomycin resistance gene strA - strB was detected in environmental, non- pathogenic bacterial isolates in New England orchard s. These results suggest that streptomycin remains an effective manage ment option for fire blight in the New England region, although there is a potential risk of streptomycin resistance development in E. amylovora populations in New England orchards in the future, as the strA -strB genes may be able to transfer from the non- pathogenic , environmental bacteria into the fire blight pathogen E. amylovora. Impact: Apples and pears are economically important commodities in the United States and Connecticut. According to recent U.S. census data, apples and pears are grown on 142,000 and 24,300 hectares nationally, with cash receipt values exceeding $2.2 billion and $355 million, respect ively (USDA -NASS 2008). Annual losses to fire blight and costs of control in the United States are estimated at over $100 million. Results from this research will provide valuable information regarding if streptomycin is still effective in the New Englan d region. Efforts will also be made to prevent and restrict the spread of streptomycin resistance in E. amylovora populations through grower education. A.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 163 Understand ing the Disease Emergence and Pathogen Evolution of Bacterial Etiolation and Decline of Cre eping Bentgrass Creeping bentgrass is one of the most commonly used grass species on golf course puttin g greens in the United States. Since 2009, grass decline with symptoms of wilting, necrosis, and etiolation were consistently observed on creeping bent grass o n many golf courses in the \"transiti on zone\" of the United States. Later , the causal agent of this disease was diagnosed as a bacterial pathogen Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae (Aaa). However, how this disease was started and spread was unknown. Two possibilities are : 1) The pathogens are dispersed from contaminated grass seeds from a single source, and 2) The pathogens emerged from parallel evolution at various geographical locations. Dr. Zeng, i n collaboration with Dr. Paul Giordano and Dr. Nathaniel Mitkowski, collected 28 Aaa strains from diseased creeping bent grass from 14 states in the U.S. Draft genomes of 12 Aaa strains were sequenced, assembled, and annotated. From the genome sequences, we demonstrated that numerous gene insertion, inversion, and mutation events occurred in all 12 strains isolated from v arious geographical locatio ns. This suggests that the disease likely emerged through parallel evolutions at different geographical locations. Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and comparative genomics methods, we identified that the 12 turf pathogenic Aaa isolates are closel y related with maize pathogenic and rice pathogenic Aaa isolates, with a significant ly lower number of type 3 secretion effectors 10; Ac melon: 19), an important virulence factor of bacterial pathogens. This suggests that the Aaa strains that infect turf may share the same ancestor as Aaa strains that infect maize and rice. The small number of effectors also suggests that the turf pathogenic Aaa strains are likely at the emerging st age of the pathogen evolution. This observation is consistence with the much earlier cultivation time of maize and rice compared to turf grass, large scale cultivation of which didn't start until the early 1900s when golfing gained its popularity in the United States. Impact: The g olf industry is an important component of the economy in the United States and Connecticut. The total size of Connecticut's golf economy was est imated at $638 million in 2008. Understanding the disease emergence of bacterial etiolation and decline w ill help restrict the spread of this important disease on golf courses and develop effective de tection and management options. Purine and Pyrimidine Transport in Plants Dr. Neil P. Schultes , assisted by Regan Huntley , investigates the movement of nucleoba ses (purines and pyrimidine s) across biological membranes. Nucleobases are important nitrogen -rich compounds that make up DNA and RNA, and are central to the synthesis of many secondary compounds including caffeine and t he plant hormones cytokinins. In plants , nucleobase biochemistry involves numerous cells and subcellular spaces necessitating transpo rt across biological membranes. Membrane bound transporters act as specific gatekeepers that regulate chemical traffic and are often key control points in plant biochemistry. Our research characterizes the biochemistry of nucleobase transporters by determining which purines and pyrimidines are moved and how efficiently. Transporters from the nucleobase -ascorbate transporter (NAT), Aza -guanine (AZG) transporter families are investigated. The function of the plant transporters is determined through an experimental technique known as heterologous complementation. In this procedure the plant gene encoding the transpo rters are cloned into DNA vectors (plasmids) that are engineered to express in brewer's yeast ( Saccharomyces Creeping bentgrass with bacterial etiolation and decline (left) and healthy creeping bentgrass (right). 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 cerevisiae ). Once expressed in yeast, a series of experiments testing the ability of the engineered yeast to take up or transport radio- labeled nucleobases are performed. In this manner the metabolite- specific transport profile and associated kinetic parameters for each nucleobase transporter is determined. For the NCS1 transporters , we are performing an evolutionary -function analysis - determin ing the transport profile of NCS1 transporters across evolutionary space in the plant kingdom. Such an analysis will determine which amino acids in the NCS1 proteins are key to nucleobase transport function. The metabolite transport profile has been dete rmined for NCS1 data complement the ongoing research in structure -function and three dimensional structural studies of NCS1 transporters actively pursued in fungal and bacterial systems. We are investigating the function of eight of the Arabidopsis NAT transporters and AZG transporters from A. thaliana and Zea mays using similar techniques. Our results show that NAT transporters move xanthine and recognize various other nucleobase compounds. Xanthine transport is intimately associated with the synthesis of allantoin in soybeans - the major nitrogen transport molecule throughout the plant. Our last associated project characterizes four similar nucleobase transporters from the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae - the causal agent of American Foul Brood in Honey Bees. Two recent developments render this project worthwhile to pursue. First, a recent report has shown that P. larvae spores germinate in media with high concentrations of uric aci d. Uric acid is a derivative of purines and is transported by some nucleobase transporters. Second, transporters can act as biosensors to trigger cellular responses. We are investigating if the P. larvae transporters can recognize uric acid. Impact : Purines and pyrimidine biochemistry play important roles in all living organisms. Although narrow in scope, our research on nucleobase transport addresses important i ssues in nucleobase metabolism. Future engineering of plants for increased productivity o r managing biotic and abiotic stresses will require a greater understanding of metabolic processes. Many anti -cancer drugs and anti - microbial agents utilize nucleobase derived compounds for treatment. Therefore, results from our work will not only direct ly impact researchers in plant biochemistry, but also researchers in human disease processes and drug development. Plant Ba cteriology Dr. Lindsay Triplett and Dr. Teja Shidore , post -doctoral researcher the Xanthomonas effector AvrRxo1 as a toxin- antitoxin system with collaborators at Colorado State University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute . This project has discovered that Xanthomonas pathogens, including those causing bacterial spot of tomato and pepper in Connec ticut, secrete a toxic protein that can modify and inactivate the metabolic intermediates of bacteria, fungi, and plants. Impact: This finding greatly expands our understanding of the ways in which bacteria can directly harm both plant and human hosts. This family of toxic proteins targets rapidly growing cells, and has been investigated toward harnessi ng its antibacterial and antifungal potential. The discovery of a new activity in this family of proteins will Chromatography methods were used to identify new compounds produced in the presence of active AvrRxo1 (bottom) but not by an inact ivated AvrRxo1 (top). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 165 help us identify ways to disrupt this protein as a strateg y to fight bacterial disease. Dr. Triplett, assisted by Regan Huntley , is also invest igating the contribution of toxin- antitoxin systems to bacterial plant disease. This project is focused on identify ing the roles of numerous different toxin - antitoxin systems in bacterial plant disease. Genomic analysis was used to identify thousands of these genes in the genomes of bacterial plant pathogens, and a few of these will be chosen to investigate their antibiotic properties and role in plant disease in the last two years of the project. Impact: In addition to being virulence factors, toxin- antitoxin systems are thought to play a major role in bacterial survival of antibiotics and survival in the host, making it difficult to eradicate disease in an area. Discovering which ones are important will tell us which ones to target for disease control strategies. With c ollaborators at Yale and Cornell University , Dr. Triplett initiated a project aimed at i dentification of a novel Xanthomonas disease resistance mechanism shared by rice and tomato. A proj ect was initiated to map the genetic location of a new type of resistance gene in rice that is triggered by a type of protein found in diverse bacteria. The location of the gene was identified, yielding a handful of promising gene candidates. Funding is being sought to identify the specific gene. Impact: The resistance activity is a novel type of resistance found in both monocot and dicot plants, and it is triggered by a protein found in 60% of Xanthomonas and many Ralstonia plant pathogens. Once the specific gene is identified, it could be harnessed for resistance against a wide variety of crop diseases. Biochar in Plant Disease C ontrol Biochar is a fine- grained , charcoal -like product that has soil enhancing properties ( Figure 1 ). It also suppress es plant diseases by absorbing toxins, increasing colonization of beneficial myco rrhiza fungi, and increasing densities of beneficia l bacteria in the rhizosphere. These beneficial microbes help to suppress disease through antibiosis , competition, or induction of systemically acquired resistance mechanisms. Delivering biochar to lower soil horizons presents an obstacle in perennial plants and it was hypothesized that e arthworm s may help in distributing biochar in soils . Drs. Wade H. Elmer and Joe Pignatello used earthworms to determine if the type of the biochar influences their ability to remove surface biochar. Substantial differences were found among nine different biochars , indicating that biochar can vary in their attractiveness to earthworm and this may, in turn, affect their efficacy in soils. Dr. Elmer , in collaboration with Amber Fearnly , a high school student at the Sound School in New Haven, CT conducted a greenhouse study to examine the impact of biochar on Verticillium wilt of eggplant ( Figure 2). Results of these experiments showed that biochar wa s ineffective in suppressing this important disease of eggplant. Figure 1. Sample of biochar. Figure 2 . Amber Fearnly conducting her senior project on the role of biochar on Verticillium wilt of eggplant . 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Impact : Biochar s are becoming more widely commercially available to the general public . These studies should caution consumers that biochar s differ in their properties and may not red uce diseases for all plants. Silicon and Partial Saturation for Disease Suppression in O rnamentals Ebb & flow recycled watering systems have been used with increasing frequen cy in Connecticut to save water and to manage moisture deficits. However, a major disadvantage of recycled watering is the potential for disease outbreaks and the development of fungicide -resistant pathogens. Previous research from a joint project with Drs. Wade Elmer, Martin Gent, Rich McAvoy (University of Connecticut), and Joe Geremia (Geremia Greenhouse, Yalesville, CT) demonstrated that partial saturation resulted in smaller , healthier , and more marketable plant s than full saturation. Our latest research project explored the possible role of s ilicon , a nonessential element that has disease suppressive properties when absorbed by certain plants, to determine if soluble silicon applications with partial saturation would act synergistically and provide more protection aga inst foliar and root diseases. Poinsettias and zinnias were grown on partial and full saturation with and without silicon applied as potassium silicate. Potassium carbonate (K2CO 3) was used in the control pots to factor against the effect of potassium. Poinsettias were exposed to Pythium root rotting pathogens and zinnias were allowed to become infected with powdery mildew. We observed marginal suppression of Pythium root rot of poinsettias when silicon was applied to plant s receiving full saturation, but no suppression on partial -treated plants. Alternatively, we observed that powdery mildew was more severe on zinnia grown under partial saturation than full saturation. However, the application of silicon significantly suppressed powdery mildew on partial saturation plants when compared to the K 2CO 3 control (Figure 3). Ornamental grasses like Hakonechloa grass are susceptible to a wide variety of foliar and root problems. A joint study with Margery Daugh trey of Cornell University examined the response of Hakonechloa grass to increasing rates of silica slag grown in soilless potting soil. It found that root growth responded best when a rate of 4 metric ton s of silica slag/ha was used (Figure 4). Impact: Silicon nutrition offers an inexpensive strategy to boost plant health and reduce fungicide usage. Partial saturation allows growers to suppress Pythium diseases and save fertilizer and fungicides. In cases where moisture stress from partial saturation increased powdery mildew , as in the case of zinnia, the inclusion of silicon nutrition provided a cost -effective method to reduce disease without fungicides. Figure 3. Powdery mildew of zinnia grown with silicon (right panel) compared to control (left panel). Figure 4 . Root systems of Hakonechloa , an ornamental grass, treated with increasing rates of silicon. The rate of 4 g/liter was superior to other rates. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 167 Sudden Vegetation Dieback Sudden vegetation dieback Spartina alte rniflora (SA) along the intertidal creeks that feed into Connecticut's Long Island Sound (Figure 5). Fusarium palustre is a recently described species that is pathogenic on SA, but is not solely responsible for SVD. Herbivory from the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, is also severe in marshes and hinders recovery from SVD. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) has been proposed as a putative physiological indicator of health in S. alterniflora and is reported to be in lower levels in SVD sites. In addition, others have reported that concentrations of several heavy metals are in higher concentrations in plants from SVD sites. Drs. Elmer served as a thesis advisor for Ms. Magali Bazzano , a master's candidate at the University of New Haven, who investigated the hypotheses that DMSP and elemental levels were affected in marshes where SVD was present. Special attention was also given to Si because this element has been linked not only to stress resistance in plants, but also to herbivore resistance. In general, it was found that the concentration of DMSP was variable within the marsh, but mean values were significantly higher in the healthy marsh compared to the SVD site. The elemental concentrations of Fe, K, and Si i n plants at the SVD site were significant ly higher, while Cu was lower. These findings were consistent with other reports in southern U.S. marshes. These data imply that physiological stress, along with biotic stress from disease and herbivory, are contr ibuting to SVD. We also examined the role of silicon in salt marsh health and its effect on grazing by the crab. Greenhouse expe riments and field plots in crab -infested creek intertidal banks were established . We found that silicon nutrition was ineffective in prevent ing disease from F. palustre or herbivory from the purple marsh crab . Drs. Elmer and LaMondia compared the salt tolerance of two salt marsh pathogens, palustre and the root-knot nematode, Meloido gyne spartinae , to genetically related terrestrial species to determine if the salt marsh pathogens had acquired tolerance to saline condition s or if salt tolerance was comparable among Fusarium and Meloidogyne species. We observed that F. palustre was significantly more tolerant to NaCl than terrestrial species and that M. spartinae survived at all NaCl concentrations tested , whereas terrestr ial nematodes did not survive. These findings provide evidence that F. palustre and M. spartinae pathogens evolved in saline conditions and are not recent introductions from terrestrial niches. Impact : Understanding the physiological parameters associated with S. alterniflora and the pathogens associated with SVD may reveal knowledge gaps where scientists migh t understand why Connecticut's salt marsh es are declining and what marshes may be threaten ed in the future by dieback . In addition, discovering how nutrition can manipulate the resistance and survival of S. alterniflora may provide alternative methods for restoring our marshes. 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Studies with N anoparticles for Root D isease M anagement Nanoparticles (NP) are as any materi al at the nanoscale (<100 nm). The literature clearly demonstrates enhanced availability and transport of NP as a function of their minute particle size. We hypothesized that NP of Cu, Mn, and Zn (essential micronutrients) applied foliarly may allow a slow release of ions t hat may be loaded into the phloem for transpo rt to susceptible root tissues. In collaboration with Dr. Jason White, Dr. Elmer compared NP of Cu , Mn, and Zn oxides to their larger bulk equivalents or to sulfate salts for effects on the growth and yield of eggplants grown in soil infested with Verticillium dahliae . In both greenhouse studies and two years of field experiments, we observed that NP of CuO increased growth and yield by 34% over the untreated control , respectively. Another study with watermelo n found that foliar applied NP of CuO were more effective in increasing growth and delay in onset of Fusarium wilt caused by F . oxysporum f. sp. niveum than NP of Zn or Mn (Figure 5) . Field studies are in progress to assess the effect of NP of CuO rate on Verticillium wilt of eggplant and other forms of Cu. Impact : These studies show positive and negative benefits of the use of NP in plant disease management. Information on how NP micronutrients might affect root pathogens is new and novel. NP might be a promising alternat ive to conventional pesticides. Disease Survey Drs. Yonghao Li and Sharon M. Douglas, assisted by Ms. Lindsay Patrick, diagnosed a wide range of fungal, bacterial, viral, nematode, and phytoplasma diseases on trees, shrubs, flowers, lawn grasses, fruits, and vegetables during the past year. The prolonged and extreme cold winter of 2014- 2015 caused severe physical injuries on trees and shrubs, especially on arborvitae, boxwood, rhododendron, and holly. Herbaceous and Woody Ornamental s: A severe epidemic of tomato spotted wilt virus on potted chrysanthemum plants was found in a field that was close to greenhouses. Impatiens downy mildew was found in late summer, but did not cause severe epidemics in the season. Impatiens necrotic sp ot virus (INSV) remained a major virus disease problem in greenhouse bedding plants, especially on begonia. Pythium root rot was found on many annual flowers, as impatiens, calibrachoa, gerbera daisy, and begonia. Phytophthora root rot was problemat ic on lavender in landscapes that had poor drainage. Powdery mildew was prevalent on peony, begonia, beebalm, and Lobularia . Figure 5. Effect of nanoparticles of CuO applied to a healthy watermelon plant compared to the control . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 169 A rose sample from a public rose garden was positive for rose rosette virus, which was the first official confirmation of rose rosette disease in the state. Lilac ', was detected in lilac samples submitted from a nursery. Fungal leaf spots of mountain laurel remained a major problem that reduced plant aesthetics and caused significant defoliation . Boxwood blight, Volutella canker, and Macrophoma leaf spot major diseases that caused severe damage to boxwood plantings in landscapes. Several Gymnosporangium rusts were identified on different hosts, including apple, pear, quince, serviceberry, and cedar. Canker diseases contribut ed of many woody ornamentals, such as cankers crabapple, and rhododendron; and Phomopsis cankers of juniper, maple, black pine, and rhododendron. Verticillium wilt was a recurring, serious problem on Japanese maple trees. Volutella blight and Alfalfa mosaic virus were major diseases on pachysandra. An increased incidence of Diplodia blight and Ploiode rma needlecast on two -needle as noted. Rhizosphaera and Stigmina needlecasts and Chrysomyxa repeating needle rust were noteworthy foliar disease problems on spruce. Swiss needlecast and Rhabdocline needlecast continued to be problem atic for Douglas -fir in Christmas tree farms and landscapes. Vegetables: Cercospora leaf spot of beet was found o n greenhouse bedding plants in early spring. Downy mildew was diagnosed on potted basil plants from a greenhouse in early summer of 2014. Basil downy mildew was also found in home gardens in late summer in 2014. On tomatoes, Septoria leaf spot continued as the Tomato spotted wilt virus on chrysanthemum. Pythium root rot of gerbera daisy. Stigmina needlecast of spruce. Rose rosette disease. 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 most common disease follow ed by bacterial leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, anthracnose, powdery mildew, leaf mold, and Botrytis blight. Powdery mildew, bacterial angular leaf spot, and bacterial wilt were common problems of cucurbits in both commercial farms and backyard gardens. Thielaviopsis root rot was identified on a zucchini sample from a commercial grower. Tobacco mosaic virus was detected on pepper seedlings that were collected from a greenhouse. Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot was commonly observed in pepper fields. Tree and Small Fruit: Black rot, powdery mildew, anthracnose, and downy mildew remained the major disease problems of grape. In a commercial winery, Phomopsis canker was identified on several grapevines. On peach trees, the two major diseases were leaf curl and brown rot. Outbreaks of f ire blight , a devastating disease of apple and pear was w idespread in many orchards throughout the state during the summer of 2014. Turf: Prolonged snow cover last winter caused severe epidemics of gray snow mold on lawn grasses. Brown patch, summer patch, red thread, powdery mildew, slime mold, anthracnose, rust, and Pythium root rot were common diseases of lawn grasses. Black rot of grape. Fire blight of apple. Cercospora leaf spot of beet. Downy mildew of basil. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 171 Weeds: Running bamboo continued to be the topic of increasing public concern because it is difficult to control and the potential for causing problems between neighbors. Oriental bittersweet, Japanese knotweed , and poison ivy remained significant problems in residential properties. Predominant weeds in turf and gardens were crabgrass, annual blue grass, ground ivy, w ild violets, wild garlic, creeping speedwell. Impact: Information on the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut l andscapes, greenhouses, vegetable fields, orchard s, natural woodlots, and forests each year helps to monitor and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or i n identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activities. Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at meetings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In C ooperation with the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, inspectors from the Bureau of Regula tion and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture collect official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds for analysis. Samples are submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, since it is the official seed testing laboratory for Connecticut. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology performs the germination and purity analyses that are required for compliance with Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. In 2015, 323 vegetable, 5 lawn, and 9 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Douglas for testing. Pamela Sletten , with assistance from Lindsay Patrick, tested all seeds following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA). Seedlings are carefully examined, s ince they must appear \"normal\" (i.e., free from decay, have well -developed primary root systems, have well -developed and intact hypocotyls and/or epicotyls, and have healthy cotyledons). Vegetable seeds are tested for germination, and as of the date of th is report, tests for 138 of the 323 vegetable seed samples were completed and five seed samples failed label claims for germination. Some failures were not retested because of insufficient amounts of seed. Seed samples were examined for prohibited noxious weed seeds and three vegetable samples contained weed contaminants that are being identified . Lawn seeds are tested for both germination and purity. One of the five lawn seed samples tested met label claims for both purity and germination. Four sample s failed purity claims, but passed germination claims. None of the 2015 lawn samples contained seeds of noxious weeds. Crop seeds are also tested for both germination and purity. Five of the nine crop seed samples tested passed label claims for purity a nd germination. Four samples failed claims for germination (with retests), but passed label claims for purity. One sample did not state a label claim for purity , but was found to contain Rumex seeds, a restricted weed. A Station Technical Bulletin will be written to report the findings of this year's results. Impact: Results of seed tests conducted by Station staff are reported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of products that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds. In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. The long -term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the unintentional introduction 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 of noxious weed seeds that could potentially impact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Li and Ms. Patrick examined 22 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Drs. Li and Douglas, assisted by Ms. Patrick, answered 4,002 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizens. Although the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (68%), other categories, such as food crops (16%) and tur f grasses (3%), were also well represented. A moderate percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (13%), which included identification of plants and poison ivy control and identification. Although the majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (58%), there were many inquiries from commercial growers and plant care professionals (35%). Inquiries from cooperative extension, health, news, agricultural personnel, and other (7%) remained consistent with previous years. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 35% of the questions came in by phone, 15% came in by mail, 12% came as email, and 38% were brought in person. The number of physical samples handled by the PDIO (53%) continued to exceed the number of phone calls and emails (47%) \u2014this is a trend that has been observed for the past 5 years. Over 1,014 letters and email messages with attached files of fact sheets were sent from the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of l etters, since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, identification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health and environmental concerns. Additional Inquiries from Stakeholders Dr. Elmer made 7 site visits to growers and answered 19 phone calls a nd 5 emails. Dr. Ferrandino answered 19 phone calls and 18 emails, tested 23 samples, and made 7 site visits. Dr. Li made 5 site visits. Dr. Zeng answered 5 questions and made 20 site visits. Impact: During the period covered by this Report , over 4,149 Connecticut residents had plant disease problems accurately diagnosed by members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. In many cases, the plant health problems diagnosed did not require fungicides for control, contrary to the initial percepti on that fungicides would be required. Staff worked closely to educate professionals and homeowners to develop disease management programs that were compatible with the environment that incorporated cultural practices, sanitation, and genetic resistance pr ior to pesticide use. Accurate diagnosis of plant health problems, educated citizenry, and implementation of integrated disease management strategies reduce pesticides introduced into the environment and water of Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 173 VALLEY LABORATORY Scientists at the Valley Laboratory conduct multidisciplinary research on insects, diseases, soil nutrition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut. The Valley Laboratory, located in Windsor, was originally established by the Board of Control in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on shade and broadleaf tobacco continues today, the research mission has greatly expanded to reflect the diverse agriculture present in the State. In addition to research, scientists and staff diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility, conduct outreach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist students. Activities on the farm There were a total of 50 experimental plots at the Windsor research farm during the past year. Three Windsor -based scientists had 25 of these plots; six New Haven -based scientists were using 15 plots. The remaining plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields, the Lockwood and Griswold farms and in State forests. Valley Lab Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and equipment ready and in excellent shape. He expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specific needs of each scientist. He and his summer research assistants did an outstanding job maintaining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pesticides and organ ized and conducted safety and pesticide training sessions for the staff. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Research Biological control using imported predators of the adelgid is a major long -term national strategy for reducing the impact and sp read of invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) threatening eastern hemlocks. Sasajiscymnus tsugae (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae), originating from Honshu, Japan, and discovered by a CAES scientist, is one of the primary biological control agents released for HWA management. Evaluation of Volatiles as Possible Attractants for Sasajiscymnus tsugae, Introduced Predator of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Dr. Carole Cheah, in collaboration with Dr. Allen Cohen of North Carolina State University, Insect Rearing Program, conducted olfactometer testing of S. tsugae responses. An improved bioassay was developed in 2014 which allowed 24 hour data gathering of adult S. tsugae male and female responses to different colors and revealed gender differences and preferences for co lors which will be used in designing monitoring traps. Humidity differences did not influence S. tsugae attraction to odors and 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 validated the responses to volatiles in a 2 way olfactometer. Also, in small tent cages, S. tsugae males and females did not preferentially choose to land on infested seedlings of T. sieboldii over T. canadensis. HWA status in Connecticut 2014 Dr. Carole Cheah's field surveys of state lands where hemlocks occurred in 2013 had previously shown that HWA has dramatically increased and spread after 2 consecutive warmer winters following a long period of patchy low populations. However, the winter of 2014 was severe and the polar vortex event in early January resulted in widespread winter mortality of HWA throughout Connecticut. Mi nimum daily temperatures of - 7 to -9\u00b0F occurred in the three climatic regions (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) of Connecticut. Mean HWA mortality was 84% with more variability for the whole of Connecticut in 2014 but was particularly high in coastal areas. But in 2015, Connecticut experienced the coldest February on record and HWA winter mortality was very high throughout the state, averaging 90.3%, with minimum winter temperatures dropping to - 13 to - 16 \u00b0F in northern areas and - 5 \u00b0F alo ng the coast. Locally, HWA has resurged during the summer progrediens generation in 2015 but infestations remain patchy. Impact: State, water company municipal foresters and natural resource managers as well as the general public were informed in the spring of the high winter mortality of HWA in 2015, resulting in reduced need for chemical control of HWA in spring 2015. Implementation of Biological Control of Mile -a-Minute Weed in Connecticut Mile -a-minute weed, Persicaria perfoliata, (MAM) originates from Asia, was first discovered in the eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as an invasive weed in Connecticut. Infestations are found in 14 eastern states from North Carolina to Ohio and the first record of MAM in Connecticut was in Greenwich in 1997, later confirmed in 2000. To date in Connecticut, 43 towns have confirmed reports of MAM, though some have only limited reports of a few plants. This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quic kly forms dense thickets which overwhelm and displace native vegetation and reduces plant diversity. An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), imported from central China, has been successfully reared and released for biolog ical control of this invasive species in the Mid -Atlantic and southern New England states. In a collaborative project between the CAES and the University of Connecticut funded by USDA APHIS PPQ, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island and the University of Delaware, nearly 44,000 weevils have been released to date in 19 towns from 2009- 2015. To date, weevils have been released to control MAM in North Haven, Gr eenwich, Newtown, New Milford and Bridgewater (2009), Stamford, Westport and Fairfield (2010) and Sprague and Norwalk (2011), Wilton, Middlefield (2012) and Roxbury, Stonington, Stratford, Ridgefield, Woodbury (2013), Southington (2014) and Wallingford (2015). Further releases are being implemented in more towns in 2015. Dr. Cheah has participated in the releases and monitoring of all the release sites since 2009. Weevils have been established at all previous release sites, survived six diverse Connectic ut winters, severe spring and summer flooding, and reproduced with multiple generations. High feeding impact has been recorded in the late summer at several sites. Dispersal of weevils has also been recorded at least 18 miles from the nearest release sit e in 2014. In 2015, GIS mapping of MAM distribution and weevil dispersal is being undertaken by Emmett Varricchio, summer research assistant at the Valley Laboratory. Impacts: Weevils released to control mile -a-minute weed in the western and eastern por tions of the state overwintered successfully again in Connecticut following the severe winter of 2015, with the coldest February on record. Ample snow cover is thought to have supported weevil overwintering. Weevils are starting to impact and reduce loca l populations of MAM at several release sites. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 175 Dispersal and spread of weevils from their original release sites has been observed. Establishment and spread of R. latipes for mile -a-minute weed would provide a natural control to limit spread and range expansion of a prolific invasive weed, and reduce the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right -of-ways, agricultural lands, bird refuges, etc. Releases of weevils in Fairfield and Wallingford 2015 . Augmentative Biol ogical Control of Elongate Hemlock Scale Elongate hemlock scale, Fiorinia externa (EHS), an exotic scale present in Connecticut since the 1960s, has recently rapidly expanded its range and population densities to seriously damaging levels on forest and la ndscape hemlocks over much of Connecticut in the past 5 years. Forest stands in Connecticut with heavy elongate hemlock scale infestations have shown thinning crowns and declining health, leading to pre-emptive hemlock salvage in forest management. Preli minary sampling in EHS -dominated Connecticut stands in 2010 by Dr. Cheah has indicated increased numbers of the twice -stabbed lady beetle, Chilocorus stigma, which is a native and widespread omnivorous scale predator , but C. stigma has not been mass -reared and is not available commercially. The objective of this project, funded by USDA APHIS PPQ, is to develop optimal laboratory methods to mass rear suitable scale cultures and C. stigma for potential augmentative and safe biologica l control releases in EHS -affected stands. In 2014- 2015, Dr. Cheah continued to survey for EHS in Connecticut and also recorded the rise in native hemlock scale, Abgrallaspis ithacae , especially in western and southwestern parts of the state. Collections of C. stigma were made during the fall of 2014 and maintained on EHS on hemlock. When supplemented with the artificial CC diet, adults readily oviposited in the fall on EHS on hemlock in the laboratory for several months but rearing in unheated greenhous e con ditions was not successful. Cultures of Florida red scale, Chrysomphalus aonidum , (FRS) were originally obtained from the University of Florida/IFAS at the Southwest Florida Research and Education Center in Immokalee, FL, were transferred and maintai ned on butternut squash through the year. After overcoming squash rot diseases, the scale culture on butternut squash was amplified considerably in 2014- 2015 and this is the 3 rd successive year of continuous FRS culture on butternut squash. In 2015 exper iments, adult C. stigma fed readily and oviposited viable eggs on an acceptable artificial substrate, on squash cultures of FRS. Resultant eggs hatched and larvae fed and developed successfully to adult on FRS squash cultures. This is the first record of C. stigma reared successfully under laboratory conditions on a squash culture of scales. 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Larva (left) and adult (right) of Chilocorus stigma reared on Florida red scale on butternut squash . Surveys in 2014- 2015 showed that eastern hemlocks continued to decline in certain regions, especially in the northwest corner, due to heavy EHS infestations, in either single or joint infestations with HWA. Thinning crowns and increased incidences of hemlock borer, a native secondary pest that attacks stressed trees, were observed in marginal sites. Aerial surveys by the CAES confirmed that in 2014, 9,000 acres of eastern hemlock in northwestern Connecticut were in serious decline and defoliation from EHS infestations. In 2015, elongate hemlock scale winter mortalit y was much higher than in 2014. In 2014, mean winter mortality of EHS was 54.8% in northern sites (n=6) and 34% in southern sites (n=2) but with high variability. The winter temperatures of February 2015 were the coldest in Connectic ut since records began and this impacted EHS winter survival. In the northwest corner, average EHS winter mortality was 74%, (n=7), 66% (n=6) in central region and 52% (n=4) in coastal areas . In contrast, winter mortality of the native hemlock scale was much lower, as expected. Impacts: Currently there is no effective non -chemical control of elongate hemlock scale and the range is expanding northwards into Maine. Development of novel mass rearing procedures for C. stigma, a safe, omnivorous, climatical ly-adapted native predator of EHS, would allow implementation into new areas, augment local forest populations and also provide a method of biological control for many scale pests in plantations and orchards and reduce pesticide usage. Insect Management Since discovering spotted wing drosophila (SWD) in Connecticut in 2011, Dr. Richard Cowles has focused on developing low environmental impact and IPM -compatible approaches for managing this pest. Field tests of behavioral approaches to manage SWD coordin ated by Dr. Cowles were replicated in five states, but resulted in no observable benefit from use of mass trapping at a density of 100 traps per acre, utilizing the best available traps and baits at the time (red cup trap, combined with kombucha or Suzukii Trap baits). Trapped fields had the same degree of fruit infestation, whether traps were present or not. Compared with the red cup trap, a more efficient trap can be made from a 2 -liter soda bottle. The top of the bottle is cut off and the cut edge inv erted into the bottle to form both a funnel at the bottom of the trap for flies to enter, and a reservoir within the trap to hold the liquid bait (which also kills the flies by drowning them). This modified McPhail design of trap is equally effective as c ommercial traps using the same basic trap design, but costing approximately $12 apiece. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 177 Traps for capture of spotted wing drosophila Strawberry sap beetles continue to be a damaging pest for strawberries, particularly where they are grown next to blueberry plantings. Adult sap beetles are difficult to control, because they arrive when there are ripe fruit and they immediately burrow in to the underside of fruit where there is contact with soil. Insect pathogenic nematodes may be useful for limiting the ability of strawberry sap beetle to increase in numbers. Dr. Cowles conducted a laboratory bioassay of three species larvae reared in the laboratory of strawberry sap beetles were highly susceptible to infection by these nematodes. This is an especially promising approach, because the re is always soil contact of fruits infested by sap beetle larvae, and the larvae undergo an extensive wandering stage prior to pupation in soil, which will increase the likelihood of infection by nematodes. Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated as having the potential to be injurious to pollinators, because they are systemic and can be transported within plants to nectar or pollen. Concerns about their use in ornamental crops has led to mandatory labeling of plants treated with these insecticid es in one state (Minnesota) and a large retail chain (Home Depot), and another retail chain (Lowes) is demanding the discontinuation of their use on plants sold at their stores within two years. In order to assist interested parties to interpret whether t here is risk to pollinators from plants at nurseries, a team consisting of Drs. Kim Stoner, Brian Eitzer, and Rich Cowles are measuring concentrations of imidacloprid found in rhododendron nectar and pollen, as well as determining which nursery plants are used as pollen sources from bees colonies placed in cooperating nurseries (this work is detailed by Dr. Stoner elsewhere in this Record of the Year). An additional effort is underway (Cowles and Eitzer) to better understand the relationships between facto rs associated with the application of these insecticides (active ingredient, dosage, application method, and interval before bloom) in influencing the resulting residues found in nectar (milkweed) and pollen (sunflower). These plant species were chosen based on for their abundant production of nectar or pollen. Dr. Cowles, along with Dr. Anthony Lagalante of Villanova University and Kyle Lombard of the NH Department of Natural Resources, applied imidacloprid to mature sugar maples in 2013, following the USDA APHIS Asian longhorned beetle quarantine protocol, to determine the degree to which this insecticide would later be detected in harvested sap and syrup. Imidacloprid residues continued to be detected in some sap samples from treated trees in 2015, wh ich would make sap from treated trees unmarketable. These residues are not greatly affected by heat, and so are concentrated when sap is converted to syrup. 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Some neonicotinoid insecticides, in particular imidacloprid, are noted for inducing spider mite o utbreaks following their use. The strongest support for various mechanisms proposed to explain this phenomenon has been for the role that these insecticides have for inducing the SAR pathways in plants, because these insecticides' metabolites are potent agonists of salicylic acid, the key natural signaling compound that triggers this pathway. Induction of the SAR pathway may prevent induced defenses in plants to spider mite feeding, thus maintaining their palatability to mites and increasing mite survival and fecundity. In collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Cowles, Eastern Connecticut State University, we have found a model plant system ( Pachysandra terminalis ) amenable for testing the effects of systemic insecticides and standard SAR elicitors on two spott ed spider mite fecundity and polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme level expression in treated plants. Dr. Cowles established a planting of firs in Brooklyn, CT, at a site with high naturally occurring incidence of phytophthora root rot. This experime nt is investigating soil acidification as a method to prevent successful infection of roots by Phytophthora zoospores, which are known to be much less tolerant of acid soils than are the true fir host plants. The soil acidification (with pelletized sulfur ) is part of a factorial experimental design investigating host species (comparing Fraser firs with Canaan firs, which are highly vs. much less susceptible to infection), use of phosphites, and use of insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) known to e licit the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathways, with a proper negative control. Impacts: Dr. Cowles' research has assisted fruit extension specialists through New England. The use of baits and traps designed by Dr. Cowles has provided timely monitoring information to fruit growers, enabling them to protect their fruit from damage. Growers in New England had early warning of SWD activity from extension personnel using effective monitoring methods Growers have adopted the use of sucrose with their sprays to more effectively manage SWD Mycology Research Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on water - damaged building materials, and infiltration of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. Toxic indoor mold - Stachybotrys and Memnoniella biosystematics study Dr. Li published a monographic paper on Stachybotrys and Memnoniella, which included at least seven species- clades. Memnoniella was determined to be a synonym . The sex ual genera Ornatispora and were determined to be synonyms of Stachybotrys . Seventy -four accepted Stachybotrys species were discussed and illustrated, while eight species are considered to belong to other genera or are doubtful species. Twelve new combinations and one new name were proposed. Each species was discussed in detail and a key to the accepted species of Stachybotrys is provided. Several sequences of ITS and LSU of Stachybotrys isolates have been sequenced in collaboration with Neil Schultes of Plant Pathology and Ecology. Impact : This is the first use of molecular data for the monographic study of Stachybotrys. The phylogenetic position of Stachybotrys was clarified and the i ntensive nomenclatural study on the types of related genera has determined that Stachybotrys is the current name (protected name) among all competitive names: Stachybotrys, Memnoniella, Ornatispora, and Melanopsamma. The keys produced in previous studies only covered limited species. The key provided by the current study includes all accepted species. This research will help identif y species of the medically important genus Stachybotrys . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 179 The ITS phylogenetic tree of Stachybotrys spp. based heteropoda (IFO 33060) as outgroup. Bootstrap values 50% are indicated above the branches. Ex-type strains were labeled with \"T\" after strain number. Epi-type strains were labeled with \"epi\" after strain number (Table S1). Global diversity of the Ganoderma lucidum complex study : Species of the Ganoderma lucidum complex are used in a number of popular health products in Asian countries and as diet supplement products available in the US. Dr. Li participated in a collaborat ive study on the Ganoderma lucidum complex to clarify the chaotic taxonomic situation of this species complex, its usage and research on their health effects. Thirty two collections of the complex from Asia, Europe and North America were studied from both morphological and molecular phylogenetic perspectives. The concatenated sequence dataset comprised 33 ITS, 24 tef1a, 24 rpb1 and 21 rpb2 sequences, of which 19 ITS, 20 tef1a, 20 rpb1 among which 17 rpb2 sequences were newly generated. Thirteen species of the complex were determined in the multilocus phylogeny. Clade A comprised tropicum, G. oregonense and G. tsugae , and Clade C comprised G. boninense and G. zonatum . A key to the 13 species and a synoptic table with their major morphological characters from basidiospores, context, cuticle cells, and pores were developed. The epitypification of G. sichuanense is rejected based on type materials. 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Impact : G. lingzhi has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for over 2 ,000 years and reported in many Chinese classic works. What has been used in diet supplement products is actually G. lingzhi , not G. lucidum as previously reported. G. lucidum is a species common in Europe and North America. The present study provided additional evidence to segregate G. lingzhi and clarified the species concepts within the species complex. These results will allow the pharmaceut ical industry to fine -tune their research o n the active chemical compounds which are beneficial to human health and characterize the pharmaceutical properties of this important species complex. Fruiting body of Ganoderma lingzhi (formerly G. lucidum ) New fungal taxa Science has only described about 7% of fungi. A majority of fungi remain unknown and mycologists are facing a huge challenge to describe these unknown taxa. Some are in danger of becoming extinct and global warming is adding additional threats to fungal survival, as our planet is becoming warmer and drier. Each new fungal species described is significant to science and biodiversity, and we need to continue our effort to discover, describe new fungal species, and conserve all fungal tax a as each new species of fungi adds essential information for future studies on ecosystems, fungal preservation, and biosystematics. The significance of new fungi as bio-resources and to our environments remains less- explored. Dr. Li collected both indoo r and outdoor specimens through the year in the USA and overseas. One fungal species new to science ( Triadelphia acericola ) was found in Windsor (Valley Lab) and submitted for publication. One species, T. centroseptata is validated and one new name, T. ar chontophoenicicola is proposed to replace a homonym, Triadelphia australiensis Joanne E. Taylor et al. Impact : The key and synoptic table for the genus Triadelphia will assist people to identify the member s of Triadelphia with better information. Triadelphia acericola. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 181 Indoor mold study A new species (to be named) and two new records were collected from indoor environments. At present the culture and type specimen are in preparation for deposition. A number of additional species are understudy. A fact sheet was written to address public concerns over indoor mold issues. Impact : The indoor environment is a man -made environ ment that can be a perfect place for fungal infestation, since moisture/water is the sole determinant factor. We had always consider ed fungal diversity indoors as simple with a small number of taxa. However, over the years a number of new species were de scribed from indoor environments by several mycologists including DeWei Li. Fungal diversity in indoor environments ha s not been fully studied and a comprehensive list of indoor fungi remains to be developed. Fungal taxa from indoor environments provide new information to allergic patients, the public, public health professionals, medical practitioners, mycologists, indoor air quality professionals, certified industrial hygienists, and indoor mold investigators for better diagnosis, management and remediation. Because the health effects of some indoor fungi are species specific, results will assist in the study of the potential effects of indoor molds on human health. Aeromycological Study Dr. Li is conducting a project in collaboration with Dr. J. Kl ironomos of the University of British Columbia focusing on two aspects: 1) long- term changes in airborne fungi in North America using 20- years of data; 2) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AM) spores (very large spores, commonly >100 \u00b5m) in the air. The resu lts have show n that the total precipitation during the 2 -month period prior to sampling (Jul-Aug.) was negatively related to airborne fungal spore concentrations. Glomus (AM fungus) spores were found in the air. The results showed that AM fungi may be more likely to be dispersed via the air (wind) in arid systems. These results were published in two papers in Fungal Ecology . Impact : The results suggested that drought and elevated temperatures resulting from global warming will lead to increment al increases in airborne fungi in the future. AM fungi are truly pioneer species for their roles in establishing plant communities in deserts. These fungi may be useful for controlling desertification, a huge ecological problem that several countries are f acing. However, these trends may also increase the risk of allergies, asthma, and other airborne fungi related health issues due to exposure to elevated levels of airborne fungi. Variation of total spore concentration with (A) Jul -Aug. average precipitation, and (B) average temperature in Toronto and New York from 1992 to 2011. 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Boxwood blight : Boxwood blight is a new, introduced disease in Connecticut. The impact of the disease has been very high; boxwood plant losses have been estimated at ov er $5.5 million in Connecticut since October 2011. In addition, the concern about boxwood has resulted in reduced or lost orders for other plants, resulting in a multiplier effect on economic losses. Dr. James LaMondia and Dr. Katja Maurer have conducted research to determine fungicide efficacy in vitro and in plant systems. Calonectria pseudonaviculata causes leaf spot and stem lesions resulting in defoliation and dieback of boxwood. In vitro assays identified systemic and protectant fungicides with activity against suitability as fungicides against C. pseudonaviculata. All DMIs showed activity against Furthermore, -methyl inhibited mycelial growth. At CAES -Windsor, we have conducted two evaluations of differential susceptibility in boxwood cultivars using 39 boxwood lines as rooted cuttings from the Long Island Horticultural Research and Extension Center originally obtained from the National Boxwood Collection. We evaluated disease susceptibility as whole plants and as detached leaves. Buxus sinica aemulans , B. sempervirens var. japonica 'Jim Stauffer' were the least susceptible, and averaged 1 lesion per plant or less, whereas B. sempervirens 'Suffruticosa' averaged over 50 lesions. Detached leaf assays did not result in significant differences, although reduced sporulation was observed on the less susceptible lines. Detached leaf assays may not be the most effective means to rank cultivar susceptibility compared to entire plants. These plants have different growth habits and therefore different microclimates, so there may be additional factors which impact d isease susceptibility or tolerance. Our preliminary results indicate that leaf age is also important in relation to disease susceptibility and that spores inoculated to the underside of leaves are much more likely to cause infection tha n spores inoculated to the top surfaces. Conidia of the pathogen can infect leaves directly or can grow through leaf stomates to infect. Similar to differential susceptibility among Buxus species and cultivars, Pachysandra species have different susceptibilities to C.ps. Infected Pachysandra plants are known to serve as a source of inocula for existing Buxus plantings. Knowing which Pachysandra cultivars are less likely to develop infections will aid in reducing further spread of this disease to established boxwood. Dr. L aMondia conducted evaluat ions of available Pachysandra cultivars using both inoculation of whole plants in the greenhouse and detached leaves in the laboratory. Plants were sprayed with infective conidia and held under disease-conducive conditions. Numbe rs of lesions and sporulation were scored to compare cultivar susceptibility. Common pachysandra ( P. terminalis ) was the most susceptible cultivar tested, Green Sheen was intermediate and Green Carpet, Crinkled and Variegated were significantly less susceptible than Common. We also determined that two additional species, Pachysandra procumbens and P. axillaris were hosts o f the boxwood blight pathogen. Previous fungicide work has yielded promising results with several registered products preventing severe development of boxwood blight. Experiments are being conducted at CAES -Windsor to investigate curative activity, the length of residual activity and fungicide programs. In addition, because growers are asking questions regarding the length of efficacy a nd reapplication intervals, we are investigating curative activity and the length of residual efficacy of specific fungicides. We conducted experiments using our most efficacious fungicide program for protectant fungicides alone or protectant plus systemi c fungicides at 2- or 3-week spray intervals. At two -week intervals, disease control was 98 -99% effective, whereas control was 78 to 87% effective at three -week intervals. Propiconazole, but not thiophanate methyl fungicide exhibited significant curative activity in detached leaves 48 hours after infection. Knowing more about curative activity and the timing of sprays will help growers and landscapers select chemistries The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 183 that have longer periods of residual activity against the disease. Additional knowle dge about the environmental factors affecting infection and risk models for disease will need to be developed. Solatenol fungicide is a new broad- spectrum active ingredient under development by Syngenta. Mural fungicide is a combination sinica var. insularis \u00d7 B. sempervirens 'Green Velvet' treated twice with Mural, Pageant, or Cleary's 3336 fungicides or water alone at 14 -day intervals. Plants were treated with a fungicide spray and then challenged by inoculation of wet foliage with conidia of Calonectria pseudonaviculata (Cylindocladium pseudonaviculatum ) after 48 hours. A ll fungicides evaluated were significantly different from the inoculated untreated controls, but the fungicides were not significantly different from each other. Disease control averaged over all fun gicides was excellent, 93 to 94% control for the two evaluations, respectively. The pathogen was isolated from symptomatic lesions. No phytotoxicity was observed in Green Velvet boxwood for any of the fungicides evaluated. Sanitizers were assessed for th eir effects on mycelial growth, conidial germination, and microsclerotia using in vitro assays with serial dilutions and contact times. Depending on fungal structure and experimental conditions, sanitizers including Lysol (O -benzyl alcoho l (70% ethanol), and 10% bleach (sodium hypochlorite) acid were effective with contact times as short as five minutes. Conidial spores are the most common means of pathogen spread and were killed very quickly by all of the sanitizers tested. Fungal colon ies growing on artificial agar -based media (consisting of hyphae, microsclerotia and conidia) were killed by exposure to 10% bleach for as little as 5 minutes, but not by exposure to 70% ethanol or Lysol for up to 30 minutes. However, the artificial media itself seems to have a dramatic effect as individual microsclerotia (tough survival structures that can last for years) that were removed from media can be killed by as little as 4 minutes exposure to 70% ethanol, while isolated microsclerotia can survive more than 30 minutes in 10% bleach or Lysol. These results will help growers and landscapers refine current best management practices, as conidia can be easily killed by a number of sanitizers on pruning implements and hard surfaces. Microsclerotia, how ever, alone or on leaf surfaces are much harder to kill and may best be eliminated by alcohol -based sanitizers. Management of boxwood blight will rely on integrated best management practices, sanitation, cultural controls, cultivar resistance and fungicid e application. Impact: The identification of fungicide application programs with activity against spore germination and vegetative growth of the boxwood blight pathogen will lead to the development of effective management strategies. Tobacco disease research The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 (as the Tobacco Substation), to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen. Wildfire w as eventually eliminated by the development of plant resistance to this pathogen . Ever since, tobacco breeding to incorporate genetic plant resistance to plant pathogens has been used to successfully manage diseases. Plant resistance to major pathogens i s the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most effective way to control plant diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950s, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960s, black shank in the 1970s, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980s and early 1990s effectively controlled serious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wrapper tobacco production in the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently a number of pathog ens that threaten the crop. Dr. LaMondia conducts an ongoing breeding program to develop resistance to : Fusarium oxysporum (causing Fusarium wilt); Globodera mosaic virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) f or both shade and broadleaf types. Recently, a 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 male -sterile F1 hybrid 'B2' highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN and with moderate resistance to blue mold and black root rot was released and licensed. Black shank, caused by Phytophthora nico tianae , has re- emerged as a serious pathogen in Connecticut and we have developed a hybrid line with significant resistance to the pathogen. This line, B3, is being evaluated under field conditions in 2014 and 2015. Black root rot, caused by the fungus T hielaviopsis basicola has been damaging and increasing in impact in recent years with cool wet springs. We obtained three sources of dark wrapper tobacco with high levels of black root rot resistance from cooperating scientists in Kentucky. A back -cross program is being used to transfer resistance to CT broadleaf , and r esistan t plants are being selected for broadleaf characteristics. Inbreds have been developed and are being used to develop hybrid lines with resistance to multiple pathogens. A burley to bacco cultivar (TN -86) with resistance to Potato Virus Y (PVY) has been obtained and is being crossed to CT tobacco types. Impacts: The development of a male- sterile hybrid broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens, i ncluding Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, should allow sustainable crop production with reduced losses to disease and much reduced pesticide inputs. B2 has been released as a new cultivar and seed production has been licensed to a local company. Proceeds will support further research on plant resistance. Adding resistance to black root rot and to PVY will further reduce plant losses to disease. Black Shank Management Black shank, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae , is a re- emerging disease in Connecticut. An experiment was conducted in 2014 in cooperation with Altadis Tobacco in a field that experienced losses to black shank in previous years . Broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco cultivar C9 was transplanted by the grower. Fungicides were applied at transplanting and a second layby application was applied at the last cultivation. Treatments consisted of Ridomil, Revus, Presidio and an experimental fungicide under development. No disease was observed on 3 July, sympt omatic plants were observed and counted on 18 and 31 July and 11 August, 2014. Numbers of black- shank affected plants were higher in untreated control plots than in all fungicide treated plots, incidence in the untreated control average about 28% symptoma tic plants. There were no significant differences between fungicide treatments, indicating that all fungicides tested had similar efficacy and that mefenoxam -resistance did not appear to be present. Disease control averaged over all fungicides was quite good, about 85% control. No phytotoxicity was observed in broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco for any of the fungicides evaluated. Reduce d pesticide residues in tobacco Connecticut shade and broadleaf tobacco types are used to produce some of the highest quality cigar wrappers in the world. Blue mold, caused by Peronospora tabacina, is a leaf spot disease that can destroy the crop, valued at up to $50,000,000 per year. Fungicides can help protect the leaves, but growers and cigar makers want to keep residues as low as possible. Dr. LaMondia conducted experiments to maximize disease control with reduced levels of fungicide in cured leaves for a third year in 2014. The s trategy tested investigated the effects of using dimethomorph, mandipropamid, or fluopicolide fungicides early in the season and avoiding or minimizing sprays prior to harvest as opposed to the standard application of the same total amount of fungicide spr ead out more uniformly over the season. Leaves were harvested, cured and fungicide residues determined by Dr. Brian Eitzer of the Department of Analytical Chemistry. Our results indicated that fungicide concentrations were stable in the plant and may have more systemic activity than thought. Impacts: The development of a more effective spray program that results in reduced fungicide residues in broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco will increase marketability and reduce human exposure to pesticides. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 185 Trap cro ps are being developed for nonchemical control of cyst cyst nematodes Globodera pallida. Because of the difficulties in working with this regu lated pathogen in the United States, Dr. LaMondia is cooperating with scientists from Idaho to conduct experiments with the closely related tobacco cyst nematode G. tabacum as a model system. In initial experiments, we evaluated broadleaf cigar wrapper to in cysts over 4 weeks more than root diffusates of S. sisymbriifolium or N. tabacum . Tobacco increased hatch by four times compared to water alone. S. sisymbriifolium stimulated twice and S. ptychanthum three times the hatch of that for N. tabacum . G. tabacum juveniles were observed in stained roots of both N. tabacum and S. sisymbriifolium and development to adult females occurred within four weeks in tobacco but not S. sisymbriifolium . Cysts were extracted from roots and soil in pots that had been planted to N. tabacum or S. sisymbriifolium for 12 weeks and cysts crushed to count encysted juveniles. Final population densities were 324 G. tabacum J2 per 100 cm3 soil for tobacco and 4.5 G. tabacum J2 per 100 cm3 better than tobacco but unlike eastern black nightshade, does not allow significant reproduction in roots , indicating that it may be an effective trap crop for management of G. tabacum . In addition, G. tabacum may be useful as a substitute model for the quarantined pathogen Globodera pallida for trap cropping with S. sisymbriifolium under field conditions. Root -Knot hapla, are damaging pathogens of many crops, including vegetables and ornamentals. Pepper breeding lines under development by the USDA Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, SC were provided by Dr. Judy Thies for evaluation against Meloidogyne hapla in Connecticut. Two S4 lines had been screened against M. hapla in SC. We evaluated 20 replicate pots of each of these lines and a susceptible control pepper variety 'California Wonder' in the greenhouse in pots and in the field. All transplants were inoculated with 6,000 eggs and juveniles of Meloidogyne hapla. One of the USDA lines had lower numbers of gall than the susceptible control, California Wonder. The other was not di fferent than California Wonder. Our results indicate that CT isolates of Meloidogyne hapla may be different biotypes that respond differently to pepper resistance genes. Impacts: Plant resistance to nematodes is the most effective and economical contro l of the plant pathogens, however, the efficacy of resistance genes against different biotypes of the nematode needs to be considered to be effective. Hops Hop ( Humulus lupulus ) cultivation in New England and New York dates back to the first settlers. Over time, the high pressure of diseases and pests due to humid climate condition s forced the relocat ion of hop production to the drier Northwest region of the United States, where the main commercial production of hops is currently locat ed. However, increased demand for local or regional products, and t he popularity of microbrews and local brewpubs have renewed interest in growing hops in New England. The CAES has established two small hop yards with several cultivars using high and low trellis systems to evaluate yield, growing characteristics, and susceptibility to diseases in two locations : at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, and at the Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT. The hop research is conducted by 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Dr. James LaMondia and Dr. Katja Maurer. The team established high and low trellis production systems within the last three years. Although hops achieve their full yield production after three years, the growth, yield, and disease/pest development of five different cultivars, Cascade, Summit, Alpharoma , Newport, and Perle, are currently being evaluated to gain a preliminary prediction. The harvest data in 2014 showed that the variety Cascade has the most well -adapted growth process. Whereas, Perle, a German breeding line, had the smallest growth and lowest yield when compared to the other cultivars. The same trend can be expected for this year's harvest. Furthermore, in 2014, the high trellis production s ystem was more fruitful for Cascade, Alpharoma, and Newport com pared to the low trellis system. A: Hop yard in Windsor; B: Hop yard in Hamden . The high pressure from diseases and pests in New England requires a strict control system. The most common diseases and pests are downy mildew, caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli , aphids, and mites. The symptoms of downy mildew are stunted short shoots, called spikes, as well as chlorotic and curled down leaves. The first rating in 2015 showed that Alpharoma, which is described as tolerant to downy mildew, ha d the most leaf symp toms, followed by Cascade. Spraying fungicides, removing weeds and redundant sprouts as well as stripping the upper leaves helps to reduce the spread of downy mildew. Spider mites were controlled by horticultural oil application before bloom and by the r elease of commercially available predatory mites. A phids have been observed but have not been significant. However, this year a novel pest , the potato leafhopper , appeared in the hop yards in Windsor as well as Lockwood and caused damage on the leaves. Furthermore, Alternaria blight, caused by Alternaria humuli , has been found in a few rare cases. This disease has a minor importance for hops and its appearance might be related to secondary infection of already diseased leaves. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 187 A-B: Symptoms of downy mildew; C -E: Symptoms of leafhoppers . In conclusion, the preliminary data of evaluating growth, yield and disease/pest development show that Cascade, a very popular cultivar in the U.S., and Summit seem to be promising varieties for ho p cultivation in Connecticut . Additional varieties will be evaluated over time. Impact: Assessment of different cultivars in low and high trellis production systems in terms of their growth, yield, and disease/pest development will lead to a better unde rstanding of successful hop cultivation in Connecticut. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information A total of 5,118 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year. The majority of these queries were answered by Ms. Rose Hiskes (57%) in the inquiry office or by Dr. LaMondia (28% - 88% commercial). About 49% of the information requests to the inquiry office were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers, government, and nonprofit, educational or other (54%). The majority of inquiries concerned insects (20%), diseases (38%) or general horticulture (8%). Valley Lab scientists made more than 61 presentations to grower, professional and citizen groups, (over 3,500 people), were interviewed 11 times and ma de 261 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects. Dr. LaMondia initiated and maintained the Connecticut River Valley Bl ue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progress of this devastating disease in North America, and the potential exposure to the pathogen and management options in the Valley. His laboratory conducted 198 nematode diagnostic samples and conducted testing as an APHIS certified pinewood nematode export testing facility. 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Thomas Rathier , emeritus soil scientist, continued to visit specific urban sites where community gardens either already existed or were planned by community organizers. At each site, Mr. Rathier made an assessment of the horticultural capabilities of the site as well as the likeliness of heavy metal contamination being found in soils on the site. Samples were taken at each site and analyzed by Mr. Rathier and Mr. Musante ( Analytical Chemistry Department). Mr. Rathier subsequently relayed results to appropriate stakeholders along with suggestions for remediation and/or avoidance of soils whose metal concentrations exceed the Connecticut standards. Soil testing A total of 4,957 soil tests were expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year. About 69 % were performed for commercial growers and 31 % for homeowners. Of the commercial samples submitted, 7 7% were for landscapers; 7% for tobacco growers; 6% for vege table growers, 3% for municipalities, 3% for golf course superintendents ; 2% for nursery growers; 1% for small fruit, and 1% for Christmas tree growers. Diane Riddle also conducted inspections to maintain USDA APHIS Authorized Official Certification. Valley Lab Information Office Insect, Disease and Plant Health Survey Ms. Rose Hiskes diagnosed a wide range of insect, disease and plant health problems on herbaceous and woody ornamentals; lawns, fruits and Christmas trees for homeowners, commercial bus inesses, other government agencies and nonprofits. Insects During the summer months, insects, such as black vine weevil, lacebugs, and bagworms were common problems on trees and shrubs in the landscape. Black vine weevil, in the adult stage, eats foliage at night and hides in the duff below plants during the day. Many broadleaved evergreens, such as rhododendron, euonymus, azalea and holly are attacked as well as conifers and perennials such as astilbe and sedum. Black vine weev il larvae live in the soil and eat the roots of the same plants that the adults feed on. The only manifestation of this 'ghost' pest is notching of foliage. Lace bugs feed as nymphs and adults on upper or lower leaves of foliage. Many are somewhat host specific such as azalea lace bug, hawthorn lace bug and andromeda lace bug. Those that feed on evergreen hosts overwinter as eggs laid in the foliage near the midrib or glued to leaves. Those living on deciduous hosts overwinter in protected areas near t heir host. Their piercing sucking feeding damage removes chlorophyll from the leaves causing browning and eventual early leaf drop. Bagworm caterpillars eat foliage of many deciduous and evergreen hosts such as honeylocust and arborvitae. Bags are made of host plant material and silk tightly interwoven. As the larvae grow they add to the bag. Young larvae balloon on silk strands with air currents to move to new hosts. This insect overwinters as eggs within the bag of the female. Azalea lacebug nymph. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 189 Lawns suffered several insect issues during the summer and fall. Grass was attacked by chinch bugs during hot dry periods and in hot dry areas near sidewalks and asphalt. Larvae and adults remove chlorophyll from grass blades with their piercing sucking mouthparts. By August ground nesting yellowjacket colonies were very large and became noticeable during summer picnics. In September many citizens reported large black beetles coming out of their lawns. The larvae of these blister beetles feed on the larvae of yellowjackets in ground nests. Adult blister beetles will feed on foliage of clematis. A vegetable grower had a problem with these beetles feeding on a crucifer crop this year as well. Rose rosette disease was offici ally diagnosed in Connecticut in fall, 2014 as Oklahoma State now has a test for the virus involved in this disease. An eriophyid mite transmits the virus while feeding in plant meristems. Symptoms such as very red, enlarged new growth with many soft spi nes had been noticed in Connecticut since 2006. The mite had also been found. Homeowners and public gardens are reporting symptoms. Since multiflora rose, a widespread invasive plant in the state, is very susceptible there is little chance of controllin g this disease. In spring 2015, a small outbreak of gypsy moth occurred in many areas of the state. Consecutive dry springs hampered the ability of a beneficial fungus to spread and infect the caterpillars. Oaks, willows, and beech were affected as were understory plants, such as witchhazel, as the caterpillars ate through leaves and dropped from the trees. Homeowners continued to report populations of brown marmorated stinkbugs in their houses during the winter months into the spring. Diseases In summer 2014, diseases such as cedar -apple rust lesions on apple foliage and continued fire blight problems were brought to our attention in orchards and home fruit plantings. Downy mildew was a problem for some grape, herb and perennial growers. Homeowners experienced blossom -end rot on tomatoes. During the fall, Phomopsis canker on blueberry stems was noticed. Alfalfa mosaic virus was found in some pachysandra plantings. Rhizosphaera needlecast infections continued on spruces and even some Norway spruce, somewhat resistant, were also found to be infected. In spring 2015, homeowners brought in many boxwood samples as they became aware of the boxwood blight issue. No boxwood blight was found but winter injury, Volutella and Macrophoma leaf spot were found. Mountain laurels were brought in with C ercospora leaf blight. A large, newly planted hemlock was found to have died from Armillaria root rot. Nearby , an oak had previously died and Armillaria had subsequently spread t o the surrounding area. Hairy chinch bug n ymph Rose rosette disease Downy mildew on Rudbeckia 190 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2014 -2015 Perennials with southern blight and bacterial soft rot were brought in from home gardens. Plants such as astilbe and hosta were most affected. Weather fleck, small white leaf spot symptoms caused by damage from air pollutants su ch as ozone, were common in wrapper tobacco and also diagnosed in other crops such as cucurbits. Potato virus Y, tobacco veinbanding virus and tobacco etch virus are aphid -transmitted viruses in the POTY virus group. These viruses resulted in poor qu ality cigar wrapper tobacco in 2014 and in potato tuber losses due to reduced yields and also tuber symptoms consisting of circular decay and necrosis on the tuber surfaces. Extended periods of warm, wet weather and high humidity in the fall resulted in significant losses of cured tobacco to postharvest storage rot fungi such as Alternaria , Aspergillus and Penicillium . Plant Health Winter 2014- 2015 was cold with a lot of snowfall. Deep snow cover for an extended time over the winter allowed voles to girdle many of our landscape plants. Bridge grafting is a possible way to save these plants. Holly and Japanese maple were some of the plants affected. Trees such as Carolina silverbell and Eastern redbud s uffered severe winter dieback. Watering these plants during the hot, dry May, pruning back to healthy wood and removing adventitious growth can get these plants back in good shape. A homeowner brought in some stems from her rosemary plant, worried they had a canker disease. The bumps on the stem were adventitious roots , not a disease symptom. Impacts: Accurate identification of pests of agricultural and human health significance has resulted in economic savings to commercial growers and homeowners, re duced human and environmental exposure to pesticides, and increased human safety. The Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year , 11 different groups used the room on 39 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Connecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Invasive Plants Working Group, Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connecticut Council for Soi l & Water Conservation, Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association, Connecticut Nursery & Landscape Association, Connecticut Land Conservation Council, Connecticut Agr icultural Information Council, USDA Farm Service Agency, Working Lands Alliance, and West Hartford Farmers Market. Ms. Jane Canepa -Morrison scheduled the meetings and James Preste arranged the furniture and ensured that the room was available after hours.
