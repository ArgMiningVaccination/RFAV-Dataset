Yearns, Professor Emeritus and Retired Extension Housing Specialist Iowa State University Ames, Iowa UNIVERSAL DESIGN in HOUSING Universal design is the design of products and the built environment to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design \u2014 Ron Mace Description: A home with universal design1 features will have universal appeal for a wide range of individuals and families \u2014whether young or old, tall or short, disabled or non- disabled. Sometimes called inclusive design , universal design creates homes that are convenient, comfortable, and attractive for everyone. Similar terms that may be used include life-cycle design , trans-generational design , and design for all . Universal design should not be confused with legislative requirements for ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) accessibility, which can stigmatize users as needing specialized products and equipment to accommodate a disability. Although a universal design home incorporates accessibility features, the items are carefully selected for universal appeal; for example, a gently sloped sidewalk, instead of a ramp, can be used to create a no-step entrance that is useful for every family member when carrying groceries or moving furniture, as well as providing easy access for wheelchair users. A universal design home will include numerous features that make a home easily navigated and useable, accommodating: The typical variation in physical size and capability seen among family members of all ages; The temporary impairments people experience throughout their lifetimes and the permanent disabilities characterizing some residents; and The evolving physical and mental changes experienced by people as they go through the normal aging process. For example , homes are typically designed for the \"average\" person; however, the standard-height bathroom sink does not work well for the family's three-year-old daughter, nor for the 6' 2\" husband; the standard-height kitchen counter does not work well for a 5' housewife. A bathtub does not work as well as a walk-in shower for the teenager with a broken leg or the visiting aunt in a wheelchair. Door knobs do not work as well as lever handles for aging arthritic hands. For an elderly person who cannot stand for long periods, sit- to-work space in the kitchen lets her continue baking; and automatic shut-off features on stoves avoid tragedies for people experiencing forgetfulness. For an extensive list of universal design features, products, guidelines , and a list of resources, see Universal Design In 2 IV.1.a Housing,2 a publication of North Carolina State University's Center for Universal Design. While a universal design home can include a long list of products, features, and equipment \u2014everything from lighted doorbells, to flush- to-the-floor thresholds, to hand rails on both sides of staircases \u2014three priorities are essential: One no-step entrance \u2014on an accessible path; Wider doorways on the main level \u2014with at least a 32-inch clear opening; A bathroom on the main level \u2014with enough space to accommodate a wheelchair. In addition to making the home more useable by its residents, t hese essential features also create a visitable3 home; that is, one that will be welcoming to visitors who have mobility limitations.

Benefits: Universal design \u2014 Makes a home convenient, comfortable, and appealing for a wide variety of individuals and families: oOlder people oPeople of all ages with disabilities oFamilies with young children oCaregivers oEveryone Facilitates the ability of frail older people and younger-aged people with disabilities to live more independently and to age- in-place for much longer periods of time \u2014thus, increasing a sense of confidence and competence, reducing vulnerability to depression, and delaying or eliminating relocation to institutional alternatives. Reduces caregiver burden by easing the physical labor and emotional stress involved in caring for a family member with a physical or mental disability. Incorporates visitability features that allow guests who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids to feel welcome and able to visit \u2014thereby reducing social isolation.3 IV.1.a Helps individuals who have disabilities obtain employment or participate in community life, as a universal design home allows them to live independently and to come and go as they please. Reduces taxpayer burden by eliminating or postponing the need for costly in- home care or institutionalization. Incorporating universal design principles when the home is initially built\u2014 Provides a lifetime of living for all residents without the need to make subsequent expensive modifications, additions, or remodeling to accommodate changes in health or abilities. Is cost-efficient, as many universal design features are low-cost or no-cost when incorporated into initial construction. Impediments or barriers to development or implementation: Consumer attitudes : Most consumers prefer to stay in their own homes as long as possible; yet, few recognize the need to selec t universal design features that would accommodate their changing needs and abilities as they age. Thus, there may be lower consumer demand for homes with universal design products and equipment. Builder perspectives: The National Association of Homebuilders is opposed to mandatory visitability laws. Their reasoning includes low consumer demand, increased construction costs, and concerns about adding regulations that some homeowners may not need. If builders are not familiar with universal design construction methods, they may be reluctant to learn new building techniques. Legislative barriers : It takes strong advocates to get new legislation passed. Some states, such as New York, may have difficulty in adopting local visitability ordinances because they are restricted by law from exceeding state building construction codes. Rural challenges: While not true of New York State, many rural areas across the country have little or no inspection of home building or remodeling projects, and some do not require builders to be licensed. This removes professional oversight that might encourage consumers to include universal design features in their homes.

Roberts, PhD, Professor of Chemistry Fordham University New York, NY LIGHTING FOR MAXIMAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Description: Lighting is not neutral, but has either a positive or negative effect on health. Correct spectrum and timing of lighting is essential because lighting modifies brain neurotransmitters and neuropeptides which, in turn, alter both mood and the human immune response. P roper lighting can improve health and well -being while poor lighting can alter mood and increase stress and t he risk of disease. All life, including humans , evolved being exposed to a different spectrum of light in the morning, afternoon and evening ; and h uman health and well -being is profoundly affected by the different spectrum s of morning , afternoon and eve ning light. Natural day lighting offers a smooth spectrum of visible light with a high intensity of light in the blue visible range ( 400 - 500 nm).1 However , as the day progresses, b lue visible light is scattered and lost from the incoming sunlight , and as the sun sets it emits visible light in the orange and red range (600-700 nm ). At night, there is natural darkness with the exception of starlight, although the full moon releases significant blue visible light . Because of the significant impact of lighting, when developing homes, health care facilities, public buildings, and public spaces , it is important to maximize natural lighting and, when designing artificial lighting, it is important to mimic the spectrum and timing of natural lighting. Until ten years ago, it was thought that the only function of the visible light received by the eye was for sight. It was known that light received by the human eye was transmitted to the retina and received by the rods and cones, which then sent a signal thro ugh the optic nerve to the visual cortex in the brain to \"translate\" an image. It is now known that visible light in the long blue range (480nm +/- 20 nm) triggers a circadian response \u2014which is the body's roughly 24-hour cycle or rhythm of waking and sleeping in synchronization with the sun rising and setting.2 This blue visible light is transmitted to the eye's retina, received by melanopsin in the intrinsic photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells, and a signal passed through the _________ 1 Wave Express, \"What is Light\" ( 2012) : For the most part, visible light is discussed in terms of wavelengths \u2014with the unit being nanometers (nm) \u2014rather than frequencies. Our brains recognize these wavelengths as different colors, where 750 nm is approximately the longest wavelength of red light and 380 nm is approximately the shortest wavelength of violet light, with all the other visible colors in between these two wavelengths. http://library.thinkquest.org/C005705/English/Light/light1.htm 2 The Free Dictionary (2012): The term \"circadian\" refers to the body's cyclical daily biological functions (for example, sleep-wake cycle or eating at a certain time) and psychological processes (such as mental alertness), which are influenced by regular variations in the environment such as the alternation of night and day. 2 IV.1.a.1 d http://www.thefreedictionary.com/circadian+rhythm optic nerve to the brain's hypothalamus \u2014which triggers the production of a cascade of neurohormones.3 Equally important is the lack of this circadian blue light in the evening. In darkness, a completely different set of neurohormones is produced. Proper blue visible lighting in the morning and lack of circadian blue visible light in the evening modulates the sleep/wake cycle, growth , blood pressure , reproduction, stress , and metabolism . If the body's circadian rhythm is balanced, there is maximum morning alertness and productivity , and deep (delta) restorative sleep in the evening. If circadian rhythm is disrupted, this can lead to behavioral problems such as depression, agitation, and/ or psychosis. Biological age is an important risk factor for impaired vision, making proper lighting to insure health and well-being particularly important for those over 50 years of age. Because of the age-related changes in the human lens, there is less visible light transmitted to the human retina of older adults. This not only results in visual impairments but disruptive circadian responses. In addition, at middle age the eye's natural antioxidant protection against light and ultraviolet-radiation-induced damage is lost, while, at the same time, there is an increase in production of the photochemically active pigments in the human lens and retina that damage the eye when activated by light. These changes in the lens lead to enhanced sensitivity to glare and eventual cataract (clouding of the lens) formation, and accumulative retinal damage leads to transient or permanent blindness (macular degeneration). Thus, lighting in individuals' homes , apartment buildings, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and other health care settings must be specifically designed to compensate for the decrease in visible light reaching the retinas of those who are over 50 years old, as well as for those individuals of younger ages who have visual impairments. Compensatory lighting for older adults and others with visual impairments: Natural daylight: Increase exposure to outdoor natural daylight (for example, activity in gardens and parks and other public spaces), particularly outside morning sunlight \u2014 6:00 am - 9:00 am is the timing for the most powerful circadian stimulation. Maximize i ndoor natural daylight (for example, using skylights and increasing window area \u2014using glass that filters and removes ultraviolet radiation. Overall VISIBLE light levels : should be raised by 25% - 50%. __________ 3 David Currie, East Tennessee State University (2012), \"A Lecture, Higher Brain Function: Activation of the Brain and Levels of Consciousness\" : Neurohormones are produced and secreted by neurons and act upon the nervous system. Their influence can be described in behavioral terms, such as the ability to think and the kind of thoughts we have, or can be described in terms of brain wave activity. http://faculty.etsu.edu/currie/ras.htm 3 IV.1.a.1 d Light levels: should be uniform, but NOT directed into the eye. Task lighting: use task lighting to illuminte specific work and activity areas as a means of reducing glare and increasing vision. Evening darkness: To avoid disruption of circadian rhythms, remove or filter TV screens, computer screens, and gadget lights that contain blue visible light. After 10:00 pm, bedrooms should be in total darkness or red light (600 nm and above). The impact of lighting affects health, achievement, and productivity in all spheres , including homes, schools, work places, health care facilities, public spaces, and public buildings . Photobiology , the study of the interactions of light and living organisms, \" can be used to define threshold values for illumination in terms of spectrum, intensity, and timing of light at the h uman eye. The outcome of such study can be translate d into goals for simulation \u2014and ultimately for building design. Initial efforts in this direction are based on the annual Daylight Autonomy (DA) metric,4 which was chosen to simulate the potential of day light for human health needs. This method can be applied to study the impact of key architectural decisions for achiev ing prescribed stimulus of the circadian system \u2014decisions such as building orientation, window size, and glazing material . . . but also to study the influence of human activity and viewing directions. \"5 Benefits: For older adults and people with disabilities: An appropriate lighting environment enhances physical and mental health and well-being. Falls and other accidents due to poor lighting design are decreased. Proper lighting in multi-use spaces encourages strong socialization and active life-style opportunities. Lighting intensity and wavelength can be easily controlled for maximal comfort, depending on light sensitivity of different individuals. For the community: The benefits of good lighting design can be successfully implemented in private homes, residential facilities, health and long-term care facilities, public buildings, and public spaces. Emphasis on natural day lighting and removing inappropriate lighting in the evening can: Improve energy-efficiency without being harmful to human health. Decrease health care costs that are related to circadian-related sleep and immune-system disruption. __________ 4 Daylight Autonomy metric: a measurement standard for defining good and effective daylighting design. 5C. Pechacek, S. Gochenour, M. Andersen (on line, March 30, 2012), \"Healthy Lighting,\" Daylighting Lab, Department of Architecture, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.4 IV.1.a.1 d For the developer, architect, and lighting designer: Resident satisfaction is enhanced at no increase in cost. Energy efficiency is enhanced at no increase in cost. Impediments or barriers to development or implementation: For development and design, emphasis is more often on energy-efficiency lumens/watt without consideration for the impact of lighting on health. Federal, state, and local building standards for energy efficiency do not take age and visual impairment into account, assuming that one size fits all when considering lighting for homes, buildings, and public spaces. There is a lack of awareness among consumers and professionals about the impact of lighting on physical and mental health. Laudable efforts to minimize the \"carbon footprint \" can sometimes lead to a poor choice of light bulbs in residential spaces \u2014for example, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) work well for vision only (and, therefore, are good for non-residential areas such as closets or garages), but do not have the proper action spectrum emission for appropriate circadian rhythm. The lack of awareness about the differences in wavelengths emitted by different lamps, as well as lack of awareness of the direct relationship between light and the body's biological function can inadvertently lead to uninformed decision- making regarding lighting and poor choices in lamps and lighting. For example, greater education would increase awareness that the action spectra of some \"cool\" LED's (light-emitting diode) is appropriate for both vision and circadian morning alertness, and i ncandescent and \"warm\" LED's are appropriate for afternoon light and task lighting. Resource \u2014examples: Stella Niagara Health Center, Stella Niagara, NY 14144 \u2014a complex that includes permanent housing (convent) for 40 Sisters of St. Francis, a school for elementary-age students, a health center, and a hospitality center that hosts retreats held by diverse individuals and groups. The lighting for the Health Center (which includes 20 Sisters who are both elderly and suffering from dementia) was modified according to the principles describe d above in th is article, including exposure to enhanced indoor and outdoor daylight during the day and red light installation for the evening. Modifications resulted in all residents, including those with dementia: sleeping through the night and staying awake longer during the day; blood pressure positively modified; and there was an overall calming effect on all residents.

Over a three- and-one-half-year period, a research project examined the effects on residents of daily supplementation with bright light for an average of 15 months per resident. In six of the facilities, bright lighting was installed on ceiling fixtures , which were turned on every day between 9:00 am in the morning and 6:00 pm in the evening. Results showed that the bright light had a positive effect on stemming cognitive deterioration by 5 per cent compared to those without the light; depressive symptoms were reduced by 19 per cent; and functional limitations usually experienced by those with dementia were decreased by a relative 53 per cent .

Tanzman , Executive Director Westchester Disabled On the Move , Inc. Chair, Housing Public Policy Committee New York Association on Independent Living Yonkers, NY A CCESSIBILITY / ADAPTABILITY IN HOUSING D escription: The purpose of this section is to describe the features of a dwelling unit that are designed to provide optimal usage by an individual with a disability , whether that disability be a mobility impairment or a sensory impairment (i.e. , deafness and/or blindness) . Such features include : no-step entrances; sufficient width of hallways and doorways; appropriate heights for counter s, appliance s, and cabinets ; grab- bars, or supports for grab-bars , in bathrooms; size of bathrooms and kitchens; auditory, visual , or other sensory alerts (i.e. , a strobe light fire alarm as well as an auditory alarm ), and others . An accessible home is one that is designed with special permanent features for persons with disabilities. An adaptable home is one where these features can easily be added or removed, based on the individual's needs. Accessibility or adaptability requirements are determined by the law that governs each apartment unit , and two major laws are the Fair Housing Act as Amended (FHAA) and Section 504 of the 1973 Reh abilitation Act. The essential difference between these two classes of housing is that the FHAA requires adaptability while Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires full accessibility. T he FHAA applies to a significant proportion of the housing in our communities. All multifamily dwellings with four or more units that were designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, are covered under this law. If the building has an elevator, all living units are covered; if not, all ground floor units are covered . Multistory townhouses are exempt. T he FHAA has seven basic standards, and living units falling under these standards are often defined as adaptable rather than accessible : The building entrance has an accessible route (no stairs!); Public -use and common -use areas are readily accessible and usable by people with disabilities; Doorways are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons using a wheelchair; There is a n accessible route into and through each living unit; Light switches, electrical outlets , and environmental controls are positioned in accessible locations (not too high) ; Bathroom walls are reinforced to allow installation of grab bars;2 IV.1.b Size and design of kitchens and bathrooms allow for maneuverability by persons using a wheelchair (minimum area size, adequate leg room, height of work surfaces , etc.). S ection 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act applies to multi unit housing for rent or sale, commercial space, areas of employment, and areas of service or program provision that receive federal financial assistance. For multiunit housing, a minimum of five per cent of the dwelling units, or at least one unit, must be accessible to persons with mobility impairments; and an additional two per cent must be accessible to persons with vision or hearing impairments. The law also applies to renovations where alterations cost 75 per cent or more of the value of the facility . S ingle-family homes and structures that have three or fewer living units have no accessibility requirements . However, increasingly, states and localities are considering requiring \"universal design\" and \"visitability \" requirements , both of which expand the concept of accessibility to maximize the usability of dwellings for people of all ages and functional abilities (see Walkability/Visitability and Universal Design in Housing in the Resource Manual). Ben efits: For older people : Acce ssible and a daptable housing units allow older people to age in plac e rathe r than having to move into a more costly supportive facility when frailty compromises their ability to continue living independently. Such features allow older residents to remain independent and self -managing for longer periods of time; help them retain a sense of competence and self - worth, which has an impact on mental and emotional health; reduce o r de lays the need for costly formal in-home services; and keep older residents active and participating in their communities. F or people with d isabilities : Ac cessible and adaptable living units allow people with disabilities to live as an integrated member of the community, with greater ability to participate i n e mployment, recreation, and civic engagement opportunities, as well as greater access to amenities and commerce venues in their communities. Enhanced visibility within a community environment facilitates acceptance of people with disabilities by other community members and improves the general community's awareness of and understanding of the abilities , c haracteristics , and potential contributions of residents with disabilities. Living as an integrated member of the community allows people withdisabilities to live in a normalized, diverse environment rather than in an e nvironment that consists only of other people with disabilities.3 IV.1.b For children and families: Accessible and adaptable f eatures are beneficial for families with yo ung c hildren; for example, ramps and no -step entrances allow easy navigation of strollers and carriages. Positive modeling \u2014accessible and adaptable living units in the wide r c ommunity provide children with exposure to people with diverse abilities and needs , increasing their acceptance of people who are different , providing model s of successful coping skills for dealing with adversity , and increasi ng aware ness of the diversity that constitutes a normal community environment. F or caregivers: Accessibility and adaptability can reduce levels and intensity of hands -on care required, isolation, stress, and burn- out for caregivers when a family member with a disability (1) can negotiate their home environment more easily and, to a greater extent, by themselves, and (2) can fully access thei r c ommunities . F or both a caregiver and her/his loved one, engaging in recreation and othe r ac tivities together can preserve a relationship that can be more than \"care giving .\" T he wider community: Accessibility and adaptability principles are one aspect of a livable community, facilitat ing a community's ability to take advantage of the opportunities and creativity that are inherent in a diverse reside nt pop ulation. Older and younger people with disabilities teach through demonstratio n abo ut adapting to changes and building upon one's abilities and strengths. Commercial establishments will have a larger clientele , leading to greate r ec onomic development. People with disabilities constitute a non- traditional labor pool, from whic h em ployers find individuals who are a motivated, dedicated, and skilled workforce. I mpediments or barriers to d evelopment or i mplementation : The development and implementation of accessible and adaptable housing in our communities have faced challenges and opposition from several sectors : While it has been shown that the additional costs of providing adaptable o r a ccessible housing are minimal, r eal estate developers and r eal estate agents , in general, have not been supportive of changes to the State Buildings Code that i ncrease accessibility, fearing (1) that these standards will make housi ng d evelopment more expensive, (2) that not all tenants or owners want or prefe r t he modifica tions required, including larger kitchens and bathrooms , and (3) that these requirements will either require greater square footage o r adj ustments that will lead to smaller living rooms and bedrooms. Developers of Federally assisted housing express conc ern that they sometimes cannot find eligible residents for \"set-aside\" accessible/adaptable apartments.4 IV.1.b However, if developers or managers make a good- faith effort to rent a set-aside unit to an eligible applicant and are unable to do so , the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development will allow its rental to a tenant without a disability. Many set-aside units have a minimum required household income that is greate r than m any people with disabilities or seniors have available . For example, m any uni ts in New York City have minimum annual eligible -income requirements of about $25,000. Unfortunately, may low-income seniors and people with disabilities rely upon SSI-level incomes that are below $10,000 per year. Enforcement of accessibility /adaptability standards , particularly those of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, are another challenge . New York State building co des that require adaptability are enforced locally by local Building Inspectors ; however , there is no local official who is ch arged with enforcing the housing accessibility provisions of the Federal Section 504 law. Thus far, disability advocates have been unsuccessful in having the language from Section 504 incorporated into New York State Law in order to have it enforced statewide by the NYS D ivision of Housing and Community Renewal.

S mart home techno logy refers to houses installed with monitoring systems (sensors, actuators, and biomedical monitors) and special wiring to enable residents to program, control , and operate an assortment of appliances and other household features throughout the house. Smart homes have been defined as the integration of technology and services through home networking for a better quality of life.1 Monitoring d evices , such as sensors, are small and can be installed anywhere \u2014inside or outside the home, or worn by an individual . D epending on the user's needs, a smart house can include a basic network of wires operated by a central control panel in the home, while others might utilize wiring that allows the user to operate the appliances and features remotely from any area of the house \u2014or even from outside the home\u2014using a remote -control device similar to a television remote control \"clicker.\" Through either method, home automation provides relative ease of use. Much of the work is carried out by the system itself, where it detects activity and discerns information based on homeowner input. The key goal for home automation is to give the occupant total control over the house from anywhere in the house or from a distant location. H ome automation can range from (1) simple, fixed applications with pre -defined and pre -established operations, to (2) applications and devices that are programmable by the user, to (3) fully flexible and automated applications and networks of devices that provide information to the home consumer or that can be programmed to share the information with others. H istorical Evolution\u2014 A major focus of this technology , which has existed since the 1980s, has been to provide convenience, personal comfort , security , and energy -conservation; for example : All windows and doors can be locked from a central location in the home . A tel ephon e call to th e house can turn on the coffee , oven, or other elements. Li ghts can be programmed to turn on and off when someone enters and leaves a r oom. Ex terior sensors ca n turn lights on and off in response to the amount of daylight entering the home. 2 IV.1.c Hom e comfort system s (heating, air- conditioning, ventilation) can be set to automatically change in response to the time of day or to external temperature s. Ex terior video or movement detector s can alert a homeowner to unusual activity , through sensors that evaluate foot -pressure changes, breaking glass, movement, and contact with windows and doors \u2014and, if a resident is away from home, through a cell phone. St ove controls can detect high temperature s and automatically shut off burners and ovens. Room-to-r oom video and audio communication systems allow viewing and tal king among people in different rooms and floors of the home. Au dio/video controls allow music to be heard in one or more rooms of th e h ouse, multiple televisions to be controlled from a central location, and multiple media sources to be interconnected and manipulated. M ore advanced systems are continually being developed\u2014for example, a smart house can electron ically maintain a cat's litter box and water the household plants. Recent developments have involved the internet, whereby a home can send messages to its owner who is away from the house via e- mail and text messages \u2014 for example, door sensors can inform the owner when children have come home or if an older member of the family has stepped out of bed in the morning. R ecent Focus \u2014 While smart house technology has primarily focused on convenience and energy - efficiency, this technology is increasingly targeted for use by people with disabilities and for the care of frail older adults\u2014providing safety, security, and ease of self - management, as well as providing both on- site and remote monitoring and health care. Over 34 million people in the United States are aged 65 years and older and nearly 15 percent of people age d five and older have one or more disabilities.2 This recent increase in interest is related to (1) its practicality in supporting the ability of older adults and people with disabilities to remain living independently and self - managing in their own homes for longer periods of time , supporting a major preference of all people to \" age in place \" in the living environment of their choice; (2) i ts ability to support the significant efforts of family ca regivers ; and ( 3) its cost savings through reduc ing the need for expensive personal aide assistance, reducin g t he need for in -person medical care, and through delaying or avoiding costly institutional care. E arly applications of smart home technology incl uded devices such as LifeAlert, introduced in the 1990s , which is a pendant worn around the neck that allows a wearer to alert a central response center when he or she experiences an emergency or needs help. Today's devices expand upon such efforts \u2014sensor s can be placed 3 IV.1.c on virtually any household object, even on the floor, where it detects movement and determines issues in mobility. Sensors can now detect if an individual has fallen and is unconscious, setting off an alarm and automatically signaling for help to an agency or family member. Other recent advancements can detect when a person gets up to use the bathroom during the night, automatically switching on a light. S ensors have been developed to detect, record, and analyze movement patterns, footfalls, and the pace at which someone has climbed the stairs or moved between rooms, alerting family members living elsewhere if there are significant deviations from the pattern or if a sudden weakness in the foot, a collapse, faint, or black -out is detected. O ther sensors can detect irregular heart rhythms or blood pressure. S mart home technology can also aid in disease prevention\u2014for example, providing inconspicuous memory aids, such as medication r eminder s; or refrigerators can evaluate an inventory of contents and provide suggestions for menus, healthy choices, and a list of groceries that need to be purchased. V ibrating bracelets or audible prompters can remind people when to eat or when to go to the bathroom, and other wrist devices monitor pulse rate s and skin temperature . Sensors and wireless devices are being used in homes to monitor individuals' vital signs and whether medication has been taken, with this information sent wirelessly, through a sensor in the home or on the individual, to the doctor or to family members \u2014which is an added benefit for people who are home -bound, living in more remote rural areas , or are without immediate access to healthcare. M uch of the current smart home technology for tracking occupants use s small portable tags or badges that send and receive radio waves or infrared light\u2014 inexpensive alternatives to camera systems. Tags can be attached to a variety of items, such as lapel s, bracelets, pins, key chains, or medicine bottles. Such technology is extremely useful for monitoring individuals with Alzheimer's, allowing them to remain living in their own homes safely for longer periods of time and, when relocated to a housing or health care facility, allowing them more flexibility in moving around a building or yard and staying integrated with other residents . T elemedicine: Services that provide health and social care directly to users in their own homes is an area of care defined as telecare, which uses interactive video and audio contact between a user and care provid er. Peripheral devices can also be attached to computers to aid in an interactive examination, and video -conferencing can be used when face -to-face consultation is necessary . The \"real-time\" consultation, diagnosis, treatment, and delivery of medical car e is carried out with the user in the home , eliminating the need for frail or homebound individuals to travel to health care offices or facilities . \"Store -and forward\" e lectronic information - processing technologies transmit medical and health information , X-rays, and data between health care providers and patients and among a patient's multiple health care providers, for more efficient and accurate record- keeping on diagnoses and treatments. 4 IV.1.c Looking at the evolution of telecare, Celler , et al. ,3 find that home telecare technologies fall broadly into three generations: (1)Fi rst-generation systems, which are designed to reduce anxiety among elderly and high- risk patients and reduce their use of primary healthcare services (fo r e xample, personal alarm systems and emergency response telephones that make a v oice connection between the patient and the response cent er); (2)S econd -generation systems, which can continuously monitor a large number of variables that are sensitive to changes in functional health status, generatin g al arms without the intervention of the patient, on the suspicion that something may be wrong; these systems can be integrated with evolving \"smart home\" technology for home automation, security, and environmental control; and (3)A th ird generation of telecare, which attempts to deal with issues of loneliness and patients' quality of life by creating a virtual community of clients, caregivers,healthcare providers, and other community services \u2014connected via the telephone, interactive television, and the Internet. T he past decade has also seen renewed attention in smart house technology as academic institutions , such as the University of Florida and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , develop their own research centers \u2014many of th em resembling actual homes \u2014to test sophisticated home automation technologies. Despite the convenience and comfort characteristic s of smart house and home automation technologies, younger generations and families have been slow to respond to the ir use over the past two decades. However, sophistication in infrastructure, advancements in ease of use, and an increased knowledge and familiarity with computers among the public has generated more attention; and older individuals and younger- aged individuals with disabilities have especially benefitted from such technologies, helping them live safely and independently in their own homes . S ome manufacturers and experts note that privacy issues are an important consideration in building smart homes. Nevertheles s, multiple surv eys have indicated that people are willing to trade -off some of these concern s for practicality , comfort, and independence .4 As the 78 million baby boomers continue entering their elder years, and people of all ages with disabilities conti nue to live much longer lives, experts believe that the demand for such technology will increase significantly in years to come.

Ben efits: Security Advanced technology in the area of home security has provided a convenie nt and s afe way to keep homes and family members out of danger, with improved methods of detecting a variety of unusual activities and potentiallydangerous situations \u2014both inside and outside the house. H ealthcare Costs : It is more cost -effective for older adults and persons with disabilities to remain living at home for as long as possible, with assistive, supportive, and health- monitoring devices , than to be placed in healthcare institutions. One study (Chan, et al. , 2008)5 revealed that 46 per cent of \"on-site nursi ng ac tivities \" could be replaced by technology that can supervise health status from afar. The study also found that average hospital inpatient care in the United States costs $820 per day , average nursing home care costs $100 per day, and an average house call costs $ 74\u2014while a telemedicine ev aluation costs $30 . Staffing decline : A study by Kevin, et al. (2003)6 finds that the number of caregiver and direct care clinicians has decline d. Appropriate and judicious use of smart house, home automation, and telecare technol ogy can be successfully used as one strategy to address this decline. Older adults and people with disabilities : oSm art-based technology , integrated into the home environment , supports the ability of older adults and people with disabilities to continue li ving safely in their own homes for longer periods of time. oSuch technology increases a user's ability to be self -managing for longe r pe riods of time \u2014promoting feelings of competency and reduci ng v ulnerability to depression. Caregivers -emotional and physic al support : T he availability of smart house technology supports the substantial caregiving efforts of the nation's millions of family caregivers : oCaregivers' emotional and physical stress is reduc ed by (1) reducing the number of hours of hands -on physical assistance needed by a frail o r i mpaired family member, and (2) al lowing caregivers to monitor family members and perform tasks from a remote location. oA caregiver's ongoing emotional worry about the well -being of a frail or i mpaired family member is reduced by (1) increasing the safety and s ecurity of the family member's home environment, and (2) delaying o r 6 IV.1.c eliminating the traumatic decision of relocating a family member out of his own home and into another environment. E ase of u se Advancements in technology, together with increasing knowledge of and e xperience with computers and computerized devices by the general public of all ages, has made smart home technology much easier to use and to adap t to daily routines . R ural areas Smart house technology is especially attractive for use in rural areas, where lack of proximity to health care could compromise medical conditions. R eferences: 5 M. Chan, D. Esteve, C. Escriba, and E. Campo (2008) , \"A review of smart homes \u2014 Present state and future challenges.\" Co mputer Methods and Programs in Biomediscine, Vol. 91 , pp. 55-81. 6 C. Kevin, et al. (2003) , \"Caregiver and Clinician Shortages in an Aging Nation, \" Mayo Clinic Proceedings , Vol. 78, pp. 1026-1040. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation : Practicality The practical design of smart home technology is extremely important fo r o lder adults and individuals with disabilities . If devices are prone to system failures (similar to those encountered on a personal computer\u2014such a s u nresponsive net works or software malfunction), comple x actions to fix the situation ( i.e., resetting the entire system) may prove too inconvenient or even dangerous for the user. Devices that assume prior computer skills or devices that are not tailored to individual ne eds could also prove problematic. For example, for people wh o a re vision - or hearing -impaired, certain technologies are ineffective, suc h tho se that require video monitoring or being attentive to auditory signals. These technologies also present issues f or cognitively impaired individuals who might find a control panel or remote control device difficult to use. P rivacy Issues of privacy often surface as a major concern in smart house development. Much of the technology being devised for older adults an d pe ople with disabilities involves an element of monitoring by others that s ome people find obtrusive. Cameras and surveillance devices are a conce rn f or many who value privacy. T herefore, it is important that informed conse nt be obtained before installing technology that could create discomfort. Developing a code of conduct for healthcare providers who monito r i ndividuals could further prevent a compromise of privacy. 7 IV.1.c Intimacy Most people are accustomed to communicating with an actual person when receiving care. A replacement of human contact by technological devices c an pre sent a level of fear , discomfort , isolation, or loneliness for peopl e re ceiving this type of impersonal care, which can have a major effect on bo th phy sical and emotional he alth. Some individuals may also experience fewer visits from family members who rely too heavily on the technology to assist and respond to daily needs.

(GUDC) Creating Voluntary Universal Design Standards D escription: The Global Universal Design Commission, Inc. (GUDC) is a not- for-profit corporation established with broad bipartisan support from across the country and with the involvement of the design, development, disability , and aging communities . The Commission's purpose is to develop, promote, and accelerate the understanding and use of Universal Design in the design and development of buildi ngs, products, and environments worldwide. Re cognizing the need to take Universal Design (UD) to the next level, Josh Heintz and his law partner, William Gilberti, of Gilberti Stinziano Heintz & Smith, P .C., agreed to fund the initial formation of the GUDC. Heintz and Gilberti collaborated with Peter Blanck, Chairman of the Burton Blatt Institute , in organizing and le ading several meetings to concep tualize the GUDC and bring together experts and stakeholders to collaborate with the new Commission . The GUDC's first effort is to create voluntary consensus standards to guide designers, developers, lenders, governments , and end users to understand and apply UD Standards and certify their efforts . GU DC is currently in the process of developing UD Standards for both new and existing commercial buildings. Modeled after the very successful Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED) standards produced by the U. S. Green Building Council, the UD Standards are intended to complement existing accessibility standards by identifying and encouraging the incorporation of features that increase usability, safety , and health for a diverse end- user populatio n. The standards will expand access to buildings for all people, regardless of physical stature and varying abilities. T he development and approval process for creating UD Standards will include public comment and review. The approved UD standards will be available on the GUDC website to guide corporations and government entities in the creation of barrier- free facilities, providing diverse users with better access to and convenience in commerc e, public services, entertainment, and employment settings. Once the standards for commercial buildings are completed, additional standards will be drafted for other components of the built environment, including housing, products, schools, etc. A numerical rating system will be developed based on the goals of Uni versal Design . Depending on the type and number of Universal Design strategies 2 IV.1.d included, a project will receive a point total and be given a level of accreditation based on that total . Ben efits: Because Universal Design seeks to make environments, products and systems safer, healthier , and more usable, adopting UD Standards has many benefits for a diverse population: UD increases functional independence and opportunities for social participatio n f or the growing number of older people and people with disab ilities: 650 million people are living with disabilities worldwide ; Over 18 per cent of the U.S. population ha ve some limitation in ability ; More than 40 per cent of the U.S. population over 65 years old have diminished abilities ; The a ging of the Baby Boom generation and the obesity epidemic will increase the prevalence of disability ; and The p opulation aged 65 and over will grow from about 20 million in 1994 to almost 40 million by the year 2010 and to an estimated 71 million in 2030 . U D expands markets beyond disability and aging to include people of extreme stature , left-handed individuals, i nternational travelers , people with c hemical s ensitivity and severe allergies, parents with children, and caregivers. UD pro vides a business advantage to organizati ons: Increases a consumer base and customer loyalty ; Reduces operating and renovation costs; Increases productivity; Expands the labor pool by making the work environment useable by greate r num bers of people . I mpediments or barriers to development or imp lementation: The development of the UD Standards will follow an \"ANSI -Approved Process ,\" which is both democratic and public, for developing the standards . Because t his method includes maintaining balance in committee membership, public revie w a nd comment , and documenting responses to all negative ballots and c omments, it requires a great deal of time and effort. A nother potential barrier to the UD Standards is the eventual rate of implementation . As a voluntary standard, there is no guarantee that buil ders, businesses, or government agencies will adopt the UD Standards developed by GUDC. Nevertheless, GUDC has begun to gain international support for itsStandards Development efforts. Potential early adopters of the GUDC standards include: the London 2012 Organising Committee; the government of Ecuador; and the Paralympics Committee , which is planning the design of facilities for the 2014 Winter Games in Russia.3 IV.1.d Resource \u2014example: A potential early adopter of the UD Standards for commercial buildings in New Y ork State includes Kirkwood Senior Housing Development in Binghamton, Ne w Y ork (owned by 3D Development Group, LLC ), which is in the planning stages of a Phase II development to expand its facilities.

The design concepts of walkability and visitability have been found to benefit communities and to improve the quality of life of its residents . W alkability has been defined by Dan Burden, a nationally known expert on the principles underlying this design concept, as the quality of \" the overall walking and living conditions in an area\u2014the extent to which the built environment is friendly to the presence of people who are walking, living, shopping, visiting, enjoying , or spending time in an area\"1 . . . how comfortable, convenient, and safe it is for people to do these things . A cross the country, greater attention is being focused on exercise, fitness, being active, and staying involved\u2014for better mental and physical health. A community with good walkability features encourages walking, strolling, and biking as a strategy for achieving improved health and increased and enhanced interaction among residents. Greater attention is also being focused on walking and biking as alternat ive transportation strategies for reducing the use of personal cars, conserving fossil fuels, and improving air quality. There is growing awareness and appreciation of the role that walkability plays in supporting health and environmental aims, as well as growing recognition of the economic benefits accruing to a community whose walkable design characteristics attract both residents and visitors from other places. W hat are some examples of elements that help make a community walkable : How comfortable is it for residents to walk around their neighborhood s? Are sidewalks needed \u2014to make walking more enticing, safer? Are sidewalks unbroken, made of non -slip m aterials , free of sand and debris in the summer and snow and ice in the winter ? Are there curb cuts to the street? Are there leash laws ? Are there street lights, and are traffic signals timed to allow small children, elderly people , and people with disabilities enough time to safely cross the street? Are there benches for sitting and resting? Water fountains? Walking paths? Are there pathways for bicycling, skateboarding, and rollerblading separate from sidewalks and from the auto roadway? Can people walk to the bus stop? Is there a bus shelter ? Are street signs, building signs, and street numbers large and visible? Are there walking trails in public parks; do they include rest stops ; is there built- in equipment to engage in exercises that improve agility, stamina, and strength? Is there a mapped walking trail through town that brings walkers and shoppers to points of interest, the major amenities, and stores? Are indoor walking trails 2 IV.1.e incorporated into c ommunity centers, schools, malls, YMCAs, a nd senior housing developments to encourage walking and to encourage integration of different age groups ? What are the distance s among local amenities and stores . . . and between residential areas and routine destinations \u2014and, thus, what is a resident's ability to easily get to the goods and services h e need s and wants? Are there buffers between pedestrian walkways and moving traffic? What is the level of connectedness among streets ? What is the frequency of street- crossings? What is the level of traf fic volume and traffic speed ? Is the neighborhood, the community, or the downtown visually appealing? Does the placement of buildings and stores instill a sense of safety . . . instead of a fear of crime? What is the quality of the air; is there sun; is there shade? A n umber of tools , checklists, and audit workshops have been developed to help residents, local leaders, and planners understand the elements of walkability and to gauge just how walkable their own communities are . Increasingly, such measu res are making their way into formal and informal community planning efforts. As an initial informal measure, \"one of the best ways to quickly determine how walkable a block, corridor, or neighborhood is is to count the number of people walking, lingering , and enjoying a space \u2014the diversity of people, and especially the presence of children, seniors, and people with disabilities, denotes the quality, comp leteness, and wholesomeness of a walkable space.\" 2 V isitability refers to the design of a home so that it can be easily entered and exited by the home 's residents, easily visited by other people, and easily used by residents and visitors, including those with frailties and disabilities . The principles of visitability also appl y to public and commercial bu ildings. What are the primary features that make a home or building visitable : (1) There is at least one no- step entrance; (2) there is a bathroom on the first floor, capable of being negotiated by a person who is using a wheelchair or who has a temporary or permanent physical limitation; (3) exterior and interior doorways are wider to accommodate a wheelchair or walker; and (4) in public buildings, an elevator is available to access upper floors. H ow critical are visitability features? A 2007 study3 by the University of Florida's Bureau for Economic and B usiness Research estimate d that up to 60 per cent of new houses built today will, at some point , have a resident with a long- term mobility impairment. Many people with permanent or temporary mobility issues are 'trapped' in their homes because they cannot negotiate stairs to the outside. Just as they may not be able to get out of their homes, many of their friends and family who are just as frail or mobility -impaired are not able to get in\u2014or, once inside the home, have no access to the bathroom . . . so they stop visiting. I t is important for frail older people and people with limited mobility conditions to maintain their social relationships . Social isolation is strongly related to depression; staying involved with family, friends , and others in a social network is strongly related to positive health and well -being. I nitially, the concept of visitability was recognized as an aspect of home design that was crucial to the ability of elderly people to successfully age in place . 3 IV.1.e Increasingly, however, the benefits of visitability \u2014easy and safe access and maneuverability \u2014became clear for people of all ages: small children; people in wheel chairs; those with walkers and canes ; those in a temporary leg ca st; those with permanent physical limitations; and those with reduced strength, agility, and balance due to health conditions or aging . W alkability and visitability \u2014both concepts are aspects of universal design, affecting how useable and how safely and e asily negotiable resident s will find their neighborhoods, communities, and homes to be\u2014throughout their lifetime . The extent to which communities and homes are walkable and visitable affects residents' health and well -being , as well as their satisfaction with their home s and community . . . and, thus, both their ability to remain living in their community and their willingness to continue living in their community .

Gainesville, FL: University of Florida, Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Demographic Association, Birmingham , AL. Ben efits: Walkability: Provides easy opportunities for improving fitness, strength, and agility among all residents \u2014(1) helping older people remain independent and self -managing fo r l onger periods of time, and (2) countering obesity trends among all age groups. Incorporating walkab ility features in and around one's home and throughout the community is a preventive and wellness strategy for better health and reducing the need for l ong-term care services . A walkable community encourages interaction and communication among the various age groups and cultural groups. This is particularly critical for frail olde r pe ople and people with disabilities, both of whom have a greater vulnerability to social isolation. V isitability: For frail older people and people of all ages with mobility impair ments, visitable homes and public buildings encourage socialization and involvement with family,friends, and the wider community \u2014countering social isolation and depression. 4 IV.1.e Visitable homes increase the ability of residents to be self -managing, thereby lessening the need for costly personal care. Designing a new home to be visitable reduces or eliminates the need fo r e xpensive renovations when a resident incurs a frailty or mobility impairment. F or the community: The outcome of walkable and visitable homes and communities is greate r i nteraction and communication among residents, which s trengthens community- building and a \"sense of community\" among residents. Both walkability and visitability are critical aspect s of a livable community (see \"Li vable Comm unities \" in the Resource Manual). The more walkable a community is, the lower the crime rate. Walkable communities reduce reliance on the personal car, conserve fossil fuels, and help improve air quality . Communities that are walkable have improved economies. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Visitability: Developer/planner m isperceptions \u2014visitability features may be dismisse d b ecause of untrue convictions, such as: A mistaken idea that a building's lot must be flat to accom moda te a zero - step entrance; An unproven belief that a home built with accessible and visitable features will be marketable only to people with disabilities; An inaccurate view that only a few people need the benefits of visitability o r uni versal design features; and An incorrect assumption that the cost of incorporating visitability features in new construction is prohibitive . There is a lack of knowledge among many homeowners and developers abo ut the choices and d\u00e9cor possibilities in architectural features, products, and de signs for visitability features, leading to a conviction that visitability features \"cannot be attractive .\" This conviction leads both homeowners and developers to fear that such features will be \"too noticeable \" and will stigmatiz e the residents as being disabled. W alkability: The movement promoting smart growth principles, which supports walkable, more compact communities and less reliance on the use of personal automobiles , is in its beginning stages. While such principles are bei ng inc orporated into newly planned communities, a greater \"culture change\" is 5 IV.1.e required to prompt widespread attention to making substantial walkability changes to existing communities. Creating a walkable community requires a collaborative, cross -sector plann ing effort among disparate agencies responsible for transportation, housing, parks and recreation, commercial building, services, education, and others. Manycommunities have had little or no experience in using such a planning approach ; the y are unaware of planning tools available to help communities implement such an approach; and smaller agencies are often fearful of losing their place i n the community if they are part of a larger endeavor.

The goal of universal broadband access is to provide a high-speed internet connection to everyone, even in rural areas, regardless of economic status. Basic broadband delivers data to the customer at least five megabits per second downstream, and at least one megabit per second upstream . Advanced broadband d eliver s data at least 45 megabits per second downstream and at least 15 megabits upstream per second . Advanced wireless broadband delivers data at least three megabits per second downstream and at least one megabit per second upstream over an internet protocol wireless network . T wo keys to the success of broadband service are its availability and its use by community residents, including older people and people with disabilities \u2014for example, internet technologies have an impact on both these populations socially , economic ally, and with health care issues. Educating older adults and younger people with disabilities about the benefits of broadband internet use is key to their adoption and use of current technologies. Access can be through the home, the senior center, community center, or the public library. In addition, the availability of broadband service supports the provision of health care services in rural areas. For example, rural providers rely heavily on the Internet for health and medical information, and rural nurse practitioners use the Internet for clinical information and for taking needed educational courses through on- line learning venues. T he federal economic stimulus plan include d nearly $179.9 million to upgrade New York's internet broadband service s in areas not currently covered . The focus of the New York State Universal Broadband Initiative is to ensure that every New Yorker has access to affordable, high- speed broadband. This also includes infrastructure develop ment, digital literacy, economic development, and online government services. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service program included $2.5 billion in loans and grants to target rural areas . The National Telecommunications Information Administration administers the B roadband Technology Opportunities Program , and has approximately $4.7 billion targeted to assist vulnerable populations (such as frail elderly persons and unemployed individuals of all ages ). Benefits: For older people and younger -aged people with disabilities: When older adults and people with disabilities are educated about the personal benefits of b roadband -enabled technologies, they can use these resources to liv e 2 IV.1.f healthier and more independent lives, stay connected to families and friends, and have greater access to amenities, supportive services, and medical care. Internet use can enhance social and c ivic engagement and decrease social isolation . Communicating via the internet can be cheaper and more convenie nt than long -distance phone calls. Web- cams can allow both a visual and audio connection , to enhance the experience of visiting and communicating with family and friends. Using the i nternet for reading daily papers, composing emails, worki ng crossword and S udoku puzzles, engaging in on -line brain- building exercises, doing personal research, playing games, and many other activities stimulates the brain, promotes mental sharpness, and helps maintain cognitive abilities throughout the aging process . High-speed broadband access will support the ability of older adults and younge r individuals with disabilities to maintain or extend the ir working careers . For example , those who are semi -retired or who engage in freelance work (as a firs t or second career) can enjoy the benefits of telecommuting wit h increase d flexibility. For caregivers: Internet use provides an affordable, effective tool for caregivers to communicate regularly with their elderly or impaired family members \u2014regardless of the geographic distance between them. Such regular contact helps caregivers keep abreast of the physical, emotional, and cognitive status of their family members, thereby reducing the daily worry about the safety and well -being of those family members. For the wider community : The internet can have an impact on small -business creation, as the associate d start- up and operating costs of web -based businesses are dramatically lowe r than traditional bricks and mortar businesses. Using t he internet for personal financial management tasks and for conducting routine daily activities can have a positive personal economic impact for community residents, including older adults and people with disabilities1\u2014for example, residents can monitor retirement accounts, track investments in stock s and bonds, conduct online banking, and pay bills. Without leaving their homes, residents can research and purchase prescription drugs, manage health care benefits, choose doctors and hospitals, research symptoms and treatments of illnesses, and communic ate with their health care professionals. They can do their grocery shopping, make appointments, arrange travel plans, download books and videos, and many other activities from the comfort and security of their homes \u2014and at any hour of the day or night. 3 IV.1.f High-speed broadband service offers the potential to significantly enhance the provision and efficiency of health and long- term care services, as well as reduc e costs\u2014for example, replacing traditional record -keeping methods with electronic medical recor d-keeping, and taking advantage of new health care technologies such as telemedicine and in -home monitoring technologies , which are transform ing how diagnoses are made, services are provided, patients are monitored, and communications are increased between patients and health care providers . Many of these changes allow residents to take a much more active role i n their own health care, including personally interacting with health care providers directly from their own home s. Patients of all ages and disabilities whose condition s require daily monitoring are now able to download the data from their monitoring equipment from the privacy and comfort of their home s, reducing the hours and cost of in-home aide s or saving the cost of nursing home care . Telemedicine and in -home care technologies have three important, and increasing, audiences: the older adult or person with a disability, who c an enjoy prolonged independence ; families or caregivers, who want the security of knowing their loved one is in good ha nds; and the health care staff , who can monitor the patient continually to identify concerns ..2 Broadband service can keep a community's residents safer; for example: Real time information and intelligence can be shared with first responders by adding wireless computers to patrol cars to improve emergency and day -to- day communications . Emergency 911 services can be extended to rural or remote areas that formerly were without coverage. Internet use provides an effective means for a community's residents to follo w and have an impact on politics at the local, state, and federal levels. State and local governments can provide better and more cost- efficient services throug h internet access so that all \"e -citizens,\" including older adults, people with disabilities, and homebound individuals, can be full participants in the information age and can be more fully active and involved in their communities. Impediments or barriers to development or implementation: Service gaps: There are gaps in broadband service provision across New York State, especially in the rural regions. Vision and leadership are required to make the right business decisions to bring broadband service to rural and remote areas , where the cost of extending the necessary infrastructure is prohibitive. For example, a servic e c ompany would not see a good return on their investment in rural areas wi th s mall populations. 4 IV.1.f Limited resources: State and local governments may have insufficient resources to dedicate to closing the \"digital di vide\"; collaborations between public and private entities can be successful and should be encouraged. \"Gray gap\": Internet awareness and use are higher among younger seniors compared to older seniors (the so- called \"gray gap\") . Older seniors, particularl y thos e who do not live in their own homes, remain more skeptical of the internet's use and benefits and they are less likely to own their own computer. Therelative high cost of computer hardware and software, coupled with broadband service availa bility, also impedes internet us age. 3 R eference s: 1 Charles M. Davidson and Michael J.

Those tightly developed communities were, by design, pedestrian- friendly \u2014built on a scale that permitted residents to easily walk from their homes to merchants and, sometimes, to their places of work. In addition, if those destinations were not within an easy walk, transit stops often were. M ost housing developments, shopping centers, office complexes, and industrial parks built since the 1950s have been oriented toward facilitating easy automobile travel and parking, while separating residential and commercial uses by distances that almost mandate the use of a car to make even short trips. For example, even if the distance between a housing development and a shopping center is a short one, walking along roads without sidewalks, crossing a highway, and traversing a large parking lot is less attractive , and often dangerous, for most people compared to driving in such an environment. T ypically, land-use arrangements since the 1950s do not provide an en vironment conduc ive to walking , biking, or jogging, thus placing constraints on residents' mobility and social interaction. Residents, including older adults and individuals with disabilities, are more inclined to use alternative mobility modes in a tightly built neighborhood with sidewalks and other pedestrians and where there are no highways, traffic on local streets moves slowly, and parking lots are small. V ery recent planning trends have returned to valuing places that accommodate walking, biking, and public transportation as alternatives to driving personal cars . People of all ages and abilities are discovering the many benefits of pedestrian- friendly communities , including physical fitness and greater opportunities for interactions with other people. Ben efits: Placement of Land Uses \u2014 Compact development (density) reduces the distance required for travel between residences, employment, commercial and retail establishments, and s ervices. Mixed -use zoning places a variety of life's daily needs\u2014home, wor k, sch ool, recreation, retail, health, civic, others \u2014within close and/or accessibl e pro ximity via travel modes other than the car. The combination of density and mixed -use creates a built environment that is more conducive to walking, as well as to using bicycles, ro ller-blades, wheel -chair travel, small motorized vehicles, and mass transit\u2014all to the benefit of older adults, children, peopl e wi th mobility impairments, and individuals with and without disabilities \u2014who prefer or require alternatives to the automobile. Both density and mixed- use 2 IV.1.g require zoning codes that accommodate these pedestrian-friendly design attributes. S treet and Streetscape Design\u2014 Streets and streetscapes can be designed to create a safe and comfortablepedestrian experience, which is important to people of all ages and abilities. I n many cases, poor design entirely precludes walking or any other mode of travel but the automobile . P edestrian- friendly street and streetscape design includes wide streets , cross-walks , trees and planting strips , and generous bike lanes. In addition to creating a safe and comfortable physical environment for pedestrians and bicycl ists, these design elements als o c alm traffic (see Safe Driving Strategies : Traffic Calming in the Resourc e Manual ) . Drivers respond to their surroundings and most often adhere to the speed that streets were designed to be driven; if those streets are designed fo r s lower travel, drivers will respond accordingly; if their surroundings signal pedestrian activity and set boundaries to their driving, drivers slow down\u2014fortheir own safety and that of the pedestrians. Gri d-Style Street Connectivity \u2014 \"Street connectivity is a measure of how well the roadway network connects what planners call orig ins and destinations. Good street connectivity means providing a variety of ways to get from Point A to B. The traditional grid -style street layout of older towns provides excellent connectivity \u2014streets are interlinked at numerous points, intersections are closely spaced, and there are few dead -ends. \"1 The goal is to narrow the gap between the actual distance from Point A to Point B and the real travel distance between the two destinations , which is accomplished by connecting homes and land uses i n a m ore gridded, inter- connected pattern. Greater street connectivity and linkages between land uses offer more travel route options , quicker and easier access to daily destinations, and reduced traffic congestion and traffic bottle -necks created when all reside ntial streets converge on single, over -loaded arterials. P ublic trails can also be used to connect land uses; trail and street connections to parks and other public spaces are particularly important because they allo w re sidents of all ages and abilities t o walk or bike to outdoor areas for recreation, exercise, and social interaction (s ee Complete Streets in the Resource M anual ). N eighborhood Scale \u2014 Many experts agree that the ideal size for a pedestrian- friendly neighborhood with an accessible town/urban center is a quarter-to -a-half-mile radius; this is the distance that people will walk to access daily amenities and destinations.The author/planner, Leslie Kettren, broke down this analysis as follows: \"A five- minute walk (one -quarter mile) is as easy as a trip by car. A 10 -minute walk (one- half mile) is easily achieved and is a good basis for planning a compac t ne ighborhood or village. A 20 -minute walk (one mile) is a reasonable distance to walk for exercise when the area is pleasant.\"2 3 IV.1.g R eference s: 1 Street Connectivity, Local Government Commission, New Jersey Department of Transportation: http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/works/studies/rt57/pdf/StreetConnectivity..p df. 2 Leslie E.

Complete Streets takes a holistic approach to community mobility; that is, rather than addressing street and streetscape reform piecemeal, Complete Streets ordinances offer a comprehensive toolbox for street and streetscape design that is age -sensitive (older people and children), and that also responds to the great diversity that typifies a community's overall population\u2014 diversity of abilities , both temporary and permanent impairments , and health conditions. This movement is growing across the country, and several states and localities have passed Complete Streets ordinances (see Resources, below ). Complete Streets are designed to provide safe, comfortable streets for all users \u2014 pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, transit riders, and users of other modes of mobility . Complete Streets combine elements of Smart Growth and walkable communities in a way that promotes safety, exercise, outdoor recreation, access to amenities, and social interaction for seniors, young and middle -aged adults, individuals with disabilities and mobility limitations , and children. C omplete Streets are characterized by a variety of elements; following are descriptions of seven specific tools in the Complete Streets toolbox: M ore sidewalks: According to architect Mark Hinshaw,1 sidewalks should be located on both sides of the street; if located on only one side, adequate street - crossing measures should be implemented. In a typical suburban residential neighborhood, sidewalks should be wide enough to accommodate two people walking side -by-side or passing each other\u2014approximately five feet; in a more dense, mixed -use residential neighborhood, wider sidewalks are necessary to accommodate three people waking side -by-side, or two side -by-side and one passing\u2014approximately seven feet; and in areas of heavy pedestrian circulation (downtowns, Main Streets, traditional business districts), sidewalks should be wide enough to accommodate two people passing each way \u201410 feet or more. To the greatest extent possible, sidewalks should be continuous and should inter-connect different neighborhoods, destinations, and land uses. N eighborhood trails: Where sidewalks are not feasible, neighborhood connector trails serve as a worthwhile substitute \u2014connecting homes, subdivisions, parks, open space, and other amenities. Connector trails can be used in low- density subdivisions (particularly ones with a predominance of cul -de-sacs and dead -ends) to connect areas that may be close \"as the crow flies,\" but require long, circuitous and often dangerous routes to actually navigate by foot or bicycle. 2 IV.1.h S treet widths: For decades, traffic engineers recommended wide streets to accommodate more cars and higher speeds. Even in traditional downtowns, which were originally designed primarily for pedestrians, streets were widened to accommodate automobile travel, rendering them unsafe to walk or bike \u2014 particularly for seniors, children, and others with mobility restrictions. Recently , however, traffic engineers have found that road widenings are little more than a temporary salve. In referring to Mark Hansen's 1995 study ( Do New Highways Generate Traffic?) , Anthony Flint 2 reports that every one per cent increase in lane miles leads to a one per cent increase in congestion within five years. This phenomenon is called \"induced demand\"\u2014the more roads you build, the more cars you will attract. C ounter- intuitively, narrower streets are actually safer\u2014safer to cross on foot and bike, and safer to drive on. Citing a study in Longmont, Colorado, by Swift, Painter, and Goldstein 3 on the correlation between street design and traffic accidents, Girling and Kellett4 report that a 36 -foot-wide street had 1.2 collisions per year, while a 24 -foot street had .32. The Longmont study found that 24 -foot- wide streets are the safest; 36 -40-foot-wide street are the most dangerous. T ypical post -war suburban streets are 34 -36 feet wide, with total rights -of-way of 50-60 feet. This width invites unsafe s peeds , which, in turn, discourages pedestrian and bicycle mobility. Some recent national standards (American Societyof Civil Engineers: National Association of Home Builders; Urban Land Institute), however, are recommending streets as narrow as 22 feet for neighborhoods wi th lo w-traffic volumes.5 S everal alternatives to road- widening are available to land use and transportation planning professionals; for example: Use extra road space (shoulder) for bike lanes\u2014well- marked lanes actually make the road itself appear narrower and feel safer, while signaling to driversthat they should slow down and drive more cautiously; Create nearby alternative routes \u2014parallel roads close by will disperse the traffic among several routes, while preserving pedestrian accessibility and safety o n ea ch of them; and Expand a pedestrian area into traditional street areas\u2014providing a pedestrian \"safety zone\" promotes safety and comfort. S horter blocks/more inter -connections: Most traditional, walkable neighborhoods designed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries have 300- 600-foot blocks; that is, cross routes/intersections exist at regular and frequent intervals. For example, the Portland, Oregon, Green Streets Ordinance6 requires through- streets no more than 530 feet apart and pedestrian connections every 330 feet, where feasible. Such requirements offer advantages for all residents, but especially for older adults with frailties, small children, and other individuals with mobility impairments; for example: 3 IV.1.h More lin kages that access different land uses and amenities; More opportunities for walking and outdoor exercise; A more interesting pedestrian or bicycle trip; A greater feeling of safety; More direct and, thus, shorter routes to destinations; and A greater sense of place. I n addition, neighborhood connector trails can be located at areas where sidewalks are absent, in order to supplement a continuous and frequent system of inter- connections. Also, restrictions on the length and number of cul -de-sacs and dead- ends in a conventional suburban subdivision offer connectivity improvements. For example, the Metro Portland, Oregon, metropolitan region sets a maximum length of 200 feet for cul -de-sacs, which are only permitted where street and trail connecti ons are not possible .7 \" Green streets\": Street landscaping and vegetation (street trees, planting beds, landscaped medians and sidewalks, pervious natural draining areas , etc.) provide human, as well as environmental, benefits: shade and cooling in the summer; aesthetic appeal; traffic -calming; and a sense of place. Researchers at the U. S. Federal Highway Administration and Canada's Victoria Transport Policy Institute even found that drivers drive slower on green streets, thus creating a safer and more enjoyable pedestrian experience.8 C ross- walks: Cross -walks provide clearly designated pedestrian areas for street- crossing \u2014areas where people come first, and cars second. Cross -walks signal to drivers (more effectively than a sign) that they should slow down and be aware of pedestrian activity. Pr otective barriers: G reen areas between the street and sidewalk , on-street parking, and street trees provide a protective barrier between pedestrian areas and traffic, creating a greater sense of safety, security , and comfort for pedestrians. Ben efits: For all residents: Complete Streets promote physical and mental health by: Providing greater exercise and mobility options; Improving pedestrian and driver safety; and Creating opportunities for socializi ng and community activity. F or older adults and individuals with disabilities: Complete Streets allow frail older people and younger people with disabilities tocontinue to independently navigate their environment, thereby maintaining a sense of competen cy and reducing vulnerability to depression. 4 IV.1.h For the community: As a critical aspect of a livable community, Complete Streets : Help create a healthier and more sustainable living environment; Help generate a greater sense of place and community identity for residents and encouraging them to remain living in the community rather than re locating to other areas. Make both commercial and residential areas more attractive, creatingincreased resident activity which, in turn, generates increased business activity by community establishments and stores. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Existing zoning and development patterns have created an environment almos t e xclusively conducive to automobile travel, which makes mobility alternatives (walking, bicycling, alternative transit use) unsafe and uncomfortable, if no t e ntirely impossible. Retro -fitting existing communities with green street amenities can be expensive. Planning for various community elements (housing, parkland, commercial, mobility and transportation, etc.) is often conducted independently of eac h o ther, thereby reducing the opportunity of coordinating the application of a C omplete Streets approach to the overall community.

Citing Professional Traffic Engineer, James Daisa, authors Handy, Paterson, and Butler1 define street connectivity as \" . . . a system of streets with multiple routes and connections serving the same origins and destinations . . . . An area with high connectivity has multiple points of access around its perimeter as well as a dense system of parallel routes and cross -connections within the areas . . . . The connectivity of the street network has important implications for travel choices, emergency access , and, more generally, quality of life. \" Connectivity is also an element of the Complete Streets framework (see Complete Streets in the Resource Manual ). S treet connectivity was the rule in most late 19th and early 20th century communities. A gridded system of streets with regular access and exit points offered several travel options for drivers, thus dispersing traffic and avoiding congestion and bottle -necks. This system complemented the more prevalent compact, mixed- use built environment of the tim e. A fter World War II, however, connectivity gradually became the exception. Instead, suburban communities were planned and built on a hierarchical system of roadways \u2014partly as a rejection of the urban neighborhood form from which many families fled, and partly to accommodate the proliferation of automobile travel and ownership. The hierarchical system functioned (or not) like this: wide, local neighborhood roads connected isolated subdivisions (many dominated by cul -de- sacs and dead- ends) to a limited number of neighborhood collector streets; these collector streets delivered cars to minor and major arterials, usually at a limited number of access points; and these arterials then connected to freeways and highways. The system also included wide, winding neighborhood roads with no sidewalks , which made pedestrian, bicycle , and transit travel nearly impossible. In i ts earlier stages, this system functioned well. But as the suburbs became more crowded, traffic problems worsened \u2014bottlenecks at peak hours (and throughout the day, in some instances) became commonplace, and traffic congestion on arterials increased. Drivers stuck in traffic had no, or limited, alternative routes. T his approach to street design and traffic management was bolstered by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual, which set road standards that most municipalities simply adopted in full . The ITE manual, for example, recommended minimum street widths of 32- 34 feet, and rights -of-way of 60 feet. Additionally, the Federal Highway Administration set neighborhood design standards based on this system of roadway design as a condition of eligibility for the long-term, low -interest mortgages that allowed many families to afford 2 IV.1.i suburban homes . Cul -de-sacs were treated by these authorities as the most desirable street layout for suburban communities .2 T his road system accommodated the market for housing at the time \u2014the American Dream of a large house on a large lot, secluded from other homes and buildings (this housing prefer ence still dominates the home -buying market ). This system reduced through- traffic, thus providing the privacy and isolation sought by families leaving the cities ; and cul -de-sacs were seen as the safest environment for raising children. The downside was increased traffic congestion, decreased walkability/bikability, limited or no transit options, and complete reliance on the automobile. B ut times are changing; many land use and transportation planning professionals are advocating for a more inter-c onnected st reet design system that promotes walking, biking, transit, slower car speeds, and greater quality -of-life. As a sign of the times, the ITE teamed up with the Congress for the New Urbanism and Smart Growth America to develop pedestrian- and neig hborhood -friendly street and streetscape designs. 3 And , the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Urban Land Institute , and the N ational Association of Home Builders have worked together to promote integrated land use and transportation planning to create more livable communities.

Washington, DC: Institute of Transportation Engineers. Electronic version: http://www.ite.org/css/ . Ben efits: Connecting land uses, neighborhoods , and districts through a well -planned, inter-connected roa d network provides multiple benefits to older adults, families, and people with disabilities, as well as the overall community: A more active and social community life, increasing communicatio n and c onnections among residents of all ages and cultures and, thereby, strengthening a community's social capital and its community identity ; Safer, more direct, and more varied routes to destinations; Mobility alternatives to the car, thereby saving energy costs ; Traffic-calming and traffic safety, thereby reducing accidents ; More access points for emergency vehicles; and A greater \"sense of place. \" 3 IV.1.i I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Wholesale adoption of a street -connectivity framework may not be supported by all community residents , or may not adequately respond to the needs of all relevant stakeholders . For example, residents who still prefer the privacy and l ess traffic associated with non -connected residential street systems may resis t e fforts for greater street connectivity . This emphasizes the need for community - wide discussions to identify the areas of the community in which street- connectivity principles will benefit residents and those areas that should remain the same . Street- connectivity often induces more neighborhood through- traffic , which ma y be undesirable . This can be minimized by including traffic- calming strategies (see Traffic Calming section in the Resource Manual ) can result in slower, calme r traf fic, or even deter through-traffic , because such measures eliminate the driver- convenience of cutting through neighborhoods. Eme rgency access/r esponse - benefits and impediments : Both the conventional, disconnected road system and the inter- connected approach embodied in the Complete Streets approach have benefits and shortcomings for emergency vehicle access and response times. Becaus e e mergency services are such an important part of a community, planning efforts should actively consult and engage fire and emergency professionals to strike a wo rkable balance between the two interests : Generally, emergency responders prefer greater connectivity because i t pro vides greater, quicker and more direct access to an incident. The Raleigh, NC, Transportation and Planning Department studied fire and E mergenc y M anagement System efficiencies in three different area neighborhood types : (1)o lder, traditional, gridd ed development; (2) neighborhoods built in the 1970s and 1980s with limited connectivity and few dead- ends; and (3) developments from the late 1980s and 1990s with very limited connections and many cul -de-sacs and dead -ends. According to the City of Raleig h D epartment of Transportation, \"In all cases, the analysis showed far greate r s ervice efficiencies for those older neighborhoods with greater street connectivity. Eve n when discounting the density of development in these areas, the raw acreage covered in each case confirmed the greater efficiencyin fire response coverage for areas with better street connectivity.\" 4 A t the same time, emergency responders prefer wider streets for increase d v ehicle mobility. Wide roads with no curbs and wide turning radii can bette r ac commodate large emergency response vehicles, such as fire trucks. B ut re search shows that these roads result in more accidents. In addition, cul - de-sacs and dead- ends present dangers for emergency response services\u2014 the first vehicle in may be blocked in by subsequent vehicles; subsequent vehicles may be prevented from getting closer to the incident; and, if a s ingle access point is blocked, no alternati ve routes exist. 4 IV.1.i Reference: 4 Susan Handy, Robert Paterson, and Kent Butler (2003), Planning for Street Connectivity: Getting from Here to There , p. 56.

Today, m ore than 8 0 per cent of Americans live in metropolitan areas , and the growing population in many of these areas carries with it increased demands on existin g parks and outdoor recreational facilities. Many community leaders understand the benefits of planning for parks and outdoor areas, and community gardens flourish in many urban places, providing a park -like setting for visitors and a place for urban dwellers to garden. R ecreation has physical, psychological, economic , and environmental benefits, all of which help people stay mentally and physically fit. Park and outdoor recreation areas located close to home or to other often -used amenities are the most beneficial, as p eople are more likely to incorporate a visit or a stroll into a daily routine if parks and trails are close to home or to other community resources such as senior centers, libraries, and shops . The farther away parks, trails, camps, fishing, and natural areas are from home, the less likely people are to visit them. M unicipalities can relatively easily make a variety of recreational options available to a community's vari ous members (including older adults and individuals with disabiliti es), all of whom might enjoy walking, bird watching, bocce ball, golf, shuffle board, tennis, swimming, tai chi, boating, gardening, or many other activities . Ben efits: For residents of all ages: Improved physical and mental health \u2014 Regular physical ac tivity improves fitness, lowers blood pressure, and is a to ol in the arsenal to combat obesity and diabetes. Exercise can be a mood- elevator, alleviating depression and anxiety , which is especially important for frail older adults and younger individuals with disabilities, as both groups are vulnerable to social isolation and limited social networks. Parks and other green recreational areas that provide comforts and a menities, such as benches, tables , games such as chess or checkers , e xercise and fitness p aths, public restrooms, telephones, lighting, first ai d s tations, water fountains, and accessibility features will foster an increase d s ense of security and attract greater use of these areas by residents of all ages, especially young children, older adults, people with special needs, and in dividuals with disabilities. This encourages a balance of resident -users, which promotes a greater sense of community. 2 IV.1.j F or residents and communities: Community gardens transform vacant lots into productive and beautifu l ne ighborhood spaces, which can beautify the neighborhood, give residents a s ense of accomplishment , improve community members' access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and reduce food budgets. F or communities: Social benefits: Recreation areas are an element of a livable community, providing areas fo r re sidents of all ages to meet socially and interact\u2014strengthening community identity and a vibrant sense of community. Well-maintained recreation areas within neighborhoods provide goo d s ocializing and activity opportunities for children and teenagers, helping to mitigate undesirable behaviors that can emerge from \"having nothing to do.\" \"Nature Centers\" serve as an in -park community center for public education, recreational activities, resident- socialization, and volunteer opportunities fo r re sidents of all ages and abilities. E nvironmental benefits: In parks and other outdoor recreational areas, trees and shrubs absorb airpollution, improving the quality of the air we breathe. Trees provide shade and cool the earth, which is nature's version of natural air conditioning . T rees and bushes provide a filter system for the pollutants in storm wate r run -off, helping to keep such pollutants from entering storm drains and going into rivers and streams. Parks provide an effective habitat for wildlife, especially for migrating birds in urban areas . Waterfront areas are rich ecosystems . E conomic benefits: Homes and businesses that are in close proximity to parks and outdoo r re creation areas have shown increase d property values . P arks and waterfront developments featuring walking paths and trails promote tourism and bring local tax dollars to the community. S ocial benefits: Parks and open- spaces recreational areas provide places for all socio - economic group s to mix and socialize , promoting interaction and helping to stabilize neighborhoods , which, in turn, can engage the interest of multiple resident groups in community planning and community efforts, and reduce crime. I mpediments or barriers to developme nt or implementation: During trying fiscal times , the decision to expend scarce resources to upgrade parks and purchase land to dedicate to open space becomes increasingly challenging . In some places, parks close ; in others , maintenance is deferred. 3 IV.1.j P ark and recreational areas that are not well -maintained (and, therefore, no t us ed by many people) can attract vandalism and other crimes. E xisting parks may lack necessary comforts, amenities, and ADA accessibility compliance. They may be older and designed only for passive recreational needs, and do not meet today's r ecreational and fitness preferences and options among all age and ability groups, such as bicycling , swimming , Tai Chi, trekking, and others . Paths and trails may not be connected between muni cipalities , reduci ng re creational choices that regional trail systems would provide. A ssembling parcels to create new parks in developed areas is complex and e xpensive and, eve n when done successfully, is a very long process.

The U . S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) de fines food security as \" access by all members [of a community] at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life .\"1 Individuals and families experience food insecurity when their diets are of reduced quality or variety \u2014because they cannot afford balanced meals , or lack knowledge of nutritious foods, or when, because of accessibility or cost, they run out of food, cut the size of their meals, miss meals, are hungry but do not eat, or they l ose weight because of a lack of sufficient food.1 R eadily available, nutritive food is vital for thriving human habitats. Upon superficial assessment of communities in the United States, it would seem that there is plenty of food to go around. However despite the ubiquity of supermarkets, grocery stores, convenience stores, and restaurants, inadequate food security remains an issue among many of our residents . I n its analysis of the 2009 Current Population Survey, the USDA found that approximately 15 per cent of households in the United States (17.4 M households \u2014 over 50 M people, including over 17 M children) were food insecure at some time during 2009 \u2014that is, were uncertain of having, or were unable to acquire, enough food to meet the needs of all their family members because of insufficient money or other resources for food. 2 Source: United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, based on Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Food Security Supplemental Data. http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodSecurity/stats_graphs.htm2 2 IV.1.k F ood insecurity and obesity \u2014 Obesity and overweight are fast becoming characteristics associated with those who do not have enough money for higher quality food or who make poor food choices due to economic hardship.3 It is estima ted that one in three adults over age 20 is overweight or obese, and approximately one in five children ages 2 through 19 is overweight or obese. 4, 5 S ome communities are virtual food deserts, where convenience stores and fast food restaurants are relied upon for relatively more expensive, less nutritive food . Both zoning ordinances and food code regulations can, without meaning to, increase access to those foods, promoting overweight and obesity . Often, zoning restrictions governing allowable locations for alternative food sources can inadvertently increase demand for lower quality food by requiring extensive travel by consumers to access more nutritious alternative sources.6 However, f ood security is not just an issue of accessibility (location, cost) ; the types of foods that fill c onventional food outlets are also a significant food security problem. Whereas alternative food source models (see below) tend to provide a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables (foods that are associated with both weight control and the prevention of chronic illnesses , such as diabetes ), consumption of these nutritive foods tends to be low among people experiencing food insecurity.7 Instead, those who are food insecure tend to consume foods that are inexpensive, convenien t, energy -rich (high in sugar) , but nutrient- poor; and this pattern has been linked to the increased prevalence of obesity.8 Some food code regulations may have also inadvertently increased demand for lower quality , factory -packaged foods , as factory -packaged or heavily processed foods may be seen by consumers as safer because of the stringent public health laws that govern their development. 6, 9 Percent of Obese (BMI > 30) in U.S. Adults http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.html#State10Percent of Obese Adults (BMI > 30) in the U.S.10 3 IV.1.k 2009 State Obesity Rates10 State % State % State % State % Alabama 31.0 Illinois 26.5 Montana 23.2 Rhode Island 24.6 Alaska 24.8 Indiana 29.5 Nebraska 27.2 South Carolina 29.4 Arizona 25.5 Iowa 27.9 Nevada 25.8 South Dakota 29.6 Arkansas 30.5 Kansas 28.1 New Hampshire 25.7 Tennessee 32.3 California 24.8 Kentucky 31.5 New Jersey 23.3 Texas 28.7 Colorado 18.6 Louisiana 33.0 New Mexico 25.1 Utah 23.5 Connecticut 20.6 Maine 25.8 New York 24.2 Vermont 22.8 Delaware 27.0 Maryland 26.2 North Carolina 29.3 Virginia 25.0 Washington DC 19.7 Massachusetts 21.4 North Dakota 27.9 Washington 26.4 Florida 25.2 Michigan 29.6 Ohio 28.8 West Virgin ia 31.1 Georgia 27.2 Minnesota 24.6 Oklahoma 31.4 Wisconsin 28.7 Hawaii 22.3 Mississippi 34.4 Oregon 23.0 Wyoming 24.6 Idaho 24.5 Missouri 30.0 Pennsylvania 27.4 http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.html#State10 A lternative food source model s\u2014 Alternative food sources are methods of achieving food security that can supplant or supplement a community's conventional methods of accessing food. Alternative food sources can be group ed into four categories: Pro ducers as consumers11 (those growing the food consume what they produce , such as in a community garden) ; Producer- to-consumer partnerships11 (growers develop a direct, private relationship with specifically identified consumers of their food products, as in community supported agriculture (CSA) programs) ; Direct-sell initiatives11 (growers sell direct ly to the general public , such a s ro adside food stands, mobile grocers, or farmers' markets) ; and Specialist retailers12 (growers /producers of a specialized product privately sell direct ly to select consumers, such as online grocers and tourist programs) . E xamples of alternative food source model s\u2014 Mobile grocers: Not your typi cal street vendor, mobile grocers (also called veggie mobiles and mobile farm trucks) are a relatively new way to sell fresh fruit and produce from a converted truck or school bus , which may or may not be refrigerated. They are typically operated by a community organization, and they differ from farm stands because mobile grocers usually target food deserts. The 4 IV.1.k mobile grocer generally operates on a fixed schedule year round and stops at specific sites that have been disclosed to the public in advance. Most mobile grocer operators are able to sell their produce for lower prices than supermarkets as the nature of their business typically requires them to purchase foods that are in season and locally produced. Mobile grocers tend to be middle men in the food system since the food they sell is usually not produced by the mobile grocer operator. Whatever is sold is first purchased by the mobile grocer from local farmers . Those operating mobile grocers typically must have a special permit to operate. Farm s tands (roadside/street- side): This is a t emporary , small retail space where a commercial or part- time farmer sells his produce and other wares at a stand on the street or roadside. This is done on a much smaller scale (e.g., one or two farmers) than a farmers' market (multiple vendors). Those operating roadside or street- side farm stands usually have special permits to operate and may be required to move after so many hours of operation. F armers' markets : This alternative food source model allow s many farmers to gather in one location, set up individual stations, and sell their produce and other wares to the public for an extended period of time. Farmers' markets are similar to open air markets and bazaars in other countries. Farmers' markets are usually held outdoors but can be held indoors during winter months or inclement weather. The markets operate weekly, monthly, quarterly, or seasonally; and vendors must have permits to operate. C ollective kitchens: Collective kitchens are also known as community kitchens and are unlike any other alternative food source model. Collective kitchens allow a group of people to come together at designated times (e.g., weekly, fortnight, monthly) to prepare meals. 13, 14, 15, 16 Usually conducted in the kitchens of schools and churches,13 collective kitchens allow p articipants to share the costs of food and food preparation, as well as provide a means for socializing with other community member s. In addition, p articipants learn about meal planning and how to become better food-purchasers and cooks. Meals are relatively inexpensive per participant when compared to the cost of independent meal preparation, and participants also enjoy more variety in their diets. Participants report feelings of increased social support, decreased social isolation, and increased feelings of group and individual empowerment, 13, 14, 15, 16 with participants often indicating that the social interaction and support are what compel them to continue to participate.17 In addition to this model's attributes as a sustainable food system and an anti -poverty method of \"pooling resources and labor to produce large quantities of food ,\" it is also less stigma tizing for community members with food security issues than going to a food bank.13, 14, 15 T he collective kitchen model appears to have originated in Peru in the 1960s and 1970s, where c omedores populares (people's kitchens) arose as a survival strategy among many residents as urban settlements grew around major cities in that country.14, 18 In 1985, t wo women in Montreal started cooking together to share 5 IV.1.k food costs, and today networks of collective kitchens are found in all provinces in Canada.13, 14, 15 While the social, health, economic, and community -building benefits of collective kitchens stress their value as an element of communi ty livability, a scan of the literature produced no evidence of them in the United States. C ommunity gardens: These are plots of land cultivated by a specific cohort of community residents . Community gardens are usually grassroots efforts, made up of volunteer community residents ; gardens vary in size and in their location within a community; the garden's available plot of land originates from diverse private or public sources; the number of participating member gardeners can vary significantly ; and me mbers are responsible for developing , maintaining , and harvesting the garden's produce . Produce can be edible foods, non -edible flora, or a blend of both; and the gardeners consume/use what they grow and are encouraged to share what is produced with others. A primary benefit and goal of community gardens is the social support and interaction among the participating members. See \"Community Gardens\" in the Resource Manual to learn about the various types of community gardens and the diverse livability benefits derived from this alternative food source mode. C ommunity supported agriculture (CSA) programs : A CSA program comprises \" a community of individuals who pledge their support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing both the risks and benefits of food production.\"19 Participating community members c ontract financially (or via physical labor or other assistance) with a loc al farmer to receive, on a weekly basis, share s of what is produced throughout the growing season . Consumers pick up their shares at designated times and places in the community. Consumers either pay for the entire season in advance or via a payment plan, assuming the risk/benefit of a poor or very productive season. CSA programs can vary\u2014for example, some operate in combination with mobile farm trucks ; some farmers will allow members to come to the farm to observe operations or to pick their own produce (a U-Pick or Pick -Your-Own program); and some farmers will supplement their CSA program by opening their U-Pick operations to the general public. T rend\u2014increasing support of alternative food source model s\u2014 At earlier times in history, what we now consider alternative food sources (street - side markets, farmers' markets, and other methods of obtaining locally produced and fresh food) were the norm. Street- side markets were the \"cornerstones of food security in rural areas and in rapidly urbanizing areas\";6 and many of these alternative models served as places of social congregation for community members. However, over time, evolving zoning ordinances stressed the separation of residential, commercial, and other community functions, restricting or complete ly prohibiting easy access to various alternative food source models by a community's population core and f orcing these alternative s to be located in areas of suburban sprawl and beyond the reach of population centers.6, 7, 20 Simultaneously, evolving 6 IV.1.k public health and food regulations focused on regulating food safety and consistency on a grander scale .6 Both these trends helped promote what is now the conventional food system . H owever, the tide is turning; in response to greater concerns about healt h, obesity, and the impact of pollutants, as well as a growing focus on walkable communities, sprawl containment, organic farming, and the economic savings of \"buying locally ,\" growing support is evident among local, state, and national organizations and governing authorities for utilizing alternative food sources. For example, b oth the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets provide resources on their web sites that allow viewers to locate farme rs' markets in defined geographical areas of interest.21, 22 Today, increasing numbers of communities have at least one community garden organization, and the American Community Garden Association maintains a list of community gardens in the United States and Canada. 23 Collective kitchen initiatives have expanded across all provinces in Canada. New York City has long been a model of street -side grocer ies, with fresh fruits, vegetables, baked goods, and other foods available to residents and visitors ali ke. The Supa' Fresh Veggie Mobile operates on the streets of St. Louis, M issouri,24 and the Capital District Community Gardens in Albany, New York, operates a Veggie Mobile that travels to areas of the community to provide fresh, healthy food options that may otherwise be unavailable to people in those communities. The New York State Office of General Services hosts a farmers ' market at both the Empire State Plaza and at the Harriman State Office complex in Albany, New York , throughout the calendar year; and a farmers' market operates in the middle of downtown Schenectady, NY \u2014 outside the Mayor's office in the summer and inside a main street theatre mall during the winter. The USDA offers grants to make farmers' markets, food stands, and other direct- sell initiatives more accommodating for people who utilize those programs. 22 Local Harvest's25 web site lists 315 Community Supported Agriculture Programs in New York State. And, m any public and private schools, universities, and even healthcare facilities hav e begun to participate in or utilize alternative food sources.26 Va rious tactics can help ensure that alternative food source models are affordable for greater numbers of households. Although alternative food networks may help support the vitality of our food systems, it is important to ensure that they remain options for everyone.27 Operators of alternative food source models can participate in benefit programs such as WIC (Women, Infants, and Children Food and Nutrition Program), Farmers Market Nutrition Program, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and SFMNP (Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program) . A number of discounted memberships per season can be offered for some alternative food source models, and tax -deductible charitable donati ons of produce can be made to members of the community who are food insecure or to organizations that provide free food and meals. A variety of other strategies, including incentive zoning, mixed -use zoning, special use permits, and more flexible public health regulations that consider the overall community -livability contexts of alternative food operations, can help improve food security, as well as overall community well -7 IV.1.k being . (See Section II.2, Zoning, in the Resource Manual for more detailed informat ion on zoning regulations.) \"F ood security\" is driven by many local conditions and m any global variables such as world food markets and government policies. Amid those conditions and variables, a lternative food sources are a vital tool in helping achieve food security . The economic, ecological, and social benefits of alternative food networks28 can make communities more livable for all residents .

Benefits: For Residents: Alternative food source models utilize food from local sources , resulting in benefits associated with a shorter food -supply chain (relatively shorter time from harvest to table: oEnergy conservation\u2014commodities travel fewer food miles to reach consumers . oFresher, more nutritive food \u2014a shorter food -supply chain lessens the lo ss o f freshness and nutrients that can occur in longer time travel period s between harvest and consumer. oCost- savings \u2014locally grown commodities do not have to be flown, shipped, or driven long distances i n refrigerated trucks ; in addition, there is less or no need to use costly means of altering locally grown foods as a m eans of preserving or restoring the look of freshness . A lternative food sources allow consumers to have increased knowledge of the origin, source, and seasonality of food. The availability of a combination of conventional and alternative food sources in a community has been associated with improved health\u2014a decrease in the prevalence of obesity and food ins ecurity among community residents. For the Community: Improved Communities : oDiverse alternative food sources provide communities with greate r o pportunities to improve food security among populations in the community's various neighborhoods , including low -income neighborhoods . oAlternative food source models can be established more quickly than conventional food sources and can, therefore , have a positive impact on the various aspects of community food security more quickly. Strengthened Communit y-Building: oThe physical, as well as philosophical, environment of alternative food sources promotes greater engagement among community members; som e m odels serve to restore public meeting/gathering places . oA lternatives can also help restore a sense of community c ohesiveness and a sense of place among its members ;1 these food source model s are ofte n11 IV.1.k more interactive than conventional food sources, allow ing participants to get to know each other and the producers of their food. Alternative food sources often put money directly back into the local econom y. References (and resources) : 1 J.

Impediments or b arriers to development or implementation : For Residents:Community member s may not be aware that alternative food sources exist. Unlike many conventional supermarkets, alternative food sources are no t o ne-stop shopping centers, thus requiring more consciou s effort and planning by consumers. Hours of operation may be more limited compared to conventionalsupermarkets. Participation in s ome alternative food sources (such as Community Supporte d A griculture (C SA) programs ) can be expensive. Many alternative food sources are unable to accept public benefits fromprograms such as WIC, SNAP, and SFMNP. For the Community:Zoning and public health laws may restrict operation of alternative food sources in some areas. If there are no alternative food source model s in a community, residents ma y hav e to travel farther to access these sources. Members of the community may oppose operation of alternative food sources for fear of attracting people from outside the community or large crowds.

Because of their inherent social, economic, health, and community- building benefits, community gardens are a valuable element of a livable community. C ommunity gardens can serve many purposes, but a universal function is to garner and nurture a sense of fellowship among its members , as well as to provide collectively organized, well -maintained green spaces. For example, the Cleveland Cultural Gardens within Rockefeller Park in Cleveland, Ohio , are a collection of gardens following an ethnic theme that demonstrate s just that.5 I t is possible that community gardens have been in existence since the beginning of agriculture, but the formal concept of the community garden seems to have been established sometime during the 19 th century in the United States \u2014interest in community gardening is evident during the late 1800s.3, 6 History also shows that during periods of drastic change or instability (and sometimes food insecurity), people turn to gardening to ease the psychological, sociological, and financial burdens that come along with these changes ; 3, 6 for example, involvement increased during the Great Depression in the 1930s , and during World Wars I and II.3, 6 Inte rest continues today, particularly in areas where green spaces are limited. According to the American Community Garden Association (ACGA),7 there are at least 18,000 gardens in the United States and Canada, with at least one community garden in all 50 U.S. states and most of the Canadian provinces ; and ACGA has been holding annual conferences in the United States and Canada since 1978. M embers of community gardens are as diverse as the communities in which they live. Membership often includes children and adolescents, adults of all ages including elderly persons , people in wheelchairs, immigrants, celebrities, and people with a variety of special needs. Additionally, community gardens attract members across income levels and with a wide range of gardening experiences. 2 IV.1.l Categorizing community gardens \u2014 There are several ways to categorize community gardens \u2014by characteristics of flora grown in the garden, the garden' s overall function , the location of the garden, and the media used for cultivation: F lora: Community gardens contain plant life, or flora, which can be edible or non - edible. Edible gardens are more utilitarian in that they are developed for consumption, and produce often includes fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Although soil testing is recommended for all gardens, this is a mandatory requirement for gardens producing edibles. Non-edible gardens are primarily produced for aesthetics, and flora include s flowers, small shrubs, and trees . Often , community gardens are of a blended type , consisting of both edible and non -edible flora. M any community gardens in the U nited States and Canada are primarily of the edible or blended type,7 while gardens in some places \u2014such as Germany , specifically Berlin \u2014tend to be for aesthetic purposes only.8 In Ireland and throughout other areas of Europe, edible gardens are often identified as allotment gardens , and non-edible gardens are considered community gardens.9 Therefore, it is important to understand that what is considered a garden consisting of edibles in one area of the world may be referred to as something totally different elsewhere. F unction: There are typically six functions of a community garden: donations, market, neighborhood, therapy , education and training, and multi-functional . Donation gardens allow all products of the garden to be donated to individuals and organizations .10 Mark et gardens require all products of the garden to be sold for a profit.10 N eighborhood gardens are probably what most people think of when they he ar the term community garden. In this type, garden plots are individually o r c ommunally tended, and gardeners are allowed to keep what is produced.10 T herapy gardens are found in places such as hospitals, elder care and othe r sp ecial-care homes, and occupational health clinics. The therapy garde n is intended for mental, spiritual, and physical rehabilitation.10, 11 E ducation and training gardens, located in schools and other locations, are use d to teach others about the environment and how to garden successfully .10, 12 A m ulti-functional garden can serve any combination of the previous ly mentioned functions. Lo cation: Community gardens can be further classified by location. Generally, gardens can be found in urban, rural , or suburban areas. Gardens in all of these areas can be placed whereve r soil or other growing media are found\u2014including empty lots, backyards, rooftops, planters, work places, places of worship, schools, and others . M edium : Additionally, community gardens are identified by the medium in which they are cultivated. Most gardens are soil -based, but there are gardens grown in medium s other than soil , due to the type of flora the gardener has chosen to 3 IV.1.l produce, climate conditions, lack of available land for cultivation, or for personal convenience. These are called hydroponic gardens, and they have been in use for many years.13, 14, 1 5 Examples of these alternative media for plant growth include moss, peat, woodchips, gravel, and even liquids fortified with nutrients vital for plant growth.13, 15 Such a lternative media can be vital in areas where soil, space/land, and even water are issues.16 The essence of a hydroponic garden is evidence of the special attention and knowledge required to maintain this type of garden. While not required for hydroponic gardens, s oil-based gardens must have the soil tested , as previous land uses may have resulted in retention of contaminants in the soil. S tarting a garden: Community gardens typically begin as grassroots efforts, and the American Community Ga rdening Association identifies s ix steps in starting a community garden:7 Development of a planning committee; Selection of a site for the garden; Preparing and developing the site ; Organizing/designing the garden; Liability insurance for the garden; and Setting up a new gardening organ ization. O nce a planning committee is formed, identification of usable land is a very important step. Land tenure (the right to hold land/property) is a major issue ;17 thus, prior to breaking ground for establishing a community garden, the planners must determine w hether a garden is to be cultivated on public, private, or semi - private land. Once a usable plot of land is identified and access is obtained, other resources\u2014such as funding for tools, irrigation, media, seeds, and seedlings, a s well as any s killed people required to run/maintain the garden and organize members \u2014are needed to prepare and develop the site . Liability insurance is also recommended in order to start a community garden responsibly.7 T o add to the livability of a community, the process of developing and maintaining a community garden should reflect the community 's membership. For example, gardens can be planned and designed to accommodate people in wheelchairs , those with other special needs , and people of various ages; and the g arden should also be named in a way that best suits the garden and the community. The most valuable required resource is the members of the community that are mobilized to sustain and maintain the garden on an on -going basis. Whether the garden is initiated by a well-established neighborhood organization or a group of motivated citizens, other members of the community must be identified and encouraged to participate. T hroughout the six steps for establishing a community garden, coalitions can be formed with local businesses, government agencies, and other organizations . Such collaborations foster community -building support for the establishment and maintenance of the community garden and are valuable resources for in- kind contributions of equipment , volu nteers, and other essentials . In addition, s upport 4 IV.1.l from local officials and leaders can promote the success of a garden by helping to establish community gardening as a norm .18 W hat community gardens are not\u2014 Occasionally there is confusion among comm unity gardens and urban farms, food cooperatives ( food co-ops), commu nity supported agriculture (CSA ), and farmers ' markets. U rban farms: Urban farms are full scale farms operating in a metropolitan area. They can be plant- or animal -focused and are dependent on a sole farmer o r a gro up of farmers working together. C ompared to community gardens, cultivation and harvest are much more structured in urban farming; typically , what is produced is sold for profit; and operations run via paid labor. Fo od co -ops: Food c o-ops exist when a collective , for the purpose of lower food costs, pools its resources to obtain food for the members of the collective . U sually set up like a grocery store, f ood co -ops require membership dues to maintain operations , and they pay the people who run the co -op for the members. The co -op may also allow non- members , who are required to pay slightly higher prices for purchasing goods. Money made by the co -op is invested back into the co -op. C ommunity supported agriculture (CSA): CSA involves a contract between consumer s and a local farmer, which allows a consumer to receive a package of produce \u2014and sometimes animal products such as meat and dairy and othe r go ods\u2014on a regular basis. Selection is limited to what the farmer success fully produces, so participating consumers assume this collective risk. Packages of produce and other goods can be delivered to the consumer or picked up from a s et location , such as the local farmer's operation, at defined interval s over th e pro duction s eason . The consumer pays a flat fee to the farmer for this service. The fee is typically expected up front, but some farmers allow participation i n pay ment plans . F armers ' markets : Farmers' markets are typically designated sites where a s ingle farmer or a group of farmers gather on a specified day and time to sell their wares to members of the public.

Benefits: For Residents: Food Security: Edible community gardens can improve the food security of community members, particularly in low- income a reas or areas considere d a \"f ood desert.\" Food deserts are found in both urban and rural areas.6, 7, 8 P hysical Health: oGardening is considered moderate -to-heavy physical activity, whic h c ontributes to overall health and fitness. oGardeners are more lik ely to have increased consumption of the food they produce , which is predominantly fruits and vegetables; in addition, easy access to locally grown fruits and vegetables increases the potential fo r i ntroduc ing diversity into the diet.7 M ental Health: oCommunity gardens can increase feelings of empowerment and a sense of community ownership among community members.1, 2, 3 This is particularly important in communities where people do not own propertyor residents' lives may involve circumstances they cannot control , which can lead people to feel alienated and powerless. oMuch empirical evidence shows that activities such as gardening help sustain mental capacity and improve mental well -being.1, 2, 3, 9, 10 F or the Community: Improved Communities: oProperty values: Evidence shows that property values in areas where a garden is located increase d in value, as did property values of surrounding areas.5 oResidents' perception of community quality: Community gardens provide green spaces in communities where green sp ace is lacking ,1, 2, 3 making ne ighborhoods more aesthetically pleasing and improving residents' attitudes about the quality of their communities. oEnvironment: Added flora to an area can improve air quality, provide shade, and mediate the temperature of the area.1, 2, 3 7 IV.1.l Strengthened Communities: oSense of community: Community gardens can serve as \"public squares\" for the community,3, 4 providing natural meeting spaces for greate r s ocialization opportunities among residents . oSocial capital: Community gardens have the ability to increasecommunity engagement and cohesiveness, providing participatin g re sidents, who may otherwise not interact, with greater opportunities to get to know their neighbors.1, 2, 3, 11,12 This increase in social capital allows comm unity members to feel more comfortable in their own communities and to better address other issues in the community.13 References \u2014Benefits Section : 1 H.

Impediments or b arriers to development or implementation : Community gardens can be seen as temporary solutions to otherwise worthless land. Once property values improve and if the land is not owned by the community garden organization, the owner of the land may find other uses fo r the area.1, 2, 3 A s the value of the property where the garden is located and the property surrounding the garden increases, gentrification of the area can occur, affecti ng the affordability of housing for current residents. This is often seen in certain urban areas.2 S oil contamination from previous land use can make starting a communi ty garde n in a specific area difficult or impossible.2 M embers of the community are often afraid the garden will attract vandalism o r wo rsen current safety and security issues in the neighborhood.2 L ack of support from community leadership and lack of funding for the garde n c an prevent a community garden from thriving.2 A lthough a major purpose of community gardens is to encourage fellowship, some residents of the neighborhood may feel that the garden leads to exclusivity , as evidenced by fencing or rules limiting access to the garden.4 I n communities with low social capital, feelings of fear or mistrust within the community can keep people from participating in the community garden.5 Lac k of participation and maintenance of the garden by members can yiel d an e yesore instead of an aesthetically pleasing space. 9 IV.1.l Most community gardens require some sort of skilled participation and m anagement. Lack of either can prevent a garden from achieving it s maximal potential. References \u2014Impediments or Barriers Section : 1 H. Okvat and A.

Rousakis, Mayor, Savannah, GA 1st National Urban Forestry Conference, 1978 De scription: Among leaders in both the public and private sectors, there is growing recognition of the significant and very diverse benefits of urban forests, leading to an expanded understanding of the value and the role of the urban forest in creating liv able communities. Urban f orestry is the term used to describe the planning, care, and management of urban forests (community greenery) in order to create or add value to a community .1, 2 While many definitions for urban forest exist within the literature , the one we will use here, a combination of several prominent definitions, is \" the trees, shrubs, flowers, and other vegetation growing intentionally and unintentionally in the areas within and around the places people live and where human influences and settlements may be concentrated, such as cities , towns, villages , and hamlets .\" T his definition broadens the term urban forestry to encompass all vegetation in urban locations as well as in areas that might not traditionally be considered urban, such as suburban subdivisions, rural populated areas, and even rural land being considered for development.3, 4 H istory of Urban Forestry Urban forestry , in its most basic sense , has existed for thousands of years ,5, 6 as the intentional presence of trees existed even in the earliest of cities, including Rome and Babylon.7 Worldwide, the purpose of the urban forest takes on numerous forms \u2014including trees used to supply firewood in China; fruit-bearing trees to supplement urban diets in Africa; rooftop trees and bushes providing shade and social spots upon hotels in New York ; the Elm -lined streets of the American mid- west providing shade for pedestrians; trees and greenery as part of Sacramento's strategy to meet the Environmental Protection Agency 's clean air r equirements; Lady Bird Johnson's tree - and flower- planting \"Beautification\" campaign, which was motivated by her belief that beauty can improve the mental health of a society; the use of trees, bushes, and flowers as a component of community \"complete street\" designs to create buffer zones between motorists and pedestrians; the use of greenery to promote retail trade along downtown streets ; and others. F or all these reasons, urban forests are a significant element of a livable community \u2014providing neighborhoods with much more t han simply aesthetic value, and requiring management and care long after the day they are planted. 2 IV.1.m Urban Forestry in the United States : The geography of the United States has changed much in the past couple hundred years, as have its communities. Early settlers cut the virgin lumber to create settlements, and it was not until the late 1700's and early 1800's that residents of those settlements began to replant trees within their communities, with the earliest community forest establi shed in Newington, NH , in 1710 .8 Initially, the trees that Americans chose for their communities were species they had brought with them from their European origins: the Norway Maple, the English Elm, and the Lombardy Poplar; and their intentions were purely aesthetic. It was not until the mid- 1800's that planting indigenous trees, for both aesthetic reasons and practicality, became popular.8 Currently, about 80 percent of the US population has contact with the various elements of an urban forest on a daily basis ,9 though not as many cities have effective urban forestry programs (including planning, maintenance/care, and replacement) as have urban forests. U rban Forestry within Communities : More often than not, urban trees/greenery are intentional parts of a community, carefully planned and managed by both residents and local officials. T he job of urban forester in the United States falls upon many different types of individuals, from local municipal government offic ials to professional arborists, to informal groups of community residents. P roblematically, green spaces and urban forests are sometimes seen by public officials and policy -makers as amenities rather than necessities. The benefits of urban forests are often mistakenly valued as strictly aesthetic, and, frequently, the measurable health and economic outcomes of urban trees /greenery are not recognized when planning a communit y. However, the positive health, ecosystem, financial, social, and aesthetic benefits of urban forestry are widespread; and the fact remains that all members of a community \u2014young or old, poor or wealthy, with a disability or not, business or residential \u2014benefit from the presence of well - managed trees and other vegetation. See \"Benefits \" below for an extensive review of the benefits most often associated with urban forests. A lesson learned by many communities is that planning and the upk eep on maintenance is essential \u2014all trees and other greenery need care, and older plantings may need repair or replacement. Management possibilities now include computerized inventory programs that will organize and analyze data simply and effectively \u2014the most important lesson learned by urban forestry planners (anyone from local officials to N on-Governmental Organizations to professi onal arborists) has been to avoid collecting more data than is needed \u2014effectiveness of a management system becomes negligible when data is collected only to sit on a shelf. F our Principles of Urban Forestry :10 In planning, maintaining, and altering an urban forest, four basic principles of urban forestry can be very helpful to the urban forester, be it a community organization, municipality, individual land owner, or group of residents working together: 3 IV.1.m (i) All trees/greenery within the community environment are contributors to the ecosystem and should be managed as one unified resource. This includes trees and other greenery under both public and private ownership, bo th pl anned and unintentional growths. (ii) Trees and other greenery should be treated as a multi -purpose res ource wi th a rang e of potential goals , including enhancement of the community landscape , solutions for environment al issues , wildlife conservation, food sources, improvement of recreation experiences, and the production of timber. Trees and greenery should be managed to optimize these resources, thereby improving the quality of lif e within the community environment. (iii) A community- based approach to tree /greenery management is necessary ; thus, the owners of trees and other vegetation, both public and private, should be encouraged to contribute to the management of their local urban forest , taking part in both management and maintenance discussions and execution . (iv) Adequate planting to counteract tree losses and to enhance the total urb an f orest resource mu st be performed to maintain the forest in a healthy state.

Ben efits: For Residents \u2014 Psychological and Social Benefits : Studies show that those who experience green spaces and urban forests i n the ir environment on a regular basis have lower rates of stress and highe r rate s or productivity .11, 12 P atients with views of trees from their hospital beds recovered faste r and had f ewer post- surgical complications than did those without tree views ,11 thus reducing medical costs and burdens. Prisoners living in cells with views of trees and other green space were sho wn to utilize \"sick call \" less often than those without views , which ultimately saves money for the prison system and for taxpayers .13 V iewing urban trees and vegetation and playing among greenery have been shown to increase academic performance, decrease symptoms of Attentio n D eficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ), and increase skills and cognit ive abilities in schoolchildren.14, 15, 16 I n areas with trees and vegetation, lower levels of driving frustration, aggression, and domestic violence have been observed compared to areas without green space.17. 18 I n communities with trees and vegetation, residents tend to have a greate r s ense of well -being and higher reported levels of satisfaction and pride i n the ir neighborhood s.19, 20 P resence of t rees/greenery encourage healthier behaviors and activities : Trees and other greenery make areas more conducive to walking, bicycling, and socializing within the community by creating cooler, shady areas and bl ocking wind, and by promoting calmer driving by automobiles alo ng ro adways that may be shared with cyclists or pedestrians.17 M ore foot and cycling transport and time spent outdoors translates to reduced fossil fuel emissions, promotion of health y exercise , and increase d s ocial interactions among members of a community. F or Residents and the Community \u2014 The presence of trees and vegetation in community areas is correlated wi th l ower crime rates: Donovan and Prestemo n21 report that trees can reduce crime by signaling to would -be criminals that a house or neighborhood is well -cared for and thus subject to more effective authority and enforcement . The authors repo rt that t rees in the public right- of-way are associated with lower crime rates, 5 IV.1.m while the relationship between crime and trees/greenery on a residential lot is mixed \u2014with smaller, view -obstructing trees /greenery associated with increased crime on private lots, whereas larger trees are associated with reduced crime. A study by Kuo and Sullivan22 of 98 different apartment buildings fo und that t he more green space surrounding the building, the fewer property and v iolent crimes were reported. In addition, residents in these areas experienced less fear, vi olence, and aggressive behavior. U rban forests s ave money and conserve energy : Shading and wind- stopping by trees /greenery help modify extrem e te mperatures and winds in all seasons , thereby helping municipalities, individuals, and businesses save money by saving energy . Trees/greenery can curb urban heat- island effect (the phenomenon describing why urban areas have hotter ambient temperatures due to the predominance of concrete and metal material) by increased shade and humidity evaporation. A single mature tree can provide cooling energy that is equivalent to five average room air conditioning units running for 20 hours a day .23 M cPherson, et al.,23 report that the city of Chicago will save 5 -10 per cent in electric costs due to its expanded tree canopy. S ee \"Resources\" below to see h ow much your community could save . T rees/greenery increase air quality by releasing oxygen and removing ai r po llution : A single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 48 lbs./ye ar and r elease enough oxygen into the atmo sphere to support two human beings.24 T rees/greenery a bsorb or intercept airborne particulates on their branches, trunks, and leaves, thus removing these pollutants from the air. By encouraging walking and decreasing heating and cooling needs, trees/greenery reduce energy consumption and fossil fuel emissions \u2014leading to less pollution. The USDA Forest Service describes Sacramento 's strategic use of trees i n th at city's plan to meet the Federal Clean Air Act requirements (see \"R esources \" below ). F or the Co mmunity \u2014 Stormwater control and water decontamination: In communities of all sizes, t he roots of trees/greenery aid in the absorptio n o f water, thereby limiting street- flooding and polluted runoff into surroundi ng l akes and streams. Non -point source pollution from run- off over impervious materials, such as asphalt, leads to drinking water contamination and the buildup of harmful chemicals such as heavy metals and pesticides in seafood. By reducing runoff into storm drains and ultimately into groundwate r suppl ies, surface water, lakes, and streams, trees and other vegetation limit p ollution into these resources. 6 IV.1.m Stormwater drain- flooding pose s a risk of damage to infrastructure and is a publ ic health hazard. After heavy rains, there are high microbial lev els in standing and backed- up water, and pooling water lead s to increased insec t bre eding, thereby increasing the risk of vector-borne illnesses such as West Nile Virus. R eduction in Noise and L ight Pollution ; Increased Privacy : Trees and other greenery along streets make communities more comfortabl e and conducive to productivity and enjoyment for visitors and residents , by: oAbsorbing , refract ing, and dissipat ing the noise caused by the heavy traf fic characteristic of urban areas. oBlocking light from streets and surrounding buildings. oProviding privacy from the street or neighboring buildings. I ncreased Community Involvement : Com munity involvement is promoted , as planting, maintaining , and enjoying urban forests foster s social interactions and the formation of social capital. I ncreased Job Opportunities : Planting, maintenance, and repair of urban forests can produce jobs for both skilled and unskilled laborers \u2014both year-round pe rmanent positions and per diem employ ment. I ncreased Land and H ome Values: The presence of trees and other greenery has a positive impact on land and home values. For example, Donov an and B utry25 report that in East Portland, OR, street tree presence increased the sale price of homes by an average of $8,870 and reduced \" time on the market\" by ne arly two days; having a tree directly in front of a house increased its sal e pri ce by an average of $7,130 ; and, citywide in Portland, street trees add over $1B in property value, or about $47 million annually. I ncreased Revenue to the Local Economy : C onsumer Spending: Wolf's26 research showed that consumer purchasing in retail stores is positively correlated with the presence of urban trees and gre enery on retail streetscapes. Shoppers demonstrated greater patronage, time spent sho pping, and a willingness to pay, on average, 11 per cent more f or an item when trees /greenery were present. Wolf27 also fo und that tr ees/greenery on commercial streets were also correlated with a bette r patro n perception of a retail district. Revenue from Urban Forest Waste and Bi -Products: Wood removed for maintenance purposes can be used for firewood, woodchips, or othe r n ecessit ies. This material can either be sold for profit or donated to the community's members .

I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation: Comments by community members and local officials include: \"Tree limbs fall down; they cause damage to homes and telephone lines. It all costs so much money to fix that it 's not worth the trouble.\" Dangerous hazards and property damage may be created by mismanaged o r po orly maintained tree branches and limbs, especially after natural disasters or severe weather events. The maintenance required for urban forestry does indeed ha ve signific ant f inancial costs ; however , proper management, together with the various economic values derived from urban forests, does allow for a net profit to be made from urban forests. Proper planning and maintenance is essential to reap the economic and social benefits of urban forestry. Maintenance has become easier as computerized inventory management systems have been developed that allow one to se lect specific tree s/vegetation in an urban forest and detail their health, condition, and history. The program can specify the maintenance plan fo r v arying spending levels and predict the future financial impact of imprope r m aintenance. See \"Resources \" below for information on such so ftware. \"T ree roots can push up the pavement, ruining sidewalks and damaging roads.\" Damage done to paved surfaces , such as streets and sidewalks , by e xpanding roots leads to unpleasant aesthetics, safety liability issues , i nfrastructure damage, and accessibility problems. However, root barriers (both physical and chemical) can control the path of root growth and preve nt pav ement damage . See \" Resou rces\" below for information on root barriers. \" I've heard of cities where half of their trees were wiped ou t from one bug. We can't afford that risk.\"Monoculture planting (planting lots and lots of the same species of tree) has proven to be a problem in the past. When one tree species is susceptible t o an i nfection, pest, or climate condition, all trees in th at species are wiped o ut o r damaged, destroying the integrity and the benefits of the community's urban forest. This problem can, however, be avoided by planting a diverse urban forest and keeping track of affected trees and areas when an outbreak does occur. oDutch Elm Disease ( DED) is a fungus that has killed millions of Americ an E lms. Solutions have been found, including DED -resistant strains of Elm tree. See \"Resources \" below for more information. \"M ore trees and greenery will increase the presenc e of allergens, insects, and ot her pests in our communities.\" 9 IV.1.m It's true that trees provide more habitat for insects. However, trees als o pro vide habitat for birds and other animals that not only add to the diversity and aesthetics of an area, but also consume insects and create a bette r bal anced local ecosystem. Trees actually show a net removal of pollutant particulates from the air , whi ch helps reduce allergies . M ost communities and individual property owners continue to choose trees and greenery based on characteristics other than their allergy -producing traits, thereby creating a burden for allergy sufferers. However, a fter many years of work and research Thomas Leo Ogren, a gardener, author, and U SDA consultant, has identified which trees and other greenery do no t tri gger allergies. According to Ogren, \"It is quite possible now to produce fine gardens and landscapes that do not trigger any allergies, but by and l arge this isn't being done .\"28 \"H iring urban f oresters can be costly, and our community cannot afford it.\" While planning, planting, maintaining, and repairing trees and greenery involves an expense for the community, c osts can be reduced by: oHiring part- time employees with a private contractor to carry out urb an f orestry tasks. oCoordinat ing a cadre of volunteers \u2014community residents , high school and uni versity students, members of community service clubs, and others \u2014to carry out the various tasks. oSharing urban forestry employees, equipment, and inventory - maintenance software with nearby c ommunities.

Citizens and professionals alike are taking active steps to address significant concerns about the environmental quality of our homes, our public buildings and spaces, our oceans, our food, and our drinking water and air. The condition of these factors is directly related to a person's health and quality of life , and directly affects the state of a community's level of livability. T he following paragraphs are taken from a document published by the United States Department of Energy.1 People live the greater part of their lives in residential homes and other buildings. T hroughout history, buildings have changed to address social needs, and this change is often advanced by innovative technologies . An example is the adv ent of the skyscraper a century ago , which allowed builders to take advantage of the transformative new stee l-framing technology to overcome real -estate scarcity in crowded American cities by enabling extraordinary growth in a contained footprint. Today's building industry is entering another era of change, with a view toward minimizing a different kind of footprint\u2014the energy, carbon, and environmental footprint of commercial and residential buildings. This time, change is being driven by a need to optimize and conserve resources \u2014 clean air, potable water, land ... and energy . And, once again, transformative technologies are holding the key to meeting the challenges in these areas . A s designers, developers, and owners search for ways to minimize the operating costs and the environmental impacts of buildings, while also increasing their functionality and appeal to occupants, \"green building\" trends have become increasingly observable in the marketplace. Energy -efficiency, energy conservation, and energy alternatives to fossil fuels are critical elements of green building. Across the country, both innovations and social needs are key drivers in green- energy trends in the construction of home s, commercial buildings , and civic facilities . For example, s uch trend -drivers include: En ergy consumpt ion\u2014 Energy consumption in buildings has been growing in aggregate over time. Today, the nation's 114 million households and more than 4.7 million commercial buildings account for nearly 40 per cent of total energy use in the United States, consuming 2 IV.2.a more energy than the transportation or industry sectors . The total utility bill for energy used by buildings topped $369 billion in 2005. P opulation growth\u2014 Energy use is driven by population growth, and changes in population profiles. Growth in the numbe r of people drives the number of homes, schools, and other community buildings that are developed; increases in the number of older people drives the development of specialized senior housing and assisted living facilities. E conomic growth\u2014 Growth in Gross Domestic Project is a major factor in energy -use, driving the amount and size of new floor space in offices and retail buildings, in the size of new homes, service demands (lighting, space conditioning, electronics, process loads), and real energy price s. E nergy innovations in the building sector\u2014 Improvements in technologies and practices over the past three decades ( in lighting fixtures, windows, insulation, building controls, and appliances, as well as whole - building design and construction) have ma de it possible to significantly improve the efficiency with which energy service demands are met, deliver ing many building services with lower energy intensity. Se ction IV.2 of the Resource Manual is devoted to \"energy\" as an aspect of environmental health, green building, and a livable community. _ ______________ 1 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (October, 2008), Energy Efficiency Trends in Residential and Commercial Buildings .

To be classified as organic, a molecule must contain the element carbon in the form of a carbon-h ydrogen bond. As a greenhouse gas, carbon bonds with o xygen to form CO (carbon monoxide, ozone) and CO 2 (carbon dioxide, necessary for photosynthesis). During the day, carbon helps stop solar ultraviolet radiation from baking the surface of the Earth and at night helps reflect heat back so that we do not freeze. Carbon is also a critical part of the water cycle, which regulates the earth's temperature and weather. T he Earth's climate is constantly changing. Before humans inhabited the Earth, there were ice ages, hot ages, wet ages , and the age of the dinosaurs. We are now entering a period of increasing atmospheric temperature , the likes of which humankind has never seen. The debate over whether or not humans are causing these changes is not over. However, there is no debate that increased carbon levels in the atmosphere will result in increased atmospheric temperatures. This is commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect. I n the United States there has recently been an increased focus on becoming energy -efficient and decreasing carbon emissions into the atmosphere . The reasons for interest in energy efficiency include everything from national security to personal financial security. People are also concerned for future generations of humans. There is great concern that an increasingly warm climate will result in polar ice melting, deserts expanding, sea levels raising, infectious disease rates increasing , and many other depressing phenomena . While some might argue that humans are not causing the increasing temperature, no one argue s that energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction is a bad thing. \" Driving\" is t he most common factor p eople think of when considering ways to decreas e their carbon footprint, and it is true that motorized transport through driving and aviation is one of our largest contributions of c arbon into the atmosphere. However, in the U nited States, emissions from energy use in homes and buildings make a much larger contribution of carbon into the atmosphere than does transportation.1, 2 Many people forget that the electricity our homes use must be generated by an electric plant somewhere else ; in the United States , this electricity usually comes from burning oil, coal, natural gas, or some other fossil fuel. T he concept of a carbon neutral home or building is relatively new and the specifics of an agreed-upon definition is still in the works. However, some groups have taken the effort to standardize the definition: 2 IV.2.b Carbon Neutral - Operating Energy This basic definition for Carbon Neutral Design in homes and buildings is taken from www.architecture2030.org . Carbon neutral, with respect to operating e nergy, m eans using no fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases to operate the building (operation includes heating, cooling and lighting ). These targets may be accomplished by implementing innovative sustainable design strategies, generati ng e qual on-site renewable power, and/or purchasing (20 per cent maximum) renewable energy and/or certified- renewable energy credits. At the present time, it is estimated that o perating energy accounts for approximately 70 per cent of the c arbon emissions associated with a building. The other 30 per cent is describe d be low. Carbon Neutral - Operating Energy + Embodied Energy This definition for Carbon Neutrality builds upon the definition above and also adds the carbon that is a result of the initial and recurring embodied e nergy associate d wi th the materials used to construct a home or building. This value is far more difficult to calculate. As described by Canadian Architect,3 \"The initial embodied energy in homes and buildings represents the non -renewable energy consumed in the acquisition of raw materials, their processing, manufacturing, transportation to site, and construction. This initial embodied energy has two components: Direct energy \u2014 the energy used to transport building products to the site, and the energy used to construct the building. Indirect energy\u2014 the energy used to acquire, process, and manufacture the building materials, including any transportation related to these activities. \"T he recurring embodied energy in homes and buildings represents the non- renewable energy consumed to maintain, repair, restore, refurbish, or replace materials, components , or systems during the life of the building. \"A s buildings become more energy -efficient, the ratio of embodied ener gy to lifetime consumption increases. Clearly, for buildings claiming to be ' zero-energy ' or 'autonomous ,' the energy used in construction and final disposal takes on a new significance. \" W hile, c urrently , design and implementation of carbon neutral homes and buildings is still in its infancy , with only scattered demonstration projects occurring worldwide , active interest is growing. For example, (1) SpringLeaf Boulder, which is in the planning stage in Colorado, will consist of 12 home s that are designe d for LEED Platinum certification, will be fully powered by photovoltaic systems, and are very close to shops and restaurants \u2014creating a little eco -community within Boulder , CO; (2) the Central Dallas Community Development Corporation's winning design has been chosen by Urban Re:Vision\u2014Dallas to take a vacant inner- city block behind City Hall and transform it into a carbon- neutral, sustainable community that will run off the grid in Dallas TX; and (3) in 2010 in New York City, 3 IV.2.b Solar One expects to begin construction of Solar Two, an 8 ,000 sq. ft. Green Arts and Education Center that will be the City's first carbon- neutral, net- zero-energy building. As renewable power technologies, advanced construction techniques, HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) equipment, appliances and lighting, and consumer awareness all move towards increase d efficiency and effectiveness \u2014 and as more new projects come on -line\u2014the dream of carbon neutral homes will become a reality.

I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Among the public, c ommon misconceptions remain about renewable powe r and c arbon neutral homes \u2014many feel modern comforts must be sacrificed, thus decreasing market acceptance.4 IV.2.b Building construction techniques, renewable technologies, and workforc e i nfrastructure is still young, decreasing availability and affecting cost- effectiveness of completing homes. Up-front development/installation costs can be large. Service can be costly or difficult to obtain if the technology break s down. Not all utilities are set up to handle net metering, thus removing the option of selling energy back to the utility to offset times of drawing from the grid . Not all utilities offer clean energy source options . Homes must use electricity as a source of air heat and hot water, or else the y have to offset those energy draws with increased electricity generation. Offsetting the fossil fuel draws is typically difficult to achieve. Local municipalities may not allow the installation of tall towers for wind powe r or photovoltaic cells on building roofs.

The resulting program is named Power to Choose and is sometimes referred to as Energy Choice . A c onsumer 's utility bill typically consists of two major charges : (1) a supply charge , which is the cost of the electricity or natural gas that the customer uses , and (2) a distribution c harge, which is the cost to deliver electricity or natural gas to the customer's home or bus iness. I n the past, a single utility typically provided all supply and distribution to a designated region. Under Power to Choose a consumer can now choose his energy supplier\u2014sometimes called an Energy Services Company ( ESCO) \u2014and has the freedom to fin d the best deal. In addition, some suppliers offer consumers \"green power\" (electricity supplied in whole or in part from renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and various forms of biomass), which benefit s the environment through reduced use of fossil fuels. According to the U. S. Department of Energy, more than 50 per cent of retail customers in the United States now have the option of purchasing a green power product directly from their electricity supplier. R egardles s of which energy supplier is used, the distribution charge to the customer remains the same and re sponsibility for distribution remains with the geographic service area's traditional utility. By law, the traditional utility is required to provide distribution, emergency response, and other services in the same manner regardless of which supplier has been chosen . When an alternative supplier- choice is made, the alternative supplier's billing may be included as part of the consumer's utility bill from the traditional utility, or may be billed separately by the alternative supplier. C ustomers may or may not pay a reduced rate for their energy use when choosing an alternative energy supplier. An alternative supplier might consistently supply energy at a lower cost than the traditional supplier, or may offer sign- up discounts or reduced rates for a specified period of time, after which rates may rival or exceed the traditional supplier. If a customer chooses an alternative supplier and changes his mind at a later date, a return to the traditional utility is always an option. \\ 2 IV.2.c \"Green Energy\" is one aspect of a livable community , and the use of alternative sources of green energy by homeowners and businesses is increasing across the country in response to con cerns about health related to poor air- quality, depletion of the world's finite supply of fossil fuels, and environmental issues. Ben efits: For residents: Greater choice of energy suppliers: Potentially a reduced cost for energy usage, support ing affordability for bo th ho meowners and renters and promoting the ability of residents to remai n l iving in their communities and to age in place. Consistent service and delivery charges regardless of which supplier is chosen. Gre en power options provide heal th benefits through better air quality . F or the community: Green options benefit the community's overall well -being through improving ai r qual ity, reducing use of fossil fuels, and addressing a variety of environment issues. C ontributes to a community's livability status: Supports a stable resident base through the availability of consumer choice among optional suppliers. Supports a stable business base through the business -marketing aspects inherent in the publicized use of green energy. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Consumers are often unaware of the alternative options available in their energyservice areas and sometimes do not understand the process for maki ng a di fferent choice. C onsumers often are not sufficiently well -informed to make the mos t appro priate decision when choosing an alternative supplier. For example: Suppliers may offer new customers sign- up gifts, lower fuel prices fo r a l imited time, or other incentives , which may be confusing or not completely understood . Consumers may not fully understand the components of their current fuel bills and may not be able to make a meaningful comparison between thei r c urrent costs and an alternative supplier' s costs. Consumers may not know to ask about such items as the terms of the contract; whether the prices are fixed or changeable ; whether the supplie r wi ll bill you separately ; and whether there are other fees , such as security deposits, cancellation charges , or other fees. C onsumers may be pressured into a decisio n by aggressive marketing tactics before they have all the information needed.\\ 3 IV.2.c R esource \u2014example: 2009 Green Power Leadership Awards, an awards program co -sponsored by the U.

Across the country, this technology is also known as Cogeneration, but more recently has been rebranded Combined Heat and Power. The most common use of this tec hnology is the generation of electricity by means of an engine -driven generator while, at the same time, capturing and recycling the heated combustion exhaust, or thermal energy, to produce domestic hot water. T homas Edison's Pearl Station in 1882 is the first commercial recorded use of CHP in the United States. The waste heat produced from the generation of electricity was used to heat the neighboring buildings. With the rural electrification policies of the 1900's, central power plants and regional utilities became the norm. This structure discouraged decentralized power generation until 1978 when the Public Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) was established. This act promoted renewable technologies and allowed non-utilities to provide power. Today, with concerns about the environment, dependence on foreign fuels, and the escalating cost of energy, efficiency of the fuel being used has become more important than ever. A lthough we are beginning to see the deployment of micro -CHP in single family homes , most CHP systems currently available work best in larger facilities or multifamily buildings that have one hundred units or more. I n addition to the engine -driven generator, several variations of CHP technology include micro -turbines, steam turbines, and fuel cells. Natural gas is the most common fuel source; however, other fuels, such as digester gas, landfill gas , or even wood scrap from sawmills have been used when available and cost- effective. All CHP systems rely on the common principle of capturing two or more forms of energy in order to maximize fuel efficiency. O ther uses of CHP technology include recycling waste heat for industrial usage or manufacturing processes or to produce refrigeration by means of an absorption chiller. In the case of an absorption chiller, what was previously considered waste heat is now converted to refrigeration through an absorption process, often providing air conditioning for a large facility. CHP systems can also be configured to provide emergency power during power outages in order to allow occupants to remain where they are (shelter in place) during power outages. Sheltering in place in lieu of evacuation may be the preferred option, especially with frail older people or individuals of any age with disabilities. Dumping of thermal energy during emergency conditions in order to maximize electricity generated is considered an 2 IV.2.d acceptable practice, but it is not recommended during normal operation as it reduces fuel efficiency. T raditional fossil -fueled power plant generation often results in the loss or dumping of exhaust heat as a waste product. Thermal dumping, combined with transmission and distribution losses, can greatly reduce overall fuel efficiency to about one- third or less. As CHP systems avoid the se losses, they have a significant environmental benefit over utility -based centralized power generation and distribution. The combined increased fuel efficiency results in an overall decrease in harmful emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur oxides (S Ox), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). A CHP system is designed to generate energy in close proximity to where it will be used and is therefore not used for long- distance transmission and distribution. As such, CHP is part of a larger group of technologies known as Distributed Generation (DG). CHP is often the most economic DG technology. In order to successfully use this technology, a preliminary assessment or feasibility study can determine if the characteristics of the electrical load can be successfully matched with a corresponding thermal load. This matching of the electrical and thermal loads can demonstrate overall fuel efficiency and thus avoid the costly dumping of the excess thermal energy. T he addition of a CHP system adds to overall generating capacity and can have a significant impact on the utility grid or network by reducing peak demand on the grid. The utility grid system's peak demand usually occurs during the hottest part of the summer when the electric cooling load is running at the maxim um. In the past, this peak demand event has been responsible for brown- out or black -out conditions. Ben efits: For consumers, including older adults and younger people with disabilities \u2014 The higher fuel efficiency results in a lower operational cost of energy (kWh forelectricity and Btu's for thermal) , thereby lowering household expenses . I nvestment in CHP provides long -term stabilization of energy rates, maki ng e nergy rates more predictable and less subject to commodity marke t f luctuations. C HP units can be configured to operate independent of the local utility company, thus providing on- site power generation during emergency conditions and a llowing for sheltering in place. F or the community\u2014 There are environmental benefits of reduced CO2, NOx, and SOx by using the fuel's energy twice and reducing the total amount of fuel consumed. This becomes a more important benefit in areas of poor air quality. 3 IV.2.d On-site generation reduces the geographical strain or need for additional transmission and distributi on systems. F inancial incentives are often available. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Investment in CHP Technology is a long -term commitment, and the owner is responsible for all maintenance (check with the manufacturer for service agreements and warranties). T here may be a lack of fuel availability \u2014 is natural gas available or another fuel such as landfill gas? T here may not be adequate space available within a building for the equipme nt and exhaust flue. T he building's elec trical distribution system and metering needs to be configure d to support CHP. T he cost -effectiveness of the project needs to be determined. The cost comparison of electricity to natural gas is often referred to as the spark spread. CHP becomes more ec onomical the larger the cost differential betwee n e lectricity and natural gas becomes. R esource \u2014examples : According to the NYSERDA CHP Program Guide, \"As of mid -2008, NYSERDA programs support and fund over 110 projects for the installation of CHP at c ustomer sites, and over 150 feasibility studies for CHP technologies, as well as numerous product development projects and technology transfer studies.Collectively, these projects represent a NYSERDA funding contribution of ove r $ 85 million, and at full -build these systems will produce 153 MW of electricity. As of mid -2008, 54 projects are operational, producing over 30 MW of electricity.\" I nformation is available from NYSERDA about specific examples of CHP projects in New York State . For example: Fonda- Fultonville Central School District, where the entire K -12 school i s o perating independent of the utility grid, producing its own electricity and recycling the heat for hot water and cooling through the absorption process.Located on high ground along the Mohawk River, this self -contained school could also be used as a place of refuge during any community emergency. The Emerling Dairy Farm in Perry, NY , where the manure from 1 ,100 cows is processed by an anaerobic digester, thus reducing odor and producing the methane used to generate electricity and hot water from the farm 's CHP s ystem . 4 IV.2.d River Point Towers , a multifamily building in Bronx, NY, which uses a natural gas CHP system to produce electricity , with the waste heat recycled to produce domestic hot water, and with surplus energy used to heat the outdoor swimming pool.

Of particular interest is housing stock in the Northeast United States , due to the area's high dependence on space heating. T he Northeast is vulnerable to high space -heating needs due to colder- than- average winter seasons. In addition to this high need, many Northeast communities are rural in nature and do not have natural gas pipeline supplies as an energy source. By default, then, fuel oil becomes the energy source of choice, and fuel oil is the most vulnerable to price fluctuations because of its connection to the cost of a barrel of crude oil on the open market as well as i ts place in a global economy and political environment. Performing a \" deep retrofit\" and eliminating a heating system that relies on fuel oil can reduce a homeowner's vulnerability to price swings. Deep energy retrofitting will drastically improv e the energy performance of an existing home , providing multiple benefits and a significant, long -lasting solution to rising energy costs. The term \"deep \" energy retrofit refers to a practice that goes well beyond the current common practice of performing energy -efficiency work. This practice involves : Substantially improving the exterior building envelope with aggressive, emerging insulating practices ( e.g. installing polyurethane rigid panel insulation, or applying open-cell polyurethane spray foam insulation after build- out), Ins talling new, energy -efficient windows or relocating existing ones, Se aling the building's below -grade foundation to the wall connections , and Se aling the roof to the wall connections with insulation that also provides an ai r barr ier. T he following mechanical practices are then implemented to complete the overall retrofit: Incorporating whole -house ventilation , and2 IV.2.e Down-sizing the mechanical plant (HVAC, etc.) typically found in residential buildings. P erforming this retrofit comprehensively, with attention to detail, will typically reduce the whole- building energy load by 40 - 60 percent.

Ben efits: For consumers, including older adults and younger individuals with disabilities : A well-insulated building , with detailed air-sealing: Enhances residents' comfort -level and is effective in control ling the conditioned space (both heating and cooling operations ); that is, the home's shell will maintain a stable temperature within the home over a greate r pe riod of time. Reduces dependence on the home's mechanical systems (HVAC, fans, etc.) to provide heating and cooling , thereby saving household expenses . Maintains the embodied energy of the existing building . W hole-house ventilation provides a healthier living environment for residents by providing constant air -exchange, eliminating stale air, and providing bette r re spiratory activity . F or the community: Reduces the need for energy -generation; when such generation uses fossil fuels, less use of such fuels reduces carb on emissions, creating a cleaner, healthie r ou tdoor environment. D eep energy retrofitting builds local economies by utilizing labor and skill rathe r t han expensive technology . I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation : There is l imited understanding by the workforce of newer insulation methods and materials, or of the synergy between envelope improvements and reduced dependence on mechanical systems . D eep retrofit work and materials are perceived by homeowners to be cost - prohibitive, wi th a long time-period for a return on the initial investment perceived .3 IV.2.e Lending institutions often lack appraisers who have the knowledge or experienc e to value a deep retrofit improvement project, and there are too few financed deep retrofit projects av ailable that can serve as comparables for appraisers. P roviding these retrofitting services requires a significant investment in training and education, requiring a longer lead time to develop contractor- capacity than is required to develop contractor- capacity for equipment (widget) base d pro grams. W orkforce -capacity includes training the entire network : contractors performi ng the work, mechanical suppliers, building code officials/inspectors, stitutions , etc. T ypically, energy -efficiency sol utions that are offered do not even consider the elements of deep energy retrofi tting work in their strategies \u2014for example, th e burde n of mechanical over -sizing of new systems, or replacement windo w s alesmen that are energy raters , so every offered soluti involves a esource \u2014examples: Cador -Price -Jones project, Somerset, Massachusetts\u2014 a retrofit of a 4,066 sq. ft. 1914 two -family wood frame house, including o riginal windows, siding, and trim . T otal Annual Energy Use before the retrofit : 205,500 KBtu/yr (includes heat, ho t w ater, electricity) ; Project objective: with work performed, reduce this total by 65 - 70 per cent, or 61,600 KBtu/yr. Framing using 2x's laid flat is built to create an insulation/air barrier cavity . 5\" cavity is s prayed using closed cell foam improves R -value, air sealing, and structural integrity . 4 IV.2.e Application of rigid polyisocyanurate insulation to the e xterior of a residential building: 2\" Polyurethane rigid panel is applied to the exterior of the buil ding sheathing , overlapping the seams of previous layered application, providing a thermal barrier and eliminating \"bridging\" from the wood material to exterior. Window and door r ough openings are trimmed with 5/4 material for finish. Siding is reapplied, leading to drastically improved insulation (R-value) and reduced air infiltration .

Note the strapping detail for fasteners and drainage plane. Window and door openings are handled with 5/4 material installed for stiffening the structure and plane. 5 IV.2.e W hole house ventilation installed , in this case using a 300 CFM Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV ) Unit : Energy Recovery Ventilator installation includes unobstructed fresh air inlet (A) and return- air outlet (B), with dual core exchange for continuous wh ole house ventilation, moving 5 CFM constantly throughout the home. Individual timers in high moisture return areas ( e.g., bathrooms , kitchens ) allows for system to be switched into high speed (30 CFM) to clear the area. This strategy e liminates the need for individual bath fans and exhaust hoods by including these returns into the ERV system. Providing continuous exchange of fresh air into the \"tightened\" building is mandatory in terms of building and occupant health.

Carver, Senior Project Manager New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Albany, NY EN ERGY MODELING \u2014for energy efficiency An energy model is a mathematical representation of a building in a specialized computer program. The representation is composed of thousands of equations created by the program from the inputted design specifications for the building \u2014such as location, size, orientation, materials, equipment, operating schedules, and use. With this information, the program ca n calculate an estimation of the building's energy usage when constructed. D escription: In many respects, designing an energy -efficient building appears to only involve choosing better materials and equipment. For example, t o achieve better energy efficiency, a building needs 12 inches of insulation in the roof instead of 10 inches, south and west facing windows with low shading coefficients, and a condensing furnace with a variable speed blower. Such design choices will improve the energy efficiency of most buildings. W hat is not obvious , though, is how these design choices were made \u2014 why was 12 inches of roof insulation selected and not 16 inches ; why were windows with low shading coefficients chosen on both the south and west sides of the building? These decisions, and many more, were made using a design tool called an energy model. E nergy modeling programs have been available for more than 25 years. The early program tools were very difficult to use and , as a result, very few buildings were designed using energy modeling . Typically, those early tools required six months or more of training before a user could effectively model a building. Models were also very time -consuming to create because the building's design specifications needed to be ente red in a command -line computer- programming environment (e.g., not a Microsoft Windows user-friendly environment with pull-down menu items ). At that time, an energy model for an average building could take two weeks or longer to create. Today, an experienced building design engineer or architect can learn how to use many energy modeling programs in less than a week and can produce high quality energy models in a few days. Most of today's programs can be run on a laptop computer, further increasing the ease of their use. T here are many energy modeling programs available. Some of the more well- known programs are DOE 2. 1, EnergyPlus, eQuest, Energy10, and TREAT. Many of the available programs have unique features that may make each of them more suitable to a specific project. For example, EnergyPlus and Energy10 allow some renewable ener gy systems to be included in a design. EnergyPlus has the ability to include indoor air quality analyses in a project. TREAT, eQuest, and Energy10 have \\ 2 IV.2.f graphical user- interfaces that are easier to use. TREAT and Energy10 are well - suited for use on residential building projects. Li ke many other products, modern buildings are very complex systems to design and construct. For many products, the design teams usually get to try several full - sized prototypes before the final design is selected and commercialized. However, buildings differ from many other complex products in this one important respect. The nature of building construction rarely lends itself to trying several full -sized prototypes before selecting the design to use. For this reason, every re asonable effort is made , before a building is constructed, to determine if it will operate properly . Usually there are no second chances for a building's design; once the building is constructed, any design flaw can be very costly to address . T his reality is equally true for a building's energy systems. If the installed energy systems do not operate together as intended, the cost to repair any design flaw can be large. Energy modeling is the most powerful tool a design team can use to ensure a building' s specified energy system will operate as intended and deliver the performance expected by the owner. The resulting energy savings from improved design decisions and the potential avoid ance of costs from design flaws can easily offset the small added expe nse of the energy modeling process . With the recent advances in energy modeling programs and computers, it is very easy to justify the use of some type of energy model during the design of any building that will have significant energy usage . Ben efits: Energy models can estimate the energy usage of a building before it is constructed, based on its design specifications; t his information can be useful to a building owner for planning the building's operating expenses . An energy model can evaluate and comp are the energy impacts of man y di fferent design decisions. For example, the orientation of a building can be easily rotated in an energy model to determine how solar energy increases o r de creases the building's overall energy consumption for different position s on the project site. An e nergy model can optimize the interactive factors in a building's design. Fo r e xample, if better wall insulation and windows are being considered, the energy model's results can be used by the design team to determine if a smallerheating system can be specified. The design team can then determine if the dollar savings from the smaller heating system will offset a significant portion of the increased expense of the better insulation and windows . The design team can determi ne the specific combination of insulation, windows, and heating system that minimizes the building's life-cycle cost (e.g. , construction costs plu s o perating expenses during its life) . Us ing an energy model can be beneficial for a project attempting to achieve a LE ED certification from the U. S. Green Building Council \u2014using an energy model is one option for showing compliance with EA 1 Credit: Optimize Energy\\ 3 IV.2.f Performance. It should also be noted the energy -model -compliance approach is the only option th at allows design teams to potentially earn the maximum points allowed for this credit (10 points vs 1 or 4 points for other compliance approaches ) on a high -performing building . I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation: Energy modeling will modestly increase the design cost of a project. This cos t i ncrease varies from project to project, based on the building's size, envelope design, and HVAC system design. However, for average buildings with construction costs in the range of $150 to $200 per square foot, a very ro ugh e nergy -modeling -cost estimate would be less than $0.50 per square foot. The accuracy of the energy model is dependent on the quality of the desig n in formation/specifications inputted into the modeling computer program . If crude design information is used, the energy model's results will be less likely to represent the final performance of the constructed building. \"Garbage -In, Garbage -O ut\" or \"GIGO\" is a computer-modeling rule that succinctly explains the importance of having accurate design information to input into the energymodel. It i s unlikely the energy model will exactly predict the building's actual energy usage , as the energy model's results are based on typical weather data fo r a lo cation ; and typical weather conditions are rarely encountered by real buildings. Energy models also assume that building occupants behave in well - defined ways, such as always setting the thermostat to the modele d te mperature, arriving and departing at the same times every day, and us ing equipment with expected patterns. Real occupants rarely behave as assumed i n en ergy models. Even an experienced energy modeler , using an advance d pro gram, can be off by as much as 10 per cent in their prediction because of these weather and occupant assumptions.

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the F ederal ENERGY STAR\u00ae program in 1992 in order to promote energy -efficient products and practices. DOE and EPA have partnered with over 15,000 private - and public -sector associations to develop the best, most energy -efficient management practices and implementation strategies in order to save both energy and money. By increasing energy -efficiency , the program reduces energy -usage and the greenhouse gas emissions that result when obtained from non -renewable sources. In the United States, with the help of ENERGY STAR,\u00ae Americans saved enough energy in 2008 alone to avoid greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 29 million cars , while saving $19 billion on their utility bills.1 T his program sets forth strict energy -efficiency and quality standards on products for both the residential and commercial sectors \u2014producing a rating system by which consumers can compare products and, thus, make educated decisions based on their effi cacy. The program offers consumers a dependable label of energy - efficiency and p erformance on over sixty product categories, with thousands of models , as well as home and building assessment tools . The goal of the ENERGY STAR\u00ae program is to offer consumers energy -efficient choices and savings on greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing features, style, or comfort, as well as provide consumers with the technical tools and management guidance to best utilize the qualified technologies. I n the residential sector, ENERGY STAR\u00ae ratings are given for household products, new home const ruction, and existing home retrofitting. I mplementation of these rating qualifications can save the average family as much as one -third of their annual energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions .1 In the business sector, a multi- faceted approach to implem enting an energy management strategy is used, including measuring energy performance, setting business goals, tracking savings, and rewarding improvements. Thus far, through the ENERGY STAR\u00ae public/private partnerships, over 96 ,000 buildings in businesses through out the United States have benefited from energy -efficiency applications.1 R eference: 1 U.

Ben efits: For older adults , individuals with disabilities , families, and c hildren: 2 IV.2.g Reduced home expenses: ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified improvements reduce energy -usage without sacrificing convenience in the livi ng environment, making homeownership and rentals more affordable for families. In addition, i ncrease d af fordability : Is a critical factor in supporting the ability older people and people wi th di sabilities to successful ly age-in-place in their own homes and apartments . Supports the efforts of New York State's substantial number of caregivers of older adults and younger- aged individuals with disabilities by reducing the financial aid many family members contribute for those they provide care for. H ealthier living environment: Reduced energy -usage reduces emissions of greenhouse gases \u2014creating healthier living environments for all residents. Children have the added benefit of inheriting a cleaner, more sustainable environment in the future. F or the com munity: ENERGY STAR\u00ae program qualifications exist for every aspect of living and for all walks of life \u2014from residential homes , to public, industrial , and commercial applications . Public and commercial budgets: The reduced energy bills resulting from implementation of ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualifications in public and commercial buildings save s the community money and helps support the business environment. Livable communities : Reduced greenhouse gas emissions results in a less - polluted, healthier ecosystem in which to live \u2014which is an impo rtant c omponent of a livable community . Geographic area: The benefits of ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualifications are applicable to rural, suburban, and urban dwellers and geographic areas . I mpediments or barriers to development or impleme ntation: Consumer cost: In general, the testing, research, and quality -assurance procedures associated with obtaining ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualification result in a cost increase when compared to products, practices, and applications that areproduced with no ene rgy-efficiency -use or quality standards. However, a s the use of ENERGY STAR \u00ae has continued to increase, the price differential betwee n EN ERGY STAR\u00ae and non- ENERGY STAR\u00ae products continue s to diminish . Nevertheless, currently, this c ost differential for s ome products is signific ant e nough for some c onsumers to opt to purchase a less expensive, more inefficient product \u2014this is often true for those who could benefit most from products that use less energy and reduce annual energy bills , including : Lower-income households, typically in rural and urban settings; Smaller/independently owned retailers and manufacturers , who struggle wi th the higher initial purchase price and adoption of such technology, eve n tho ugh it will save them money in the long run. 3 IV.2.g Resource \u2014examples: \"Success stories,\" ENERGY STAR for Affordable Housing: More Energy Efficient, Livable, Sustainable Communities , U.

Fuel cell systems offer the potential for clean, reliable energy by generating electricity from a chemical reaction rather than from combustion (burning a fuel). I n a fuel cell, h ydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity and water. Hydrogen (fuel) is fed into the anode of the fuel cel l, and o xygen (from air) is fed into the cathode side. Encouraged by a catalyst, electrons are stripped from the hydrogen atom ; freed of the electrons, the protons pass through the electrolyte, while the electrons are forced to take a different path to the cathode. As the electrons travel their separate path, they create an electric current that can be utilized. At the cathode, another catalyst rejoins the hydrogen atom, which then combines with the oxygen to create a molecule of water. P roducing electrical power for a working application requires more than just the fuel cell stack. A fuel cell system may include fuel processing, thermal management, power conditioning, electric gr id connection , and energy storage modules ; the 2 IV.2.h power conditioning system provides regulated DC or AC power appropriate for the application. Successful integration of an entire fuel cell system is critical to achieving optimal performance. While h ydrogen is the primary fuel source for fuel cells, the process of fuel -reforming allows for the extraction of hydrogen from many widely available fuels , such as natural gas and propane , or any other hydrogen- containing fuel. Fu el cell systems offer commercially v iable alternatives to existing power sources because they have higher efficiency compared with conventional power generation, emit little or no pollution, and have greater flexibility in installation and operation. These systems are appropriate for all geographic areas of the State and can be deployed to operate in para llel with the electric grid ( as independent energy sources ) or to complement solar and wind generating systems. The space needed to house a fuel cell is equivalent to an ordinary refrigerator. A system for a single family residence could be located in the basement or backyard. F uel-cell-based MicroCHP (combined heat and power) \u2014 As the cost of energy increases and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions becomes more urgent, the need f or clean, high- efficiency distributed generation solutions becomes increasingly important. C HP systems, at all capacities\u2014 industrial, commercial, and residential\u2014remain a top choice for solving America's energy constraints. A recent study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory concludes that \"the energy efficiency benefits of CHP offer significant , realistic solutions to near - and long -term energy issues facing the Nation.\" Co-generation (heat and electricity) solutions make the most sense in regions where the cogenerated heat can be put to good use (for example, in the colder climates like New York and throughout the northeast) . F uel-cell-based CHP systems represent a solution for residential or light commercial, grid -connected, stationary power requirements. In addition, they also offer energy efficiency and environmental benefits, as well as an economic/cost advantage to the end user. T he use of fuel cell systems for a variety of applications is increasing across the world. F or example, i n Japan, Toyota has built fuel cell hybrid buses; drivers in Southern California are testing Honda's Fuel Cell Electric cars; Germany created the world's first fuel cell boat and uses fuel -cell systems in submarines; a Chinese company will use PEM fuel cells to power their electric bicycles for China's extensive, growing e -bike market; Manhattan's new Twin Towers are expected to be partially powered by 12 hydrogen fuel cells ; and, according to the U. S. Department of Energy, in the United States there are major fuel cell programs in New York (NYSERDA), Connecticut (Connecticut Clean Energy Fund), Ohio (Ohio Development Department), and California (California Energy Commission). While f uel cell technology in private homes and multiunit housing has not yet reached the le vel of use in large buildings, commercial spaces , and other applications , residential use is increasing. Japan is in the forefront, with 2,200 3 IV.2.h homes get ting their heat and electricity through fuel -cell generation. In the United States, interest in residential usage is now increasing. For example, in 2002, the York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) partnered with the National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation in Western New York to install fuel cell systems in two residential homes ; in 2007, the Governor's mansion in Florida became powered through a hydrogen fuel cell system ; in 2009 NYSERDA partnered with Plug Power, Inc.,1 to install fuel cell systems in three New York State homes. Several manufacturers across the country are cur rently working on installing residential fuel cells , including ClearEdge Power in California and Oregon, McCutcheon Construction in California, and Plug Power, Inc., in Albany, N ew York. While cost continues to be an issue in the implementation of fuel ce ll systems, the U. S. Department of Energy has been working steadily to bring down the cost to be competitive with other forms of energy -generation.

F or communities: Transitioning to a hydrogen- based economy can deliver three main benefits: Energy Security : Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of fuel sources, including renewables, which can help diversify our energy supplies and lesse n o ur dependence on foreign oil. Economic Growth: Hydrogen can contribute to economic growth through jo b c reation in a developing industry and investment opportunities. Environmental Health : Hydrogen can be produced and used in ways that i mprove health- related air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.4 IV.2.h H ydrogen is the lightest of all elements . This causes it to be buoyant and to rapidly disperse when released in air, so a leak is quickly diluted and harmless. H ydrogen is colorless, odorless , and has no taste. It is non -toxic and non- poisonous, and there are no significant environmental hazards associated with accidental discharge. A hydrogen fire radiates very little heat compared to a petroleum fire. For a f lammable mixture to exist, a four times higher concentration of hydrogen is required than that of gasoline (four per cent versus one per cent ). An electrostatic spark from the human body is just as likely to ignite gasoline as hydrogen at these minimum concentrations. H ydrogen has been mass -produced for more than 50 years. Eight million tons are produced annually in the U.S. alone. Impediments or b arriers to development or implementation : Fuel cells have the potential to be a very clean source of energy if the hydrogen- generation process uses renewable fuel sources; however , current government- funded research requires the use of fossil fuels to produce the vast majority of hydrogen for fuel cells. Without a trend towards increased use of renewables fo r hy drogen production, this technology's environmental benefits will continue to be somewhat offset by its reliance on fossil fuels. T here are also concerns that, in a large -scale hydrogen economy wher e hy drogen is used to power fuel cells and related technologies in a variety of applications, manufacturing, storing, and transporting hydrogen would result inleaks that could accumulate in the upper atmosphere, potentially depleting pol ar oz one layers. Infrastructure designs that carefully eliminate the potential fo r le aks can minimize this risk.

Pl ug Power (July 7, 2009), \" Plug Power Receives Award to Operate Residential GenSys Fuel Cells in New York State . Plug Power, Inc., has received a $1.4 million award from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to install and operate three combined heat and power (CHP) GenSys fuel cell systems in New York State homes. These systems will allow Plug Power to validate and enhance product features in preparation for broad scale product commercialization. The first s ystem is scheduled to be installed in mid -2009, with all three units expected to be operational by the end of 2009. A residential GenSys unit will be installed in the basement of each home and will operate in conjunction with the electric grid, running on natural gas. The fuel cell will produce electricity and high- quality heat to satisfy the home's heating and domestic hot water demands. Plug Power estimates that the GenSys unit is expected to achieve an overall combined efficiency of 85 per cent (cur rently, homes utilizing grid electricity and typical heating systems average 44 per cent household efficiency), and is expected to save the homeowner s approximately 30 per cent on their monthly utility bill s. Re sidential GenSys is a grid-parallel system , with two sources of power available \u2014 the grid and GenSys. During normal operation, GenSys is designed to satisfy all the cooling, heating, and hot water requirements of a typical home. As the home calls for cooling/heat or hot water, GenSys produces electricity; the more cooling/heat you need, the more electricity that is produced. Homes with large space conditioning or hot water demands may produce excess electricity, which can be sold back to the grid. Conversely, during periods of peak usage, homes w ith very high electrical demands may also consume some electricity from the grid. GenSys delivers between $1.60 and $1.80 worth of energy (heating, cooling, and electricity ) for each $1 of natural gas processed. The economic benefit varies with specific energy demand s and regional energy prices, but typically results in a 20 -40 per cent reduction in monthly energy bills. R esource \u2014written and web: U.

Bl oom Energy1 (originally called Ion America) is a privately owned company founded in 2001 and based in Sunnyvale, CA. The p rincipal Co -Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Bloom E nergy, K . R. Sridhar, and his team worked on NASA's Mars space program at the University of Arizona in the 1990s and built a device capable of producing air and fuel from elec tricity and , reversibly, producing electricity from air and fuel. In 2001, after the NASA project was over, the team continue d its research, which led to the formation of an innovative device\u2014Bloom's Energy Server \u2014that serves as a clean, reliable , and affordable energy source. T he initial servers were made with the capacity to generate 5kW of electricity and were tested at a field trial site at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga. Several other units were then tested in California and Alaska to validate the technology. The commercial (100kW) servers were shipped to the company's first customer, Google, in July , 2008. A s this alternative is still in its early development stage, Bloom Energy manufactures the c ommercial servers manually . The other early customers include FedEx, Coca- Cola, Staple s, and Wal -Mart. Mass -manufacturing of small household units of the Bloom Energy Server is expected in the future , and it is expected that this will be an affordable option for energy production in domestic settings (private homes). Technology and architecture of the Bloom Energy Server : Energy server: An energy server is an electricity generator that has the capacity to store the generated power. Bloom Energy uses its patented solid oxide regenerative fuel cell technology for its Energy Server . Each server consists of thousands of Bloom's solid oxide regenerative fuel cells . Fuel cells: Fuel cells are devices that convert fuel into electricity through a clean electro -chemical process without any combustion. This conversion technique gives much higher conversion efficiencies than conventional thermo -mechanical methods. The operating principles of fuel cells are similar to those of batteries ; i.e., includes an electro -chemical combination of re actants to generate electricity \u2014a combination of a gaseous fuel (hydrogen) and an oxidant gas (oxygen from the air) through electrod es and via an ion- conducting electrolyte. However, unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging. A fuel cell operates as long as both fuel and oxidant are supplied to the electrodes , and the influence it exerts on the 2 IV.2.h.1 surrounding environment is negligible (see Resources section for links to more information on fuel cells) . Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),2,3: A SOFC is a type of fuel cell valued for its potential market competitiveness , with high efficiency in fuel input and electr icity output. A SOFC is like a rechargeable battery that always runs. It consists of three parts: an electrolyte, an anode , and a cathode. In Bloom's SOFC, the electrolyte is a solid ceramic square made from a common sand- like \"powder.\" According to Bl oom's patent description, these thin white ceramic plates are Scandia stabilized Zirconia (ScSZ). The anode and cathode are made from special inks that coat the electrolyte on each side. One side of the ceramic electrolyte plate is coated with a green nic kel oxide -based ink that works as an anode ; the other side , which works as a cathode , is coated with black ink ( most probably Lanthanum Strontium Manganite \u2014a non- radioactive substance). The Bloom s erver does not require chemical s, such as the corrosive aci ds used in conventional fuel cells. Instead, i t uses inexpensive metal alloy plates for electric conductance between the two ceramic fast-ion conductor plates , as opposed to the use of costly precious metals like Gold or Platinum that are used for high conduc tance in other fuel cells . The electro -chemical process within SOFC (http://www.bloomenergy.com/products/solid- oxide -fuel-cell-animation/ ): SOFC requires a high operating temperature (600-10000C) for its reactions to take place. At a high temperature, warm air enters the cathode side of the fuel cell. The resulting s team mixes with the fuel to produce reformed fuel ; this reformed fuel enters the anode side , and a chem ical reaction takes place. As the reformed fuel crosses the anode side, it attracts oxygen ions from the cathode. Oxygen ions combine with the reformed fuel to produce electricity, water, and a small amount of carbon dioxide gas. Water is recycled into the cell to produce steam to generate reformed fuel , and t his process also generates the heat required for the functioning of fuel cells. The continuous supply of fuel, air , and heat constantly generates the electricity from the cell . Each Bloom Energy f uel cell is capable of producing about 25W of energy , which is enough to power a light bulb. For more power, multiple cells are mounted together, along with metal interc onnect plates , to form a fuel cell stack. A few stacks together ( about the size of a loaf of bread) are enough to power an average U.S. home. In an Energy Server , multiple stacks are aggregated into a \"power module\" ; and multiple power modules, along with a common fuel input and electrical output , are assembled as a complete system. When more power is required\u2014for example, for commercial or industrial sites \u2014multiple Energy Server systems can be deployed side by side. The current Energy Server in the market has the capacity to generate 100kW of electricity , which would power a 30,000 s q. ft. office building or 100 average -sized U.S. homes. 3 IV.2.h.1 Bloom Energy Server Unit Design4 Cost of Bloom Energy Server : The current 100 kW Bloom Energy Server costs a pproximately $700,000 - $800,000. The high cost is the result of the factors associated with manual production, and t hese production costs are expected to come down once mass - manufacturing starts and widespread commercial and domestic use become s routine practice. Bloom Energy estimates the size of a home -sized server as 1 kilowatt, and it is expected to cost under $3000. End-use is more cost -effective compared to other sources of generated electricity. Bloom's servers produce significantly more electricity for the same fuel costs of conventional energy sources , and the Bloom server's ability to generate the electricity on- site eliminates the need for costly transmission and distribution infrastructure. Thus, savings typically provide a three -to-five-year payback on a user's initial capital investment. While individual commercial or industrial sites or individual homeowners can purchase their own servers to generate electricity on site and, thereby , put control directly into the c onsumer 's hands, Bloom Energy suggests an alternative means of achieving the cost -savings of the Bloom Energy Server \u2014 selling the electricity produced by the server (named Bloom Electrons ) rather than selling the server itself. Both small energy suppliers and big energy industries can invest in a Bloom server and make their generated electricity availab le to individual consumers . This shifts the cost of infrastructure management from individual consumers to the suppliers. Industry comparisons: The Bloom Energy Server is a relatively recent entry into the field of \"green and affordable energy\"; i t is not yet available for home use, and mass -production has not yet been achieved for commercial use. Thus, comparison claims with other green energy alternatives (such as wind, solar, and other types of fuel cells) are difficult to substantiate . In additio n, continued progress in research and 4 IV.2.h.1 development continues to improve technology and output and to reduce costs for a variety of green energy alternatives, including the Bloom Box . When comparing this innovative model with other modes of green energy , professionals note that insufficient \"use-time\" has elapsed for evaluations of the Bloom server equipment's long-term durability and reliability, the model's aggregated carbon dioxide emissions once mass- production is achieved, its comparative electricity -generation conversion efficiency, and its potential to surpass other models' production and operation costs .

S. space programs. Following Bloom's development of the energy server system at theUniversity of Arizona for NASA's Mars Space Mission, Bloom has brought SOFC technology into commercial and industry use, and development for domestic use as a portable energy source is expected in the future. Urban, suburban, and rural use: The Bloom server's modular architecture, solid s tate construction, portability, and easy -to-install units allow for flexible assembly and make the systems suitable for any geographic area. F or the overall community and the environment: A green energy alternative: With the Bloom Energy system, Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emissions are reduced by 40% -100% compared to the U.S. grid (depending on their fuel choice), leading to a reduction in the nation's carbon footprint in affordable ways. There is virtual elimination of all harmful gases (SOx, NOx, etc.) and othe r h armful smog -forming particulate emissions. Bloom Energy systems emit pure CO 2, which allows for easy and cost- effective carbon sequestration (separating the CO 2 from the other effluents). The system does not use any harmful chemicals, such a s acids or alkalis, which are used in other fuel cells. Bloom's servers produce no noise pollution, which can be present in otherenergy production facilities.5 IV.2.h.1 Local decision -making: Multiple local production and distribution options: Individual companies or homeowners can choose to individually own a server to generate their o wn e lectricity, or a municipality or generation facility can own a server system to generate and distribute electricity (Bloom Electrons ) to multiple business and homeowner customers. The Bloom Energy system puts energy -generation control into the customers' hands, allowing them to manage their energy sources more effectively. Financial incentives, subsidies, and tax credits may be available to green energyusers, depending upon a state's energy policies and available federal programs. F or commercial, industrial, and domestic consumers: Production and distribution efficiency:Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are the most efficient in fuel input andelectricity output due to their high operating temperature (800 0C). SOFC technology in Bloom's servers is about twice as efficient in energy productioncompared to standard power sources. On-site power generation and storage allows for an efficient power supply, eliminating the costs, complexities, interdependencies, and inefficiencies associated with conventional transmission and distribution systems, and also reducing the geographic al strain. Lower cost : B loom's servers do not use expensiv e noble metals like Platinum or Gold, thus reducing production constraints and costs. Reverse backup and high return on investments: For businesses using Bloom's servers, the system works as the primary source of their energy supply, with other conventi onal sources, such as grid power, acting as a bac kup to supplement energy output when necessary. This increases asse t uti lization, gives a high return on investment, and reduces the cost of purchasing and maintaining expensive generators and other backupapplications. The servers produce significantly more electricity for the same fuel costs compared to conventional sources, due to the efficient conversion of fuel t o e lectricity. The servers can operate with multiple fuel options, such as renewable fuels (e.g., biogas) or fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas). Depending on the availability of the local fuel source, customers can choose the cheapest fuel to maintain the system's economy. Reliability and durability: Since Bloom systems are capable of running on a wide range of pipelines and l ocally stored fuels and can automatically detect an interruption, they can c ut o ver from a primary to a backup fuel source and maintain a continuous power supply.6 IV.2.h.1 The system generates perfect waveform (voltage or electrical flow) at the point of consumption, eliminating volatility and allowing perfect power quality without variations in voltage, intermittent brown- outs, or black -outs. Lo ng term use: SOFCs have a potential life expectancy of 40,000 -80,000 hours. Bloom's en ergy systems work 24*7*365, for a continuous productio n and s upply of energy. Independence from natural resources: SOFC technology and Bloom Energy Servers do not depend on natural resources (such as wind, sunlight, or the force of water currents) for the production of electricity, which allows quick access to the power supply with uninterrupted service. The heat produced within the server's electro -chemical process is recycled within the cell and external loss of heat is minimized by the strong protectiveshield. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Criticism and skepticism ha ve been expressed by members of conventional energy industries that are using standard practices . The current manual production of Bloom server systems requires signific ant s tart-up time. Currently, the server systems are marketed only for commercial use, with massproduction for domestic units expected as a future market. The present high cost of equipment (because of manual production) is currentlyaffordable to big industries only. Economic and other technical analyses are needed to establish marke t s tandards. Evaluation of the aggregate level of CO 2 emissions will be needed when mass - energy production for wider use takes place. Technical challenges: Requires very high operating temperature. Highly sensitive to operating temperature variation. High temperature demands significant thermal shielding to protect personnel and to retain heat.

A g eothermal heat pump system differs from a system that directly provides heat by piping water from underground geothermal hot springs directly into buildings and homes. Such systems are comm on in countries such as Iceland and Turkey. In contrast, geothermal heat pumps use water which is heated or cooled by the earth, in conjunction with the action of heat pumps inside the building or home, to deliver heating or cooling. According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, \"Throughout New York State, the temperature below the surface of the earth remains in the low 50\u00b0F range throughout the year. This stable temperature provides a source for heat in the winter and a means to reject excess heat in the summer. Geothermal heat pumps transfer heat between the constant temperature of the earth and a building, maintaining the temperature conditions in the building's interior space . Water is circulated between the building and the \"ground- loop\" piping buried in the ground. In the winter, the water picks up heat from the ground and moves it to the building (heating the building) . In the summer, it works in reverse \u2014the water picks up heat from the building (cooling the buil ding) and delivers this heat to the geothermal water. Heat pumps make the collection and transfer of this heat to and from the building possible. \" 1 T he underground, stable -temperature geothermal water can be a natural source of ground water (an open -loop system) , or it can be water that is circulated through a set of pipes in the ground ( an approach referred to as a closed -loop system ). The current trend is toward using closed -loop systems, to avoid water quality problems that are associated with open l oop systems. W ithin a building, heat pumps most commonly deliver heating and cooling through forced air systems (fans and ductwork). A less common option is to use a heat pump to deliver heating only, by supplying hot water to heat the space . A flexib le feature of a geothermal heat pump system is that portions of a building can be heated while other portions are cooled. For example, on a spring day, a room with a large window and full sun exposure might need cooling, while a north- facing room needs he ating. As long as the building has been zoned with multiple heat pumps, one heat pump can cool a room, and a separate heat pump can heat another room. B ecause of their positive impact on the environment and their affordable and efficient delivery of heat and coolth, the use of heat pump systems is increasing 2 IV.2.i across the country for use in residential homes and public and commercial buildings. \"In New York State, installations have ranged from single family homes , to hotels , to 500,000 -square -foot offic e buildings. \"2 In addition, they are a particularly high- efficiency heating option for rural areas, which often do not have access to natural gas. The se systems' capability of heating and cooling different parts of a home or building simultaneously make their use particularly attractive for buildings with fluctuating usage schedules (such as schools, hotels, or offices) or widely varying heating and cooling requirements within individual zones (such as senior housing apartments , single -family homes, or museums), which are difficult to meet efficiently with conventional systems. Ge othermal heat pumps are sometimes viewed as a renewable energy option. However, while geothermal heating from hot springs (such as Iceland's and Turkey's systems) can be considered a renewable energy alternative, geothermal heat pumps are not renewable, and depend on electricity. Only if the electricity is 100 per cent generated by renewable sources (solar photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric, etc.) can geothermal heat pumps be fully viewed as being a renewable option. R eferences: 1, 2 New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, Albany, NY . Ben efits: For older people , people with disabilities, and families : Supports aging in place by increasing the affordability of home ownership and of rental charges. The green aspects of this option promote health for all community residents. The flexibility of simultaneously heating and cooling different areas of a home o r bui lding: Allow for greater responsiveness to the c omfort and health needs of differe nt po pulations, such as older people, bed- bound individuals, babies, bo th phy sically active and sedentary workers, and people of varying sizes and to lerances. Saves money by reducing energy usage in areas of a home or buil ding where heating or cooling is not needed. F or homeowners and building operators: Contrary to a conventional heating or cooling system, installation of a he at pum p system can be carried out incrementally - allowing an owner of a home o r bui lding to install heat pumps one by one. S ystems are space -saving: Smaller equipment\u2014no large boiler, chiller, or cooling tower. 3 IV.2.i Pumps can often be installed above ceilings or in closets \u2014no need for a large mechanical room. F or communities: Higher efficiency, r educed operating costs , and low maintenance costs: Support the viability of the business community. Result in a lower budgets for: oPublic buildings, such as schools and public offices ; oReligious facilities and service agency buildings . Rural areas \u2014these systems are a high- efficiency heating option for rural areas, which do not have access to natural gas . The green aspects of this option contribute to a community's livability: While heat pumps themselves rely on e lectricity , the overall system is automatically partially renewable ; if the electricity used is generated by a re newable source (wind, hydroelectric, etc.), the entire geothermal he at pum p system can be viewed as a totally renewable energy option. The reduced need for electricity use has various environmental benefits. Geothermal heat pumps are a path to zero -energy buildings . T here are environmental benefits of reduced electricity use. F inancial incentives are often available for implementing geothermal heat pum p s ystems . I mpediments or b arriers to implementation : While there is typically a good payback for new buildings, g eothermal heat pum p s ystems often have a higher install ation cost than conventional systems, especially if closed- loop wells are used. H eat pumps can be noisy ; if located indoors, they should locat ed where the noise is not objectionable \u2014for example, a void locating heat pumps close to o r abo ve bedrooms , offices , or other areas where noise is objectionable. I f open -loop systems are used, minerals in the water can foul heat exchanger s and c ause problems.

H istory is full of examples of water wheels or water mills with associated mill ponds . These systems functioned for thousands of years and provided power for the production of flour, lumber, and textiles. Hydropower also provided power for irrigation and cranes for loading and unloading cargo ships. M ost of us , however , associate hydropower with the production of electricity or hydroelectricity \u2014for use in homes, public buildings, and commercial establishments . H ydroelectric generation stations, such as the one located at Niagara Fall s, which was completed in 1886 , take advantage of the natural falls . However , most hydroelectric projects require a dam and an associate d reservoir to provide what is called the \"head. \" The head is simply the pressure exerted by the weight of the water, based upon elevation (or distance) between the top of the water and the generating equipment. When the water is released and allowed to flow, it provides the power necessary to drive the turbines. T he 1930' s saw large scale projects, such as the construction of Hoover Dam (creating Lake Mead ), which was completed in 1936 on the Arizona /Nevada border, and also saw the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933 . The TVA constructed dams and reservoirs for flood control and hydroelectric power in seven states. In addition, these projects provided much- needed employment during the Great Depression. The TVA also advanced efforts in r eforestation and malaria control and trained farmers in techniques for improving crop yield and soil conservation. T he U. S. Army Corps of Engineers provides a historical perspective on hydropower: \"U nlike the West, where irrigation became the focus of attention, the East was more concerned over hydropower development. Beginning in the early 1880's, when a plant in Appleton, Wisconsin, first used falling water to produce electricity, the construction of hydroelectric dams on the nation's waterways proliferated. These private dams threatened navigation and forced Congress, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to regulate dam construction. The Rivers and Harbors Acts of 1890 and 1899 required that dam sites and plans be approved by the S ecretary of War and the Corps of Engineers before construction. The General Dam Act of 1906 empowered the 2 IV.2.j federal government to compel dam owners to construct, operate, and maintain navigation facilities without compensation whenever necessary at hydroelectric power sites .\" See: U. S. Corps of Engineers : http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/BriefHistoryoftheCorps/Mult ipurposeWaterwayDevelopment.aspx . T he U. S. Army Corps of Engineers also offer this explanation of the process of hydroelectric power: \"A hydraulic turbine converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. A hydroelectric generator converts this mechanical energy into electricity. The operation of a generator is based on the principles discovered by Faraday. He found that when a magnet is moved past a conductor, it causes electricity to flow. In a large generator, electromagnets are made by circulating direct current through loops of wire wound around stacks of magnetic steel laminations. These are called field poles and are mounted on the perimeter of the rotor. The rotor is attached to the turbine shaft and rotates at a fixed speed. When the rotor turns, it causes the field poles (the electromagnets) to move past the conductors mounted in the stator. This, in turn, causes electricity to flow and a voltage to develop at the generator output terminals. \" See: The U.S Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation: http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hyhowworks.html . D ams and reservoirs are expensive , create challenges to navigation and aquatic life, and take up valuable real estate . More recently , we have seen the development of tidal power, or dam -less power. One example of tida l power is located in the East River in New York City. A New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) p ublication explains this process: \"Capturing the natural ebb and flow of the tides has always been a challenge filled with potential benefit. For the past century, hydropower was created by building dams to channel water through powerhouses , where giant turbines captured the power of the falling water. Recently, increased attention to hydrogeneration has centered around a kinetic method of hydropower. By using dozens of small generators in a section of the East River off of Roosevelt Island, near midtown Manhattan, a project is demonstrating kinetic generation. The Roosevelt Island project features tri - bladed turbines capable of turning on their horizontal axes to capture both the ebb and flow of the East River. Submerged prototypes have shown positive results , and regulatory approval is underway for a section of river covering a little over one acre. The potential is to generate 5 to 10 MW of electricity by 2010 .\" See: NYSERDA : General \"Renewal . 3 IV.2.j Hydroelectric stations are appropriate for any geographic location that has moving water. This form of power is the most common ren ewable energy source worldwide and accounts for almost half of all renewables in the United States . According to The Need Project (2008), hydropower produces 20 per cent of the world's electricity; and in the United States, New York ranks third in the use of hydropower for the generation of electricity : http://www.need.org/needpdf/infobook_activities/IntInfo/HydroI.pdf . Hydropower is the cheapest way to generate e lectricity in the United States \u2014cheaper than coal or nuclear plants \u2014and produces no air pollution because it does not burn fuel . Ben efits: For consumers Hydro electric power produces no air pollution, promoting a healthier livi ng e nvironment for community residen ts. The lower cost of hydro electric power makes homeownership and rental costs more affordable for older people, individuals with disabilities, and families , s upporting their ability to remain living in their communities. F or the community The lower cos t of hydroelectric power supports the activities of the busine ss c ommunity and lowers the operating costs of other community sectors, such as health care facilities and schools. H ydroelectric power is a renewable energy source , reducing reliance o n trad itional non -renewable fuels . H ydroelectric power avoids fuel costs in the production of electricity, and , therefore , stabilizes the cost of energy over the life of the plant . T he avoidance of fossil fuels makes h ydroelectric power more environmentally friendly and reduces greenhouse gas emissions . Lak es created by hydroelectric dams can also contribute to flood control, irrigation, recreation, and wildlife. I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation : Hydroelectric power is dependent upon rainfall for the supply of flowing water. H ydroelectric stations must be sited in area s with moving water. H ydroelectric generation is a long- term investment. H ydroelectric generation may require the construction of a dam and reservoir .

Maintaining visual quality means being mindful of the type, color, and quantity of light provided in a given space or area and encompasses a range of issues for both general and special populations, such as assuring that enough light reaches the eye, maintaining even lighting levels across the floor, and heightening security . Lighting also uses a significant amount of energy in buildings , which can contribute to how the above issues are managed ; but there are steps that can be taken to promote e nergy efficiency and ensure that the public is healthy and safe. V isual Quality: One aspect of m aintaining visual quality is assuring that there is enough light for users to see and perform their daily tasks without eye strain. The impact of low visual quality negatively affects people with normal vision, but is particular ly challeng ing for the older population and people of all ages with vision loss. T he Aging Eye: E yesight weakens over time. Glare is poorly tolerated by older people, as are extreme differences in lighting levels. With age, the pupil decreases in size and the lens thicken s. The eye of a typical 60 -year old lets in only one-third of the light that is received by a typical 20 -year old's eye. Ge neral Public: Many of the lighting designs that are beneficial for older people also help younger -aged people with vision loss. The Web site, Better Medicine ( http://www.localhealth.com/article/vision- loss/causes ) lists numerous causes of vision impairment among people of all ages ; and the American Foundation for the Blind reports that \"m ore than 25 million Americans report experiencing significant vision loss ,\" including 57,696 legally blind children ( http://www.afb.org/default.asp ). T hese demographics, tied with an overall aging of the general population , including people with vision loss, call for awareness to eyesight issues and visual quality in both newly -constructed buildings and existing spaces that serve all populations. En ergy Efficiency: According to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency,1 in the average U.S. home, lighting accounts for about 20 per cent of the electric bill ; and the U. S. Energy Information Administration2 reports that lighting account s for 21 per cent of overall electricity use in commercial buildings in the United States. Improving lighting efficiency has both direct and indirect benefits. For example, 2 IV.2.k \"over 23 per cent of the electricity us ed in California is for lighting; in commercial space, five percent of the electricity used for air conditioning eliminates heat that is generated by lighting.\"3 As a significant source of energy use, lighting presents an opportunity for capturing energy savings through the use of energy -efficient equipment. High- quality, energy -efficient lighting is possible if the proper equipment is used for a given application and if the characteristics of the affected population are considered. M ost facilities are phasing out the use of inefficient incandescent lighting, using fluorescent, LED (light- emitting diode), and metal halide technologies in its place . More efficient versions of existing fluorescent lighting are available as well. However, not all types of lighting are appropriate for every application. For example, t he best form of lighting for a cafeteria in a senior housing complex is different from what is best for a bedroom in a single -family home . Thus , it is important that a project's design staff be familiar with both lighting quality and energy efficiency. N atural d aylight is an important consideration from both a lighting- quality and energy -efficiency perspective. The use of daylight to minimize internal lighting needs is a common strategy in reducing a building's overall energy use . In addition, the use of daylight in both residential and commercial facilities can help maintain circadian rhythms and overall health. E xterior lighting systems support both navigation and security. Visual quality for exterior systems assures that pedestrians and vehicles can identify points of entrance and exit from a facility, and that potential hazards (for example curbs and stairs) are lit well enough to either negotiate or avoid. Exterior lighting can also discourage criminal activity and allow security surveillance systems to function properly. T he quest for security should not result in o ver-lit exteriors which show light trespass (where lighting spills over property lines) and contribute to sky glow (night brightening of the sky caused by outdoor man-made lighting and natural atmospheric and celestial factors) . Local municipalities may also have legislation addressing sky glow, especially in rural or recreational areas. A s with interior lighting, older technology (such as mercury vapor systems) in exterior lighting can be replaced with more efficient systems , such as metal halide or LED , which use equipment that precisely directs light to ground level where it is needed .

Ben efits: There are numerous benefits to maintaining visual quality and energy ef ficiency in lighting systems: Fo r consumers: Health, safety , and self -care: Maintaining appropriate levels of lighting, as well as the elimination of glare: oReduces the risk of falls, missteps, and other accidents for people of all ages and functional lev els, including older adults, younger people wi th v isual loss, children, and others . oS upports the ability of all people to be self -caring and self -managing . oT he use of daylight, in place of artificial light, contributes to the maintenance of healthy circadian rhythms. F or the community: High quality lighting reduce s the number of maintenance call -backs. E nergy -efficient lighting systems reduce energy costs and demand on the electrical grid. H igh-quality exterior lighting promotes site safety and security. E xterior lighting that minimizes \"sky glow\" nighttime light pollution has positive implications for the environment and individuals' health. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Obstacles to achieving a space with a high quality, but energy -efficient , visual environment include lack of information, funding, and misconceptions : In designing new spaces, the design team may not be aware of the special lighting needs of the older adult population or of other population groups wi th vis ual impairment s. However, numerous design guides and information exist on how to improve lighting to meet the needs of individuals with visua l i mpairments. Homeowners, as well as building and facility operators, are not sufficientlyknowledgeable about the cost differences between conventional lighting optionsand newer energy -efficient lighting options. However, the incremental cost of installing a high- quality, energy -efficient lighting scheme is minimal ; using high - efficiency lighting fixtures typically has an attractive payback and will pay fo r i tself over time.4 IV.2.k Fluorescent and compact fluorescent lamps contain a small amount of mercury, and the fear of mercury keeps some users from adopting this option. I n addi tion, d isposal of these lamps must be treated with care; and all facilities should comply with the requirements of federal, state, and local legislatio n re garding the disposal of lamps and ballasts. However, c ompact fluoresce nt l amps are a relatively simple energy -efficiency retrofit , and many retailers have implemented take -back programs to properly recycle and dispose of spe nt l amps. Some individuals believe that fluorescent lamps (both linear and compact) give poor light quality by casting the room in a greenish glow. However, great improvements have been made in fluorescent lighting in the past ten years , including an improved array of colors available and minimization of flicker andhum from fluorescent ballasts. Some consumers have had poor experiences with compact fluorescent screw -in lamps and feel they do not provide high enough lighting levels . Manufacture r pac kaging for screw-in compact fluorescent lamps tends to recommend a 4:1 wattage reduction ( for example, a 14 -watt compact fluorescent light bulb to replace a 60 -watt i ncandescent light bulb), which often results in under- lit s paces for older adults and others with visual impairments. Instead, a 3:1 ratio (i.e., 20-watt compact fluorescent bulb to replace a 60 -watt incandescent) is recommended to ensure that enough light is available and to assure that the lamp is not replaced with a higher- wattage incandescent lamp out of frustration.

The municipal provider sells the electric power service to the end -users (homeowners, businesses, public buildings, community organizations, etc.) and maintains the distribution network to these custo mers. For many cities and towns, public power represents both an ideal of local people working together to meet local needs, and the many revenue, environmental, and quality -of-life benefits inherent in local control of the power system. A municipal powe r distribution system supports a community's livability status. In particular, (1) the lower electricity rates increase the ability of older people and younger people with disabilities to affordably age in place in their own homes, (2) local employment op portunities support community stability, and (3) efficiency through the integration of all utility operations helps sustain a community's viability over time. T he process of forming a municipal power utility typically includes the following elements: a feasibility study, legal analysis, facilities valuation, consumer educational campaign, citizen referendum, price negotiation and/or condemnation proceedings, petition to the New York State Public Service Commission, power supply arrangements, and start- up operations. The American Public Power Association provides information and materials for municipalities interested in pursuing public ownership of their local distribution system. N ew York State has a long history of municipally instituted public powe r systems, and usage has grown over time. Many cities and towns in New York State, such as Tupper Lake, Fairport, and Westfield, began generating their own electricity to power streetlamps , as well as some homes and businesses, at the turn of the 20th century. The Village of Fairport's electric utility began operating a small steam generator to power 12 streetlights and 40 homes \u2014today, the Fairport system serves 15,000 customers over 27 square miles. Similarly, four rural electric cooperatives were forme d in the 1940' s to establish electric service in areas of the State not yet serviced by surrounding utilities . I n 1931, a commission established to study the hydroelectric potential of the St. Lawrence River called for the creation of an Authority to build generating facilities on the river. On April 27 of that year, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Public Power Authority Act into law \"to give back to the people the waterpower which is theirs, \" forming the New York Power Authority (NYPA). Even as work on the St. Lawrence River project proceeded, the New York Power Authority prepared for an even more complex power project, to be located on the lower Niagara River, about five miles downstream from Niagara Falls. Congress passed the Niagara 2 IV.2.1 Redevelopment Act in 1957 , paving the way for the Power Authority to obtain a license and begin construction on the Niagara Power Project to fully develop the United State s' share of the Niagara River's hydropower potential. T he 1957 Niagara Redevelopment Act also gives \"preference power\" to municipal and rural electric cooperative systems in New York and bordering states, which is 50 per cent of the Niagara Project's capacity. The low cost hydropower from the Niagara Power Project and the St. Lawrence River is delivered and sold to existing municipal power providers throughout the state, at a greatly reduced cost than they would otherwise be able to generate or purchase. M unicipal power providers that have been established following the Niagara Power Project have predominantly done so as an alternative to Investor Owned U tilities. For example, Messina Electric was formed in 1981 to create a local commitment to low rates, reliability, and environmentalism. Today, the majority of municipal power providers in New York State purchase all or a substantial portion of their power from the New York Power Authority. Only four public power utilities in the State generate their own power supply to augment the low -cost hydropower received from NYPA \u2014Jamestown Board of Public Utilities, Green Island Power Authority, and two plants on Long Island. Other municipalities, whose need extends beyond the ir NYPA allocation, supplement their supply through a contract with the New York Municipal Power Agency (NYMPA) , which is a joint action agency made up of 31 municipal utilities from around the State that purchases power on behalf of its members through the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). Ben efits: The benefits of municipally owned power often depend on the way the community has structured that particular system, as a public power utility is owned by, and accountable to every citizen of the municipality . For many, the benefits for families, businesses, and community organizations include: Lower electricity rates . E qual or greater reliability of services . Re sponsive ness to customer concerns . Em phasis on long -term community goals . Q uick response from crews located in the community , which is especially beneficial for frail older adults, younger individuals with disabilities, and thosewho rely on home health care. R evenues that stay within the community. L ocal employment opportunities . 3 IV.2.1 Access to tax exempt financing for capital projects. O pportunity for efficiency through integrated utility operations (e.g. electric, water, sewer, garbage, cable, telecommunications, gas) . Lo cal control over special programs (energy conservation, rate relief for certain customer classes). I mpediments or barriers to development or i mplementation: Market and price fluctuatio ns: A municipality looking to form a public electric utility is not currently able to access low -cost hydropower through the New York Po wer Authority , as NYPA's power capacity has been allocated through long - term contracts with existing utilities. Thus, municipalities would need to purchase their power on the open electricity market through NYISO or o n a c ontract with NYMPA. Purchasing power through this competitive process is subject to market fluctuations, and prices cannot be guaranteed. Exit fees: The Public Service Commission (PSC) establishe d Rule 52 in 1998 to determine monetary exit fees to compensate utilities for the portions of thei r di stribution networks that are being bypassed due to municipalization. Unde r t he Rule 52 formula, an exit fee is equal to (1) the net present value of 'th e re venues the utility would have received from departing customers located i n the municipality that is exiting from the utility's network' had those customers continued to take retail service from the utility , (2) plus the value of th e di stribution and street lighting plant that will be taken, (3) minus the costs the utility will avoid by not serving the departing customers, (4) minus revenues the utility will receive by selling the capacity and energy that is no longer needed by departing customers to other customers . However, a ccording to the PSC , the process of municipalization can be regarded as economic only if it produces ne t s avings even after payment of the exit fee.

R enewable Energy (RE): RE, often called renewable power, includes those technologies that derive power without the use of nuclear or fossil fuels. Renewable technologies can generate energy from the sun, wind , biomass, tides, moving water, or geothermal sources. These technologies produce little or no emissions and result in minimal environmental impact. T he use of renewable energy sources is not new. Pre -Columbian examples of renewable energy can be found i n the s outhwestern United States , where the Anasazi c ulture took advantage of solar gain for heating in the winter, when the sun was low on the horizon. Similarly, they utilized the shade of the cliffs to provide cooling in the summer, when the sun was hi gh in the sky . Long before electricity, our ancestors used wind to po wer the pumps that provided water to farms. In the 1930s, hydroelectric projects provided not only cheap reliable power and flood control , but also created jobs for a nation experiencing the Great Depression. N ew York State Renewable Portfolio Standard \u2014 In 2004, New York State adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard. Within the total amount of electricity used by retail customers, this policy set a goal to increase the proportion of renewable - generated electricity to 25 per cent by 2013. Renewable systems include solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) is tasked with achieving 24 per cent of the new policy's goal . The remaining one per cent is anticipated to come from utility customers willing to pay a premium to support this effort. The Renewable Portfolio Standard comprises two sections : The Main Tier , which is designed for partici pation by large-scale generators . The Customer -Sited Tier, which is designed for on- site generation and use. These applications have been referred to as \"behind the meter\" renewable systems. D istributed Generation (DG) : DG is simply the on -site productio n of energy. It may also be referred to as dispersed generation, embedded generation, or decentralized generation. DG systems can include continuous prime power and standby generators, c ombined heat and p ower (CHP) systems, solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and energy storage systems ; this list is increasing with the deployment of new technologies. Renewable systems that are Customer- Sited would be considered d istributed generation. 2 IV.2.m DG systems can be configured to operate in synchronization with the electrical utility grid, or can be independent of the utility grid and continue to supply powe r during utility power outages. Synchronized systems can often sell excess- generated power back to the grid through a process known as net- metering. T he most common DG systems are those used for backup power generation, which are often used in hospitals and municipal buildings or to supply standby power for other utilities , such as telecommunications or water systems. Because DG systems add to overall generating capacity , they can have a significant impact on reducing peak demand o n the utility grid or network. Peak demand, which has been responsible for brown- out or black -out conditions, usually occurs during the hottest part of the summer, when the elect ric cooling load is running at a maximum. R enewable Energy Distributed Generation ( REDG ) systems can be purchased or leased, depending on the type of system and the vendors. In all cases, REDG systems are considered a long- term investment , and the initi al cost of a system and its payback and benefits are calculate d over the life of the system. This long -term approach to energy tends to stabilize or hedge the cost of power over the life of the system and is less impacted by the commodity- market fluctuati ons common to fossil fuels . Ben efits: For consumers REDG can be configured to operate with or independent of the local utility company, providing on- site power generation during emergency conditions, allowing for sheltering in place, as opposed to evacuation, in the event of apower failure . . . which is particularly beneficial for frail older adults and people with disabilities of all ages . S ystems using renewable energy sources provide a healthier environment fo r re sidents and building tenants. I nvest ment in REDG provides long-term stabilization of energy rates , making energy rates/expenses for homes and buildings more predictable and less subject to commodity market fluctuations \u2014which is an important factor i n s upporting the ability of residents to age- in-place. F inancial incentives and tax credits are often available \u2014keeping housing costs affordable . F or the community Depending on the type selected , there can be environmental benefit s because of reduced or no carbon emissions . On-s ite generation reduces the geographical strain or need for additional transmission and distribution systems. 3 IV.2.m R EDG can also be used to reduce peak kilowatt demand, thereby avoidi ng bro wn-outs and black -outs. I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation: Investment in RE DG Technol ogy is a long -term commitment, and the owner is responsible for yearly maintenance . T here may not be adequate space or a good location for the equipment. T he building 's electrical distribution system must be configured to support REDG . T he project may not be cost-effective . A home or building owner can c alculate the Savings to I nvestment Ratio (SIR) by taking the annual savings in energy costs ($), multiplied by the life expectancy (years) of the system; t hen, dividing that answer by the initial cost of the system ($). The result i s the SIR. If the SIR is 1.0 or greater, the project is considered to have a positive payback.

Compared to the environmental impact of energy produced using fossil fuels (such as oil, gas, or coal) , solar electric \u2014or PV\u2014 technology makes use of the abundant energy of the sun and has little negative impact on our environment. PV cells can be used in a wide range of products, from small consumer items to large commercial solar electric systems. Commonly known as solar cells, individual PV cells are electricity -producing devices made of semiconductor materials (materials \u2014such as sili con and germanium \u2014that conduct electricity in a limited way) . PV cells come in many sizes and shapes\u2014from smaller than a postage stamp to several inches across\u2014and these cells are often connected together to form PV modules. A typical PV module measures three feet wide by five feet long, but they can range from two to four feet wide and four to six feet long. Modules can be combined and connected to form PV arrays (panels) of different sizes and power output, and these connected systems integrate easily with existing energy supplies. P V panels need to see the sun to make energy; they are often mounted on the roof of a building, facing south at an angle, so the modules receive the maximum amount of sunlight. T here are many tools that can calculate the av ailable sun - hours that will be available for a system \u2014the same hours that give a person the fastest tan will also generate the most energy from a PV system. T he ideal angle for harvesting sunlight is about 10 degrees less than latitude, but an angle betwe en 20 and 45 degrees will provide a great deal of electricity. Due South is also ideal, but plus or minus 25 degrees will have only a minimal effect o n energy production. A site- specific analysis should be completed before any site is ruled out. A fo ur-kilowatt PV system generates enough electricity to meet about half of the electrical needs of an average home, with additional needed electricity purchased from the local utility from the electric grid . When excess energy is produced by the PV system , the local utility will \" buy back\" this power\u2014 if net-metering is available. Some local utilities are not equipped to handle net- metering. If it is equipped to handle net -metering , the utility will provide a credit for the excess electricity generated by the PV system and appl y it to the bill for the grid- electricity that the consumer must purchase. Typically, the consumer's account is reconciled annually, and the utility will buy any excess electricity at their wholesale rate. A ty pical feature of a PV system is the inverter, which changes electricity from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) so that it can be used by most standard appliances and computers. Batteries may also be added for emergency 2 IV.2.n backup in the event of power outages or in cases where your PV system is not connected to utility power lines and cannot access electricity from the grid . W hile PV systems are often mounted onto a roof , an exterior wall, or another part a building, a Building -Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system c an be incorporated into the building, replac ing conventional building materials (such as roofing and siding) and blending into the look of the building. Ben efits: For the community and the environment: The electricity generated by a PV system is typically used where it's generated,eliminating load on the local utility's distribution system (electric grid) . S olar energy promotes a healthier living environment because energy produced through solar power is pollution- free\u2014creating a more livable, attrac tive community for residents . T he overall use of fossil fuels is reduced because energy from the sun is a s ustainable resource \u2014essentially infinite. F or the consumer \u2014 cost-savings and convenience: A properly installed PV system requires little maintenance over its lifetime. M ost solar panels carry a 25 -year warranty; inverters can carry a 10 -year warranty . I f batteries are included in the PV system as a backup, the system can provide electricity during a black -out. S olar electricity is generated for the consumer during times of peak demand on the electric grid, when purchased power from the utility is most expensive. If the cost of connecting to the utility grid is excessive or impossible , solar power can be a very economic alternative . F inancial inc entive s and tax credits are often available that subsidize the cost of installing a PV system . The cost of PV systems has been decreasing and the cost of purchase d e lectricity has been increasing. Many predict that grid- parody (where the cost of purchased electricity equals the cost of the electricity generated by a PV system ) will occur around 2015. Fo r installations that are eligible for net- metering, the local utility purchases the excess electricity that is generated by the PV system but unused by the consumer .3 IV.2.n Impediments or barriers to development or implementation: Currently, the initial cost of a PV system is expensive\u2014costs range from $6/kW to $10/kW. However, costs have been decreasing, and most predict that cos t wi ll continue to decrease for the foreseeable future. PV systems can only generate electricity when the sun is shining. During the night, or when it i s cloudy, or when the panels are shaded, the system will produce very little or no power. The ability of a solar array to produce energy is only as good as the weakest- performing panel; if one panel is completely shaded, all the panels in that array will not generate any energy. A PV installation requires a large area for the system to be eff ective in providing electricity. An area the size of a sheet of plywood (32 square feet) is needed for 500 watts of generating capacity. Thus, 260 square feet of area (8 sheets of plywood) would be necessary for a 4 kW system . Panels may need to be cleaned \u2014although, in New York State, if the panels are installed at an angle, rain generally does a pretty good job. The location of solar panels can affect long -term performance \u2014trees gro w and buildings get built which can obscure the panel 's view of the sun. Batteries must be included in the system to provide continued generation of electricity during a blackout. Without batteries, when the re is an electrical blackout, the PV system will not generate electricity, as the inverter needs the electricity from the grid to synchronize the AC power it is producing.

The Town has been an Energy $mart Community since February , 2003, and actively conducts outreach to educate its residents and businesses about energy efficiency and renewable energy. Town officials sought to install a photovoltaic system in the Town Hall primarily as a demonstration system to increase public awareness of the need for and benefits of renewable energy, as the Town Hall's central location, high visibility , and large number of visitors mak e it an ideal setting for this purpose.

However, all are designed to capture solar energy in the form of heat. A home owner can use the sun for cooking, heating hot water for a home, warming a swimming pool, radiant heating, and even as an alternative to air conditioning . T ypically, residential sola r thermal applications include either a passive collector design that incorporates a thermal mass with no mechanical systems , or an active design that includes electronic controls and circulating pumps. A thermal mass is any material that stores solar energy during the day and releases the energy in the form of heat at night, when the temperature is cooler. Common thermal masses include concrete, natural stone, and water. Both passive and active designs offset the amount of energy required by a household. W hile the combinations of using solar thermal systems are endless, the most common application in use today centers around the production of domestic hot water, which is the focus of this paper . An average solar domestic hot water system can produce up to half the hot water required by a typical household in New York State . A typical system includes a solar thermal collector, a medium (such as anti-freeze or similar fluid) to transport heat from the collector, a heat exchanger, and a reservoir (collection) tank. Many systems include a secondary hot water tank to supplement heat and ensure hot water is always available. I n northern climates, including New York, where below-freezing temperatures are normal during the winter months, a flat plate collector or an evacuated tube collector \u2014in combination with a non -freezing heat transfer fluid (medium) \u2014is the solar thermal collector of choice. Both collector types are designed to be roof - mounted and can be linked together to form a thermal collection array that balances the hot water production needs of the household with installation costs. S olar domestic hot water systems can be installed in any geographic area of the State, on any household or building with optimal sun exposure \u2014reducing the cost of heating water and saving both energy and money. Using the sun as a clean, abundant, reliable, affordable, renewable energy source, solar thermal systems are considered a valuable element of a livable community. Ben efits: For homeowners The reduced cost of heating water with a solar thermal system makes homeownership more affordable for older people, people with disabilities, and f amilies \u2014supporting successful aging in place and supporting the efforts of family caregivers.2 IV.2.o The application of solar thermal systems for apartment buildings contributes to the affordability of rents for lower- income older people, people with disabilities, and families. A so lar system m ay extend the life of a secondary hot water tank (if included i n t he system). F or the community Reduction in the annual amount of c arbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by conventional water heaters improves air quality in homes and ac ross the community, creating a more healthy living environment. U se of solar thermal systems reduces use of costly conventional heating m ethods such as electricity (as well as reduces the drain on the country's electrical grid) and reduces the use of non -renewable fossil fuels. I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation : Climate: Certai n types of s olar domestic hot water systems cannot be installed in climates that experience freezing temperatures . C ost: Although installation costs are recouped over time through operationalsavings, the upfront cost to install a s olar domestic hot water system is high. On average, a typical residential system costs approximately $5,000 fo r m aterials, plus the cost of installation by a professional . S olar domestic hot water systems require regular maintenance, which o n av erage costs $100 annually.

Morrison, II, Project Manager New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Albany, NY SU B-METERING FOR ELECTRICITY D escription: There are two different methods by which multifamily buildings are metered for electricity: direct metering and master metering. Single -family buildings are direct metered. D irect metering: In a direct -metered building (also known as individually metered), the utility owns the meter and supplies electricity to each living unit (single -family home; individual apartment) . Each householder receives his living unit's electric bill from the utility at the residential retail rate ; in a multiunit building, the building owner receives an electric bill for electric usage in the common areas, typically at a commercial retail rate . M aster metering: In a master- metered building, the utility supplies electricity to the entire building, and one utility -owned meter serves the building. The building owner receives one electric bill, often at a rate that results in a bill significantly lower than the retail residential rate. Individual apartments are not metered, and actual apartment consumption cannot be determined or used as the basis for billing electric charges. I n a direct- metered building, residents pay for the amount of electricity they consume. In a master- metered building, the cost of the total electric consumption for the building is divided among apartments, not taking into account actual consumption per household . Billing for each apartment can be handled in various ways; f or example, divided evenly among all apartments, or based on the size of the apartment or where it is located in the building, or based on the numer of residents in an apartment. Submetering combines the best of both direct- and master- metering systems. S ubmetering: Submetering is used with master- metered buildings. It permits the measurement of electric use in individual apartments via a building- owned meter installed for each apartment (these are submeters and are owned by the building and not the utility ). The building continues to purchase its electricity on the less expensive commercial or bulk residential rate basis, but the owner is able to bill electric -use to individual apartments on an actual -consumption basis. The building owner continues to receive one bill from the utility ; the owner allocates the utility costs across apartments based on the usage recorded by the apartment submeters ; residents pay the building owner, not the utility; and the building owner continues to be responsible for the portion of the utility bill that covers the building's common areas. 2 IV.2.p There are many benefits to electrical submetering in master- metered buildings \u2014 both the owner and the residents reap the benefits of lower energy costs, c urrent technology facilitates the reading of submeters without entry into individual apartments (preserving residents' privacy), and available software systems enable automated billing procedures. In addition, electrical submetering is a successful energy -conservation strategy , reducing energy use among residents . Often, property owners do not bill residents separately for utilities, but incorporate those charges into the rental charge . When property owners do not charge for utilities separately, residents have little reason or incentive to conserve ener gy; and they are unable to compare how much energy they are saving when they do decide to take energy -saving steps . When a building undergoes a typical energy - conservation measure (installation of a new boiler, etc.), consideration should be given to including submetering as a beneficial component of the new installation . Ben efits: Energy savings \u2014a change from traditional mas ter-metering to submetering has been shown to reduce residents' consumption of elect ricity in apartments by 10 - 26 per cent.1 Lo wer utility costs \u2014building owners continue to reap the benefits of less expensive commercial or bulk -buying electric rates, which are passed on to apartment dwellers. F airer allocation of energy costs\u2014 Submete ring restores the \"pay for what yo u us e\" concept. Data reveals that 20 -25 per cent of total apartment usage is consumed by only 10 per cent of the residents ;2 yet, under traditional master- metering, these excessive users pay the same as other residents . Sub- metering restores fairness. Approximately 60 -70 per cent of residents benefi t f rom submetering . The only residents who fare worse under submetering are those who use excessive amounts of electricity; however residents who find that t heir electric bi lls are excessive have the ability to reduce cost by reduci ng c onsumption. Be nefits to owners \u2014 Submetering largely eliminates a volatile, variable, and d ifficult -to-control factor from a building's operating budget\u2014apartment electric usage costs. Whether the building is a rental, cooperative, or condominium, owners can better predict costs when the only electric usage to be considered is for common areas, which are under management control. Be nefits to utilities and society \u2014 Submetering benefits utilit ies and society in th e s ame way: by reducing the waste of energy and deferring the need to site, build, or otherwise acquire electric generating capacity, as well as by reduc ing the use of fossil fuels (e.g., oil), which are still the primary source of power - generation in New York State. Reducing the use of fossil fuels is a giant ste p to ward enhancing the environment by improving air quality. 3 IV.2.p R eference s: 1, 2 \"Sub-metering,\" Energy Conservation Services Corporation, New York City : http://enconcorp.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid= 77. I mpediments or b arriers to development or implementation: Inplementing submetering i nvolves an investment of about $500 per submete r po int (tenant space) , and the owner is responsible for all maintenance and billing to the tenants . S ome residents may refuse to pay any additional charges related to the implementation of the sub- meter ing syistem . S ome residen ts may object to a change in billing procedures, or may object to any increase in charges due to their higher individual consumption patterns. The owner is responsible for a ny dispute -resolution process to resolve such issues. Such a proce ss is designed to establish procedures in the eve nt a re sident does not agree with the meter reading, billing, or other aspects of the electric charges. S ome tenants may lobby others in the building to convince them that s ubmetering is bad for everyone ; it is usually the tenants who use the most energy who become most vocal.

Between 1950 and 2000, the U.S. population nearly doubled. However, in that same period, public demand for water more than tripled. Each American now use s an average of 100 gallons of water each day1\u2014enough to fill 1,600 drinking glasses! This increased demand has put additional stress on water supplies and distribution systems, threatening both human health and the environment. T here is a reason why water has become a national priority. A recent government survey showed that at least 36 states are anticipating local, regional, or statewide water shortages by 2013.2 But, by using water more efficiently, we can help preserve water supplies for future generations, save money, and protect the environment. T he average household spends as much as $500 per year on its water and sewer bill; by making just a few simple changes to use water more efficiently, that house could save about $170 per year.3 If all U.S. households installed water- efficient appliances, the country would save more than three trillion gallons of water and more than $18 billion dollars per year.4 Also, when water is used more efficiently, there is a reduced need for costly water supply infrastructure investments and new wastewater treatment facilities. I t takes a considerable amount of energy to deliver and treat the water that is used in homes every day. For example, letting a faucet run for five minutes uses about as much energy as letting a 60 -watt light bulb run for 14 hours. American public water supply and treatment facilities consume about 56 billion kilowatt- hours (kWh) per year\u2014enough electricity to power more than five million homes for an entire year.5 T here are many ways to save water in residential buildings , and all of them are cost-effective over a very short time -horizon, making their implementation an economic home- run almost every time. The Federal Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992) issued performance standards for residential water- efficient fixtures and appliances, which are now federal law. These appliances and fixtures include toilets, faucets, showerheads, clothes washers, and dishwashers. The standards are expressed in tables below. 6 I n addition to federal standards, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed certifications to help consumers identify the most energy - and water- efficient products on the market. These certification labels are WaterSense\u00ae 2 IV.2.q and ENERGY STAR\u00ae; WaterSense\u00ae products use less water than the standards developed for EPAct 1992.

It is common for people to install faucet aerators that use as little as 0.5 gallons per minute in the bathroom sink, because most people actually use very little water to brush their teeth and wash their faces. In places like New York City , where water is over $7 per 1,000 gallons, changing from a 2.5 to a 0.5 aerator pays for itself in only 50 minutes of use. A nother easy way to save water includes landscaping your property with native plants, which will not require constant watering. The National Wildlife Federation maintains a Web site containing a list of all plants that are native to New advanced concepts in water- efficiency include the limited reuse of \"greywater. \" Greywater is water that has been used for some purpose and is no longer potable . However, it could be used for other activities; f or example, some developers have implemented systems where water that has been used to wash hands is subsequently used to flush toilets or water lawns. A similar idea to recycling greywater is the collection and reuse of rainwater . Instead of letting rainwater get washed away from the gutter to the sidewalk, many buildings contain a cistern to capture the water and store it for use at a later date. The primary use for such water is irrigation, which requires little engineering or effort; but there is also the potential to use rainwater for non- potable applications in a building , such as flushing toilets. F inally, as was discussed earlier, energy and water use are often inextricably linked. Heating systems in the Northeast tend to be either steam or hydronic. In steam systems, water is heated in a boiler and distributed through pipes to radiators, which , in turn , heat the building. The steam turns into hot water after giving off its heat and returns to the boiler to start the cycle again. Hydronic systems circulate hot water through the pipes rather than turning it into steam first. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has studied the water use in steam and hydronically heated buildings, and findings show that hydronic systems use dramatically less water (and energy) than most steam systems . Thus, if there is an opportunity to install a hydronic system rather than a steam system in a building, it should be pursued. In conversions from steam to hydronic , it is important to ensure that the pipes are sealed to avoid water leaks throughout the building. Whatever the configuration of a heating system, the amount of water being used by the system should be regularly checked, because excessive water use can be a good indication that something is wrong with the system. A system that is kept in good working order will extend the life of the equipment, save money on utilities, and save the State's resources. 5 IV.2.q R eferences: 1, 2 U. S.

Ben efits: For consumers: Water- and energy -efficient features save significant househol d ex penses \u2014making homeownership and rental properties more affordable fo r gre ater numbers of householders and allowing greater numbers of individuals to remain living in the community. G rants and rebates are available for Energy STAR\u00ae and other water- saving appliances. F or the community: By reducing household water use, householders not only help reduce the energy required to supply and treat public water supplies but also can help address climate change. For example, according to the U. S. Environmental Protectio n Ag ency (http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/sustain/waterefficiency.cfm ): If one out of every 100 American homes were retrofitted with water- efficient fixtures, about 100 million kWh of electricity per year would be saved\u2014 avoiding 80,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That is equivalent toremoving nearly 15,000 automobiles from the road for one ye ar. If one per cent of American homes replaced their older, inefficient toilets with WaterSense\u00ae-labeled models, the country would save more than 38 million kWh of electricity \u2014enough to supply one month's electricity for more than 4 3,000 households . Impe diments or barriers to development or implementation: Some efficiency strategies are too advanced for \"do -it-yourself\" applications and re quire the skills and knowledge of professionals; for example: The use of greywater is an advanced strategy , requiring engineering and s ome level of filtration, and should be pursued only after all of the nuts -and- bolts technologies have been implemented. Rainwater collection and use is a much more advanced application and woul d re quire some level of filtration and engineering. 6 IV.2.q Hydronic heating systems require some design and engineering work and m ay not be appropriate for every application.

Syracuse, NY WEA THERIZATION De scription : The primary goal of all \"weatherization\" efforts is to modify a home or building to reduce its energy consumption and optimize its energy ef ficiency. In particular, publicly supported weatherization programs are designed to assist needy householders (including older adults, individuals of all ages with disabilities, and families with children) reduce their energy bills and achieve both economic and environmental savings. While publicly supported programs assist low-income household ers, weatheriz ing homes and other types of buildings has rapidly become attractive to people of all income levels because, i f done properly, it will permanently red uce energy bills by making existing homes and buildings more energy -efficient. According to the United States Department of Energy ,1 weatherization reduces heating bills by an average of 32 per cent and overall energy bills by about $350 per year at curre nt (2009) prices. Acr oss the United States, existing buildings use one -third of all energy consumed in the country and two -thirds of all electricity. Due to the ir high energy usage, existing buildings are a major source of the pollution that causes air quality problems ; and they supply pollutants that directly contribute to climate change. The practice of weatherizing a home or building offers a long -lasting solution to the many inefficient homes and buildings in country , as it directly addresses the cause through energy efficiency. T he movement to weatherize homes and buildings has grown over the years in conjunction with rising concerns about fuel costs and environmental issues . As weatherization has evolved, there has been increasing emphasis o n looking at how each individual building performs as a whole system. This more current approach extends traditional weatherization activities to also include the installation of recent ly developed , energy -saving heating and cooling equipment, as well as the repair of old, inefficient equipment. A lthough weatherization packages vary to best suit each individual home or building, some common weatherization procedures include : Sealing\u2014which is done using materials such as caulk, foam sealant, weather- stripping, window film, door sweeps, and electrical receptacle gaskets to reduce air infiltration : Seal bypasses (cracks, gaps, holes), especially around doors, windows,pipes, and wiring that penetrate the ceiling and floor, and other areas wi th hi gh potential for heat loss. Seal air ducts, which can account for 20 per cent of heat loss, using fiber - reinforced mastic . 2 IV.2.r Provid e proper ventilation to unconditioned spaces to protect a building from the effects of condensation. Protect pipes from corrosion and freezing. Weather- strip doors and windows. Clean and tune existing heating mechanical systems. Install : Storm doors and storm windows.

Install/replac e dampers in exhaust ducts to prevent outside air from enteri ng t he house when the exhaust fan or clothes dryer is not in use. F ederal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)\u2014 Through a nationwide weatherization network of 900 agencies, the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Federal Weatherization Assistance Program provides for the installation of energy efficiency measures in single -family and multiunit homes of income -qualifying homeowners. WAP is administered in each state by a state government agency. Since its inception in 1976, more than 6.2 million low- income families have been assisted with weatherization procedures that are long - lasting and effective, providing energy savings that pay for the upgrades within a few years. WAP' s Technical Assistance Center provides guidance for program operations and fosters community partnerships to advance weatherization. T hrough its Oak Ridge National Laboratory, DOE conducts regular evaluations of the WAP program to verify energy savings and to maximize servi ce to weatherization clients. Evaluations have shown that each dollar of DOE investment in weatherization returns $2.69 in energy and non- energy -related benefits . The WAP program was greatly expanded as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment act (ARRA) of 2009, with eligibility qualification now raised to 200 per cent of the F ederal poverty income guidelines. Many techniques that are currently standard procedure in the country's larger weatherization industry were first developed and tested under the Federal Weatherization Assistance Program ; and, through this program, DOE continues to develop and test new advances in the field of home energy science. 3 IV.2.r Reference: 1 Hawaii State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, U.

For example, according to Weatherize.org,2 52 jobs are directly created for each million dollars invested into the Federal Weatherizatio n A ssistance Program . Local economy \u2014 Weatherizing homes directly provides work for local contractors and revenue for the businesses that supply the materials necessary for weatherizatio n pro cedures.

Wind energy \u2014or wind power\u2014is the process by which wind turbines convert the kinetic (motion) energy in wind into mechanical power or into electricity. The wind turbine captures the wind in its blades (or rotor) and converts the wind energy to rotational o r mechanical energy. The rotor drives an attached shaft, gearbox , and generator to produce electrical energy. Wind turbines can be used to produce electricity for a single home or building, or they can be connected to an electricity grid for more widespread electricity distribution to multiple homes and buildings. A wind turbine produces alternating current (AC) , which must be converted into direct current (DC) and then back into AC to add consistency to the energy produced. Output from a wind turbine is always changing, since the wind is not constant. Wind speed is very important to the output of a turbine. A doubling (2X) of the wind speed will increase output eight -fold (8X). Newer technologies are making the extraction of wind energy much more efficient and allow for energy production at lower wind speeds. W ind power is not a new technology. In various areas of the world, harnassing the energy of the wind for tasks such as pumping water and grinding grain has existed since before 200 B.C. ; and settlers brought windmill technology to the United States in the late 1800s to pump water for farms and ranches and, later, to generate electricity for homes and industry.1 Across the world, i ndustrialization led to a gradual decline in the use of windmills, but interest in th is technology has always risen and waned in re sponse to the price of fossil fuels. Current growing interest is related to the high cost of fossil fuels, concern about the unsustainability of using finite non -renewable fossil fuel sources, and mounting concerns about the significant environmental impact of the carbon emissions associated with these fossil fuel re sources. I n contrast to fossil fuels, wind power produces no environmental pollutants; is a sustainable, renewable energy -generating resource; and the wind, itself, is free. In addition, the use of w ind power is also growing as a result of technology improvements, cost reductions , laws, and incentives. According to a U. S. Department of Energy report,2 the U.S. wind power market surged in 2007 \u2014with 5,329 MW of new capacity added and $9B invested in wind project installations , for a cumulative total of nearly $28 B since the 1980s. The Union of Concerned Scientists,3 reported that the use of wind power across the world grew at an average annual rate of 32 percent between 1998 and 2002 , and reported that the 2 IV.2.s U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) \"Wind Powering America\" initiative has set a goal of producing five per cent of the nation's electricity from wind by 2020. T he New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ( NYSERDA) has supported the construction and operation of 41.5 megawatts (MW) of wind energy in New York State . NYSERDA currently supports extensive wind resource development and prospecting efforts to identify promising new sites for wind development. These projects could result in the development of over 425 MW of wind energy, having the potential to satisfy increasing consumer demand for green energy and various green energy purchase mandates in neighboring states.

W ind energy reduces reliance on foreign petroleum and other fossil fuels. W ind turbines do not produce air or water pollution and require very little disturbance of land or soil. M odern wind turbines are very quiet and can be located within 300 feet of residential structures. T he footprint of a wind turbine is fairly small and the unit is compatible with mixed land use, such as grazing or agricultural (crops can be grown right up to immediate proximity of a turbine, and turbines can be located within grazing areas \u2014with little impact on crops or stock). A gricultural and residential wind turbines can be located in remote areas where connecting to the utility grid may be too excessive or impossible. W ind power is a growth industry, stimulating economic development and jo b o pportunities. 3 IV.2.s W ind turbines have been successfully used in rural, suburban, and urban areas. A commercial wind farm can increase a municipality's tax base, offsetti ng re sidents' tax bills. Fo r consumers: Provide s a cleaner, healthier living environment for residents. R educed housing costs: Wind power has increasing potential for reduci ng h ousing costs \u2014making homeownership and rental charges affordable for more people, thereby supporting their ability to remain living in the community. While some reports indicate that the cost of building turbines increased recently, increasi ng numbers of agencies and reports indicate that the cost of wind powe r c ontinues to decrease and will shortly become competitive with conventional sources of energy -generation; f or example, s ee: Eu ropean Wind Energ Association, \" energy keeps electric rates affordable\": http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/factsheets/upload/Consumer- Benefits -Fact-Sheet.pdf .

T hrough lease agreements, wind turbines provide a potential seco nd i ncome for landowners and farmers. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Environmental aspects of wind technology have an impact on market and community acceptability : Aesthetics: While many people think the modern designs of wind turbines are elegant, many others feel they present an aesthetic blight on the landscape. Noise: Residents often object to the noise generated by wind turbines. While wind turbines are not silent, they are not excessively loud \u2014producing sounds that are typical to a rural environment. However, advancing technology continues to reduce, and may even eliminate, any noise from wind turbines. 4 IV.2.s In many areas, wind strength is too low to economically support the installation of a wind turbine . However, newer technologies are creating wind turbines that efficiently generate power at lower wind strengths than were traditionally required . Too much wind is a s bad as not enough. E xcessive wind can damage the gearbox \u2014reducing a turbine 's output or completely stopping a turbine in high - wind conditions. The installation of wind systems can involve the use of heavy equipment , which can cause temporary negative impacts to the area near the installation. C ontrol of erosion around a site must be mitigated. Wind speed is critical to the viability of a wind turbine, and taller towers may be necessary to achieve the necessary wind resource . However, a l ocal municipality may not allow the installation of tall towers (typically considere d greater than 80 feet tall), or may require getting a variance f rom a local law. There is a big difference between a large wind project and a small wind project (number of turbines, land space occupied, noise, geographic location, site location ); however, laws created to restrict th e development of large wind farms often catch small wind projects in the same net, including a single turbine fo r a s ingle resid ence. Migratory birds and bats may collide with rotor blades. Shadow flicker is created when rotor blades cast a moving shadow over nearbywindows during daylight. New York State has great wind- power potential in the Adirondacks and Catskill Mountains, but lacks access to transmission lines. R esource \u2014examples: Alfred State College Farm , Alfred, New York \u2014a 10 kW turbine on a 100' guyed lattice tower was installed to produce energy for the milking barn and to allo w s tudents to monitor power production.

The first is to liv e in a home that does not use any energy \u2014unfortunately, this means not having electricity, heat, or hot water. This does not sound like a home anyone would want to live in. Now i magine living in a home that contains all the modern amenities, but there is still no utility bill \u2014such a home would need to generate all of the power it needs to operate through a \" zero-net-energy \" approach. Z ero-net-site-energy homes typically use electricity to heat the air and water of the home \u2014no use of gas or oil needs to be considered. In such a home, the amount of energy provided by on -site renewable energy sources (for example, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal) is equal to the amount of energy used by the home . These homes are connected to the electric grid and may draw electric power when needed, but will also give back to the grid when producing more than the home needs. By definition, the amount of electricity put back into the grid must equal the amount used from the grid . T wo major trends are resulting in zero -net-energy homes becoming more and more of a reality: (1) The progress of new construction technologies and techniques, as well as the commercialization of advanced renewable/sustainable technologies ; and (2 ) t he development of z ero-net-energy home projects throughout the world, providing academic researchers and public policy designers with great insight intothe most effective and least costly paths to achieving their goals. A lthough this section focuses on zero -net-energy residential homes , this approach is beneficial for a variety of buildings, which is evident in the several definitions of what a zero -net-energy approach means in practice. Below are brief descriptions of some of t he nuances of this co ncept: Net-z ero-site-energy use \u2014 This describes a home or other type of building in which the amount of energy provided by on- site renewable energy sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building. Net-z ero-energy emiss ions\u2014 Outside the United States and Canada, a zero-net-energy home is generally defined as one with zero -net-energy emissions \u2014also known as a zero -carbon building or a zero-emissions building . This definition also considers the carbon emissions generated from on -site or off -site fossil fuel use s, which need to be balanced by the 2 IV.2.t amount of on -site renewable energy production. In addition to consider ing the carbon emissions generated by the building while in use, true net -zero-energy - emissions homes also c onsider the emissions generated during the construction of the building, as well as the energy required to make the building materials for the structure. Over the life of the home, the clean on -site energy produced must make up for these other emissions. Homes that use natural gas or some other fossil fuel to heat its air and water must consider the emissions from combusting these materials and make up for it through clean energy generation. Off -the-grid\u2014 Off-the-grid buildings are stand- alone zero-net-energy homes that are not connected to an off -site energy generation facility. They require distributed renewable energy generation and energy storage capability (for when the sun is not shining, the wind is not blowing, etc .). These homes are the most d ifficult to design and construct and are also more costly than grid-connected homes. True off -the- grid homes require great dedication from their owners. I n the United States, the concept and general definition of net-zero-energy homes is understood to be the point where all electricity demands from the home are met through on -site renewable power generation. Great care is taken through advanced building techniques to decrease the power- demand of the homes, while not sacrificing functionality or comfort. Items that need to be combined for a successful zero -net-energy home include: Passive solar designs Adv anced insulation and air sealing t echniques Ene rgy-efficient appliances and lighting Hig h-efficiency heating, cooling , and hot water systems R enewable power generation through wind, solar, or biomass N et metering with the utility Co nsumer educatio n On-s ite power generation is the most costly and unreliable portion of the zero- net- energy home. Because of t his, it is advantageous to design a home so that it does not require excessive amounts of electricity in the first place. A highly eff icient home is much easier to make zero-net- energy. As more research occurs and more demonstration projects are undertaken, the process for achieving this goal will become clearer. T he final part of the process is the consumer. A house is only as efficient as the people operating it. Human activities , such as washing clothes in cold water, using 3 IV.2.t clothes lines, turning off lights when not in use, taking faster showers, and reading instead of watching television, all combine to greatly decrease energy demands. Ben efits: For homeowners and building owners: Year- round reduced or zero energy bills . Off-the-grid houses and buildings are not susceptible to black -outs, brown- outs, or power failures. Healthier living environment because of decreased or no emissions. As the use of this concept expands \u2014bringing installation and service costs down\u2014the health benefits and reduced operating costs will help make homeownership and rental more affordable \u2014supporting the ability of residents to continue living in the community. For communities:Decreased load on the electricity distribution infrastructure (electric grid). Reliable, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Decreased emissions from power generation plants due to decreased demand provide environmental benefits . Reduced operating cost s support business es. State and Federal p rograms to help in construction. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: This concept is new, so technologies and market penetration have not yet reached a sufficient level to (1) reduce large up- front costs and service costs, and (2) engender a network of service providers to accommodate break -downs in the technology. Not all utilities are set up to handle net- metering; where net -metering is no t available, users do not have the option of selling energy back to offset times of drawing from the grid. Homes must use electricity (instead of fossil fuels) as a source of air heat and hot water, or else they have to offset those energy draws with increased electricity generation. Offsetting the fossil fuel energy draws is typically difficult to achieve. Local municipalities may not allow the installation of tall towers for wind po wer or photovoltaic cells on building roofs. There are common misconceptions about renewable power and zero -net-energy homes \u2014for example, m any erroneously feel that modern comforts must be sacrificed \u2014which decreas e market acceptance. Building construction techniques, renewable technologies, and workforc e i nfrastructure are still young, decreasing their availability and affecting the cost- effectiveness of completing homes.4 IV.2.t Resource \u2014examples : United States: In the United States, zero -net-energy building research is currently (2010) being supported by the U.

There is a focus on increasing the efficiency of energy, water use, and materials resources , as well as on reducing negative human health impacts throughout a building's life cycle. Green building is often called sustainable buil ding because its practices make use of ecosystems and their resources in a way that meets the current needs of people and communities without compromising the needs and options of future generations. A cross the country, the trend of incorporating green principles in houses and communities is growing. The U . S. Green Building Council ,1 a national trade association established in 1993, held its first national convention in 2002 with just a few hundred people in attendance. In the fall of 2008, there were nearly 30,000 in attendance from all over the world. In t he opening plenary , Bishop Desmond Tutu told attendees that we \"are a remarkable people\" and can do what we need to do if we set our minds and hearts to it; and the final plenary included a statement from E. O. Wilson, eminent biologist: \"We will either settle down, achieve sustainability and do it right , or completely wreck the planet. \" This conference reflected a growing movement to create more healthy living environments through building greener homes, buildings, and communities. A s the movement has mature d, the earlier perception that \"greening\" is about sacrifice has evolved into an awareness that it is really about excellence and appropriateness . This evolution reflects a greater understanding that all elements of our living environment have an impact on the health and well -being of people and their surroundings. At all levels of society \u2014national, state, and local \u2014many aspects and issues have emerged to compel this movement t o \"build green\"\u2014for example, the responsibilities associated with environmental stewardship; the impact of the environment on health and productivity ; the future status of non - renewable energy resources; the economic potential of green building, including new products and local jobs for services, manufacturing, and renewable energy production; and the willingness to redefine growth beyo nd conventional definitions. F ollowing are examples of real -world situations that are driving the global development of green building expertise as a means of sustaining the health and well-being of both the planet and its residents . 2 IV.3.a Plan etary Health: There are many aspects of the living environment that can be positively influence d by a more respectful, sustainable use of our planet and its resources ; for example: Water\u2014 The Earth's supply of potable water is limited . According to the U. S. Department of the Interior,2 only three per cent of the Earth's total water is non- saline freshwater (two per cent locked up in glaciers and icec aps and one per c ent available as surface and ground water) . Practice s that use potable wate r f or throw- away systems ( such as toilet flushing) are a questionable use of a critical ly limited resource. According to the Water Research Foundation, daily indoor per- person water use in the U nited States is 69.3 gallons,3 about twice the per- person use in Europe. Air\u2014 Every place on the planet is interconnected , and harmful substance s e mitted in any one country will come to the others , affecting people and re gions well beyond the point of origin. Reducing or avoiding those emissions benefits all people; in addition, innovative development can strive to identify a healthful use for those \"waste\" products. S oil\u2014 Various actions can have significant unintended impacts on the sustainable quality of the earth's soil, and these impacts are often no t re cognized or not taken into account. For example, remov ing older- growth tre es and brush that replenish the soil with their leavings, destroy s soil. Or, when outmode d farming methods or climate changes deplete the soil's nutri ents, it becomes harder or impossible to obtain healthful food from the earth. Other actions, such as building roads, dumping waste , logging, re - routing waterways, and aerial spraying affect the quality of the soil on a long - term basis . D iversity of species \u2014 Many species of plants and animals have become extinct and others are endangered\u2014due to several reasons, including the increasin g s prawl of humans, a general unawareness of or indifference to these plants and a nimals , and a lack of knowledge of the critical role that variety in plants and animals plays in sustaining the environment and the critical balance of nature . I n many ways , true (closed) cycles (which encourage creation of diversity in some species to balance a loss in others) are declining because of activities and be haviors; for example, farming systems in the United States encourage huge farms of single crops , together with engineering to make one crop variation dominant . H ealth and P erformance of P eople: Environment -related decisions \u2014both unintended and calculated \u2014have direct, often long-lasting impacts on health and well -being; for example: People spend an average of 90 per cent of their days and nights in their homes and public buildings; but the materials used for construction and for furnishings are often toxic , sometimes intentionally planned to achieve a laudable purpose. For example, electronics and clothing are produced with fire retardants to 3 IV.3.a protect us ers from fire , but with the knowledge that those substance s can increase the risk of cancer or endocrine disruption. C oal miners and workers in other hazardous jobs are exposed to health hazards that are unsupportable. W hile tens of thousands of chemicals have be en created, b asic toxicity information is publicly available for only 43 per cent of HPV4 chemicals and ful l in formation on toxicity is publicly available for only seven per cent.5 I ncreasing incidence of m any health conditions have been associated, to one degree or another, with environmental toxicity, including lung disorders, contact illnesses, bioaccumulation of toxins, and poor performance ; for example : According to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology,6 an e stimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma; 250,000 annual deaths are attributed to the disease; workplace conditions, such as exposure to fumes, gases, or dust, are responsible for 11 per cent of asthma cases worldwide; and about 70 per cent of asthmatics also have allergies. Theprevalence of asthma increased 75 per cent between 1980 and 1994, and asthma rates in children under the age of five increased more than 160 per ce nt duri ng that time period. E czema, various skin disorders, and other allergy -related sensitivities have increased.7 N early 16 per cent of women of childbearing age have mercury levels above what is considered safe.8 B uildings with little or no natural daylight have resulted in eye strain , de pression, and decreased productivity. Children in schools that were well -lit with natural light were found to do better academically.9 Poor air quality can cause migraine headaches, dizziness, lack of focus on tasks at hand, and c an e ven potentially cause heart strain. Nationwide, the number of children in special education programs with learning disabilities increased 191 per cent between 1977 and 1994.10 E conomics: Green buildings, even those that use the LEED11 rating system , do not need to cost more than \"conventional\" buildings to construct ; for example : The use of passive solar gain, controlled day -lighting, and cross -ventilating breezes are natural systems that have their basis in things that are free, giving a building an economic leg -up on operational costs. Bui lders can choose to work with the landscape in which the building is situated. Common green areas with indigenous plantings can reduce chemical -use, a s we ll as the energy and money spent on lawn care. 4 IV.3.a When green -building adds to initial construction costs, this can be viewed within the overall costs of operating and maintaining the building over the long term. Green buildings are typically built better, with more durable materials and more efficient products ; thus , they last longer, perform significantly better in monthly operati ng costs, and recoup any initial additional costs in a reasonable period of time. However, decisions can be difficult to make when considering only the initial construction- cost feasibility. For example, if a project is green (no toxins, much recycled content, materials made locally )\u2014in response to the homeowner's heightened sensitivities to chemicals or to a mission directive to support local businesses\u2014but costs 20 per cent more , tough choices have to be made to accommodate the additional project co st within the established budget. T he three topics above illustrate Triple Bottom Line (TBL) thinking, where each decision is weighed against the benefit or cost to the people affected, to the planet we all inhabit, and to the bottom line of the organization, individual , or community. Employing TBL considerations in each decision can result in a stable and reasonable understanding of the long-term success of a project. T he general movement in green design and planning relates to the TBL approach and employs Integrative Design\u2014pulling the concerned parties into the mix early and working very hard to understand the needs, prioritize the goals, and design with long -term benefits in mi nd\u2014while balancing the budget, schedule , and program. While such an approach sounds complex, it quickly becomes a less linear, more comprehensive approach to design and planning, resulting in projects that involve fewer change s in construction because more questions are asked and answered early on . . . all opportunities for discussion and benefits are brought up earlier . . . and more, creative alternatives are considered . Two example s can illustrate this : No longer is the engineer brought in once a building's \"architecture\" is se t and t he engineer then plug s in standard one -size, one-type systems to heat and cool the building. Instead, there is greater understanding that s uch systems affec t the design, and the design should support the parameters and potential of the systems used by the engineer . If a bu ilding is disturb ing the portion of the site that is near the road, consideration can be given to adding sidewalks for the community and water- retention to keep local streams cleaner . Keeping other pieces of the TBL equation in mind , how could the cost of this alternative solution be addressed ? Pe rhaps the city will reduce taxes on the project because the sponsor is engaging the town and supporting its infrastructure beyond the code requirements , and that tax break will make the sidewalk an affordable projec t c ost. Or, an alternative suggestion might be to use permeable concrete for the sidewalks , reducing or eliminating the need for a water- retention system. Or, perhaps a trade can be made with a neighbor\u2014the project includes the sidewalk, but the neighbor agrees to mai ntain it. Following an Integrative Desi gn appro ach, discussion s such as th ese allow the project an opportunity to become a positive choice for the people, the community, and the planet . 5 IV.3.a W hile an Integrative Design process is often not easy , national organizations are moving forward to support its adoption. The National Charrette Institute12 specializes in training people to manage the large -scale and long-term planning sessions that must be employed for community projects ; the American Institute of Architects13 promotes this approach and is educating its professionals in this communication skill ; and the United State s Green Building Council (USGBC)14 is striving to create rating systems to measure successful application of the process and case studies to inspire users. These three organizations are leaders in understanding sustainability in des ign and construction and are excellent resources for community planning, green building design, and the tools and processes to achieve green building and s ustainabi lity goals. In clusive , integrative planning and design, and using a TBL approach, is applicable to any project, be it a neighborhood feasibility study, retirement housing, adaptations to local zoning, a community center project, changes to town infrastructure, or a new kiosk in the town center. For any project, the end result is a more universally accepted, understood, and supported project througho ut its design, construction , and implementation . Initial construction and long -term maintenance and operation costs are understood; more people are on board and will work to ensure the success of the project; more people feel that their concerns are addressed and understood; s uccess is more certain; the triple bottom line is clearly understood; and the project works to sustain the health, comfort , and safety of the people and the wider community.

Petersburgh, NY Tracie Hall, Executive Director U.S. Green Building Council, New York Upstate Chapter Syracuse, NY L EED\u00ae D escription: The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) G reen Building rating System is a nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high- performance, healthy, sustainable, energy -efficient buildings. Developed in 1999 by the U. S. Green Building Council, LEED is voluntary, point- based certification system that measures and certifies how well a building performs as a green building. L EED promotes a whole -building approach to sustainability by recognizing performance in five key areas of human and environmental health: Sustainable Site Development: LEED encourages selecting sites that are close to community resources, maximizing quality of life and reducing time and energy expended in travel. LEED buildings avoid destructive construction practices and have landscapin g and o ther elements that protect the building site. Water Conservation: LEED buildings use innovative strategies to reduce a building's wate r c onsumption and to find creative ways to recycle/reuse water. Energy Efficiency: LEED buildings use 20 -60 per cent less energy than buildings built to curre nt co des. Less energy means lower utility bills every month for the life of the building. Materials and Resources Selection:LEED buildings use locally produced, recycled, reclaimed, and responsibly obtained materials as much as possibl e. Indoor Environmental Quality: LEED buildings are designed to maximize replenished fresh air and minimize exposure to toxins and pollutants. T he level of performance achieved in the above categories is separated into four performance tiers: Certified, Silver, Gold , and Platinum , based on the number of points the project achieves in the rating system. A LEED Accredited Professional (LEED AP) can assist in determining the most practical level of LEED certification, as applicable to a particular project and budget parameters. L EED certification in new construction and renovation is growing nationwide among all types of structures, including private homes, multiunit rental housing , schools, 2 IV.3.b health care facilities, commercial buildings, and corporate offices. Residents, building occupants, workers, and investors seek the health, productivity, and financial benefits of creating green, healthy living environments. For example, according to the U. S. Green Bu ilding Council, g reen schools cost less to o perate, freeing up resources to improve students' education; t heir carefully planned acoustics and abundant daylight make it easier and more comfortable for students to learn; t heir clean indoor air cuts down sick days and gives children a head start for a healthy, prosperous future ; and their innovative design provides a wealth of hands -on learning opportunities. U SGBC recently teamed with the Congress for New Urbanism and Smart Growth America to create LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED -ND). LEED -ND emphasizes Smart Growth planning and zoning principles in a larger, co9mmunity context. Ben efits: For architects, developers, builders, and o wners : LEED is a checklist used to set targets and track progress during the design and construction of a gre en building. F or homebuyers: LEED is a scorecard \u2014like a nutrition label\u2014that gives a clear, concise picture of all the ways a green home performs at a higher level. F or residents : LEED is a seal of quality, third -party verification providing peace of mind that they are living in a truly healthy, efficient home environment. F or older people and families (especially relevant to those on fixed incomes) : a LE ED building is assurance of continued long -term reduced utility costs, and a he althy indoor li ving environment. F or the wider c ommunity: a LEED building means reduced long- and short- term impacts on the local environment, reduced emissions, reduced burdens on the local infrastructure, reduced pollutants, and a reduced carbon footprint. A lthough LEED building characteristics/priorities will vary with geographic are a and building type, the LEED process accommodates these variations, with the end result of a sustainable green building being just as viable in any location. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Impediments to implementation of LEED -certified buildings include lack of public awareness , and misconceptions about the additional up- front development and construction costs of LEED buildings vs. payback benefits : Public Awareness:Although LEED has been around for some ten years, it is only in the past fe w y ears (due in part to widely fluctuating oil prices, economic conditions, and increasing awareness of climate change ) that we have seen the LEED movement slow ly gain traction. As more LEED buildings are developed, and 3 IV.3.b with continued information- dissemination such as this document, this impediment becomes minimized. Added Costs of LEED Buildings: Although there are some added development and construction cost s as sociated with LEED buildings (typically 3 -10 per cent), because of th e re duced operating costs and increased efficiency of a LEED building (typically 30-70 per cent), the payback, including reduced utility costs, increase d re sale value, increased marketability, etc., more than offsets the increase d u p-front costs. The desired level of LEED certification also has a direc t i mpact on the added costs; i.e., a building certified at the lowest LEED level will cost less than a LEED platinum -level certific ation, although there will be a corresponding difference in the level of efficiency.

C. Glens Falls, NY I NTEGRATIVE DESIGN: INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY D escription: When designing, constructing , and maintaining a building, it is important to take a holistic view of how people interact with the building and how the building itself affects the occupants. There are elements in a building that can be uplifting and there are elements that can be toxic. Steps can be taken to make sure that the building is a safe and healthy place for people of all ages. A s we design, build , and maintain housing for families, multiunit senior housing , care facilities, or housing for people of all ages with disabilities, the building s themselves should not make the residents ill. Elements within a building can lead to what is called Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) \u2014a condition where an occupant's comfort and health are negatively affected by the building systems, materials, or both. Symptoms can range from sensitivity to odors to dizziness, headaches, and nausea. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, SBS can be caused by inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, or biological contaminant s, to name a few. Identifying and eliminating the source of the pollutants can solve most of these issues. O n the other hand, there are elements in a building that can have a positive impact on its users, by improving morale , health, and productivity. For example, p roviding natural day lighting and views to the outdoors has a beneficial effect on building occupants , and can decrease electricity load. Using light color paint can help decrease the lighting load , but can also help people who have difficulty seeing in low light. There are many opportunities to create a synergy between green building and universal design \u2014everything from reducing water use to allowing individuals to control their own thermostats\u2014which can be seen as opportunities to preserve the environment as well as make someone's life more comfortable. A s we learn more about how people are affected by certain chemicals and other external factors, it is important to keep the following factors in mind when making decisions about building de sign: I AQ (Indoor Air Quality) during construction: During construction, keep all new ductwork sealed and safely stored. To protect from mold growth, protect all stored or installed materials from absorbing moisture. F lush out: After the completion of any project but before occupation, set all the ventilation systems to run at full capacity for several days. At the end of the 2 IV.3.c several days, replace all of the filters. This will help remove potential smells, dust, and air- borne toxins left from construction and new finishes. I nsulation: Using blown -in insulation can greatly reduce energy consumption, but it also helps with noise pollution, especially for those with hearing issues. Insulating between rooms is also important where individual spaces have their own temperature controls. I ndividual controls : Allowing individuals to adjust the temperature of their own localized areas helps reduce the need to heat all spaces at once. It also helps with an occupant's sense of comfort and autonomy. A dequate ventilation: Design the Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system to provide adequate fresh air ventilation to all regularly occupied spaces. H VAC: Specify energy -efficient Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning systems (HVAC), with ducts that are insulated and sound- attenuated. Insulated duct systems reduce the vent noise that can create problems for those with hearing loss. A ir intake : By making sure that air filters are regularly cleaned, and by locating air intake vents away from cars and other motorized vehicles , smokers, trash receptacles, and other noxious sources, fewer pollutants will enter the building. F resh air: Installing a mechanical system that increases air circulation and makes most windows operable allows stagnant air to leave and permits fresh air to enter. I ndoor pollutants : When specifying building and finishing materials, choose products that do not off -gas toxins. Specify materials that do not contain urea formaldehyde, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). W alk-off mats : Much of the dust in a building comes in on the soles of our feet. By providing walk -off mats at all regularly used entrances, dust can be collected before it enters the building. Be sure to clean the walk -off mats on a weekly basis. C leaning products : Using nontoxic cleaning products and storing them away from residents helps with indoor air quality. Create a storage room that has a continuous vent directly to the outdoors. C arbon dioxide sensors : Install carbon dioxide sensors for the health and safety of the occupants. S moke free building: Institute a policy forbidding smoking inside the building to prevent issues caused by second -hand smoke. Locate a designated smoking area outdoors away from operable windows, doors , or fresh- air intakes. L ighting: Replace old light bulbs with more efficient fluorescent and compact fluorescent bulbs, which are more energy -efficient and have a better color range. 3 IV.3.c Design the lighting to accommodate low- vision difficulties by sizing the light fixture correctly and us ing up-lighting techniques. O ccupant Sensors: Occupant sensors on the market today are more sophisticated than their predecessors. They are more energy -efficient because the lights turn on only when some one enters a space, and they turn off if no motion or sound is made for a c ertain period of time. F enestration: The use of natural day lighting can help those with light- vision difficulties and can help with the overall health and wellbeing of the residents. It is imperative that glare be minimized. Wi ndow type : Use casement windows instead of double -hung windows. Casement windows allow for greater ventilation and egress. In addition, casement windows are opened with a single handle , making them easier to open. W ater efficiency : Installing water faucets with sensors helps reduce the amount of water consumption by portioning the amount of water that is provided. Water faucets with sensors are also a good universal design feature because everyone can operate them. F ront load washers: Front-load washers reduce the amount water and energy it takes to wash a load of laundry. In addition, front- load washers are easier to use by individuals using a wheelchair. M onitoring: Staff in facilities and multiunit ho using, a s well as residents in single family homes, should continuously monitor the indoor environment to make sure that systems are functioning as originally intended. Ben efits: Residents' well -being and quality of life are improved: Residents' physical and mental health are not adversely affected by theelements of their living environment. Incidence s of specific chronic illnesses, such as asthma , chronic fatigue, migraine headaches, allergies, and others are reduced. Productivity by children and adults of all ages is improved . E nvironmental elements that support the ability of residents to see and hear well allow both older people and younger- aged people with vision and hearing loss to retain a sense of competency and autonomy, two traits that are associated wi th e motional, mental, and physical health status. Env ironmental elements , such as individual- room-based temperature adjustment, support an individual's sense of control over his living environment. Perceived personal control over one's daily life is a major factor associated wi th m ental and emotional health status .4 IV.3.c In a time of limited and costly resources, water and energy are conserve d and us ed more efficiently . W hen indoor environmental quality standards are integrated into a building's design from the outset, many benefits are realized with little or no increases i n c onstruction and maintenance costs. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Many builders, home owners, and facility operators are unaware of : The impact of env ironmental factors on the health, safety , and mental and physical well -being of residents. The impact that the quality of the living environment has on costs to the health care system, the educational system, and the work place . M any builders, homeowners, and facility operators are not knowledgeable about specific ways or tactics to improve the quality of the living environment, or of the availability of specific appliances, equipment, building materials, furnishings,products, etc., that can replace traditionally used methods and items. R etrofitting a building or home to improve environmental quality, such as adding new windows or upgrading a mechanical system, can be costly. During times ofeconomic hardship, even though the pay -off in health and safety is great, homeowners or facility operators may find themselves unable to argue fo r i ncurring the added tangible cost.

Minnery, AIA, NCARBSenior Principal Saratoga Associates Landscape Architects, Architects, Engineers, and Planners, P.C. 443 BroadwaySaratoga Springs, New York 12866(518) DESIGN: GREEN BUILDING D escription: Green building, also known as sustainable design, is the practice of safely fulfilling the needs of today's generation without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. Across the country, today's youths, our families, and the new crop of senior citizens are much more environmentally conscious compared to previous generations; and all are increasingly aware of the interactive impact of environmental elements. Declining na tural resources, health factors, and volatile economic conditions have converged to sustain an interest in green design. From regional transportation, to cleaning products , to housing, green design is a growing trend that has touched all aspects of our da ily lives. H ousing alternatives for older people, for families , and for people with disabilities ; health care facilities ; commercial structures; and public buildings can benefit greatly from green building techniques. The demand for buildings that are environmentally sensitive and healthy for their inhabitants will naturally increase as the emphasis on green, sustainable design grows. Several organizations have created rating systems to implement and evaluate the green building process. The most prestigious is the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification. Projects that are LEED certified must achieve a set number of points based on six topics: sustainable sites, w ater efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovations and design process. T he New York State Department of State continuously adjusts the State's building code to incorporate new findings on subject s such as energy use, water efficiency, indoor air quality , fire prevention, factory -manufactured buil dings, and the removal of toxic materials. O rganizations, such as the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), can provide technical and financial assistance for green building design and construction. F rom heating bills to food costs, the fluctuation of energy prices affects all aspects of our lives, and a major goal is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels without significantly decreasing our standard of living. By increasing the energy efficiency of a building and reducing demand, we can create comfortable places for people of all ages. S ome s teps for creating a more environmentally sensible and energy - efficient building include: S ite planning : Reuse of building : Reusing an existing building, rather than constructing a new o ne, saves natural resources and energy. B uilding location: Not locating the building in a wetland, an endangered habitat, or on prime farmland can help preserve natural features for future generations.2 IV.3.d S olar orientation: Orienting the building in the East- West direction allows the building design to take advantage of full southern sun and provides the opportunity for passive solar heating and cooling. V egetation: Specifying native species and drought- resistant plants allows the site to be a habitat for animals , while reducing the amount of water and pesticides typically needed. T rees: Planting native deciduous trees around the property allows sun to penetrate into the building in the winter and provide shade in the summer,offsetting energy costs. Coniferous trees on the west side of the building block winter winds. W ater: Installing silt fences and restrictions on the use of pesticides prevent the contamination of the local drinking water. Decisions made during constructio n and the grounds -maintenance policy should take the local water quality into consideration. M aterials : Regional materials: Choosing building and finish materials that are harvested and/or manufactured locally saves on energy for transportation and helps the local economy. Local materials that are aesthetically pleasing can create a \" sense of place.\" S ustainable harvest: Forests that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) are sustainably managed to conserve animal habitat, reduce stormwater contamination, and preserve logging traditions. R apidly renewable products: Specifying building materials that are rapidly renewable, such as bamboo and cork, decreases the need to consume old - growth forests. R ecycled Content: Specifying building materials with recycled conte nt c ompletes the cycle and extends the life of a product; i f recyclable materials are not reused, most will be sent to the landfill. E nergy : Overhangs : By using sunshades or overhang s, the sun can be used to heat the building in the wintertime and shade the building in the summer time. F enestration (the design and placement of windows in a building) : Placing high - performance windows in the right locations can greatly reduce energy consumption and help individuals who have vision difficulties in areas with low- light. I nsulation: Using high -performance , blown -in foam insulation reduces energy consumption.3 IV.3.d H VAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) : Specify an energy -efficie nt H VAC system. Make sure the ducts are insulated and that the filters are changed regularly. Consider a radiant floor system that, if used properly, is more efficient and can aid with indoor air quality. Energy star ceiling fans effective ly reduce air -conditioning use and increase air circulation. L ighting: Replace old light bulbs with more -efficient fluorescent and compac t f luorescent bulbs. Fluorescent bulbs also have a better color range fo r in dividuals with poor vision. Design the lighting to accommodate low -vision difficulties by sizing the light fixture correctly and us ing up-lighting techniques to avoid glare. E nergy Star: Energy cost can be greatly reduced if all appliances are E nergy Star\u00a9 rated. I ndividual controls : Allowing individu als to adjust the temperature in their o wn e nvironments help s reduce the need to heat all spaces at once, and helps wi th t he occupants' sense of comfort. R enewable energy : On-site renewable energy sources , such as photovoltaic (solar) panels and small wi nd turbines , can provide continuous energy. The use of ground source heat pumps, which adjust indoor ambient temperature by using the constant ground temperature, are also energy -efficient technologies. W aste: Construction and demolition waste : By reduc ing, reusing , and recycli ng c onstruction and demolition waste, fewer natural resources are extracted from the earth and fewer materials go to the landfill. R ecycling location: Locating recycling bins in a convenient location within the building increase s the practice of recycling by residents. Ben efits: Recycling and re -using materials and products reduce waste and reduce the use of land -fills. O ver the long run, sustainable building practices are economically beneficial , s aving energy costs, utility costs, and rehabilitation costs. Gre en, sustainable practices \u2014 Conserve the use of limited , costly, non -renewable natural resources , such a s o il and gas . Conserve the use of the world's increasingly limited amount of potable water. Maximize the use of renewable natural resources, such as wind, sun, and n on-potable water. Preserve natural (increasingly endangered) plant and wildlife. Reduce the use of pesticides and other contamina nts and pollutants .4 IV.3.d Improve the health and well -being of residents in homes and workers and s taff in the workplace, which, in turn, has a positive impact on costs associated with the health care system. S tate and federal government agencies provide technical assistance, grants, and tax credits to offset the initial cost of employin g green building products, materials, and techniques. I mpediments or barriers to development or implementation: Many builders, developers, and homeowners are unfamiliar with available gree n bui lding products, materials, and technologies, which can lead to imprope r i nstallation and use , user frustration, or a resulting contrary effect. Taking the time to understand the issues, asking questions , and having patience will rectify most issues. In the end, asking if a particular product is harmful to a resident's health or has any other consequences is the quickest way to understand its environmental impact. F or some materials or products, there may be an increase in upfro nt c onstruction cost to incorporate green techniques into a project. While these wi ll be offset in the long run ( with energy savings and better health and s atisfaction for the building occupants ), short -term financial considerations ofte n wi n over a longer -term perspective.

Characteristics of this sustainable development include: U.S. Green Building Council LEED -NC, v.2/v.2.1 --Level: Certified . The g reen measures safeguard already fragile health of residents and buil d a f oundation for high- performance healing environments. The building is 48% more efficient than a building minimally compliant with ASHRAE 90.1 standards , due to a ground -source heat -pump system ; a tight, high-performance envelope; extensive day -lighting; and efficient products and equipment. A staggered, narrow building footprint and bold fenestration pattern allo w publ ic spaces the benefit of day -lighting during normal operating hours and re duces artificial lighting use. Structural shading devices and a reflective metal roof are expected to reduceheat gain and air conditioning demands during the summer. In selecting this site, the Center avoided prime agricultural land, optinginstead to infill on a previously abandoned industrial agricultural site. A5 IV.3.d bucolic pedestrian path system, open pasture, native plants, and farming fields occupy the sit e.
