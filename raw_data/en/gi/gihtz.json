Article in English | Web of Science | ID: covidwho-1560996 ABSTRACTEven after one and a half years since the outbreak of COVID-19, its complete and effective control is still far from being achieved despite [vaccination] [drives], symptomatic management with available [drugs], and wider lockdowns. has inspired [researchers]to screen potential [phytochemicals]from [medicinal plants]against [SARS-CoV-2], adopting a [bio-informatics]approach. The current study aimed to assess anti-viral activity of [drug]-likeness. The to [molecular docking]and only three showed promise Acetovanillonewith a binding affinity -4.7Kcal/mol with RdRp and -4.1 with Kcal/mol [analysis], [molecular dynamics simulations]and executed for two complexes, acetovanillone_RdRp and myrtenol_3CL pro.Acetovanillone_RdRpcomplex did not display any structural change after MD simulation as compared to myrtenol_3CL pro. The overall stability of acetovanillone_6NUR needed their [efficacy]in [biological models].
