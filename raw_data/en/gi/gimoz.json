Key facts - Immunisation protects children (and adults) against harmful infections before they come into contact with them in the community. - Your baby or child can get many vaccines for free under the Department of Health and Aged Care's National Immunisation Program. - New vaccines against serious illnesses continue to be developed, so your child may receive more vaccines than you did as a child. - Your child can be vaccinated at your doctor's clinic, an immunisation clinic, your local council by community child health nurses, and at some hospitals. - Most vaccine side effects are minor, and the risk of a serious side effect from a vaccine is far lower than the health risks of the disease itself. How does immunisation work? Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way to protect children against certain diseases. The serious health risks of these diseases are far greater than the very small risks of immunisation. Immunisation protects children (and adults) against harmful infections before they come into contact with them in the community. It uses your body's natural defence mechanism \u2014 your [immune system](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/immune-system) \u2014 to build resistance to specific infections. Most vaccines contain a weakened or dead version of the germ that causes the disease. Your immune system responds to the vaccine and creates antibodies that prevent a future infection. What is the difference between vaccination and immunisation? Vaccination is the term used for getting a vaccine \u2014 that is, getting the injection or taking an oral vaccine dose. Immunisation refers to the process of both getting the vaccine and becoming immune to the disease after vaccination.

Which vaccines are recommended for children in Australia?

The National Immunisation Program Schedule is available at the [Department of Health and Aged Care's website](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule). Why do children need so many vaccinations? Young children need vaccinations to protect them against some of the most serious childhood infectious diseases. Your child will need several vaccinations because new vaccines against serious infections continue to be developed. In some cases, several vaccines are combined into one injection. This reduces the number of injections your child will get.

Do vaccination needles hurt? Although needles are given quickly, getting vaccinations can be painful for your child.

Many children get minor side effects such as: - redness, soreness or swelling where the needle went in - mild [fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/fever-and-high-temperature-in-children) - being irritable or unsettled Side effects tend to be short-lasting.
