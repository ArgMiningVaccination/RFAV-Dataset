Before Beginning, Let's Review Principles of Subject Safety 3Monday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse Events 4 Adverse'event'means'any'untoward'medical'occurrence'associated'with'the'use'of'a'drug'in'humans,'whether'or'not'considered'drug'related.''21 CFR 312.32(a) Monday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse EventsICH E6 Section 1.2 5An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality or relationship to the drug. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Monday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse Events 6Indicates a change in the subject's health status 'since baseline' right before taking the study drug.When toxicity of the study drug is a hypothesis, you will see on the calendar, a baseline physical exam to be completed either at Day 0 or Day -5 prior to dosing. Monday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse Events 7Baseline would include all of the below:Pre-existing conditions that are ongoing during the clinical trial-Hypertension-DiabetesConcomitant medications taken prior to participation in the clinical trial-Anticoagulants to prevent thrombosis-Steroids for autoimmune conditionMonday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse Events 8Examples of Adverse Events which are not related to [or caused by] the study drug but if they occur while the subject is on study, would have to be collected, reviewed by PI and tracked:-Transfusion reactions-Accidental injuries-Surgery Monday, February 3, 14Definitions of Adverse Reaction 9A suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. 'Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and adverse event. Monday, February 3, 14Definition of a Serious Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction21 CFR 312.32 (a) 10An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"serious\" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.Monday, February 3, 14A \"Life Threatening Adverse Drug Experience\" Defined 11Any adverse experience that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would result in the patient's death. Examples include:hemorrhaging and internal bleeding with rapid drop in blood pressure; Loss of consciousness from increase in pressure on the brain Monday, February 3, 14Hospitalization Defined 12Admission to the hospital for longer than 24 hours or prolonga5on of a hospital stay due to adverse event. Monday, February 3, 14\"Disability\" Defined 13A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.Examples include: loss of speech; fatigue so great the subject cannot get out of bed at all; loss of memory; and paralysis. Monday, February 3, 14\"Congenital Anomaly\" Defined 14Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy resulting in an adverse outcome in the child.Thalidomide is the best exampleof a drug causing congenital anomalies with babies born with deformed arms and legs. Monday, February 3, 14Definition of a Serious Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 15One final outcome that makes an event or reaction serious: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.21 CFR 312.32 (a) Monday, February 3, 14Examples of Important Medical Events 16 Allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at homeBlood dyscrasiasConvulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, Development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Monday, February 3, 14What is Expected versus Unexpected when Defining Adverse Events or Suspected Adverse Reactions 17Expected toxicities from the study drug if found in the following:Safety information on approved products is reflected in product labeling (Package Insert)Up-to-date safety information on the products under investigation is found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB) From these sources the protocol and the informed consent is written to explain to describe what risks we currently expect from this study drug.Safety profile of other drugs in the same classUnexpected means that the event experienced by the subject is not listed in any of the documents above.Monday, February 3, 14Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event 18Unexpected: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"unexpected\" if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.21 CFR 312.32 (a) Monday, February 3, 14Examples of an Unexpected Adverse Event 19Hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidentsMonday, February 3, 14Definition of Severity vs. Serious 20Refers to the intensity of the event and can be used with any event, without regard to whether or not it meets the federal criteria for 'serious'....is expressed in 'grades' of severity.Responsibility of the principal investigator to concur with all intensity assessments added to the database for the events identified in the subject. Monday, February 3, 14Examples of Grading Severity/Intensity Ranges 21Grade 1: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; no intervention indicatedGrade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADLGrade 3: Severe; or medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADLGrade 4: Life-threatening ; urgent intervention indicated.Grade 5: Death related to an AEReferences: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Vaccines/ucm091977.pdfhttp://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdfMonday, February 3, 14Example of Future use of GradingAdverse Events during the Clinical Trial 22When a drug gets approved to be used in clinical practice, prescribing information will refer to the intensity grading scales to assist physicians managing patient care. For patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours or greater than or equal to Grade 3 diarrhea, withhold [drug name] until diarrhea resolves to Grade 1 or less, and resume [drug name] with appropriate dose reduction.Monday, February 3, 14IND Safety Reports 23All SAE reports sent from Site Principal Investigators to the Sponsor must be prepared as an 'IND Safety Report' and then tracked as sent to all of the other site investigators with the expectation both the PI and the IRB will review them.PI/CRC receives of safety report/letterPI determines need to:Update informed consentRisk/benefit analysis change to subjectsPI and CRC report to UCSF CHR, in a timely mannerFollow CHR requirementsKeep a log of IND Safety Report receipt date, event, date reported to CHR, informed consent updated (yes/no) for the sponsorFile in study files21 CFR Subpart B section 312.32(c)(1)IND safety reports . The sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator's IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible...Monday, February 3, 14ANSWER: During the course of the study, the CRC will find them in the Medical Record, Laboratory reports, Radiology reports, Surgical reports, Infusion Center nursing notes, subject diaries, subject surveys or questionnaires.Documentation of all adverse events should be written and signed by qualified clinicians in the subjects medical record which will serve as original source. This includes lab and radiology reports often need PI initials to show review.Non-serious and serious adverse eventsUnanticipated eventsReport all directly observed events (rash etc)Events elicited from the subjectEvents spontaneously volunteered by subjectLaboratory, EKG or other test results that meet protocol requirements for classification as adverse event 24Where are Adverse Events or Reac1ons Documented? Monday, February 3, 14Review data entry for adverse events and serious adverse events provided by the sponsor or investigator developed data entry. It will clue you in on what needs to be tracked.All adverse events and suspected adverse reactions are collected from 'source documentation' and the CRC abstracts the eventsDocumentation can be within UCSF medical records, but at times the CRC will also have to have the subject or family send outside source documentation. If you will have to request records on your own, you will need a HIPAA release form signed by the subject for the outside institution.Report all SAEs immediately to the Principal Investigator upon identification or notification from family.NOTIFY: MD/NP assigned to the study for 'subject's medical care' in the event the study drug needs to be stopped, per protocol. The CRC assists clinical staff to manage the subject. Certain drugs to treat the adverse event can be forbidden by the protocol....it is the CRCs role to know the protocol details to assist the clinicians. 25CRC Role in Adverse Event CollectionBest Practice Monday, February 3, 14Print AE Tracking Tool from DatabaseOncore and some sponsor databases allow print out of AEs entered, in a table format, so this can be reviewed by the Principal Investigator; then ideally signed or initialed by the PI as having reviewed causality, severity grades, description of the event. The CRC must collect and enter this safety data accurately but cannot take responsibility for assessing the events. 26Tips and Tricks Monday, February 3, 14Collecting Adverse EventsEvents that are NOT linked pathophysiologically, or temporarily, are reported as separate eventsExampleSubject is admitted to the hospital with Heart FailureSubject develops sepsis while in the hospital as a result of the venous catheter and this prolongs the hospitalization.Two SAEs for this subject: One for Heart Failure and one for Sepsis 27Tips and Tricks Monday, February 3, 14Process of converting investigators \"verbatim documentation\" terms to standardized \"Preferred Terms\" (PT)Standardization allows sorting of AEs and grouping of like events. PT used to calculate incidence of AE. Currently the most used coding dictionary is: MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) Is available in OnCore and many large pharmaceutical safety databases. 28Coding of Adverse Events Monday, February 3, 14Coding problems may lead to missing safety signals; can be a real challenge for the CRC and the monitor from the drug company will want to make sure that data entered is coded correctlyExamples: Splitting same AE among similar PTs-Hypertension, high blood pressure, etc. Lumping different terms to same PT-Leg edema, face edema, etc. Lack Metabolic syndrome, Serotonin syndrome 29Be Aware of the Need for Accurate Coding as you Abstract Clinician Dictation Monday, February 3, 14Takeaways...Documentation of the subject's baseline medical history, physical examination, medications and treatments is critical for evaluating the subject's safety, and adverse events during the study periodCRC is responsible for abstracting and tracking the adverse events and adverse reactions in manner that helps the Principal Investigator review before entering this into a sponsor database.Understand protocol-specific adverse event definitions and what is required to be reported in addition to those meeting the federal definitions.MD/NP evaluation of the subject cases and IND Safety Reports for the need to modify the informed consent when changes to risk have been identified.Be consistent and use scientific terminology when reporting AEs; get assistance from your investigators!It is all about subject safety and human subject protection! 30Monday, February 3, 14 "}
