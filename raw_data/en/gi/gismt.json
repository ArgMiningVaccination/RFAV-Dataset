Certificate, Meditation, 2019), accredited with Australian Natural Therapists Association (ANTA) and Meditation Australia (MA). A fundamental principle that underpins Naturopathy, is that we treat the cause of an illness, not simply the disease. Over many years of clinical experience, being a mother to 2 daughters and diving into all of the 'roles' between, Kate has arrived with a deep understanding that the primary underlying causes of dis-ease are stress, anxiety and an inability to still the mind. Kate creates unique partnerships with her clients, offering ongoing support and expertise. She works closely with her clients, teaching life-skills and wellness tools to gain confidence for long lasting health and wellbeing. In addition to prescribing tailored natural medicine programs, Kate teaches her clients to cultivate a self - care plan that embraces meditation and mindfulness designed around their own schedule and lifestyle.
