The beginning step is a sensitization during which an antigen, harmless at this point, is recognized as an allergen. This first step prepares the immunological system for a specific reaction during the next contact with the allergen. In recent years, the number of allergic patients has increased dramatically, particularly in industrialized countries, with a predominance of respiratory and food allergies. Allergic asthma Allergic asthma is characterized by a chronic inflammatory reaction of the bronchi leading to difficulty in breathing. It can be caused, for example, by mites or various pollens. Food allergies In food allergies, the immune system recognizes a food antigen as a harmful foreign substance just like a bacteria or a germ. The manifestations can be respiratory, cutaneous, or intestinal, with the most severe form being anaphylaxis. There is no specific treatment for allergies. Symptoms of asthma can be relieved by inhaling bronchodilators to reduce the feeling of tightness in breathing. In the case of food allergies, the avoidance of the allergen must be implemented strictly. It is also possible to set up a desensitization strategy but this remains long, delicate and is only possible if the allergen is identified. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) have a key role in allergic reactions. We are currently developing a kinoid vaccine that simultaneously targets IL-4 and IL-13. Neutralization of these two cytokines in a mouse allergy model showed a therapeutic effect on the respiratory capacity and bronchial mucosal cells of mice. In the context of food allergies, we are also assessing the kinoid targeting IL-4 and IL-13, and a kinoid targeting IgE.
