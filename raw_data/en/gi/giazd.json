I feel this more is comfortable, for most of my clients. The crystals on the bed are what I use for healing. Although I tick them on a sheet for you, to suggest what can help and support you, I never explain my crystals unless asked. Telling you about The Gift of Harmony, if you remember, was about explaining to you about 4 parts of the self. Understanding this concept usually helps many of my clients in their lives. If I suggested the program to you, it is because I feel it would benefit you, which is why I created it. The 'strange song' as I explained at the time, was Light Language song, you might rarely hear this - even in the most spiritual of circles - this high vibrational sound healing allows me to communicate feelings and concepts to you wordlessly, bypassing the resistance of the mind and ego. Healing is an intuitive feeling experience involving deeper parts of you - not your conscious mind. As such, 'explaining the process' to your conscious mind, is unlikely to make sense and is not normally a part of my sessions. However, I did provide a list of changed old negative beliefs and your new positive beliefs acquired for your reference. These are all sub-conscious, and although I explained them in the session, I'm happy to explain them further to you, if you wish. Healing is a vocation, my purpose in doing it, working on my craft for 20 years now with 10,000 clients seen, is to empower, transform and free people. I do not allow people to sign up for years and years and milk them - they work a short time - then they're fine - and they usually then go on, happy, with their lives. It is a known phenomenon, in psychotherapy, for clients to not notice or appreciate their change. That is actually quite 'normal' - as the conscious mind may never grasp it. It is sub-conscious work after all! I'm very sorry at the phone interruption, I do apologise once again for that - although I could swear my phone was off, as usual, a film crew magically got through, and came and filmed my work after I saw you for Nomad Junkies - not an every day occurrence! You may not have noticed that I added time to your session for that interruption, and also allowed your session to overun further a bit - so that you could fully complete your process. Even though start time chat could also be billed I actually start the clock when the session really begins. And I always do that. I don't see how giving you extra time for free equates to 'fraud'. Healing is a vocation - if I was 'in it only for money' I would most likely still be a project manager and consultant in IT, working globally for large banks. It would be a rare careers advisor who suggested 'go crush it, become a healer!!' If you would like to contact me privately, I'll be happy to give you a refund, give you a gift of some crystal jewellery - explain your notes, or whatever it takes, to put this right for you. "}
