General introduction10 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineBackground 1.1 A \"double faced\" transformation in healthcare The past fifty years have seen a major transformation regarding societal views on the position of patients in healthcare. Bopp et al. (2005) describes the history of the role of patients regarding their own treatment process, and the relationship with their physician (Emanuel and Emanuel 1992), from the 1960s until the beginning of the 21st century: from patronised patients in the 1960s to informed (1970s), assertive (1980s), autonomous (1990s) and competent patients at the start of the new millennium. From the 1960s, patients became more and more involved in their own treatment. In the 1970s the con - cept \"informed consent\" was introduced in Europe. In the 1980s, patients became more aware of their rights, and in the 1990s, doctors practiced the first models of \"shared-deci - sion-making\" (Emanuel and Emanuel 1992, Bopp et al. 2005). From the 2000s onwards, patients are expected to perform a competent consumerist role and patients' power has been put in the centre of attention (Bopp et al. 2005, Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Victoor 2015, Smit and De Knecht 2018). This transformation is partly steered by concepts and policies that were designed to strengthen the position of patients, to measure outcomes that matter to patients (ICHOM 2019), and to enable patients to perform their role in shared decision-making, self-management, and patient-centred care (Mead and Bower 2000, Wagner et al. 2001, Coleman and Newton 2005, Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Van der Weijden 2011, Rademakers et al. 2012, Victoor 2015, Smit and De Knecht 2018). Concepts like patient empowerment and patient participation have influenced the debate about the delivery of healthcare great - ly. The extent to which these concepts and policies enable patients to execute their rights and provide them with tools for agency and equality in practice varies and is sometimes rather limited (Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Engelen 2012, Dowdy et al. 2013, Franzel et al. 2013, Agoritsas et al. 2015, Victoor 2015, Smit and De Knecht 2018). Not only have these developments been stimulated by top-down policies on the national level, but also are these (policy) developments mirrored in movements from bottom-up in which patients wish to have more influence in their treatment processes, to be taken seriously, to be treated as human beings instead of illness cases, and to participate in shaping healthcare in a way that addresses the issues that they consider to be important (Rademakers et al. 2011, Engelen 2012, De Boer et al. 2013, Franzel et al. 2013, Miletus 2016, Smit and De Knecht 2018). Many patients do have strong motivations to be involved and to perform an active and competent role in their treatment process 11 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine(Bopp 2005, Engelen 2012, Franzel et al. 2013, Miletus 2016). However, at the same time, a large group of patients lacks the health literacy and capabilities to do so (Rademakers et al. 2012). 1.2 Integrative Medicine Associated with this transformation is the increasing number of people that makes a deliberate choice for using Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM) (Box 1.1) or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) (Box 1.2), in addition to or as an alternative for conventional (biomedical-based) medicine. Conventional medicine has developed in Western countries and is rooted in the natural sciences that have developed since the Middle Ages (Bynum 2013). In practice, the terms T&CM and CAM are used interchangeably. Following the WHO (WHO 2013), in this thesis the term T&CM is used. Part of T&CM form the so-called Whole Medical Systems (WMS) (Box 1.3). WMS are complete systems of healthcare theory and practice that have developed over time and in different cultures, independently from conventional Western medicine (Baars and Hamre 2017). Box 1.1 - Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) traditional medicine is \"the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.\"(WHO 2013) Following the WHO's definition as well, complementary medicine refers to \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system.\"(WHO 2013). Because the two terms are used interchangeably, the WHO has merged them into the term Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM) (WHO 2013).12 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineBox 1.2 - Complementary & Alternative Medicine (CAM) The Cochrane Collaboration definition of complementary medicine is that it in - cludes all such practices and ideas that are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries and that it is defined by its users as preventing or treating illness, or promoting health and well-being. These practices complement mainstream medicine by satisfying a demand not met by conventional practices and diversifying the conceptual framework of medicine (Manheimer and Berman 2008). According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is defined as health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual western practice. While the terms complementary and alternative are used interchangeably, the NCCIH makes the following distinction: if these healthcare practices are used in place of conventional medicine it is considered alternative, whereas practices in combination with conventional medicine it is referred to as complementary (NCCIH 2019). Box 1.3 - Whole Medical Systems (WMSs) Whole Medical Systems (WMSs) are complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved independently from or parallel to conventional medicine. Many are traditional medical systems that are practiced by individual cultures throughout the world (e.g. Anthroposophic Medicine, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine). WMSs are healthcare approaches in which practi - tioners apply bodies of knowledge and associated practices in order to maximize the patients' capacity to achieve mental and physical balance and restore their own health, using individualized, non-reductionist diagnostic and treatment approach - es. WMS practices often involve complex interventions (CI), composed of parts that together make the whole intervention, in which the whole is more than the sum of the parts, and in which the whole can generate the effect of the intervention (Baars and Hamre 2017). 13 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineFrom the perspective of patients a strong wish, need and motivation exists for integration of T&CM with conventional medicine (Frenkel et al. 2008, Jong et al. 2012). Depending on the study and the formulation of the specific question 55% - 97% of the patients is motivated to use T&CM in combination and communication with conventional care (providers) (Frenkel et al. 2008, Jong et al. 2012, Kemppainen et al. 2018). Carried by scientific underpinning this motivation has driven the development of integrative medi - cine (IM) (Duin et al. 2009, Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, Franzel et al. 2013, Berger and Heusser 2017, Baars et al. 2018) (Box 1.4). IM brings together T&CM and conventional medicine in a coordinated way (NCCIH 2019) and is defined by the Academic Consor - tium for Integrative Medicine and Health as \"the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing\" (ACIMH 2018). The term IM firstly emerged in the 1990s in the USA in response to the need to broaden the focus of medicine to healing as well, rather than to diseases alone (Caspi et al. 2003, Van Vliet 2017). It stems from the growing recognition that the dominant disease-based approach in medicine is not able to address the growing epidemics of chronic diseases (Maizes et al. 2009, Van Vliet 2017). Representing a broader view on medicine, IM states that the practice of good medicine is inquiry-driven and open to new paradigms (Caspi et al. 2003, Maizes et al. 2009). It has a critical open mind to both conventional medicine and T&CM. It is a new comprehensive system of medicine both in techniques and in conceptual foun - dation. It puts patients at the centre of the therapeutic relationship and, as such, it values patients' points of view and preferences as leading principles for healing (Caspi et al. 2003, Maizes et al. 2009). IM seeks to build bridges between the previously, often parallel worlds of conventional medicine and T&CM and to find therapeutic and cost-effective ways to combine best of both worlds (Maizes et al. 2009, Van Vliet 2017). The need for the further development of IM and, consequently, the integration of T&CM with conventional medicine, is strongly underlined by the WHO as described in the \"WHO traditional medi - cine strategy: 2014-2023\" (WHO 2013).14 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineBox 1.4 - Integrative Medicine (IM) Integrative Medicine (IM) is a holistic and comprehensive healthcare approach that brings T&CM and conventional medicine together in a coordinated way, and focuses on well-being and the promotion of health rather than on fighting disease alone(Baars 2011, Van Vliet 2017, NCCIH 2019). The definition of IM according to the ACIMH encompasses four aspects, IM 1) reaffirms the importance of the re - lationship between practitioner and patient; 2) focuses on the whole person; 3) is informed by evidence; and 4) makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.(NCCIH 2019) Following an earlier definition formulated by Duijn et al. (2009), Van Vliet (2017) also adds the aspect of the healing physical environment. 1.3 Use of T&CM and IM The group of patients that uses T&CM and IM has gradually grown over the past two de - cades (Maizes et al. 2009, Templeman and Robinson 2011, Jong et al. 2012). Large num - bers of patients choose deliberately for T&CM and IM (Frenkel et al. 2008, Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, Koster et al. 2014). A recent study investigated the use of T&CM in 21 European countries based on data of the European Social Survey, round 7 (ESS 2014, Kemppainen et al. 2018). In 2014, 26% of the European population had used T&CM during the last 12 months, which was approximately one third of the people who had visited a general prac - titioner in the same year (Kemppainen et al. 2018). In the USA, these numbers are higher: from 34% in 1990 to 62% in 2002 (Jong et al. 2012). The numbers reported for the Nether - lands are inconsistent. On the one hand, T&CM use seems to be growing. In 2009, about 9,2% of the population used T&CM (Jong et al. 2012), whereas in 2014 14% of the Dutch population had used T&CM in the last 12 months (Kemppainen et al. 2018). On the other hand, Van Vliet (2017) reported a T&CM use of between 6,5% (in 2003) and 5,1% (in 2015). According to the study of Kemppainen et al. (2018) health problems or indica - tions for which patients in Europe use T&CM most often are skin conditions (38,1%), back or neck pain (38,0%), allergies (36,7%), stomach and digestive system related problems (35,7%), upper extremity pain (34,7%) and severe headaches (34,1%). However, not all T&CM modalities were included in this study, for example Anthroposophic medicine and Ayurveda were not included, implicating that the estimated real percentages are even 15 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinehigher (Kemppainen et al. 2018). Overall, it is likely that the specific definitions that are used and the number of modalities that are included in the different studies influence the figures. For example, in The Netherlands more often more narrow definitions of T&CM are used, including fewer modalities (Van Vliet 2017). With regard to population characteristics, most studies point out that users of T&CM and IM are more often women than men, are on average middle aged, and have on average higher educational levels (Kienle et al. 2006, Arman et al. 2011, Jong et al. 2012, Van Vliet 2017, Kemppainen et al. 2018). Patients have many different reasons and motivations for using T&CM (Vlieger et al. 2006, Wapf 2007, Dulmen et al. 2010, L\u00e4engler et al. 2010, Jong et al. 2012) (Box 1.5). Their most important reason is dissatisfaction with conventional medicine (Fischer et al. 2014). However, most people do not wish to turn their back upon conventional medicine at all, but rather like to be able to choose best of both worlds and want a treatment that is line with their personal values and preferences (Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012). This is also visible in the figures about the use of T&CM in Europe: only 8% of T&CM users did so without any visit to a conventional biomedical professional (Kemppainen et al. 2018).16 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineBox 1.5 - Reasons and motivations The reasons and motives for using T&CM and IM can be ordered in five categories (Vlieger et al. 2006, Wapf 2007, Dulmen et al. 2010, L\u00e4engler et al. 2010, Jong et al. 2012, Van Vliet 2017): 1. Perceived effectiveness: looking for an alternative effective treatment when conventional treatment has been ineffective or found to be too risky or toxic. \u00b7 Examples are: milder treatment, less side effects, whish to generally feel better, less allopathic medication, improve chance of cure, end of treatment elsewhere, preference of a natural treatment, strengthening the immune system, and relaxation. 2. Personal involvement in the healing process \u00b7 Examples are: more control over decisions regarding ones health and treatment, individual responsibility in achieving health, less unquestioning acceptance of medical authority. 3. Philosophical and values compatibility \u00b7 Examples are: congruent with patients' spiritual values and beliefs, meaning of health and illness, holistic nature, treatment from a different angle and believe in a combination of T&CM and conventional treatment. 4. Better relationship with care provider \u00b7 Examples are: more consultation time, being seen and heard as a human being, and being respected as a partner in the treatment process, more caring and empathic provider. 5. External motivation: \u00b7 Examples are: advice from family or friends, good experience earlier, positive information and second opinion, reference by GP or specialist. 1.4 Transparency in healthcare The transformation of the position of patients combined with the introduction of regulated markets (see below) and the growing importance of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) (see 1.5) has resulted in a call for transparency about quality of care (Delnoij et al. 2010, Krol 2015, Victoor 2015) and subsequently the development of indicators about quality of care (Delnoij et al. 2002, 2010, Van den Berg et al. 2014). In the Netherlands in 2006, this call 17 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinefor transparency was reinforced by the introduction of managed competition (Enthoven and Van de Ven 2007, Victoor 2015). Two important Acts regarding the organisation of healthcare in the Netherlands came into force: the Health Insurance Act (ZVW) and the Market Regulation of Healthcare Act (WMG) (Staten-Generaal 2005, Staten-Generaal 2006). The purpose of both acts was to democratise healthcare and create a healthcare system based on managed competition between healthcare providers and between health insurers, with patients acting as healthcare consumers (Enthoven and Van de Ven 2007, Victoor 2015). From then on, patients have been officially appointed to be the so-called third party, intending that they should have an official and effective voice regarding healthcare performance (Enthoven and Van de Ven 2007, Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Victoor 2015). On a collective level this means that patients (and patient organi - sations) are an official stakeholder and consultation party regarding healthcare policies (Delnoij 2010, Van de Bovenkamp 2010). On the individual level this means that patients are expected to act as active consumers and choose the best care and health insurance for themselves (Delnoij et al. 2010, Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Victoor 2015). To perform this role they need reliable information that enables them to make informed decisions (Schut and Van Doorslaer 1999, Delnoij et al. 2010, Krol 2015, Victoor 2015). The underlying assumption, rooted in neo-liberal theory, is that patients make rational informed choices based on quality and costs (Victoor 2015). 1.5 Measuring patient-reported quality of care Another related development that reinforced transparency in healthcare is EBM (Offringa et al. 2003, Smulders et al. 2010, RVS 2017). One of the initial aims of EBM was to democ - ratize knowledge about the effectiveness of treatments and protect patients from possibly harmful interventions (RVS 2017). EBM has influenced thinking about the effectiveness of treatments to a large extent and initiated the development of professional guidelines, quality indicators, volume norms, and especially RCTs as the golden standard of evidence (RVS 2017). In this context, the merits of EBM have contributed to (transparency about) safe and effective treatments. However, the narrowing of the original ideas in the context of generating evidence has resulted in the risk of reducing \"good care\" to \"proven care\" only (Smulders et al. 2010, Schoemaker and Smulders 2015, RVS 2017). Currently, the debate on quality of care focuses on reconsideration of what is good evidence, the limits of epidemiological evidence and the return of patients' preferences and his/her context back into the principle of evidence-based decision making (Smulders et al. 2010, May and Mathijssen 2015, Schoemaker and Smulders 2015, RVS 2017). 18 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine The influence of EBM has also demanded and stimulated research regarding the effectiveness of T&CM and IM interventions. Both the quantity and quality of the body of evidence on safety, efficacy and effectiveness of T&CM and IM prevention and treatment is growing. So far, the scientific development of IM has largely focused on its biomedical quality and clinical research and this has had many merits in developing good quality evi - dence of safety and (cost)effectiveness of IM (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Herman et al. 2012, Baars and Kooreman 2014, Hamre et al. 2014, Kligler et al. 2016, Baars et al. 2018). However, as a consequence of IM's focus on clinical research, gradually it becomes clear that measuring patient-reported quality has been lagging behind and would be a legitimate next step (Adams and Robinson 2013, Nissen et al. 2013, Fischer et al. 2014, Koster et al. in press, this thesis Chapter 6) in IM's scientific development. In the past twenty years, measuring patient-reported quality of care has become an essential part of evaluating healthcare performance (Cleary and Edgman1997, Sixma et al.1998, Delnoij 2009). As such, this approach to evaluating quality of care expresses the recognition of the patient as a valid source of knowledge regarding this quality (Delnoij 2009). In doing so, great efforts have been made to collect valid, reliable and patient-derived information, and re - search is still further developing and enhancing its methods (Sixma et al.1998, Turner et al. 2007, Delnoij 2009, McKenna 2011, Trujols et al. 2013, Kessel et al. 2014, Bos et al. 2015, Krol 2015, Wiering et al. 2016, Verkerk et al. 2017). In conventional medicine, specific methodologies have been developed to mea - sure different aspects of received care from the perspective of patients (Greenhalgh et al. 2018, Wiering 2018). Currently, two major methodologies are the Patient Reported Ex - perience Measures (PREMs) (Sixma et al. 1998, Delnoij 2009, Bos et al. 2015, Krol 2015, Wiering et al. 2017, Greenhalgh et al. 2018) and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) (Turner et al. 2007, Boyce and Brown 2013, Kessel et al. 2014, Verkerk et al. 2017). PREMs are used to measure process aspect of care, for example, communication, patient-provider relationship, accessibility, tailored care and cooperation between care pro - viders (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008). PROMs are used to measure concrete outcomes of care (Black 2013, Boyce and Brown 2013, Kessel et al. 2014) either disease-specific or in general (Kessel et al. 2014). Examples of disease-specific outcomes are bodily function after surgery, and reduction of or recovery from specific symptoms or illnesses (see for example www.ICHOM. org). General outcomes are usually assessed by measuring patients' quality of life (Fagerlind et al. 2010, McKenna 2011, Haywood et al. 2012, Verkerk et al. 2017). 19 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine1.6 Measuring what is relevant The development of relevant patient-centred measures is important for process aspects, as well as general \u00e1nd specific outcomes of care (Epstein and Street 2011, Staniszewska et al. 2012, De Boer et al. 2013, Cleary 2013, Krol 2015, Wiering et al. 2016). One of the major challenges of measuring patient-reported quality of care is to actually measure what is relevant for patients and to develop proper measures that address (the full spectrum of) patient-centred care (Thorsen et al. 2001, Epstein and Street 2011, Entwistle et al. 2012, Staniszewska et al. 2012, Cleary 2013, Krol 2015, Wiering et al. 2016, ICHOM 2019). Ac - cording to Thorsen et al. (2001), the patient's view is not necessarily represented in the patient's answers to pre-formulated questions. Therefore, not only it is important to let patients answer questions their experiences with received care and the perceived effective - ness of treatment, but also to involve patients in formulating and prioritising the ques - tions that are asked (Wiering 2018) 1.7 Patient-reported quality in IM As described before, measuring patient-reported quality of care in IM is important to con - tribute to the further development of its scientific base. It will make the actual quality of IM from patients' perspective more visible, and will provide concrete feedback to improve its services. Moreover, the large number of deliberate choosers and their reasons for mak - ing their choices demonstrate that IM has something to offer to patients that they are less likely to find in conventional care on its own. To patients, IM has added value compared with conventional medicine (Frenkel et al. 2008, Greene Prabhu et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, Franzel et al. 2013, Foley and Steel 2017). Parts of this added value are becoming clearer - for example, experiences of em - pathy from care professionals, empowerment and patient-centred care - (Jong et al. 2012, De Boer et al. 2013, Foley and Steel 2017) and are also developing in conventional medi - cine (Greene Prabhu et al. 2009, Foley and Steel 2017), while other parts, such as curative health promotion (Baars 2011), agency (Berger and Heusser 2017) and spirituality (Huber et al. 2013, Baars and Hamre 2017) are still relatively new or unknown. It would be worth - while, legitimate and necessary to study these aspects, which are partly non-specific and contextual, in order to decide whether they should be included in measuring patient-re - ported quality in IM. In the light of the current debates on different concepts in healthcare regarding the position of patients, the increasing efforts to understand effects of non-specific and 20 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecontextual factors, and the collective search for measuring the right and relevant aspects of care, the investigation of patient-reported quality of IM could reveal aspects that may be relevant and important to all patients, i.e. patients of conventional medicine. Another reason why it is important to conduct and further develop research on patient-reported quality of care within the field of IM in the Netherlands is the WHO's rec - ommendation for a worldwide integration of T&CM with conventional medicine, based on its potential strength for optimizing health, well-being and patient-centred care, which has been formulated in the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 (WHO 2013). In contrast with developments in other countries, for example in the USA, in the Netherlands, up until recently, there has been no development of national policies to implement and coordinate the practice of and research on IM (Busch et al. 2015). Recently, The Netherlands Organi - sation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) has formulated an advice to create a knowledge infrastructure that would contribute to the integration of safe and effective T&CM within Dutch healthcare (ZonMw 2015). A new-formed consortium of (academic) hospitals and research institutes has taken up the task to develop and stimulate the Dutch IM knowledge structure (CIZG 2018). In the USA, a similar consortium has existed since 2000 (ACIMH 2018). This was formed to serve the transformation of medicine and health - care through rigorous scientific studies (Maizes et al. 2009, ACIMH 2018). Also in Brazil a similar consortium exists since 2017 (VHL TCIM Americas). Further developing health services research and measuring patient-reported quality of care will contribute to this knowledge infrastructure and provides more valid information that is needed to enable patients to make informed decision on the use of IM. This thesis 1.8 Anthroposophic Medicine Being a classical example of IM, the focus of this thesis will be on anthroposophic med - icine (AM). AM has originated in Europe and was founded in the 1920s by the scientist Rudolf Steiner and the medical doctor Ita Wegman. Since then, it has developed worldwide and is established in 80 countries; including most countries in central Europe (Kienle et al. 2013). AM combines all knowledge from biomedical medicine with a holistic view on illness and health (Kienle et al. 2013, Baars et al. 2018). It provides specific therapies, including medicinal products and non-medication therapies, and encompasses multiple sectors, including general practice, occupational medicine, primary school doctoring, child 21 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinewelfare centres (CWC), clinical specialists, psychiatry, special needs care, hospitals, and a large amount of paramedic sectors such as physiotherapy, art therapy, music therapy, speech therapy, eurhythmy therapy, psychotherapy and counselling, dietetics and nursing. AM GPs often work in close cooperation with these therapeutic disciplines in integrative healthcare centres (\"therapeutica\"). Important features of AM are its health promotion- oriented prevention and treatment strategies, its patient-centred, individualised approach, its diagnostic procedures, its complex interventions and its focus on self-management and the patient-provider relationship (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2013). AM is a Whole Medical System in the sense that it is a complete system of theory and practice that encompasses its own philosophy, diagnostics, coherent interventions and evaluation (Busch et al. 2015, Baars and Hamre 2017). However, unlike most other WMSs, AM has developed from the roots of the natural sciences - the same roots as con - ventional medicine has developed from (Bynum 2013), and is embedded in the develop - ment of western philosophy (Sijmons 2008). In addition, it has integrated conventional medicine and AM complementary therapies from the start of its development. This inte - gration of different viewpoints is part of AM worldview (Baars and Hamre 2017). In the light of the current development of IM this in an important strength, because it means that AM not only has practiced IM for over 90 years, but also that the integrative character is indissolubly a part of AM's identity. The choice for AM in this thesis is based on both scientific and practical reasons as well as reasons regarding the content of AM. Scientifically, AM is very well defined and described in literature as an extension of conventional medicine, and is based on an in - creasingly sound scientific fundament (Kienle et al. 2011, Heusser 2016, Baars et al. 2018). The term IM is much younger and, despite its clear definition that is described earlier in this introduction, the term is often still interchangeably used with the terms Complemen - tary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), Complementary and Integrative Medicine (CIM) and T&CM, in which it is not always clear if complementary treatments are used in com - bination with conventional treatment, or as alternative to. This thesis explicitly focuses on the integration of T&CM with biomedical-based medicine. As stressed before, within AM the two are a priori combined (Baars et al. 2018). On the practical level the field of AM is nationally and internationally well organised, which makes convenient access to existing research, international research organisations, professionals and professional organisa - tions, and the patients' organisation in the Netherlands. On the content level, there are many reasons that make it interesting to investi - gate AM. The fact that AM is a WMS and is embedded in western science and philosophy makes it a logic field to start studying the integration of T&CM with biomedical medicine from patients' perspective. Especially, because based on its worldview and philosophy, AM emphasises the position and the active role of the patient within his/her own treatment, 22 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineand in this line it has started to develop a body of knowledge dedicated to the perspectives of patients in AM care (Medizinische Sektion 2018). Finally, like what goes for all other forms of IM, there is a strong need for further development of its scientific base. For AM it is important that its specific features are described, compared to conventional medicine, and that its added value from patients' perspectives is scientifically tested. By focusing on AM this thesis will contribute to addressing this need. 1.9 Research questions The initial research question from where we started our study was: how to evaluate pa - tient-reported quality of care in AM? To operationalise this question, several relating questions emerged. These were questions like: What is measured so far? What do we need to measure? What do existing measurement instruments tell us about what aspects of care are generally measured? What are specific aspects of AM care that are important for patients? To what extent can we measure patient-reported quality of AM with existing instruments that are developed within conventional medicine and healthcare settings? How to develop additional methods - items, domains and/or instruments - to measure aspects of AM care that are not met with existing instruments? What kind of patients are involved? What are characteristics of this patient group? Do they have specific preferences and values? What are basic values of AM patients? And do these values influence what AM patients find important in healthcare? Can this be related to the values, worldview en/or life philosophies that form the philosophical backbone and inspire the practice of AM? Over the years this thesis has grown on the basis of these sub-questions. We learned that to be able to evaluate quality of AM care from the perspective of patients, it is necessary to ask patients about aspects that they consider relevant and important. There - fore, we needed a better insight into specific aspects of AM care that matter to these pa - tients. At the same time, we put forward that AM users might be a specific patient group with specific characteristics, preferences and values, which might influence the way they evaluate care. Therefore, in addition to focus on specific aspects of AM care we also con - sidered it important to investigate possible specific aspects of AM users. In conclusion, this thesis will address the following main questions: 1. What are characteristics of AM users, in terms of demography, health behaviour and human values? (In short: Who are AM patients?) 23 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2. What specific aspects of AM care are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view? (In short: What do AM patients find important?) 3. How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do AM patients evaluate their received care? (In short: How do AM patients evaluate their care?) This thesis encompasses seven studies and uses both quantitative and qualitative meth - ods. It is structured in two ways. The first way is a chronological narrative of the devel - opment of this thesis, in which the various questions that are described above emerged along the way, and have found answers in seven sub-studies. This structure will be out - lined below. The second way in which this thesis is structured is a conceptual framework based on the three main research questions. It orders the content of the chronological narrative and the results of the sub-studies in three categories: 1) Who are AM patients?; 2) What do AM patients find important?; and 3) How do AM patients evaluate their care? Table 1.1 shows how each study fits within the conceptual structure of this thesis. This structure will be further elaborated and discussed in the general discussion. 1.10 Development of this thesis The development of this thesis started very small, with a practice-based research in an AM healthcare centre for children, and grew and evolved along the way. It can be looked upon as a nautilus: starting very small in the middle it spirals in outer direction; and with every step the scope grows and new horizons emerge. Chapter two marks the start of the inves - tigation and reports the findings of measuring parents' experiences with care in the Kinder - therapeuticum , using a questionnaire that had been used in this institution twice before. From measuring parents' experiences with care in one institution, the study grew wider to primary care in general and a large number of GP practices. At this level we aimed to measure quality of care in 22 AM GP practices. To be able to do so, we used a stan - dardised measurement instrument, the Consumer Quality Index General Practice (CQ- Index GP) (Box 1. 6). In this instrument a coherent set of aspects of care was identified, validated and ready to be measured. As such, this instrument provided a good starting point for measuring patient experiences with AM GP care. In addition, we conducted a construction and validation study and developed additional measures that address specific aspects of AM GP care. Also, we compared the quality of AM GP practices with conventional GP practices, based on the original CQ-Index GP items. These studies are respectively reported in chapter three and four . 24 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine To be able to measure patient-reported quality of care in AM we had to investi - gate aspects of care that are relevant for patients. Part of the construction of the CQ-Index was a qualitative phase, aiming to identify relevant aspects that indicate quality of care, and in which both care professionals and patients were involved. The most important question on the table then was: what are specific AM aspects of care and what aspects of care are relevant for patients? The construction and validation of the CQ-index Anthropos - ophic Healthcare contributes to this answer. However, during the process of constructing and validating a questionnaire spe - cifically for AM GP care two things became clear. Firstly, although this current study was a very important step in developing a sound scientific method to address patient-report - ed quality of care in AM, it was not enough to provide a full and thorough answer to the question at the table. Being a PREM the CQ-Index focuses on experiences of patients with process aspects of care, as opposed to outcome of care. However, the qualitative phase of the development of the CQ-Index showed that many more aspects of care than those that fitted in the structure of the CQ-index, were relevant for patients. To address and identify these aspects in a methodological sound way, more inductive and qualitative research was needed in a larger population of AM patients. From this point on, the scope of this thesis grew again and another horizon emerged. From a standardized way of measuring patient-reported experiences, using the CQ-Index, we stepped into an open inductive approach in search for aspects of AM that were relevant for patients, without using any pre-constructed concepts. This step was needed to connect with patients and their experiences and point of views in the most direct way. We conducted a qualitative triangulation study in which we investigated four different data sources that all contained information that was directly derived from pa - tients. This study is reported in chapter five . The results showed twelve meaningful out - come domains. The findings that were generated in this study contained a large area of health, wellbeing, and quality of life, and opened up a window to a large research field that was connected with developments of PREMs, PROMs, measuring health related quality of life, and the search for measures that are genuinely relevant for patients. This triangulation study demonstrated a potential of AM to benefit patients with a wide variety of treatment outcomes. In addition, it raised several question with implications for further research. One of these questions was whether these aspects also applied to other AM settings and the wider field of IM. Or in other words: how is patient-reported quality mea - sured in AM and other forms of IM so far, and which aspects are measured? In asking this question the scope of this thesis widened further. To find an answer, the next step was to perform a scoping review on patient evaluation studies on quality of care, including instru - ment development studies, in IM as a whole. This study is reported in chapter six . A second question was related to the domain that refers to patients' active 25 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecontribution in promoting and maintaining one's health. People regard AM's contribu - tion to enable patients to be actively involved in one's treatment and health issues a very valuable aspect of AM. Within the current development of self-management, it would be worthwhile to investigate how this relation between AM and self-management is shaped, why patients value this aspect of AM and how AM can contribute to the practice of self-management. Up until recently this has not been explicitly and methodologically studied. Therefore, this study is conducted within this thesis and is reported in chapter seven . The study revealed that AM patients' experiences with self-management support the hypothesis that AM's contribution to self-management might be embedded in AM philosophy and/or worldview. Following, during the research process and in particular within the analyses of the CQ-index questionnaires, we took into account that the way patients evaluate their care could be influenced by population aspects, such as age, gender and education. Previous literature suggests that AM users are more often female, middle-aged and higher educated than users of solely conventional medicine. Following, it raised the question whether AM users might be a specific patient group. The last study, reported in chapter eight , addresses this question. It focuses on patient characteristics of Dutch AM users and investigates if this patient group has specific population characteristics, health behaviour and patient values, compared to the general Dutch population. Box 1.6 - Consumer Quality Index Chapter two and three are studies that have used the Consumer Quality Index (CQ-Index) for measuring patient-reported experiences in primary care. The CQ- Index method has been developed to measure patient-reported quality of care, in different healthcare sectors in a standardized manner. Its purpose is to generate reliable, valid and comparable information about quality of care from the perspec - tive of patients. The CQ-Index is a Patient Reported Experience Measure (PREM) that is based on two earlier methods, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and the QUality Of care Through patients' Eyes (QUOTE). In line with the CAHPS (Cleary 2013) and the QUOTE the CQ-Index measures concrete experiences with care rather than patient satisfaction. An im - portant characteristic of the CQ-Index lies in the process of development, in which three parties - patients/clients, care providers and health insurers - are involved. 26 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineIn the Netherlands, the Consumer Quality Index (CQ-Index) has served as an import - ant instrument to measure Patient Reported Experiences (PREs) in the last ten years. In its method of evaluating care the CQ-index combines the inventory of experi - ences with questions about values and expectations with regard to the healthcare field at issue. Each item about a certain experience is paired with an item that asks about the relevance or importance of that experience item. The combination of both these answers is helpful in determining priorities for improvement. The construction and validation process of a new CQ-index was protocolled by the former Dutch foundation CKZ (Centre for client experiences in healthcare). Important parts of this protocol were the formulation of the items and the stan - dardized answer categories, the method of data collection and the statistical analyses. The protocol has been replaced by more general guidance on developing patient experience surveys and is published by the National Health Care Institute: https:/ /www.zorginzicht.nl/binaries/content/documents/zorginzicht/ontwikkeltools/ ontwikkelen/handreiking-ontwikkelen-prems/handreiking-ontwikkelen-prems/files/Han - dreiking-ontwikkelen-Patientenvragenlijsten-def.pdf A large number of has been developed; one of them is the CQ-Index General Practice, which is used as a base for the studies that are reported in chap - ters two and three. This instrument contains 56 experience items and five scales: Accessibility, Assistance, General Practitioner, Communication, and Tailored Care. In addition to measuring patient experiences with AM general practice care using existing CQ-index measures, chapter two reports of the construction and validation of the CQ-index Anthroposophic Healthcare, in which two new AM scales were developed: AM Treatment and Interactional style GP. The CQ-Index has been developed in a way that different healthcare services and providers can be measured within the same systematic structure, in order to be able to compare these experiences. This systematic makes it possible to compare between different GP practices.

(Published)* * Chapter 2 is a translated and slightly edited version of Baars, Koster and Schoorel 201128 The relevance of holistic healthcare: quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Background: The Kindertherapeuticum is a private anthroposophic healthcare institu - tion for the diagnostic evaluation and therapy of three streams of children (paediatrics, child psychiatry and developmental problems). Methods: In 2000, 2005 and 2009 a questionnaire was sent to all clients (parents of children, physicians and therapists) investigating client characteristics, experiences with diagnostics and treatment, subjectively experienced effects and the quality of the organisation. Results: Average response: 54%. Client characteristics: children coming from the region (43%), from the rest of the Netherlands (55%) and other countries (2 %); age categories children: 0-7 (50 %), 8-11 (35 %), (15 of problems: psychiatric, psychosomatic or pedagogic (2/3), somatic (1/3). Most parents emphatically choose for an anthroposophic approach (88 %). An increasing number of parents (an estimated 30 %) come from a non-anthroposophic physician. Most parents, physicians and therapists are (very) satisfied with the diagnostics, treatment and the quality of organisation. Judgments of parents on the effects (more than 2/3), reduction in the use of care after visiting the Kindertherapeuticum, and a reduction of the use of conventional medication (an average of 20%) indicate positive effects. Conclusion: Clients are (very) satisfied with the diagnostics, treatment and organisation quality. There are some indications for positive effects of the approach. 29 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2.1 Introduction The Kindertherapeuticum is a second line children's healthcare centre in Zeist, The Neth - erlands, which was founded in 1996. Vision and work method within this institution are characterised by the integration of the conventional and anthroposophic approach to di - agnostics and treatment (Baars 2008), multidisciplinary working, attention for the unique - ness of the child by using image-forming methods and good operational management (Baars and Koster 2010, www.kindertherapeuticum.nl). In 2001, in addition to the already existing medical stream, the pedagogic stream was initiated. In 2003 the psychiatric stream was added. Within the employee group medi - cine and child psychiatric insights are expanded with insight from orthopedagogy, physical therapy, speech therapy, art therapies, nutritional therapy and other sciences. Healthcare problems are thus investigated, named and treated multi-disciplinary. Within the Kindertherapeuticum the connections between pathology, constitution and the development of the child are looked at multidisciplinary, in a broader way than in a con - ventional setting. During the team meeting, with the help of a phenomenological, imaging method (Borthoft 2010), the observations are translated into a common assessment in a common (anthroposophic) language at a higher abstraction level. Then, at this level a cohesive pattern becomes visible, which offers an explanation for (ideally) all observations in the area of pathology, constitution and development. This cohesion is then translated back to a diagnostic dynamic image that is communicated to the parents and that also forms the basis for the therapy and support by the parents and therapists (Baars and Koster 2010). 2.1.1 Characteristics of the Anthroposophic Healthcare The Anthroposophic Healthcare (AH) pays a lot of attention to the connection between body, soul and mind, as well as lifestyle, meaning in life and environmental factors in con - nection to disease and health. What is significant is that the AH focuses on the support and active stimulation of the self-regulating and self-healing ability of people. This takes place with the help of additional therapies (for example art therapy or eurhythmy therapy), the development and the use of natural medicines and a reticent use of conventional med - icines. A frequently mentioned and appreciated characteristic of AH is the attention for the anthropos , the human being. In the practice this translates to a professional orientation of the individual, an equal relationship between patient and caregiver, as well as a lot of time and attention for the patient (Baars and Van der Bie 2008). A clear example of the anthroposophic approach is the treatment of hay fever. The NHC standard (Dutch College of General Practitioners) focuses on the excessive 30 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinehistamine production through the treatment with antihistamines, and the chronic inflam - matory reaction with local corticosteroids. The anthroposophic treatment (in particular the medicinal treatment with Citrus/Cydonia comp. (extracts of citrus and quince) and the eurhythmy therapy) focuses on the structural improvement of the immunoregulation, which ideally leads to a full recovery of theThi/Th2 balance. There is more and more scien - tific evidence for the effects and the immunological working mechanism of Citrus/Cydonia comp (Baars 2011). The AH is strongly, internationally organised. This form of care is currently stud - ied and taught at the various universities in Europe and ambulatory and clinically practised in eighty countries all over the world. The AH encompasses multiple sectors: general prac - titioner, company doctor, school doctor and the health centre (first line care) in addition to a rich variety of second line care. The general practitioners work in independent practices and practise often together with various other disciplines. There are about 160 practising anthroposophic (general) practitioners and specialists in the Netherlands. There are 15 health centres for infants and children up to 4 years of age, partially imbedded in the re - gional institutions. An estimated 200,000 clients make use of these services (Baars and Van der Bie 2008). Up to the end of 2010 a total of 256 studies on the effect of AH have been done (Kienle et al. 2006, Kienle et al. 2011), of which 70 in the past six years, as well as various studies in paediatrics (Majorek et al. 2004, Fl\u00f6istrup et al. 2006, L\u00e4engler et al. 2007, L\u00e4engler et al. 2008, Hamre et al. 2009). Of those 356 studies 74 were prospectively com - parative studies (including 38 randomised clinical trials; RCTs), go prospective and 52 retrospective studies without comparison groups, and 49 retrospective comparative stud - ies with a comparative group. In 38 of these 256 studies the AH therapy system as a whole (including medication and therapies) was researched, for the rest there were 10 non-phar - macological studies, 133 studies about mistletoe therapy in cancer and 84 other medicinal product studies. The results of the studies are predominantly positive and there are barely any risks and side effects; if present, they are mild to moderate. On the basis of the sys - tematic review the conclusion is that the study about AH on a broad spectrum of disorders showed predominantly good results, with few side effects, a high measure of client satis - faction and indications of cost-effectiveness compared to conventional treatment (Kienle et al. 2006, Kienle et al. 2011, Kooreman and Baars 2011). For the purpose of quality management a study on client experiences (parents of patients, referring physicians and therapists, who prior and/or in connection to the contact are involved in the care of the child) is performed within the Kindertherapeuticum every five years (Baars and Koster 2010). 31 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2.2 Methods The objectives of the study were to obtain insight in the client characteristics and the ex - periences that parents of patients, referring physicians and therapists had with the Kinder - therapeuticum (quality of care, subjectively experienced effects and experiences and sat - isfactions about the operational management) over the past years. All three target groups received a questionnaire with both closed and open questions. All parents of patients who visited the Kindertherapeuticum in the period between 2005 and 2009 were approached. With respect to the physicians and therapists only a random, select group was picked out from the total database of the members connected to the professional organisations. All referring anthroposophic general practitioners, as well as all anthroposophic therapists with whom the Kindertherapeuticum has a referral and/or working relationship, were notified. All questionnaires were processed anonymously. Statistical analyses were per - formed with SPSS 18.0. The results of the current questionnaire were compared to those of the two previously performed questionnaires in 2000 and in 2005 (Idema 2000, Van Ham 2005). 2.3 Results 2.3.1 Response Of the 2297 questionnaires sent, 1241 (54%) were returned. Per category (parents of patients, physicians and therapists) the response is respectively 51%, 56% and 90%. In general a response percentage of 40% is considered reasonable, above 60% is consid - ered good. The average percentage of response of 54% can therefore be considered sufficiently representative to make a statement. In a period of 14 years the percentages of response over all 5207 parents, physi - cians and therapists that were written, are respectively 55%, 51% and 65% and thus suffi - cient (twice) and good. Of the 1033 responding parents 1014 (19 non-responders with this question) can be subdivided into the three streams of the Kindertherapeuticum. Over two-thirds of the parents are in the medical stream, over 20 % in the psychiatric stream and a small 10 % in the pedagogic stream. Of the medical, the pedagogic and the psychiatric stream approximately resp. 39%, 65% and 69% comes for diagnostics alone, 18 %, 7% and 14% for diagnostics and one-time check-up, and 42 %, 28% and 16% for both diagnostics and treatment.32 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2.3.2 Client characteristics Nearly 50% of the children are in the age category 0 through 7 years. Respectively 35% and 15% of the children visiting the Kindertherapeuticum are in the categories 8 through 11 years of age and 12 through 20 years of age. 43% of the visiting children come from the Kindertherapeuticums regional postal code areas 3400 through 4000. 2% of the children come from abroad and the remainder (about 55%) comes from almost all areas of the Netherlands. In the 2009 questionnaire the question, if parents had made a deliberate choice for anthroposophic care or not, was asked for the first time. 88% made a deliberate choice and 12% did not. The most important reasons for this choice were the added value of anthroposophic care (68%) and interest in anthroposophic care (32%). Far fewer times the parents chose the Kindertherapeuticum for unknown reasons (9%), on the advice of a teacher (8%), on the advice of a family member (7%) or because the child could no longer be treated elsewhere (5%). As indicated by the parents, a distinction can be made between somatic ques - tions of care and questions of care of a psychic, psychosomatic and/or pedagogic nature. In the period from 2005 to 2009 two thirds of the questions of care were of a psychic, psychosomatic or pedagogic nature and one third of a somatic nature. Compared to the previous two periods there is an evident trend towards more psychic, psychosomatic and/or pedagogic questions of care. More than 95% of the referrals in the period from 2005 to 2009 came from a physician. Nearly half of those cases came from the general practitioner and 40% respec - tively 11% of the cases from another physician or the school doctor. The number of referring consultative-active anthroposophic physicians has increased with respect to previous statistics and these referrals are most probably at the request of the parents of patients who do not have their own anthroposophic general practitioner. 2.3.3 Experiences with the offered care Of the children 41% also has treatment at the Kindertherapeuticum after diagnosis: rhythmic massage (33%), art therapy (18%), eurhythmy therapy (17%) or music therapy (16%). Treatments with speech/sensory integration therapy or play therapy (both 8%) are used least of all. Over 80% of the parents are of the opinion that Kindertherapeuticum pro - vides a good image of the situation of the child (84%) and specific therapeutic advice (81%). More than 70 % of the parents were confirmed in what they already knew (79%), believe that the image of their child has changed (74%) and that something diagnostically new has been added (72%). More than 60% of the parents are of the opinion that the previous examina - tion information is well integrated (66%) and that specific pedagogic advice is given (63%). Only 43% is of the opinion that they receive a quick and clear referral back to the first line. 33 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2.3.4 Subjectively experienced effects of the care 92 % of the parents are reasonably satisfied (27%) to very satisfied (65%) about the consul - tations. 84% is reasonably satisfied (32%) to very satisfied (52 %) about the treatment used at the Kindertherapeuticum. In both cases 5% is dissatisfied. About two thirds of the parents believe the healthcare condition, the behaviour and/or the psychic well-being to be better after the visit. Only 2-3% thinks it is worse and a little less than one third of the parents believe the healthcare condition, the behaviour and/or the psychic well-being remained unchanged after the visit. In comparison to both previous statistics the percentage of parents that established an improvement, was somewhat lower, however, the percentage of worsening remains pretty much unchanged. The majority of the parents (93%) that see an improvement are also of the opinion that the recommendations of the Kindertherapeuticum have had an effect on this. The general well-being of the child has improved after the visit to the Kindertherapeuticum with respect to sleeping (42%), fitness (49%), eating (30%) and other well- being (76%). Only in 1-5% of the cases the well-being became worse. The doctor's visits in connection with acute medical questions connected to the registration of problems were enormously reduced in the two months after the visit to the Kindertherapeuticum with respect to the last two months prior to the visit to the Kinderther - apeuticum. The percentage that did not visit a doctor doubled from 37% to 74%, the percent - age of single visits dropped from 24 % to 0 %, and also the percentage of second doctor's visits drops significantly from 19 % to 6%. The percentages of fourth, fifth and sixth visits in the two months after the visit only are respectively 2%, 1% and 1% and are continuously lower compared to the number of doctor's visits in the last two months prior to the visit to the Kindertherapeuticum. The above-mentioned percentages are almost equal to those in the 2005 and 2000 questionnaires. In 32%, 50% and 42% of the cases, prior to the visit to the Kindertherapeuticum, the children were treated with respectively conventional medication, anthroposophic and/or homeopathic products and external therapy. In 45% of the cases less conventional medica - tion is used after the visit to the Kindertherapeuticum and in 20% more. For the anthropos - ophic and/or homeopathic medicines these numbers are 22% less versus 45% more and for the external treatment 24% less versus 47% more. 2.3.5 Physicians and therapists Physicians and therapists have to various extent experience and contact with the three care fields of the Kindertherapeuticum: paediatrics (96%, 31%). Referring physicians and therapists are gen - erally highly satisfied to very satisfied a bout the care that is offered in general, the diag - nostic image of the child and the pedagogic recommendations. They are the most satisfied about the work of the paediatrician.34 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2.4 Conclusion and discussion Clients of the Kindertherapeuticum have been (very) satisfied with the diagnostics, treatment and the quality offered for more than 14 years already. Subjective assessments of the parents (more than two thirds), reduction of the use of healthcare after visiting the Kindertherapeuticum, and a reduction of the use of conventional medication (on average 20%) are indications of the positive effects of the approach of the Kindertherapeuticum. Increasingly, parents who do not have an anthroposophic general practitioner, look for help in the diagnosis and treatment of their child. With this study the Kindertherapeuticum indicates that it meets the needs of a growing number of parents for a different, integrative look at the problems of their child (Madsen et al. 2003). In addition to this evident demand of parents for the care the Kindertherapeuticum offers, the employees also have the need to show scientific responsibility for their work. As a next step a routine outcome monitoring (ROM) infrastructure will be created with which aspects like quality, safety, effect and satisfaction will be monitored on a continuous basis. Based on the results of the ROM, best practices will be identified, which can then be studied in more controlled outcome studies for safety and effectiveness. The fact that some children use more conventional medication after the consultation at the Kindertherapeuticum may be astonishing. However, it fits in the profile of anthroposophic medicine, which wants to be an extension of conventional medicine and not a replacement thereof. So it is possible that some parents, for whatever reason, may not fully treat their child in the conventional sense. At that point it is the task of the anthroposophic physician to point this out to them and to suggest an adequate treatment. 35 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine 3. The Consumer Quality Index Anthroposophic Healthcare: a construction and validation (2014) The consumer quality index anthroposophic healthcare: a construction and validation study. BMC health services research 2014;14(1):148. (Published)36 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Background: Accounting for the patients' perspective on quality of care has become increasingly important in the development of Evidence Based Medicine as well as in gov - ernmental policies. In the Netherlands the Consumer Quality Index has been developed to measure the quality of care from the patients' perspective in different healthcare sectors in a standardized manner. Although the scientific accountability of anthroposophic health - care as a form of integrative medicine is growing, patient experiences with anthroposophic healthcare have not been measured systematically. In addition, the specific anthroposoph - ic aspects are not measured by means of existing Consumer Quality Indexes. To enable accountability of quality of the anthroposophic healthcare from the patients' perspective the aim of this study is the construction and validation of a Consumer Quality Index for anthroposophic healthcare. Method: Construction in three phases: Phase 1. Determining anthroposophic quality aspects: literature study and focus groups. Phase 2. Adding new questions and validating the new questionnaire. Research population: random sample from 7910 patients of 22 an - throposophic GPs. Data collection: survey, mixed mode by means of the Dillman method. Measuring instrument: experience questionnaire: CQ Index General Practice (56 items), added with 27 new anthroposophic items added and an item-importance questionnaire (anthroposophic items only). Statistical analyses: Factor analysis, scale construction, in - ternal consistency (Chronbach's Alpha), inter-item-correlation, discriminative ability (Intra Class Correlation) and inter-factor-correlations. Phase 3. Modulation and selection of new questions based on results. Criteria of retaining items: general: a limited amount of items, statistical: part of a reliable scale and inter-item-correlation <0,7, and theoretical. Results: Phase 1. 27 anthroposophic items. Phase 2.Two new anthroposophic scales: Scale AntroposophicTreatmentGP: seven items, Alpha=0,832, ICC=4,2 - between new scales: r=0,50. Phase 3: Adding both scales and four single items. Removing eleven items and reformulating two items. Conclusion: The Consumer Quality Index Anthroposophic Healthcare measures patient experiences with anthroposophic GP's validly and reliably. Regarding the inter-factor- correlations anthroposophic quality aspects from the patients' perspective are mostly associated with individually tailored care and patient centeredness. 37 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine3.1 Background The Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) development that started in the nineties of the 20th century has influenced healthcare to a large extent. The main aim of EBM is to improve the quality of healthcare for the individual patient, based on the best evidence available (Off - ringa et al. 2003). In association with other developments such as New Public Management from the eighties of the 20th century and subsequently accountability of public finance, there is an increasing demand for scientific and societal accountability of the quality of healthcare (Delnoij 2009). According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM 2001) quality of care is a multidimensional concept consisting of at least six domains: effectiveness, safety, patient centeredness, timeliness, efficiency and equitably. In the last two decades one of these domains, patient-centred care, has become increasingly important in relation to the evaluation of the quality of healthcare (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Sixma et al. 1998). Patient-centred care represents a humanistic, bio-psy - chosocial perspective in healthcare, with a strong emphasis on communication, patient participation in clinical decision making, forming a therapeutic alliance and sharing power and responsibility (Rademakers et al. 2012). Various instruments have been developed in order to measure patients' experi - ences with patient centeredness, for instance the instruments known as CAHPS (Consum - er Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems), or the instruments developed by the Picker Institute, and the Consumer Quality Index (Delnoij and Hendriks 2008, RVZ 2010). In 2006, the Dutch Ministry of Health promoted the Consumer Quality (CQ-) Index as the instrument to measure patient experiences with healthcare (Delnoij et al. 2010, Ikkersheim and Koolman 2012). Since then the CQ-Index has been developed in a way that different healthcare services and providers can be measured within the same systematic structure, in order to be able to compare these experiences (Delnoij and Hendriks 2008, Sixma et al. 2008). Currently, several CQ-Indexes have been developed to measure patient experiences with for example: asthma care (Bloemendal 2008), physiotherapy, hospital specialist care (Donselaar et al. 2010), COPD care (Heijmans et al. 2009), and general practice (Meuwis - sen and De Bakker 2008). The construction and validation process of a new CQ-index is protocolled by the former Dutch foundation CKZ (Centre for client experiences in healthcare) (Sixma et al. 2008). Important parts of this protocol are the formulation of the items and the stan - dardised answer categories, the method of data collection and the statistical analyses. Anthroposophic healthcare Since ideally patient experiences with all areas of healthcare have to be measured, this also is of relevance for anthroposophic healthcare (AH). AH is a form of integrative med -38 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineicine (IM) that is provided to a small part of the Dutch population (estimation: 200 000 clients) in 80 general practitioner practices (Baars and Van der Bie 2008). AH emphasizes the relationship between the body, the soul and the mind as well as lifestyle, meaning in life and environmental factors with regard to health and disease. It focuses on the support and active stimulation of physiological self-healing and the self-regulating ability of people. Additional therapies based on the study of anthroposophic humanities, the development and use of natural medicines and a reticent use of conventional chemical medication play an important role within AH. A frequently mentioned and highly appreciated characteristic is the attention to antropos , the human being. In practice it means a professional orienta - tion to the individual, an equal relationship between patient and healthcare provider and much time and attention for the patient (Baars and Van der Bie 2008), or in other words: patient-centred care. AH is strongly organised internationally. This integrative form of healthcare is currently studied and taught at various universities in Europe and ambulatory and clinical - ly practiced in eighty countries worldwide (Kienle et al. 2006). AH encompasses multiple sectors: general practice, occupational medicine, primary school doctoring, child welfare centres (CWC) clinical specialists, psychiatry, special needs care, and a large amount of paramedic sectors such as physiotherapy, art therapy, eurhythmy therapy and psychother - apy. The GPs work independently and often closely together with these therapeutic disci - plines in integrative healthcare centres (Baars and Van der Bie 2008). Although the quality and the quantity of the scientific underpinning of AH is growing (Kienle et al. 2006, Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Kooreman and Baars 2011), it still suffers from a lack of acknowledgement within conventional healthcare. In the Nether - lands as well as internationally large groups of people have good experiences with anthro - posophic healthcare (Kienle et al. 2006, Baars and Koster 2010, Koster 2011). Nonetheless, up until now, patient experiences with anthroposophic healthcare have not been measured systematically. To enable accountability of quality of AH from the patients' perspective, the aim of this study is to develop a standardized instrument to measure patients' experiences with AH objectively and systematically. This instrument will generate feedback information about patient experiences, which can be used to monitor and improve the quality of AH. The instrument will meet the increased demand for quality assurance of (anthroposophic) healthcare in general and it will contribute to the scientific underpinning and accountability of AH. The present study focuses on investigating specific anthroposophic aspects of quality of care; the reliability, factorial structure and validity of the CQ-Index Anthropo - sophic Healthcare; the experiences with these anthroposophic aspects of healthcare in a group of patients at anthroposophic GP practices; and designing a final version of the CQ-Index questionnaire. The development of the CQ-index AH combined the development 39 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineof a measuring instrument for GP care with a measuring instrument for a broader spec - trum of AH therapies. This article focuses on the development of the CQ-index AH for GP care only. The overall research question was: How can quality of anthroposophic healthcare be measured from the patients' perspective? More specifically: Which aspects of quality of care are important from the perspective of patients of anthroposophic GP's? How can these aspects of care be measured as individual items in a valid and reliable way? Which items are part of a valid coherent scale and should be retained? What are patients' experi - ences of these aspects of care? 3.2 Methods The CQ-Index systematic consists of an experience questionnaire and an item-importance questionnaire (Sixma et al. 2008). According to the CKZ-guidelines the construction of the CQI-AH consisted of three phases. Phase one concerned the determination of the aspects of quality of care that are important from the perspective of patients of anthroposophic GP's and the construction of 'anthroposophic questions'. Phase two concerned the adding of new questions to the existing CQ-Index General Practice (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008), conducting a survey involving a sample of nearly 8000 patients of the population of anthroposophic GPs and validating the new questionnaire. Phase three concerned the modulating and selection of new questions based on the results in the previous phases. Ethics statement Regarding research ethics it is important to mention under Dutch legislation, which is laid down in the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act , this study is not subject to approval of an ethics commission. The Declaration of Helsinki does not apply on this study, because it is not medical research, but social science. The patients' experiences are used to evaluate the performance and service of doctors. There is no medical data involved. However, the study is carried out according to protocol of the former foundation CKZ (Centre for patient experiences in healthcare). The protocol is written down in the Handbook CQI development (Sixma et al. 2008). All necessary research ethics are covered within this protocol and the protocol was tested on it. The protocol is also fully in line with the legislation of the Dutch DPA (Data Protection Authority). The researchers followed this protocol in detail.40 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine3.2.1 Phase 1: determining anthroposophic aspects In order to determine what the anthroposophic aspects of GP care are, the CKZ-guidelines prescribe literature review and focus groups and/or interviews with experts. Rather than having both focus groups and interviews it was chosen to invite all participants in the focus group process. In this way patients and professionals could actually have a discus - sion on quality aspects together. The literature was reviewed and three focus groups were organised. Literature study For the literature study a database search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, the database of the international anthroposophic Medical Section and the internet in general was executed. The search terms were (a combination of): Dutch anthroposophic occupa - tional associations and the Dutch anthroposophic healthcare institutions were asked for client questionnaires with specific anthroposophic items. Finally, the Dutch patient organ - isation for AH, Antroposana, was consulted for literature on the subject of quality aspects of anthroposophic care from the perspective of their members. Focus groups Because of the wider context of the study regarding the broad spectrum of anthroposophic therapies both anthroposophic GP care and anthroposophic therapist care were discussed in the focus groups. Regarding the composition of the focus groups the guidelines of the CKZ were followed. A minimum of 6 participants was compulsory. In the first focus group (with three patients, three healthcare professionals, and one chairman) specific domains of anthroposophic experiences were determined and corresponding conceptual questions were formulated. The second focus group was an enlargement of the first focus group. A broad spectrum of anthroposophic therapists (13), doctors (4) and several patients (8) gave their feedback on the conceptual domains and questions that were constructed as a result of the first focus group. To minimalize group- and information management issues the communication in the second focus group went through email. In the third focus group (with two patients, two healthcare professionals, and two researchers) the feedback from the second focus group was discussed. All the professional views were in the end discussed with the patients' representations. The patients were recruited from the Dutch patient organisation for AH, Antro - posana. In total nine different patients were consulted for the construction of the ques - tionnaire, two of them were present at all focus groups. The doctors and therapists were recruited from their anthroposophic occupational associations. All healthcare profession - als had a working experience of a minimum of five years. In the consensus process with 41 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinethe members of the focus group and the anthroposophic patient organisation additional items were formulated. After that they were tested cognitively. The questionnaire was sent to 13 members of the anthroposophic patient organisation. They were asked if the ques - tions and the structure of the questionnaire were understandable. After integrating the criticisms the questions were added to the existing CQ-Index General Practice (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008) and a new questionnaire was constructed. 3.2.2 Phase 2: Validation of the CQ-Index AH Research population The new questionnaire was tested in a survey involving a patient population among 22 Dutch anthroposophic GPs. (Total population: 29 341 patients) Following the guidelines of the CKZ (Sixma et al. 2008) two random samples were taken. One random sample consist - ed of 6910 patients of 22 anthroposophic GP practices (range: 250-475 per practice). Accord - ing to the guidelines 20 practices were needed. It was chosen to include two spare practices. Following the recommendations of the pilot study CQ-Index GP (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008) only patients aged 18 years and older who visited their GP in the last year were included. They received the newly constructed questionnaire called the experience questionnaire. This questionnaire was to be validated. After the first sample a smaller random sample of 1000 patients (50 per practice) was taken from 20 of the original 22 an - throposophic GP practices. In this sample no spare practices were needed. These patients received the item-importance questionnaire. This questionnaire resulted in an importance rating per item. This rating was part of the criteria for the item inclusion in the factor-anal - yses of the experience questionnaire. It was chosen to send both questionnaires to differ - ent samples in order not to burden the respondents with more than one questionnaire. The CKZ-guidelines describe that the samples need to be representative in com - parison to the population. This is checked for each GP practice individually while taking the samples. Data collection The data collection was primarily accomplished online. This was also a recommendation of the pilot study CQ-Index GP (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008), in order to be able to cut costs and save paper. Respondents received an invitation by mail from their GP prac - tice with an Internet link and a login. A supplement in English, Turkish and Arabic was attached. People who didn't want or had difficulties responding online could ask for a paper version of the questionnaire. Two weeks after the first invitation the whole sample received a thank-you/remind - er postcard and four weeks after the first invitation only the non-responders received a 42 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinereminder invitation containing the Internet link and the login again. The data collection took place in accordance with the privacy legislation of the Dutch DPA (Data Protection Authority). Measuring instruments The experience questionnaire measured patients' experiences with quality of care. The questionnaire contained 83 items, of which 56 from the existing CQ-Index GP and 27 new anthroposophic items. The response options of the majority (69) of the items were: never (1), sometimes (2), usually (3) and always (4). Six items had response options yes and no. One item was a global rating of the GP practice, with response options from 0 (worst pos - sible) to 10 (best possible) and one item was a net promotor score. Seven items had other response options and two items had open answers. The item-importance questionnaire contained the same questions, only reformu - lated to ask about patients' opinions of the importance of the 27 new anthroposophic questions. The answer categories were: not important (1), quite important (2), important (3) and very important (4). Finally, both questionnaires contained questions regarding the background characteristics of the respondent. Statistical analyses Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted in order to test the validity of the new items and gather information needed to construct a new CQ-Index AH. Three consecutive factor analyses were performed to explore if the new items led to new factors: a first factor analysis to establish the factorial structure of the new items, a second factor analysis to determine if these factors contributed to the factorial structure of the original questionnaire and the last factor analysis to test if additional anthroposophic questions loaded on original factors. After the construction the new scales were checked to confirm that each of them didn't consist of more than one factor. The items were analysed individually before including them in the factor anal - yses. The criteria for inclusion of new items in the factor analyses were: comparable an - swer-structure, number of missing values (combined with the answers 'don't know' and 'not applicable'), importance rating, inter-correlation of the answers of separate questions. The discriminative ability was determined by means of intra-class-correlation (ICC) scores of the new scales and items. Subsequently, the statistical quality of new scales (and items) was tested by determining the intra-class-correlation (ICC), factor loadings, item-total-cor - relation (ITC) and Crohnbach's alpha if item deleted. Also, inter-factor-correlations be - tween both new and original scales were calculated. 43 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine3.2.3 Phase 3: Modelling and selection of new items In order to decide which items were to be enclosed in the final measurement instrument, general, statistical and theoretical criteria were followed. The general criterion was to only add a limited number of necessary items contributing to new reliable scales with addi - tional value. The statistical criteria were that items were part of a reliable scale and had inter-item-correlation <0,7. The theoretical criteria concerned the content of AH. The final decision per item was made in dialogue with the Dutch anthroposophic GP's occupational association and the Dutch anthroposophic patient organisation. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Phase 1: Anthroposophic quality aspects Literature study The Dutch patient organisation for AH formulated their quality criteria of AH in 9 do - mains: Autonomy, Treatment attitude, Support, Therapy, Expertise, Information, Accom - modation, Organisation, and Professional regulation (PPAG 2002). The following validat - ed questionnaires Jeu - gdthermometer (GGZ 2005). Three non-validated questionnaires from three healthcare centres were also used. Focus groups Specific aspects that are associated with anthroposophic care mentioned in the focus groups are (amongst others): Being heard as a human being; individually tailored care; attention to physiological self-healing; autonomy of the patient; deeper insight in one own health problem; less side effects; body, soul and mind as a unity; conscious integration of spirituality or view on life within treatment; interdisciplinary cooperation; enough time for the patient and possibility of choosing for conventional and/or anthroposophic treatment. In the focus groups the following domains of AH have been formulated: Practice/ organisation, Cooperation between healthcare professionals, Life vision and spirituality, Therapeutic relationship, Physiological self-healing, self-management, Individually tai - lored care, Expertise and insight, Structure of treatment and Healing Environment. These domains led to the formulation of 27 additional items. These items were added to the existing experiences questionnaire CQ-index GP and reformulated into an item-importance 44 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinequestionnaire (only AH items). 3.3.2 Phase 2: Validation of the CQ-Index AH Response rate The experience questionnaire had a gross response rate of 35,4% and a net response rate of 30,6 % (NGP=2063) (Table 3.1). The item-importance questionnaire had a response rate of respectively 35,2% and 32,2% (NIM=315). (Table 3.1) 65% of the responders were female and 35% were male. The mean age of the responders was 54 years (sd=15) (Table 3.2). The responders are on average high educated. More than 55% had a HBO*1 or university education. 78% considered his or her general health good to excellent. 14% had used the possibility to answer the questionnaire on paper instead of online. In compar - ison with the sample, women responded more often (experience: p<0,000, item-impor - tance: not significant) as well as people aged >45 years (experience and item-importance: p<0,000). * university of applied sciences 45 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineTable 3.1 Response analysis NGP % of Net sample % of Gross response NIM % of Net Sample Gross sample 6910 1000 Not registered at GP 100 20 No visit in last 12 months 75 - Younger than 18 2 1 Net sample 6733 100% 979 100% Non response with notification 23 9 Recently died 4 - Non response without notification 4322 625 Gross response 2384 35,4% 100% 345 35,2% Not completed questionnaires (digital) 281 26 Less than 50% of compulsory questions 2 - Paper and digital 2 - Only therapist questionnaire 36 - Other - 4 Net Respons e 2063 30,6 % 86,4% 315 32,2% Table 3.2 Sample and response: age and gender Net sample Net response Experience 6733 2063 % male 38,9 34,8 (15,40) % under 45 years 40,8 45 years and above 59,2 74,9 Item -importance 979 315 % male 38,1 Age, mean (14,63) % under 45 years 39,1 24,4 % 45 years and above 60,9 75,6 46 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Item analysis There were 4 items with high percentages (>50%) missing and no items with extreme skewness. 8 items had a high inter-correlation (r>0,7) with one or more other items.

A fourth factor analysis confirmed the newly constructed scales and showed only minor shifts in factor loadings. Scale construction Finally, two new scales regarding AH were constructed. The first scale contains items about the treatment attitude of the GP and the therapeutic relationship between the GP and the patient. This scale is called InteractionalStyleGP . The second scale contains items concerning the content of the anthroposophic approach within the treatment from the GP. This scale is called AnthroposophicTreatment .

Both new scales have their highest correlation with the existing GP TailoredCare scale ( Anthro - posophicTreatment : r=0,56; InteractionalStyleGP : r=0,76). The correlation between the two new GP scales is r=0,50. The AnthroposophicTreatment scale has low to moderate correla - tions with all other scales. 52 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative values ( InteractionalStyleGP : ICC=5,7; AnthroposophicTreatment : ICC=4,2) demon - strate that these scales are able to determine small though statistically significant differ - ences between the GP practices. Table 3.6 Pearson's correlations between existing and new anthroposophic scales InteractionalStyleGP scales GP AH scores The mean overall value for patients' global rating of the GP practices is 8,4 (range 0-10; sd=1,2). The mean scale scores, following the answer categories, (range 1(never) - 4(always)) are: InteractionalStyleGP : 3,6; AnthroposophicTreatment : 3,1 (Table 3.5). The mean scale scores equal the answer categories usually and always. The mean overall value and the mean scale scores demonstrate an overall positive image of the anthroposophic GP care. 3.3.3 Phase 3: Final questionnaire The final questionnaire consists of the complete CQ-Index GP added with two anthropos - ophic scales. The scale InteractionalStyleGP contains five items. The scale Anthroposophic - Treatment contains seven items. Four items remain singular items because of their impor - tance for AH. The complete final questionnaire is available as additional digital file. 3.4 Discussion In this study a CQ-index AH has been constructed and tested among 2063 patients in 22 GP practices. The CQ-index AH contains the complete CQ-Index General Practice, two new anthroposophic scales and four singular items. The internal consistency of the two new scales is sufficient and the discriminating ability of the two new GP scales is small though statistically significant. 53 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine The results of the measurement of client experiences in AH practices are posi - tive. The mean scale scores demonstrate positive experiences with anthroposophic care. The anthroposophic GP practices are valued with a mean of 8,4 on a scale from 0 to 10. The recommendation to invite people to an online questionnaire has been successfully brought in practice: 87% of the responders used the Internet. The general response was lower than expected, though the difference between the gross and the net response was small. Due to the digital data collection most of the questionnaires (86,4%) could be used for analysis. It seems obvious to think that the relatively low response rate was related to the comprehension of the added questions and the length of the questionnaire. However, this does not show up from the number of people who started, but did not finish the question - naire. Also, there is hardly any difference in response percentage between the relatively long experiences questionnaire and the relatively short item-importance questionnaire. The most explicit characteristics of the responders are the high percentage of higher education and the majority being female and over 45 years of age. These charac - teristics differ only slightly from the international research (Kienle et al. 2006) about the socio-demographics of the users of AH. Kienle et al. (2006) demonstrates that anthropo - sophic treatment is used particularly by well-educated women aged between 30 and 50 years. The adding of the two new scales demonstrates that it is possible to measure patients' experiences with stimulation of physiological self-healing, the active contribution to one's own health, the doctor-patient relationship, and the interactional style of the healthcare professional. Previous research on the Consumer Quality Index has demonstrated the impor - tance of the doctor-patient relationship and communication. Patients' global rating of their healthcare is strongly determined by their experiences with interpersonal aspects of care and doctor-patient communication (De Boer et al. 2010). By adding these aspects the CQ-Index AH enhances the CQ-Index structure and extends the theory of client experienc - es with healthcare in general. The factor analyses demonstrate that the items regarding self-management in combination with other anthroposophic treatment items make a good independent scale. The correlation of this scale ( AnthroposophicTreatment ) with all other GP-scales is small to moderate. The highest correlation of both new scales is found with the scale Taylored - Care (AnthroposophicTreatment: r=0,56; p<0,05 and InteractionalStyleGP: r=0,76; p<0,05). is also high correlation between InteractionalStyleGP and resp. GP Conduct (r=0,70;p<0,05) and GP Communication (r=0,75;p<0,05). These correlations demonstrate that the anthroposophic aspects of care are relatively strongly related to individually tai - lored care and a social handling focussed on having an alliance with the individual human 54 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinebeing. Patients especially value this mentality or treatment attitude. This is an important reason why the scale InteractionalStyleGP is maintained, despite its high correlation with these three scales. Further research needs to be done among a patient population of both anthroposophic and conventional GP's to determine if and how these scales can be integrated in order to reduce the amount of items. The rating of the anthroposophic GPs is slightly higher than the mean rating of the conventional GPs (8,2) measured in 2008 (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008) and 0,5 point higher than the mean rating of GPs in 2010 (7,9) (Donselaar et al. 2010). To illus - trate: other mean ratings are (for example): Asthma care: 7,7 (Heijmans et al. 2009). Since the anthroposophic aspects are part of a broader approach to practicing healthcare, emerging in the current developments of self-management, tai - lored care and health promotion it would be interesting to measure the anthroposophic items in conventional GP practices. 3.4.1 Limitations One of the limitations of this study regards the general response. Compared to the pilot study in 2008 the response was again lower than expected. The recommendations from this previous study to invite only the people who have been to their GP in the last year and only people from 18 years and older have not led to a higher response. Another limitation of this study is the discriminating ability of the instrument. The small though statistically significant discriminating ability enables this instrument of measuring differences between practices, although possibly large samples are needed. Supplemented research about the size of these samples is recommended here. Its discriminating ability might be higher and more relevant if tested among conventional and anthroposophic practices together. However, the expectations should not be too high, because the discriminative ability of patient experience surveys is sometimes rather limit - ed (De Boer et al. 2011). 3.4.2 Future perspectives With the development of the CQ-Index AH there is a standardized and validated instrument to measure patient experiences within the AH systematically and take account of the quality of AH from the patients' perspective. The future perspectives of this instrument are the pos - sibility of comparing anthroposophic institutes and groups of professionals, meeting future criteria regarding monitoring and assuring the quality of healthcare, and the possibility of benchmarking within general and anthroposophic healthcare. The recommendations of this study are further research of the discriminating ability of the CQ-index AH and testing of the new scales among non-AH populations in order to investigate and compare the prevalence 55 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineof a broader way of practicing healthcare among other GP practices. 3.4.3 Conclusion The CQ-index AH measures patient experiences within AH validly and reliably. The quality of AH in the Netherlands is good. The CQ-index AH enables AH to take account of the quality of healthcare from the patients' perspective systematically and in a standardized way. This is of great importance for the future perspectives of AH.

(Submitted)58 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Background: Patient-reported quality of care is increasingly important in the evaluation of healthcare performance. In order to explore explanations for differences in overall experience from patients, this study compared patient experiences of Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) general practitioner (GP) practices with those of conventional GP practices and tested three possible explanations for the observed differences, namely, differences in patient characteristics, in aspects of care, and in expectations. Methods: A database containing patient experiences collected with the Consumer Quali - ty (CQ)-Index from AM GP practices (2063 patients) was merged with two databases con - taining CQ-Index data from conventional GP practices (9632 patients). Influence of patient background characteristics and aspects of care on overall experience ( Experience rating and Recommendation ) was tested by linear regression. Influence of expectation was tested by linear regression within the AM database. Results: Most analysed factors influence both Experience rating and Recommendation. Patient characteristic Age, Diminishing health problems, and care aspects GP Communication, GP Conduct and Practice Assistant have the largest impact on overall experience. The influence of kind of care (AM vs CM) on overall experience is small. A deliberate choice for AM has no influence on overall experience. Considered added value of AM affects the extent to which people recommend the practice to their family and friends. Conclusion: Care aspects GP Communication, GP Conduct and Practice Assistant, and Age and Diminishing health problems have the largest influence on Experience rating and Recommendation . Considered added value of AM affects Recommendation , but not Experience rating . 59 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine4.1 Introduction Patient-reported quality of care is becoming increasingly important in the evaluation of healthcare performance (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Sixma et al. 1998, Kessel et al. 2014, Wiering 2018). One way of measuring this is by using Patient Reported Experience Mea - sures (PREMs), which focus on process aspects of care. In the Netherlands, the Consumer Quality Index (CQ-Index) has served as an important instrument to measure Patient Re - ported Experiences (PREs) in the last ten years. Measuring PREs and developing instruments to measure PREs have largely taken place within conventional healthcare (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008, Adams and Robin - son 2013, Kessel et al. 2014, Wiering 2018). However, those instruments are also relevant for Integrative Medicine (IM) (Adams and Robinson 2013), which embraces a broader definition of healthcare than conventional medicine (CM), defined as: \"the practice of med - icine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing\" (NCCIH 2018). IM is practiced worldwide and the attention both from patients, professional, providers and researchers within Europe is growing (Jong et al. 2012, Fischer et al. 2014, Hart 2018). Patients experience additional value from IM in comparison with CM (Wapf and Busato 2007, Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012), which might be an important mo - tivation for using this care. Therefore it is very relevant to measure PREs in IM. This way it is possible to check the existence of the added value and investigate which aspects of care might contribute to this experienced added value. A form of IM that has originated in Europe is Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) (Kienle et al. 2013). AM is an integrative medical system based on all knowledge of CM combined and integrated with a holistic understand - ing of man and nature, based on AM worldview (Hamre et al. 2005, Arman et al. 2011, Kienle et al. 2013, Baars et al. 2018), which, according to patients, contributes to its added value (Baars et al. 2017). In recent decades, both the biomedical quality of AM and its pa - tient-reported quality have become more transparent (Kienle et al. 2011). Patient-reported quality of anthroposophic primary care has been studied in AM General Practitioner (GP) practices using the CQ-Index General Practice (CQI-GP) (Koster et al. 2014). This study showed that PREs with anthroposophic general practitioner (GP) practices were good (8.4 on a scale from 1-10) and valued higher (on average 0.25 points) than patient experiences with conventional GP practices. Why these differences occur and whether they are statistically significant has not been investigated. Three possible explanations are suggested: differences in patient char - acteristics, differences in aspects of care or differences in expectations. The first explana -60 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinetion arises from the fact that the AM population differs from the CM population. Patients that use AM are on average more often female, middle aged and higher educated (Kienle et al. 2006, Arman et al. 2011, Koster et al. 2014) than patients in conventional practices. A second explanation might be the added value of AM. Several recent studies have focussed on revealing, clarifying and scientifically underpinning specific aspects of AM. These aspects (may) have added value for scientific theory formation, for clinical prac - tice, as well as for self-management for patients. Examples of these aspects are a holistic and spiritual worldview (Baars and Hamre 2017, Baars et al. 2017, Baars et al. 2018), an individualized treatment approach, the combination of fighting disease and the promotion of health (Baars 2011) and AM's view and practices on supporting self-management self-regulation (Baars and Hamre 2017, Baars et al. 2017). A third explanation lies in the assumption that a part of the patients who attend AM practices have chosen their GP intentionally. This deliberate choice might have an effect on the valuation of the received care. Assuming that cognitive dissonance (Redelmeier and Dickinson 2011) plays a role in the way patients value the care they have received, it can be argued that people who make conscious deliberate decisions are more likely to be satisfied with the result of their choice. In order to explore possible explanations for differences in overall experience from patients, this study compared PREMs in AM GP practices with those of CM GP prac - tices and tested three possible explanations for the observed difference in overall evalua - tion of the quality of AM. 4.2 Methods 4.2.1 Design The databases of three cross-sectional studies were merged. One database contained patient experiences collected with the CQ-Index General Practice care (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008, 2009) from AM GP practices and two databases contained CQ-Index data from conventional GP practices. Influence of background characteristics and aspects of care on overall experience was tested by linear regression. Influence of deliberate choice was tested by linear regression within the AM database. 4.2.2 The Consumer Quality Index (CQI) General Practice The CQ-Index General Practice contains 56 items and five subscales: Accessibility, Practice Assistant, GP Conduct, GP Communication and Tailored Care (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008) on which patients can rate their experience on a scale from one to four (1: never, 2: 61 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinesometimes, 3: most of the times, 4: always), where four is the best score. In the current study, overall experience with received care was assessed using two items: 1) A general rating of the general practice on a scale from zero to ten; and 2) The likelihood of rec - ommending the general practice to family and/or friends on a scale from one to four (1: absolutely not, 2: probably not, 3: probably, 4: certainly). Aspects of care that were tested comprised the subscales of CQI ( Accessibility, Practice Assistant, GP Conduct, GP Communi - cation and Tailored Care ) and the extent in which \"health problems were diminished\". 4.2.3 Other data The following background characteristics were assessed: age, gender, education, general health, mental health and ethnicity (Damman et al. 2011). Two additional questions to CQI were posed to patients in AM GP practices: 1. \"Did you choose deliberately for an AM practice?\" (yes/no), and 2. \"If so, for what reason?\" (multiple choice). Patients who ticked the answer \"... because AM has an added value\" were considered to be possibly biased in their judgement, since cognitive dissonance might play a role. This effect was investigated by analysing the two extra variables: Deliberate choice and Considered added value of AM . 4.2.4 Selection of databases Three existing databases were suitable for comparison. Database 1. AM GP practices Database 1 contained data of 22 anthroposophic GP practices located across The Nether - lands. The total number of patients was 2063. This sample was used in the construction and validation of the CQ-index Anthroposophic Healthcare in which two new AM scales were developed in addition to the existing GP scales. All details of the data collection can be found in Koster et al. (2014). For the current comparison, only original items and scales from the CQ-Index General Practice care were used. Additionally, patients from AM prac - tices were asked about their motivation for choosing an AM GP practice. Database 2. Northern region of the Netherlands (conventional GPs) Database 2 was generated to test four methods for distributing the questionnaire in 44 practices in the northern part of the Netherlands. The total number of patients was 4084. Details about the data collection are reported in Sixma et al. (2011). Database 3. Initial validation of the CQ Index (conventional GPs) Database 3 was generated during the initial construction and validation of the CQI for GP practices. It contained a sample of 17 practices in the Rotterdam area and 15 practices in the province of Drenthe. The total number of patients was 5548. Details about the data 62 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecollection are reported by Meuwissen and De Bakker (2009). 4.2.5 Analyses Differences in descriptive statistics between AM and conventional GP patients were displayed. P-values were calculated using chi-square when variables were nominal and using independent sample t-test for scale or ordinal variables. To provide insight in the influence of population characteristics on overall experience, linear regression analyses were conducted with background variables as independent variables and Experience rating and Recommendation as dependant variables. To provide insight in the influence of aspects of care, these variables were added to the linear regression analyses as indepen - dent variables. Finally, the influence of deliberately choosing for AM was analysed using the AMdatabase. Two additional factors (1. Deliberate choice, and 2. Considered added value) were added to the linear regression analysis in the AM database. 4.3 Results 4.3.1 Background characteristics Between the two patient groups (AM and CM) small though significant differences in background characteristics were identified (Table 4.1). Patients in the AM group were slightly older, had a higher level of education, were more often female and had a slightly better physical health. Psychological health scored somewhat lower in the AM group. 63 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineTable 4.1 Background characteristics and CQ-Index scores from Anthroposophic (AM) and Conventional (CM) General Practice care AM CM P-value Data 1 Total Data 2 Data 3 N=2063 N=9632 44 54 64 74 (.77) 2.97 0.01** health: 1 -5, mean (SD) 3.22 (.86) 3.30 (.88) 3.36 (.87) 3.25 (.89) 0.01** Diminishing health problem: 1 -4, mean (SD) 3.16 (.67) 3.21 (.72) 3.17 (.69) 3.24 (.74) <0.001** Scale Accessibility: 1 -4, mean 3.42 3.23 (.82) 2.94 (.55) 3.42 (.92) <0.001** Scale Assistant: 1- 4, mean (SD) 3.72 (.40) 3.51 (.54) 3.37 (.45) 3.61 (.58) <0.001** Scale GP Conduct: 1 -4, mean (SD) 3.83 (.33) 3.79 (.41) 3.80 (.39) 3.77 (.42) <0.001** Scale GP Communication: 1 -4, mean (SD) 3.77 (.43) 3.64 (.50) 3.69 (.46) 3.61 (.53) <0.001** Scale Tailored care: 1 -4, mean (SD) 3.50 (.55) 3.64 (.76) 3.59 (.76) 3.67 (.76) <0.001** Rating (1 -10), mean (SD) 8.39(1.23) 8.14 (1.25) 8.09 (1.18) 8.17 (1.29) <0.001** Recommendation (1- 4), mean (SD) 3.54 (.63) 3.47 (.67) 3.50 (.64) 3.46 (.67) <0.001** * Chi -square, ** T -test 4.3.2 Influence of AM vs CM Conform the observed results in previous research, AM practices scored significantly 64 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinehigher than CM practices, both in Experience rating and in Recommendation (table 4.1). As expected, small significant differences between the AM and CM populations existed (table 4.1). When controlling for 'aspects of care' and 'background characteristics' (table 4.2) these differences seem to be partially responsible for the higher scores in AM. Also after controlling for 'aspects of care' and 'background characteristics', the influence of kind of care (AM vs CM) changes: although the kind of care that is provided stays a factor influencing the experience and recommendation of care, the characteristics of this relationship changes. This generates the outcome that AM still provides slightly better experience ratings whereas CM instead of AM has slightly better recommendation scores. 4.3.3 Influence of background characteristics The regression analysis (table 4.2) demonstrates that various background characteristics influence Experience ratings and Recommendation . In general, background characteristics seem to influence Experience rating more than they affect Recommendation : all background characteristics, except for Mental health , influence Rating, whereas only Age, Gender and Mental health influence Recommendation . Age and Gender are the most influential char - acteristics; they have a small significant effect on both Experience Rating and Recommen - dation . Ethnicity, Education, Physical and Mental health are less influential, since they only have an effect on either Experience rating or Recommendation . 65 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 4.2 Linear regression: Influence of care, controlled for background characteristics, CQ -Index scales and diminishing health problem Dependent = rating (1 -10) Dependent = recommending practice (scale 1 -4) B St error Stand.

AM scores slightly worse on Diminishing health problems and Tailored care (table 4.1). To determine if these factors in themselves influence Experience rating and Rec- ommendation and might explain differences in AM vs CM scores, CQI subscales and the question about 'diminishing health problems' were added to the regression model. The regression analysis (table 4.2) confirmed the hypothesis that these factors partly explain a difference in overall experience. Most factors influence both Experience rating and Recom - mendation . The factor Tailored care is the only exception; this factor only explains variation in Recommendation . GP Communication seems to be the most important factor affecting both Experience rating (Stand. B= 0.285) and Recommendation (Stand. B= 0.321) followed by GP Conduct (Stand. B=0.198 and 0.125 resp.) 4.3.5 AM as deliberate choice In the third regression analysis, the variables Deliberate choice and Considered added value of AM were added to the model in the AM database (table 4.3). The analysis shows that a deliberate choice for AM as such had no influence on the way people value their overall experiences: neither on Experience rating or Recommendation a significant influence was seen. However, when making this deliberate choice for AM because of considered added value, a significant positive effect (0.141, p<0.05) on people recommending the practice to their family and friends arises. 67 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 4.3 Linear regression: influence of deliberate choice for AM, controlled for background characteristics, CQ-Index scales and diminishing health problem Dependent = rating (1 -10) Dependent = recommending practice (scale 1 -4) B St error Stand.

Three explanations for these differences were hypothesised and analysed in this study: differences in patient characteristics, differences in aspects of care and differences in expectations. Three existing databases with CQI-GP data (one with 2063 patients of AM GP practices and two databases with in total 9636 patients of CM GP practices) were analysed. Regression analysis with background characteristics of patients and aspects of care demonstrated that many factors influence patients Experience rating and Recom - mendation . Most factors influence both (except Mental health, Physical health, Ethnicity, Education and Tailored care ) and GP Communication seems to be the most important factor followed by GP Conduct and Practice Assistant. These three factors have the largest impact on both outcomes: Experience rating and Recommendation . Also Age and Diminishing health problems seem to be important factors attributing to Experience rating . The regression analyses also demonstrated that influence of kind of care (AM vs CM) on both outcomes is small. After controlling for background characteristics AM still provides slightly better experience ratings, whereas CM instead of AM has slightly better recommendation scores. Regarding expectations, the analyses show that a deliberate choice for AM has no influence on overall experience. The means that the principle of cognitive dissonance does not apply to patients' experiences regarding the quality of AM. In addition, this find - ing does not provide a logic explanation of an interaction between patient characteristic and care aspects. Following, if people considered AM to have added value, it does have an effect on the extent to which people recommend the practice to their family and friends. This result coincides with what one would logically expect: if people are convinced of the benefits of a particular kind of care, they are more likely to recommend it to others. This finding could contribute to a possible interaction. The importance of this study is threefold. Firstly, the study clarifies which aspects of care in GP practices are important from patients' perspectives. The results demon - strate that the most important patient-reported aspects are the GP's communication with patients, the professional conduct of the GP, and the work of the practice assistant. Particular the influence of the work of the practice assistant is worthwhile to emphasis, because whereas GP Communication and GP Conduct are both qualities concerning the GP and relatively obvious aspects to influence patients experiences with GP care, Practice Assistant refers to qualities of a specific other person and function in the GP practice, which appeared to be a third important factor that influences patients' experience. How - ever, the importance of this aspect for patients is less obvious, relatively unknown and to 69 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineour knowledge only little research is dedicated to this aspect of GP care (Grimes 2008). Secondly, it is important to see that the evaluation of patient-reported quality of AM is not strongly biased by the fact that many patients deliberately choose for AM. This is in line with the position that AM envisages for itself, namely as a form of medicine that is not only relevant for a particular group of people or patients, but could benefit everyone (Kienle et al. 2006). Thirdly, previous research demonstrated that patient-reported quality of AM GP practices, measured with the validated PREM CQ-Index is good. The current analysis con - firms that this result still stands in comparison with a larger dataset from CM GP practices and when controlled for patient characteristics. This is an important finding supporting an evidence base of AM in general. One of the strengths of this study is the large sample size of the database: 2063 patients from AM practices and 9632 patients from CM practices. This is the first time that merged data from large-scale research could be analysed. It allowed for thorough compari - son of AM and CM, controlling for background and other characteristics. However, the fact remains that large numbers alone are no guarantee for valid conclusions. The differences in the samples of the three databases are one of the most important limitations of this study. Samples differ in inclusion (contact with GP in the previous year vs previous three months), area (throughout the Netherlands, Northern provinces, Rotterdam/Drenthe) and response rate (35% - 68%). Since this research, and other research (Li et al. 2016) shows that many factors influence experience rating and recommendation, it is not certain that all relevant confounding factors have been included in the regression model. Knowing that these samples slightly differ, results might origi - nate by artefacts caused by confounding. In addition the large sample size make that even small differences become statistically significant. Another limitation is that the data are relatively old. However, more recent suitable data was not available. A final limitation is the quantitative character of the study. Because the subscales reflect quite general aspects of care, specific aspects of AM are not measured with this CQ-Index GP. Future research should focus on comparing the scales between AM and CM with more recent data and with all known confounders. Secondly, it would be valuable to include the additional AM scales, in both AM and CM practices in future studies. Since the new scales with specific AM aspects that were developed in the construction of the CQ-In - dex AM share similarities with wider developments in healthcare, like patient-centred care, self-management, shared decision making and personalised healthcare, these so called ''AM aspects\" can be relevant for all patients. Finally, qualitative studies are necessary to deepen the insight on the influence of the work of the practice assistant on patient-re - ported experiences and quality of care and differences of the Practice Assistant in AM and CM. Qualitative studies are also needed to explore in more detail the influence of the AM 70 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineworldview on GP Conduct, GP Communication, Accessibility , Assistant, and Tailored Care as influencing aspects of care on PREs in AM GP practices. 71 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine 5.

(Published)72 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Purpose: To provide a qualitative investigation of aspects that matter to patients regard - ing quality of life (QOL) and other perceived treatment effects of anthroposophic health - care (AH). It is a first step in the development of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for AH. Hence, it will contribute to the evaluation of AH quality from patients' perspectives. Method: Within-method triangulation of four qualitative data sources: 1: Survey of 2063 patients of AH general practitioners; single open item. 2: Survey of 34 patients of AH nurses; single open item. 3 and 4: Sixteen semi-structured interviews with patients. The data sources contained patients' qualitative reports on contribution of treatment to QOL, other perceived treatment effects and/or quality of care aspects. Content analysis: construction of items and domains by open, axial and selective coding. Results: Twelve domains regarding quality of life are found: Recovery/Symptom reduc - tion, Func - tioning, Energy/strength, Care relationship, Natural healing, Mindful inner attitude, Being well informed, and Social life. The interviews demonstrate relations between domains. Conclusions: The findings give a comprehensive insight into aspects of care that are relevant to patients, providing a first step to develop PROMs for AH. Findings show a broadening of domains compared to existing measurement instruments and show close similarities with the recently developed concept of \"positive health\". Extending QOL instruments with a broader set of domains would give concrete tools to improve evalua - tion of quality of care and make this evaluation more in line with aspects that matter to AH patients. 73 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine5.1. Introduction In the last two decades patients' perspectives on quality of care have become increasingly important in the evaluation of healthcare performance (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Sixma et al. 1998). Patients' perspectives are addressed by measuring patient experiences - with consumer assessment questionnaires such as CQ-Index, CAHPS and QUOTE (Koopman et al. 2011) - as well as by measuring patient reported outcomes (PROs) (Turner et al. 2007, McKenna 2011, Boyce and Brown 2013, Kessel et al. 2014). Evaluating quality of care from patients' points of view is also relevant for In - tegrative Medicine (IM) and anthroposophic healthcare. IM is the practice of medicine, founded on four pillars: 1) it is informed by evidence, 2) it reaffirms the patient-practitioner relationship, 3) it focuses on the whole person and 4) it makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing (CAHCIM 2007, Greeson et al. 2008). IM is increasingly practiced worldwide (Frenkel et al. 2008, Xu and Chen 2011, Fischer et al. 2014). Anthroposophic healthcare (AH) is a form of IM, originating in Europe and cur - rently practiced in 80 countries worldwide (Kienle et al. 2013). It underlines the four pillars and integrates them in a whole system approach based on anthroposophic philosophy. AH uses all knowledge of conventional medicine and adds to it a holistic view on life and a focus on salutogenic health promotion (Baars 2005, Hamre et al. 2005, Baars and Van der Bie 2008, Arman et al. 2011, Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2013). AH encompasses multiple medical sectors, among which are general practice, specialists' care, nursing, child welfare centers (CWC) psychiatry and special needs care, and a variety of paramedic disciplines, for example, physiotherapy, art therapy, eurhythmy therapy and psychotherapy. The quality and quantity of the scientific underpinnings of AH are growing (Kien - le et al. 2006, Baars and Van der Bie 2008, Baars and Van der Bie 2009, Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Hamre et al. 2014). Recently, in the Netherlands, patient experiences with AH were measured by means of a CQ-Index AH (Koster et al. 2014). According to this study the service quality of AH and interpersonal relations between physicians and patients are good and general rating is slightly higher than of conventional healthcare (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2009). In addition, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of AH with similar methods as those used in other healthcare sectors, it is important to develop PRO-mea - sures (PROMs) for AH (Appleby 2012). To develop PROMs for a group of patients it is important to start with a qualita - tive phase in order to investigate what aspects of care are relevant to these patients (Wiering et al. 2016, Turner et al. 2007, McKenna 2011, Haywood et al. 2012, Trujols et al. 2013, Kessel et al. 2014). An important concept that is regarded to be particularly relevant to patients is Quality of life (QOL) (Boyce and Brown 2013, Corner et al. 2013, 74 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineLin et al. 2013). The QOL concept intends to cover all aspects of human experiences of what makes a life a good life (Fagerlind et al. 2010, Lin et al. 2013, De Smedt 2013). The concept QOL has been adapted in order to measure quality of life related to health and illness: Health-Related QOL (HRQOL) (Lin et al. 2013). Existing HRQOL measures are often used as PROMs, for example SF-36, EuroQol-5D and WHOQoL-BREF (Fagerlind et al. 2010, McKenna 2011, Haywood et al. 2012, Boyce and Brown 2013, Corner et al. 2013). Hence, QOL is used as an outcome factor in measuring quality of care. Often used do - mains of HRQOL are shown in table 5.1 (Aaronson et al. 1998, Skevington et al. 2004). Considering their general character these HRQOL measures could be used as PROMs in AH as well. However, being a form of integrative medicine AH encompasses more aspects of life than conventional medicine. It is not know whether existing QOL measures will be sufficient to serve as PROMs for evaluating AH and whether these instruments measure what is relevant for AH patients. An aspect that might be important for the development of good PROMs for AH is the fact that within AH the centrality of patients within their own treatment is very strong. Patients are not only cared for according to their individual needs and preferenc - es, taking into account all aspects of human life, but also patients are actively stimulated to care for themselves, to contribute to their own health and are provided with practical guidance to do so (Ketelaars et al. 2001, Kienle et al. 2006). Because AH is being practiced for over 90 years (Kienle et al. 2013), one can say that AH practices patient centred care (PCC) avant la lettre . Therefore, this characteristic of AH might not only be important in developing good PROMs for AH, but also it might be relevant for the further development of PROMs in general. Overall, it is important to start with a general and open investigation. Table 5.1 HR-QOL domains often used EuroQoL -5D SF-36 WHOQOL -BREF Mobility Physical functioning Physical Self-management Limitations caused by physical problems Psychological Pain and other complaints Pain Environmental Daily activities Perceived general health Social Fear and depression Limitations caused by emotional problems Vitality Mental health Social functioning 75 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineThis study Addressing the importance of a qualitative phase regarding the development of PROMs this study aims to provide a comprehensive insight into outcome aspects of care that are important to AH patients. The study investigates how treatment influences and effects QOL from the perspective of patients, and does so without a theoretical preconstruction of QOL. The study focuses on actual experiences with treatment and its effect on QOL rath - er than collecting patients' ideas and opinions on how treatment should contribute to QOL. In addition, the study investigates other perceived treatment effects and aspects of care that matter to patients. The study will be a first step in developing new PROMs or choosing appropriate existing PROMs to evaluate outcomes of AH. Hence, it will contribute to the evaluation and accountability of the quality of AH from patients' perspective. In addition, the results might provide valuable information for the further development of PROMs in general The following research questions were addressed: 1. How do patients experience AH treatment and its effects on their health and QOL? 2. What are characteristics of AH contributing to quality of care from the perspectives of patients treated by AH professionals? 5.2. Method The research design encompassed secondary analyses on existing qualitative data from earlier studies, collected using within-method triangulation (Shih 1998, Thurmond 2001) of four different data sources and two different data collection procedures: surveys and in-depth interviews. Researchers used an inductive method in the sense that the analyses were performed sequentially, however, the data collection had taken place in tandem. The order of analyses was decided based on the size and collection method of the data sources: first the largest data source, followed by the second largest one, both short single open items. After that the interviews were analysed in order to deepen the insight. 5.2.1 Data collection Details of the data collection are shown in table 5.2 Data source 1 Data source one (DS1) contained the results of a qualitative survey amongst 2,063 pa - tients of anthroposophic general practitioners (GPs). The respondents of the CQ-Index AH were asked: Did the treatment contribute positively to your quality of life? Followed by: If so, 76 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecould you point out how? Respondents gave a short open answer. The data collection was part of the validation study of the CQ-Index AH (Koster et al. 2014). Data source 2 Data source two (DS2) contained the results of a qualitative survey amongst 34 patients of anthroposophic nurses, who treated their patients with external applications therapy (massages, packs and baths with oils, essences and/or ointments). Therapy consisted of 12 one-hour sessions. Patients were asked about perceived treatment effects by com - pleting the following sentence: \" Often when I have had external application treatment:...\" Respondents gave a short open answer. The item was part of an outcome questionnaire within a pilot project developing a Routine Outcome Monitoring procedure in external applications therapy (Baars 2012a). It was asked at three points in time: after respectively four (t=1), eight (t=2) and twelve (t=3) sessions. Data source 3 Data source three (DS3) contained the results of six semi-structured interviews with pa - tients evaluating their experiences with an anthroposophic care program for depression (Ponstein 2011). The topic list included: evaluation of treatment, provider-patient relation - ship, perceived treatment effects, and view on illness and health. The interviews were part of a pilot study developing the care program. The patients were recruited from participat - ing GP practices. Inclusion was based on severity of depression, using PHQ-9 question - naire (Kroenke et al. 2001). Data source 4 Data source four (DS4) contained the results of ten semi-structured interviews with patients of AH treatment of various disciplines. The main theme of the interviews was patients' experiences with health promotion. The topic list included: one's own role regarding treatment and health promotion; coping with pain and anguish; responsibility of provider and patient; role of AH regarding health promotion; individual needs regarding health promotion and support. Respondents were selected from the Dutch anthroposoph - ic patients' organisation. Illnesses of respondents varied between minor illnesses (e.g. colds, low HB), chronic diseases, combinations of mental and physical illnesses, allergies, aging problems, and life-threatening diseases (e.g. hart failure and cancer). 77 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 5.2 Details on data collection Data source Earlier study Collection method Data collection Period Population Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Question/ Topic list Data collection by researcher DS1 Validation study CQ-Index Anthroposphic Healthcare Survey Single open item with a short open answer Sept 2010 - April 2011 Patients of anthroposophic GPs All patients participating in the validation study. >18 years of age CQ-Index participation in the last 12 months Did the treatment contrib ute positively to your quality of life?

Details on applying the coding process are explained in table 5.6. The amount of answers suggests that sufficient data saturation will be likely, which will be discussed in the discussion section. Phase 1 DS1 was open coded by two researchers individually (EK, NR) and subsequently checked on four methodological criteria - overlap with other items, ambiguity, singularity, and concreteness (NCGG 1995). Answers with overlap, those that were ambiguous or lacked concreteness were deleted. To prevent loosing important information answers containing more than one aspect were split. These were coded and again checked for each item indi - vidually. Researchers each made an independent coding list. After individual coding the re - searchers discussed and integrated both coding lists. Thereafter axial coding was applied. Phase 2 The individual items were clustered into domains and these were given a preliminary label. Five co-workers (EK, NR, EB, ETK, AB) discussed the clusters. Within this group doubts and different interpretations were discussed for each item, resulting in a consensus-based list of domains. Phase 3 The coding list was applied to the open answers of DS2. The answers were checked for the same methodological criteria as DS1 and deleted or split the same way. Similarities, differ - ences and additions were integrated into the coding list and necessary adjustments were made to the domains. Phase 4 DS3 and DS4 were analysed using selective coding (Wester 1987/1995, Strauss and Corbin 80 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine1990). Consequently, labelled domains were compared to the found themes in the inter - views. Researchers specifically looked at commonalities between the themes found in the different data sources, and the interpretations of those themes by the respondents in the interviews. The domains were extended and refined accordingly. Then, researchers looked for specific relations between different domains. During the coding process text passages emerged coded with more than one domain. The relationship between domains in the par - ticular passage was analysed from the content of this passage. After these final analyses the domains were given definitive labels. 81 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineTable 5.6 Details on content analysis process Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Data source DS1 DS1 DS2 DS3 and DS4 Analysis on item level Open coding: Labelling all individual answers by two researchers independently.

A list of all domains and items is given in table 7. All answers of DS2 correspond with seven domains of DS1: Active contribution/Autonomy, General wellbeing, Rest/Relaxation, Functioning, Energy/strength, Natural healing, Mindful inner attitude. All domains from DS1 and DS2 are covered by the content of DS3 and one domain is added: Social relationships. In contrast to DS1 and DS2, answers of DS3 had more ex - plicit attention for characteristics of one's treatment, regardless its effect. Most frequently mentioned in DS3 is the involvement of patients' GP and therapists with the patient. Peo - ple valued their treatment especially for the way that it suits, for example, their situation, personality, preferences, worldview and/or their life. The treatment is personally tailored regarding all aspects of life. This way, patients are seen and heard as whole human beings. The theme of personally tailored treatment is not added to the domains, because aspects of it are grouped in other domains, according to their content. Answers of DS4 were main - ly focused on self-regulation (domain: Natural Healing), tools for coping (Active contribution/ Autonomy), Functioning, Mindful inner attitude and Meaning . A new item that emerged was contact with nature (Active contribution/Autonomy) . 5.3.2 Relationships between domains The stories from the interviews showed that domains and subdomains interact with each other. From this interaction relationships could be interpreted. First the relationship is described, and then this is illustrated with quotes from the interviews. Active contribution/autonomy, Rest/relaxation, Functioning, General well being and self- regulation, Self-regulation was related to several other (sub)domains. Domains like Active contribu - tion/autonomy and Rest/relaxation turned out to function as an investment in respondents' self-regulation. The respondents actively endeavored a lifestyle with sufficient room for their self-regulation to function properly. Aspects of this lifestyle were: good food, physical exercise, rest, daily rhythm, doing enjoyable things and contact with nature. Respondents described the positive effects as \" recharging \". Other domains, like Functioning and General wellbeing turned out to benefit from a well-maintained self-regulation. Recharging enabled respondents to function better or, like a respondent said: \" to look at the world as fresh and friendly again\" (DS4) . Because the investment and benefit partly overlapped a loop of posi - 83 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinetive feedback could develop in maintaining a well-functioning self-regulating ability. Positive awareness and self-regulation Being aware of one's own body increased the contact with one's self-regulating ability and improved one's general wellbeing. Respondent: \" Rhythmic massages made me feel stronger and reduced my stress symptoms\" (DS4). Faith regarding one's self-regulating ability turned out to be a crucial factor here. Respondent: \" Maintaining faith [EK: in the treatment process] is an active process that constantly needs attention\" and: \"I've always said: This is not going to make me die\" (DS4). Active contribution/autonomy and Being well informed Several domains were used as resources regarding active contribution and autonomy. The respondents deemed it essential to be well informed to be able to make their own choices fitting their own personal preferences and situation. Respondent: \"To have different possi - bilities to choose, no matter how small, helped me to feel less overwhelmed by everything, (...) by making the little steps I had chosen myself I could get used to changing situations easier and that made me cope with and accept the current situation better\" (DS4). Being well informed, Functioning and Meaning Respondents valued a thorough insight of 'what is going on'. This insight enabled them to give meaning to their own situation. This meaning influenced patients' inner attitude towards their impairment positively and that improved integration of it within daily func - tioning. Respondents asked themselves how their daily functioning contributes to their impairment and what they can do to reduce the symptoms. One respondent argued that healing is only possible after you have accepted your problem and it's fallen into place. Respondent: \"You have to embrace your illness\" (DS4). Meaning and Care relation An open, holistic view from the care provider contributed to an equal care relationship in which the patient experienced that he/she is fully seen and heard as a whole human being. One respondent feels heard \"...because he [EK: care provider] asks questions and truly looks at what is going on with me\" (DS3) . Another respondent: \"You just want to be seen as a person\" (DS3). Active contribution, Self-regulation and Care relation An active contribution to one's own health was anchored within an involved and equal care relationship. Respondent: \" Doctors should ask: what would help you, in your situation? \" (DS4). In the common search for an individually tailored treatment there was much at - tention and support for self-regulation. The use of self-regulation offered the particular 84 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineindividual practical keystones for coping and, in doing so, increased possibilities to ac - tively contribute to one's own health. For instance, adapting previously mentioned lifestyle aspects to their individual treatment. This opened up a professional tailored form of self- care, embedded in their individual treatment. Subsequently, it offered additional possibil - ities to address previously unaddressed problems. Respondent: \" Keeping myself warm is a very simple and effective way to reduce the pain of my arthrosis\" (DS4). 85 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineTable 5.7 Total domains, subdomains and items (data source 1-4) Domains Subdomains Items Recovery/symptom reduction Specific illness recovery Specific symptom reduction Speed of recovery/symptom reduction Functioning* Physical functioning Mental coping Less absence Doing enjoyable things Assertiveness Balance work/relaxation Less surviving Natural healing* No/less adverse events No conventional medication Physiological self-regulation supported/used Treatment offers general support Specific physical reactions on treatment** Rest/relaxation* Better sleep during the night Satisfying tiredness** \"Rosy -ness\"** Care relation Trust and confidence in doctor Communication Human approach Being at ease Attention Being heard/seen Being understood Taken seriously Feeling supported General well-being* Feeling better (\"beter in mijn vel\") Feeling of optimism/ happiness/ lust for life Balance/wholeness/harmony Social relations*** Better partner relationship Better social life Close to family Energy/strength* Physical condition Balanced energy level Improved vitality Feeling physically stronger Stronger muscles Resilience Resistance Being well-informed Good information Monitoring Appeasement Relief 86 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 5.7 (following ) Domains Subdomains Items Mindful inner attitude* More Self awareness attention/awareness Emotional reactions on treatment** Body awareness Taking time for things** Positive Acceptance attention/awareness Emphasize on positive things Faith and hope Confidence in own body Meaning Insight regarding health and disease Giving meaning within the big picture Personal development Holistic vision Treatment fits own vision on life Active contribution/Autonomy* Keystones/tools for coping Own responsibility Grip/control/own -control Self-confidence Healthy lifestyle Food No-smoking Contact with nature*** * Domains corresponding with data source 2 ** New added items from data source 2 *** New added domain and item from data sources 3 and 4 5.4. Discussion This study investigated patients' experiences with AH treatment and its perceived effects on their health and QOL. It provides a comprehensive insight into aspects of QOL and AH that are relevant to AH patients. Hence, it reveals characteristics of AH that contribute to the quality of AH from patients' perspectives. Analyses of four data sources led to formulation of 12 domains, containing as - pects of AH treatment that contribute to patients' healing; Being well-informed; and Social relationships. The in-depth interviews provide insight into relation - ships between domains. The results show perceived effects of AH according to patients, and a wide vari - ety of treatment aspects contributing to patients' QOL. The aspects are intelligible, con - 87 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecrete and fit into relevant domains. Due to the amount and the similarity of answers the researchers expect that they have covered all possible domains. The richness and method - ological quality of the answers show that respondents are very well capable of reflecting on their QOL without responding to a theoretical preconstruction of the concept. The emphasis on direct experiences with received care contributes to the validity of the an - swers for practical use in comparison to answers based on ideas and opinions. The results show from different angles or perspectives, in different data sources, similar answers emerged. In the context of within-method triangulation these different perspectives con - tribute to the validity of the findings. The quality of the results enables this study to be used as starting point for the development of PROMs for AH. On a broader scale, the results will contribute to the sci - entific underpinnings of AH and a transparent, comprehending communication in- and outside its field. A limitation concerns the fact that the data collection methods are designed to serve the earlier studies in the first place. A second limitation concerns the fact that the answers are provided by patients from AH providers. Because this might be a specific patient group it challenges the generalizability of the findings. However, DS1 and DS3 included patients of GPs with a mixed practice population: some patients may have cho - sen their GP because of anthroposophic background; others simply because it was the closest available option, or other non-AH related reasons. Further research needs to be done to investigate differences in needs between different patient groups. The domains that emerged from the study partly overlap with the domains of existing instruments such as SF-36 (Aaronson et al. 1998), EuroQol and WHOQoL-BREF (Skevington et al. 2004). Functioning overlaps with Physical functioning (SF36) Mobility and Daily activities (EuroQol) and the Physical domain (WHOQoL), General well-being overlaps with Perceived general health (SF-36) and Overal (WHOQoL), Social relations overlaps with Social functioning (SF-36) and Social domain (WHOQoL), Recovery/symp - tom reduction overlaps with Pain (SF-36), and Pain and other complaints (EuroQol), and Energy/Strength overlaps with Vitality (SF-36). New items within these overlapping do - mains are: less surviving ( Functioning ), feelings of balance/wholeness/harmony ( wellbeing ), ) and resilience Energy/ Strength domains emerged: Active contribution/Autonomy, Mindful inner atti - tude, Being well informed, Care relation, Natural healing, Rest/relaxation and Meaning. The domain Active contribution/Autonomy seems to overlap with the domain Self-management from the EuroQol. However, on item level they show a different content. In addition, the aspect of Meaning is also present in the WHOQoL. However, it is present as a single item, being part of the psychological domain, while in the current study it emerges as a domain 88 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineof itself. Some of these domains, such as Being well informed and Care relation , are not new in evaluating healthcare performance. However, these are usually addressed as experience measures, for example in CQ-indexes (Koopman et al. 2011, Kessel et al. 2014), in stead of outcome measures, like PROMs. Altogether, the study demonstrates a broader view on health, QOL and outcomes of care from patients' perspectives then current HRQOL-in - struments. A broader view on health and QOL is also demonstrated in the work of Huber et al. (2011), who recently proposed to change the WHO-definition of health. They re-defined health as a dynamic construct based on \"the ability to adapt and self-manage \" (Huber et al. 2011). Extended research to the ability to operationalize the new definition provided six main dimensions: body functions, mental functions and perceiving, spirituality, quality of life, social and societal participation, and daily functioning (Huber et al. 2013) . Based on these dimensions Huber et al. developed the concept of \"positive health\" (Huber et al. 2013). This new view on health shows important similarities with the results in our re - search. Firstly, there is a close similarity in content between the domains of General wellbe - ing in this study and quality of life in Huber et al. (2011, 2013), particular the items of feel - ing better, happiness, lust for life, and balance. Secondly, both studies demonstrate the importance of autonomy, manageability, self-esteem, self-management and own control regarding health and QOL. Thirdly, both studies contain a full and separate domain for the aspect of meaning. This shows the importance of being able to give meaning to problems and situations in order to cope with them and live a \"full\" life. In addition, in both studies the aspect of self-regulation plays an important role. In Huber et al. (2011, 2013) it is very much connected with health in general, because it is present in the definition as the \"ability to adapt and to self-manage\", both physically and mentally. In our study self-regulation is present in, for example, the domain Natural heal - ing, as physiological self-regulation and in the domain Active contribution/Autonomy, as tools for coping. In both studies it is the individual that contributes to its own recovery. The new concept of health has been widely recognized, in many different healthcare set - tings (Alivia et al. 2011, Van der Greef 2011, Rosenbaum and Gorter 2012, Timmermans 2013, D\u00f6ring et al. 2015). Also in the field of Psychology efforts have been made to broaden concepts of health and QOL. Seligman speaks of positive psychology, encompassing three domains: pleasure, engagement en meaning (Seligman et al. 2004, Lee Duckworth et al. 2005). Ryff named six domains of wellbeing: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with other, purpose in life and self-acceptance (Ryff and Keyes 1995). Moreover, the similarities between our study, the work of Huber et al., and similar work in the field of psychology imply that the results of the current study might be relevant for healthcare settings outside the field of AH as well. In addition, Ryffs domains are used to develop a 89 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinemeasurement instrument for evaluating wellbeing-therapy (Fava and Ruini 2003). This instrument might not only be useful in finding or constructing appropriate PROMs for AH, but also be relevant for complementing existing PROMs in other healthcare settings. Future research needs to investigate if PROMs for AH could be constructed from appropriate existing instruments or that a new instrument needs to be developed. If so, research should focus on prioritizing domains by patients and subsequently converting them into a validated measurement instrument. Future research also needs to investigate if patients of conventional medicine and other integrative medicine providers generate similar results. In general, to make evaluation of healthcare more in line with what is rele - vant for patients, QOL measures should be extended with a broader set of domains. And in doing so, it might be useful also to consider research in other fields, such as psycholo - gy, and integrate it into the field of medicine. Compliance with Ethical Standards Ethical approval: All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was exempted from a medical-ethics committee approval be - cause the study contained the monitoring and evaluation of current practice and participants were not subject to any experimental conduct or imposed behavior. However, all four data collection procedures are conducted in accordance with necessary ethical guidelines. Informed consent: Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic Integrative in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine: a scoping review, Patient Education and Counselling. (In Press )92 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Objective: To investigate how, and to what extent, patient-reported quality of care is measured in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine (AM/IM). Methods: Scoping review of evaluation studies of patient-reported quality of care and development studies of PREMs and/or PROMs in AM/IM, using five stages of Arksey's methodological framework. Search strategy: Literature search in twelve relevant databases. Data extraction: Basic information, added categories: Focus; PREMs/PROMs; Evaluation measures; Patient involvement; Use of results. Results : Sixty-four included studies: 30 quantitative, 20 qualitative and 14 mixed-meth - ods studies. Quantitative studies showed a wide variety of instruments and qualitative studies showed a meaningful list of evaluation themes. Most prevalent themes: Agency & Empowerment; Patient-provider relationship; Perceived - chological functioning; Inner awareness; Meaning; and General wellbeing. Seven studies report concrete, coherent, patient-derived evaluation measures with emphasis on PROMs and/or PREMs. Conclusion: Patient-reported quality of care was not measured in a standardised way. Knowledge gap: in general, quantitative studies lack patient-derived measures and quali - tative studies lack development of concrete evaluation measures. Many AM/IM evaluation aspects connect with patient-centred care. Practice implication: The international field of AM/IM would benefit from the develop - ment of a core set of validated PROMs and PREMs to further enhance its scientific under - pinning. 93 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine6.1 Introduction Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine (AM/IM) are promising forms of healthcare that have increased their scientific underpinnings enormously in the past ten years (Van Duin et al. 2009, Guarneri et al. 2010, Baars 2011, Hamre et al. 2014, Cramer and Chung 2016, Baars and Hamre 2017, Kienle et al. 2017, al. 2017, Van Vliet 2017, Baars et al. 2018). The American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM) and the Consortium of Academic Health Centres for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM) have defined Integrative Medicine (IM) as \" the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evi - dence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" (CAHCIM) Hence, IM practices a combination of conventional biomedical-based medicine and Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM) (Baars and Hamre 2017) Conven - tional bio-medical based medicine has been developed in Western countries and is rooted in the natural sciences (Bynum 2013). Traditional medicine is \" the sum total of the knowl - edge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the preven - tion, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness \" (WHO 2013, p.15). Complementary medicine refers to \" a broad set of healthcare practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (WHO 2013). Because the two are used interchangeably the WHO has merged them into the term T&CM (WHO 2013). The increasing use of T&CM and need for integration with conventional medicine is an important drive behind the de - velopment of IM, supported by the WHO (Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, WHO 2013, Baars and Hamre 2017). A form of IM, Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) has originated in Europe in the 1920s and is currently practiced by medical, paramedical and therapeutic practitioners in 80 countries worldwide (Kienle et al. 2013). Aspects of AM treatment are an individualized approach, both preventive and curative health promotion, medicinal use of substanc - es and non-medication therapies (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2013). AM has an important strength in the sense that it has both developed from the roots of the natural sciences in Europe - the same roots as conventional biomedical-based medicine has developed from (Bynum 2013) and has integrated biomedical-based medicine and complementary thera - pies from the start of its development (Baars and Hamre 2017). This means that AM not only has practiced IM for over 90 years, also the integrative character is deeply connected with AM's identity (Baars and Hamre 2017). In the context of the evidence-based medicine development, research on IM has 94 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinenecessarily focused on biomedical quality and clinical evidence, regarding efficacy, (cost-) effectiveness and safety (Guarneri et al. 2010, Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Herman et al. 2012, De Witt et al. 2012, Adams and Robinson 2013, Baars and Kooreman 2014, White et al. 2014, Kienle et al. 2017, Dusek et al. 2018). However, whereas clinical research in AM/ IM has increased and served the important purpose of establishing evidence on safety and effects of treatment, health services research is under-developed (Adams and Robinson 2013) and would be a legitimate next step in the scientific development of AM/IM. Health services research is defined as the multidisciplinary field of scientific in - vestigation that studies how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, and personal behaviours affect access to healthcare, the quality and cost of healthcare, and ultimately our health and well-being (Lohr and Steinwachs 2002). Part of this field is measuring patient-reported quality of care, which has become essential in evaluating healthcare performance (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Sixma et al. 1998, Delnoij 2009). Within conventional medicine specific methodologies have been developed to evaluate patient-reported quality of care, in which a division is made between process aspects and outcomes aspects of care (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Black 2013, Kessel et al. 2014, Bos et al. 2015). On the one hand, process aspects are measured using Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs), for example, communication, patient-provider relationship, accessibility, tailored care and cooperation between care providers (Meuwissen and De Bakker 2008). On the other hand, outcome aspects - general and specific - are measured using Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) (Black 2013, Boyce and Brown 2013, Kessel et al. 2014). Examples of disease-specific outcomes are bodily function after surgery, and reduction or recovery of specific symptoms or illnesses. General outcomes are usually measured with Quality of Life instruments, such as EQ-5D and SF-12 or SF-36 (McKenna 2011, Lin et al. 2013, Koster et al. 2016). Another important reason to measure patient-reported quality of care in AM/IM is the fact that both IM and AM espouse patient-centred or individualized care as a lead - ing principle (Kienle et al. 2006, Maizes et al. 2009, Koster et al. 2016, Baars and Hamre 2017, Kienle et al. 2017), which is highly valued by patients (Jong et al. 2012). As such, AM/ IM seem to have a potential to contribute to further develop and enhance the delivery of patient-centred care (Maizes et al. 2009, Koster et al. 2016, Kienle et al. 2017). Measuring patient-reported quality of care in AM/IM addresses this principle. Because it is important for AM/IM to further develop health services research in general, and measuring patient-reported quality of care specifically, it is necessary to map and scope the body of knowledge that has been built so far and to identify the precise ex - tent of the knowledge gap. Therefore, to investigate this potential knowledge gap the aim of this research is to perform a scoping review. The research question is: how and to what 95 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineextent is patient-reported quality of care measured in health services research in the field of AM/IM? 6.2 Methods The aim of a scoping review is to map and present an overview of the body of literature on a specific topic area (Arksey and O'Malley 2005, Levac et al. 2010)). The intent is to articulate what is known about key concepts, both in-depth as well as in a broad sense, by including a larger range of studies than systematic reviews (Arksey and O'Malley 2005). A scoping review provides a descriptive overview of the included studies without critically appraising the methodology of individual studies or synthesizing evidence from different studies. An additional reason for conducting a scoping review is to identify research and knowledge gaps within the topic area (Arksey and O'Malley 2005, Levac et al. 2010). Arksey's methodological framework proposed an iterative five-stage process (Arksey and O'Malley 2005): Stage 1: identifying the research question Stage 2: identifying relevant studies (search strategy) Stage 3: study selection Stage 4: charting the data (data extraction) Stage 5: collating, summarizing and reporting the results The aim of these stages is to create an underpinning with equal extent of rigorousness and transparency as with systematic reviews (Arksey and O'Malley 2005). Following the recom - mendation of Arksey et al. (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) this section provides a descrip - tion of how the stages were addressed. In addition, to enhance the quality of this review the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews was followed where possible. 6.2.1 Stage 1: Identifying the research question The research question is: How, and to what extent, is patient-reported quality of care measured in health services research within the field of IM and AM? Sub-questions: 1) How many studies exist in this field? 96 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2) Which methods are used? 3) What aspects are measured? 4) In which way are patients involved in defining which aspects to measure? 5) What purposes are results used for? 6) Is patient-reported quality of care measured in a standardized way? 7) Are measures underpinned with theoretical concepts of IM? This research question implies that patient-reported outcomes measured in clinical trials are excluded from this scoping review. The focus is on so-called real world data (Makady et al. 2017). The authors investigated openly which instruments and methods were used to evaluate patient-reported quality of care, without critically appraising whether the instru - ments at issue were initially made for this purpose. In addition, patient-reported quality of care was addressed in the form of retrospective evaluation as opposed to prospective motives for and expectations of use of care. 6.2.2 Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies (search strategy) The electronic database search took place on February 24th 2017 and was conducted with a search engine that combined several relevant databases (See Box 1). The search terms (See Box 1) were determined after an initial literature- and database search, in consensus be - tween the authors, and with advice from a librarian of UAS Leiden. Search terms had to be present in title, abstract and/or subject terms of the publication. No time frame was set. In addition to a database search, Arksey et al. (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) also recommend identifying relevant literature by means of checking reference lists, hand searching of key journals, and existing networks. A pre-investigation of existing relevant research within the authors' network showed little attention for the combination of AM/ IM and evaluating patient-reported quality of care (Brinkhaus et al. 2016, Kienle et al. 2017). At the same time, within the authors' extensive network on evaluating quality of care and health services research there is little expertise on AM/IM. Potential key journals were pre-explored. This exploration showed a similar picture: within journals about health services research, there were few search results on AM/IM, and within journals about AM/ IM few articles on patient-reported quality of care studies. Considering the above and the large number of databases included in the search, the authors chose to conduct the scop - ing review using only electronic database sources. 97 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineBox 6.1 Details on search strategy Databases in the search engine: Academic Search Premier (EBSCOhost), BioMed Central, CINAHL with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Library, Open Access Journals, MEDLINE with Full Text (EBSCOhost), NARCIS - National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), PubMed Central (PMC), ScienceDirect healthcare\") 6.2.3 Stage 3: Study selection Inclusion criteria The included studies met the following criteria: A description or analyses of the evaluation of quality of actual delivered care as reported by patients in AM/IM care, based on the definition of IM Both qualitative and/or quantitative Used or developed measurement instruments, serving as PREMs, PROMs or other evaluation instruments Languages: English, German, Dutch and French Exclusion criteria Studies were excluded based on the following criteria: Theoretical non-empirical studies and/or essays about aspects of care considered to be of value regarding the quality of care Patients' motives for and expectation of the use of AM/IM 98 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Other languages Unavailability of both abstract and full text article Clinical trials and other studies focussing on clinical effectiveness of interventions (Black 2013, Ishaque et al. 2019) Lack of relevance otherwise (for example; no IM, no patients, organizational implementation, no quality of care) Definitive selection The selection of studies was initially based on the titles and abstracts. When the abstract did not provide enough information the full-text was assessed. Two authors assessed all studies independently, based on clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, agreed among all authors. Uncertainties were discussed and consensus was formed. 6.2.4 Stage 4: Charting the data (data extraction) The following information was collected: first author; year of publication; journal; satisfaction; evaluation measures or aspects; patient involvement; use of results. A number of categories required the use of iterative process, because often the information was not explicitly reported within the selected studies. Those categories were : design; involvement of PREMs, PROMs or patient satisfaction; evaluation measures or aspects; patient involvement; and use of results. Two categories needed extra literature to chart its data. For defining the correct quasi-experimental research designs Harris et al. (2006) was followed. For categorizing the ways and extent of patient involvement in the process of measuring outcomes and experiences of care the classification developed by Wiering et al. (2016) was followed. These categories are, in order of increasing involve - ment: 1. Using patients for testing comprehensibility of measures, 2. Involving patients in item development, and 3. Involving patients in establishing outcome measures. A random sample of 20 studies was assessed in duplicate independently to develop inter-researcher validity. Contradictions and doubts were discussed to achieve consensus. 6.2.5 Stage 5: Collating, summarizing and reporting the results In stage five the end product of the scoping review was developed. It is a narrative pre - sentation that synthesizes the research and applies meaning to the results. Following the recommendation of Levac et al. (2010) three steps were taken in reporting this stage: an - alysing the data (collating and summarizing), reporting results, and applying meaning to the results. Analysing the data involved both a descriptive numerical summary (table 1 and 2) and a thematic analysis (table 3). The numerical summary included all the information 99 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecategories from the previous phase. Conducting the thematic analysis researchers kept to the phrasing and meaning of the items in the included studies. Only when items were obviously about the same theme, they were clustered. Starting from the numerical analysis researchers looked for meaningful patterns in the content of the publications. In addition, gaps of knowledge were identified. 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Search flow The flow chart is shown in figure 6.1. It shows 381 identified studies, of which 188 dupli - cates were removed.

Twenty studies used interviews and/or focus group designs. Thir - ty-two studies measured patient-reported quality as main purpose of the study, and seven studies were instrument development studies. 103 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 6.2 Instruments used for evaluation of IM/AM care Used as PROM questionnaires Used as PREM questionnaires SF-12 (4x) Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale (IMPSS) SF-36 (4x) Satisfaction Index (PSI) Patient Care Monitor EUROPEP (2x) Integrative Medicine Outcome Scale (IMOS) CQ-Index General Questionnaire (LSQ) CQ-Index Anthroposophic Medicine PROMIS -Pain Interference 6b Patient Enablement Index EQ-5D-5L Patient satisfaction score (scale 1-100); Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS); Patient Satisfaction scores (rating 0 -10) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS -10) Columbia Health Medical Services Patient Satisfaction Survey Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale (MSAS) Picker Inpatient Questionnaire Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing Questionnaire (2x) Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Berg Balance Scale (BBS) Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale (AIOS) Patient Activation Measure Perceived Stress Scale- 4 PROMIS -29 Holistic Health Questionnaire Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Tool Picker Inpatient Questionnaire (2x) Arthritis Health Assessment Questionnaire QOL -scale 6.3.4 Patient involvement To categorise patient involvement, categories (1-3) of Wiering et al. (2016) were used. In 20 studies these categories were applicable: one study used patients for testing compre - hensibility, in 15 studies patients had a voice in the item development phase, and in four studies patients were involved in establishing outcome measures. However, in many of included studies patient involvement was deemed lower than category one. Therefore, two categories of patient involvement were added. We distinguished between respondents of surveys and respondents of interviews; the latter was considered as a higher level of involvement, because in interviews patients have usually more influence in the way they answer questions than in surveys. Details are shown in table 6.1. In almost halve of the included studies patients' involvement was limited to being respondents in a survey. In most qualitative studies patient involvement was on the level of item development or high - er. The mixed-method studies varied the most regarding their level of patient-involvement of each study. Hence, these findings indicate a limited degree of patient-involvement.104 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 6.3 Evaluation aspects from qualitative studies Domain Number of items Agency and empowerment 23 Patient -provider relationship 21 Perceived effectiveness (symptoms, pain) 18 Coping and psychological functioning 14 Inner awareness 14 Meaning 11 General patient satisfaction 10 General wellbeing 10 Transformation/turning point/new perspectives 8 Program evaluation 7 Quality of life 6 Holistic philosophy 6 Skills and knowledge practitioner 5 Support 5 Clinic's atmosphere 5 Feeling connected 4 Integration of care 4 Team collaboration 4 Accessibility 4 Energy/vitality 3 Social relationships 3 Functioning 3 Patient -centred care 3 Relaxation 3 Stress and anxiety 3 Information 2 Natural healing 2 Physiological indicators 2 Side effects 2 Treatment options 2 Additional treatment costs 1 Safety 1 Unmet needs 1 Other/non -specified aspects 18 6.3.5 Use of results The results of the studies are used for various purposes. Most study results are used for further instrument development, further research, care implementation and advocacy of AM/IM. Quality improvement, service- and outcome evaluation, important purposes asso - ciated with PREMs and PROMs, were less mentioned.

Many different instruments were used: 22 as a PROM and twelve as a PREM. Although several questionnaires are well known and validated, the authors cannot confirm the validity of all of these questionnaires. Also, in general, the items of these in - struments were not explicitly mentioned in the studies. Contrary to the use of pre-structured questionnaires, 22 studies composed a variety of quantitative evaluation measures themselves. The variety of measures differed greatly within as well as between the quantitative studies. Although some standard themes are recognisable when comparing these studies - for example, effectiveness, satisfaction or relationship with practitioner, quality of life and likelihood to recommend - the specific sets of measures that are used within a single study often lack reasoning for the choices made and come across as somewhat arbitrary. Table 6.3 provides an overview of evaluation categories that were generated and/ or assessed in the qualitative studies and qualitative parts of the mixed method studies. The themes emerged from the items that were described in the studies. During the anal - ysis, the researchers stayed as close as possible to the meaning of the items, resulting in a long list of categories. Seven evaluation categories were most prevalent in these studies and had a prevalence of ten or more items in the studies all together. These were (number of items): Agency & Psychological functioning (14); Inner awareness (14); Meaning (11); and General wellbeing (10). Two other categories were also similarly prevalent in the studies. However, one category contained outcome- and experiences measures that were quite vague and lacked specification (18), for example \"health outcomes\". The other cat - egory contained \"patient satisfaction\" without specifying the precise meaning of it (10). Therefore, these two categories show low content value. In addition, in none of the studies an explicit coherence was made between the evaluation measures and the theoretical base of IM. PREM and PROM assessment Twenty-seven studies focused on PREMs, PROMs or both, and seven of those had a pa - tient-involvement level of minimal \"item development\". (See Table 6.4) Three of them are instrument development studies with a patient-involvement level on \"establishing outcome measures\" (Hunter 2014; Eton et al. 2005; and Koster et al. 2014). The other four studies (Keshet et al. 2015; Koster et al. 2016; Mulkins et al. 2003; and Verhoef et al. 2005) report a thorough qualitative phase of item development on the way to PROM and/or PREM construction. All of these seven studies report concrete and/or coherent evaluation measures. 107 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine6.4 Discussion 6.4.1 Discussion In this study the authors performed a scoping review on how and to what extent patient-re - ported quality of care is measured in health services research within the field of AM/IM, in order to identify a potential knowledge gap regarding the assessment of patient-reported quality of care within this field. The sub-questions were: 1) How many studies exist in this field? 2) Which methods are used? 3) What aspects are measured? 4) In which way are patients involved in defining which aspects to measure? 5) What purposes are results used for? 6) Is patient-reported quality of care measured in a standardized way? And 7) Are measures underpinned with theoretical concepts of IM? In total, 64 studies were includ - ed; these were published between 2002 and 2016. Thirty quantitative, 20 qualitative and 14 mixed method studies were conducted. Patient-reported quality of care was measured both as main purpose of studies and as part of larger studies. The results of the studies are used for various purposes. A wide variety of quantitative instruments were used. A reason for this could be the variety of care that is evaluated. If this explanation would apply one would expect that similar aspects would be measured in the same way, which is, however, not the case. Consensus on a standard instrument that measures different aspects of IM seems to be lacking. For example, although the Patient Activation Measure was initially not designed to be a PROM (Hibbard 2017), one study (Dusek et al. 2016) used the instruments for this purpose. Also the Picker Inpatient Questionnaire was used both as PREM and as PROM. Within the qualitative methods, seven evaluation themes were most prevalent: Agency & Empowerment; Patient-provider relationship; Perceived effectiveness; Coping & Psychological functioning; Inner awareness; Meaning; and General wellbeing. Because most qualitative studies investigated aspects that were relevant for patients and had a patient-involvement level (Wiering et al. 2016) of item development or higher the wide prevalence of these themes indicates that they are regarded to be the most important from patients' perspective. Two of them Agency & Empowerment and Patient-provider relation - ship are relatively new regarding measuring outcomes of care (Koster et al. 2016), and the amount of research that focuses on understanding their mechanisms is increasing (Rade - makers et al. 2011, De Boer et al. 2013, Greco et al. 2016, Foley and Steel 2017). In both qualitative and quantitative studies \"patient satisfaction\" was often used as an evaluation measure. In these cases \"patient satisfaction\" was not further specified or operationalised and left to interpretation of the respondent. This disputed its validity. The original idea behind the development of experience measures in the first decade of this century was to enhance the way of evaluating patient perspectives at that time by replacing arbitrary measures of \" patient satisfaction \" by measures of concrete experiences with re -108 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineceived care (Sixma et al 1998). This review demonstrates that in IM the awareness for this development could be improved. The degree of patient involvement was - in general - quite low. The assessment of patient involvement was limited by the fact that the studies did not give an account of patient-involvement in the development of the existing pre-structured questionnaires. However, the shortcoming correlates with findings of Wiering et al. (2016) in conventional medicine. Apart from positive exceptions, the general degree of patient involvement in developing PROMs is lower than desirable and lower than would be expected based on the increasing importance of patients perspectives in the evaluation of healthcare (Wiering et al. 2016). The current study indicates that patient involvement in IM is even lower than in conventional medicine. This is particularly striking, because of IM's leading principle of patient-centeredness: a focus on optimal health for the individual patient and the reaffir - mation of the patient-provider relationship (CAHCIM) in both of which the patient has an active role (Van Duijn et al. 2009, Maizes et al. 2009, Koster et al. 2016, Baars and Hamre 2017, Van Vliet 2017). How obvious would it be that patients should naturally have a role in defining relevant evaluation measures regarding the care they receive? The way results of the studies are used varies. However, most studies are used for further research and further instrument development. Apart from the relatively small number of studies involved with concrete quality evaluation from patients' perspectives - which in itself requires improvement - the distribution of studies between the different prevalent purposes implies something about a common focus of many studies. Purposes like quality improvement and service & outcome evaluation demand concrete measures and concrete study outcomes, forcing researchers to work towards thoroughness and clarity, whereas further research and further instrument development as purposes of study say more about what has to be done yet, than about the merits of the study at issue. Patient-centred care Many aspects of care that have emerged in this review and especially in the narratives in the qualitative studies connect with the wider theme of patient-centred care. It shows that patient-centred care has many faces and practices and is of great value for patients. Aspects in which patient-centred care is reflected are for example Patient-provider relation - ship, Agency & Empowerment, Coping, Wellbeing, Feeling connected, Meaning, and Unmet needs. This wide connection shows that the principle of patient-centred care is actually experienced and valued by the patients in the included studies. As such, AM/ IM have a potential to contribute to further develop and enhance the delivery of pa - tient-centred care (Maizes et al. 2009, Koster et al. 2016, Foley and Steel 2017). Measuring patient-reported quality of care in AM/IM addresses this principle and provides opportu - nities to contribute to the evolving research on patient-centred care and it's influence on 109 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineoutcomes of care (Greco et al. 2016, Foley and Steel 2017). In addition, comprehending the depth and meaning of patient-centred care might be crucial in developing better inte - gration of T&CM with conventional care. Strengths and limitations The strength of this study is the rigour of the review, which included many aspects that were collated from the included studies. In addition, it demonstrates that many of the evaluation measures come to together in the overarching theme of patient-centred care. This implies not only a crucial connection between AM/IM and the values of patient-cen - tred care, but also a relevance of this review regarding evaluating patient-centred care within conventional medicine. A limitation concerns the selection process. Although the greatest care was taken in this, there might exist studies that should have been included, but did not turn up in the search results, due to the phrasing of IM. Only studies that use IM explicitly are included. However, studies that use (a form of) complementary medicine in combination with con - ventional care without naming this \"integrative\" in someway (see search terms) are not included. It was not feasible to include \"implicit IM\" in the search terms. Also the study did not emphasise on different types of IM. This topic is addressed in for example the review of Lim et al. (2017). The study results might also be limited by the fact that the search took place in February 2017. Possible new studies that have been published between February 2017 and the submission of this study are not included. However, it is commonly accepted that a review is completed within 24 months after the initial search (Amstar). Implications for further research This scoping review can contribute to the further development of PREMs and PROMs in AM/IM. The development of a core set of validated PROMs and PREMs for AM/IM in different languages that could be used in many countries is very important for the further global development and scientific underpinning of AM/IM quality of care. A next step in developing PROMs and PREMs should incorporate a comparison of the existing questionnaires in the quantitative studies and the results from the qual - itative studies in this review on item level. Validity and reliability should be considered carefully since the recent systematic review of Bull et al. (2019) concluded that these are important limitations of many used PREMs in general. Remarkably, a large number of non-specific aspects of care were evaluated, both in the qualitative studies and in the quantitative studies. Further research should focus on clarification of these aspects. Clarification could serve three purposes. One, it serves a more concrete and transparent evaluation of AM/IM. Two, the process of clarifying these 110 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinenon-specific aspects adds to the discussion of the influence of non-specific aspects on the delivery of care. And three, insight in these aspects, making them more concrete, will also help to identify factors that contribute to the value and quality of AM/IM in the perspec - tives of patients. Further research should also focus on generating more insight in subdomains of the category Patient-provider relationship. In order to develop sound evaluation measures on this particular aspect, results on item level from the selected studies can be added and supported with results from current research on the influence of the patient-provider rela - tionship on treatment processes. Vice versa, results from the selected studies can enhance current insights on the patient-provider relationship with patient-derived knowledge. Fully comprehending the role and influence of the patient-provider relationship on treatment processes, treatment outcomes and the meaning of it for patients might be an important link in the chain that addresses patient relevant aspects of care in general and the further development of AM/IM specifically. In addition, the vast prevalence of the aspects Patient-provider relationship and also Agency & Empowerment in the selected studies and the increasing awareness for these aspects in conventional care should be a reason to consider incorporating them as standard aspects in future care evaluation studies. 6.4.2 Conclusion Based on this scoping review, the knowledge gap regarding the assessment of patient-re - ported quality of care within the field of AM/IM can be identified as follows: Patient-re - ported quality of care was not measured in a standardised and methodologically sound and transparent way. In the quantitative studies, a wide variety of instruments were used, the measured themes differ between studies, and most studies did not give an account for why they chose these particular themes. The large amount of different instruments demonstrates that the field lacks a consensus about a standardised way of measuring pa - tient-reported quality of care. Also, patient involvement in defining which aspects to mea - sure was generally quite low. The qualitative studies did to a large extent investigate and address aspects that were relevant for patients. In the analysis a meaningful list of themes emerged. However, many qualitative studies remained in a narrative report in which men - tioned aspects lacked a formulation in a concrete measurable way. The results of the studies were used for various purposes. However, the num - ber of studies with (self-reported and implicit) use of results associated with PREMs and PROMs covered only one-third of the included studies. In none of the studies an explicit coherence was made with the theoretical base or definition of IM. In addition, many in - cluded studies show evaluation measures that lack specification. 111 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine A few promising findings are standing out. Seven domains - Agency & Empower - ment; Patient-provider relationship; Perceived effectiveness; Coping & Psychological func - tioning; Inner awareness; Meaning; and General wellbeing - are most prevalent among the aspects that are derived from patients. Moreover, the theme of patient-centred care is connected with many aspects. Seven studies report concrete, coherent and genuinely patient-derived evaluation measures with emphasis on PROMs and/or PREMs. These are hopefully promising examples that can be used to serve as a base for further development of patient evaluation methods in IM. 6.4.3 Practice implications This scoping review could serve as a starting point for the future development of PREMs and PROMs in IM and AM. In doing so a vivid connection - on item level - should be made between existing questionnaires used in the quantitative studies and the results from the qualitative studies. Making a good instrument - one that answers to the key is - sues validity, reliability \u00e1nd relevance for patients (McKenna 2011, Rademakers et al. 2011, Wiering et al. 2016, 2017, Bull et al. 2019) - is about bringing together the meaning of qualitative findings and the concreteness of a quantitative instrument. In the end, it is the formulation and nuance on item level that shapes the measure and gives meaning to the instrument.

Currently, there is also a worldwide interest in the integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine into Integra - tive Medicine. This article explores the contribution of anthroposophic medicine (AM) to the promotion of self-management of patients. Materials and Methods: The scientific literature on concepts of, evidence on and experiences of patients with AM was explored. Results: The AM approach contributes to (1) a patient-centered, collaborative promotion of patient self-management by means of application of basic values (equivalence, servi - tude and presence of mind) and specific methods; (2) a better coping with health-related issues by providing a spiritual worldview that serves as a coping strategy; by treating patients in such a way that they (further) develop self-regulating functioning, both on the physiological and the psychosocial level, thus enabling the self-management of disease related symptoms; and by treating with (non-verbal) therapies that improve emotion- focused coping skills; and (3) a better self-monitoring of: one's own activity during treat - ment and in dealing with treatment- and health-related issues, and the physiological and/ or psychological responses to these (self-reflection) activities. Conclusion: AM provides specific contributions to promoting self-management of patients. 115 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine7.1 Introduction In many Western countries, an important topic in healthcare policies is promotion of self-management of patients (with chronic diseases). Self-management is often broadly defined as (1) the individual's ability to properly cope with symptoms, treatment, physical and social consequences of the chronic disorder and the associated adjustments in life style, and (2) the ability to cognitively self-monitor one's own health status, and to subse - quently exhibit behavioral and emotional responses that contribute to a satisfying quality of life (Wagner et al. 2001). Self-management promotion involves a patient-centered, col - laborative approach to care and enhances patients' self-management (skills) by promoting patient activation, self-efficacy, education, and empowerment of patients to seek solutions and to have control over their own lives (Goldstein 2004, Coleman and Newton 2005). Currently, there is also a worldwide interest in the integration of different types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) on the one hand and conventional medi - cine on the other into Integrative Medicine (IM). For example, in the USA, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, nowadays called the Academic Con - sortium for Integrative Medicine & Health (The Consortium), was established in 2000. Since then, the number of universities being a member of this consortium has increased from 11 to 63 in North America. This demonstrates an increasing interest in CAM based on different traditional medical systems in the academic world (ACIMH 2016). In 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) developed and launched the \"WHO Traditional Medi - cine Strategy 2014-2023\". The strategy demonstrates that all over the world CAM is used and should be integrated with conventional medicine into IM (WHO 2013). IM is based on four pillars: (1) a horizontal relationship between the doctor/ ther - apist (coach) and the patient (co-producer); (2) an active role of the patient in prevention (lifestyle), well-being, and therapy and healing processes; (3) the use of evidence-based safe and effective conventional and complementary therapies; and (4) the use of healing environments (ACIMH 2016). One type of IM is anthroposophic medicine (AM), that was founded in the early 1920's (Kienle et al. 2013). The fundament of AM was provided by the philosopher Rudolf Steiner and the physician Ita Wegman (Steiner and Wegman 2000). They cooperated to integrate the knowledge from conventional medicine and science and the knowledge from spiritual science (anthroposophy) into the concept and practice of AM. Starting in Central Europe, AM is currently practiced and taught throughout most Euro - pean countries and in more than 80 countries worldwide (Kienle et al. 2013). In 2012, the figures for Europe were as follows (IVAA 2012): AM was practiced by more than 2,700 fully AM trained licensed medical doctors in 22 European Union (EU) member states, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, AM was prescribed by about 15,000 physicians with various levels of training (estimate, based on various data). AM was provided in 24 hospitals in five 116 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineEU member states and Switzerland (14 of those had Accident & Emergency services, two of those were university teaching hospitals). AM was provided in >120 outpatient centers (physician and at least one anthroposophic therapist) in 14 EU member states, Norway and Switzerland. Anthroposophic therapies were provided by >7,000 anthroposophic therapists (\"classical anthroposophic therapies\") and nurses in 25 EU member states, in Norway and Switzerland. AM was provided in >500 institutes for people with learning difficulties in 19 EU member states, Norway and Switzerland. AM was regularly taught at universities and medical schools in seven EU member states and Switzerland (university chairs in Germany and Switzerland). AM-full training with certificate was provided for medical doctors in seven EU member states and Switzerland. AM therapy involves specific anthroposophic medicinal products (AMPs) and non-pharmaceutical therapies (IVAA 2012). It seems clear that IM may have a lot to offer to the promotion of self-manage - ment of (chronic) patients. Therefore, this article explores the contribution of AM, as an IM modality, to the promotion of self-management of patients. 7.2 Material and Methods 7.2.1 Operationalization of self-management promotion Promotion of self-management of patients was operationalized according to the self-man - agement literature (Wagner et al. 2001, Goldstein 2004, Coleman and Newton 2005) as: 1. Promotion takes place by means of a patient-centered, collaborative approach 2. Promotion refers to the promotion of being able: a. to cope with symptoms, treatment, physical and social consequences of the chronic disorder and the associated adjustments in life style; b. to self-monitor one's own health status, and subsequently, to respond emotionally and behaviorally to one's self-monitoring results in a way that contributes to a satisfying quality of life. 7.2.2 Research questions The research questions that are answered in this study are: 1. Which aspects of the AM worldview, values, concepts and methods contribute to the promotion of self-management of patients? Which aspects contribute: a. to a patient-centered, collaborative approach of self-management promotion? b. to patients coping with symptoms, treatment, physical and social consequences of their (chronic) disorder and the associated adjustments in life style? 117 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine c. to patients self-monitoring their own health status and subsequently their emotionally and behaviorally responding to the self-monitoring results in a way that contributes to a satisfying quality of life? 2. What are the experiences of patients with the AM self-management promotion approach? 7.2.3 Methods The scientific literature on concepts and evidence on AM as well as on patients' expe - riences with AM and self-management was explored. In addition, ten semi-structured interviews with patients were audio-analyzed with regard to the experiences with AM in relation to self-management. Relevant data was coded and transcribed, and quotes were categorized thematically. Respondents were selected from the Dutch organisation of an - throposophic patients. Illnesses of the respondents varied between minor illnesses (e.g., low haemoglobin levels, common cold), allergies, chronic and progressive diseases, aging problems, psychosomatic conditions, and life-threatening diseases (e.g., cancer and heart failure). Data from the interviews has been published earlier as part of a larger study on patient relevant outcomes on AM and quality of life (Koster et al. 2016). Domains from this analysis that are related to self-management were included in the current literature analysis of AM and self-management. 7.3 Results 7.3.1 Worldview of AM: a summary Worldviews are frameworks of meaning and meaning-making, shaping how individuals perceive particular issues and their possible solutions. They also tend to influence the will - ingness of individuals to participate in these worldview-related solutions. Worldviews have five, interrelated and interdependent, aspects: (1) ontology: a perspective on the nature of reality; (2) epistemology: a perspective on how knowledge of reality can become about; (3) axiology: a perspective on what is a good life, in terms of morals and quality of life, ethical and aesthetic values; (4) anthropology: a perspective on what creature the human being is and on his role and position in the universe; and (5) societal vision: a perspective on how society should be organized and how societal problems should be addressed (Hedlund-de Witt et al. 2012). The worldview of AM is that a human being is, in essence, a spiritual (non-ma - terial) being, which, in addition to its spirit, has a soul and a (living) physical body ( on-118 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinetology ). The human being is an entity that integrates and balances these different 'levels' that are constantly interacting with each other and the outside world. Health and disease are expressions and results of adequate or inadequate interactions, respectively, between these separate organizational levels of the human being. Treatment is oriented at influ - encing different aspects of the involved organizing system levels in health and disease at the same time or in phases. One main route of treatment is aiming at restoring balance and wholeness within the system by stimulating the higher levels of organization in or - der to regulate the lower levels (Steiner and Wegman 2000, Heusser 2011, Kienle et al. 2013). Anthroposophic treatments of diseases stimulate the self-healing or self-regulation activity of the (organism of the) patient towards an optimal functioning of the higher levels of organization in relation to each other and in their regulation of the lower levels. This means that AM treatments promote the person\u00b4s physiological and/or psychosocial (self-organizing) ability to adaptively acquire or maintain health across changing personal and environmental conditions (Boekaerts et al. 2005, Baars 2011). Therefore, in essence, it is a sustainable health promotion strategy, one that supports and enables patients to actively contribute to and self-manage their own health and disease status (Baars 2011). Because AM results from the integration and application of knowledge and methods from conventional medicine and science with anthroposophy, it also integrates and applies the best of both worlds from a 'fighting disease' approach and a health promotion approach (Baars 2011) ( epistemology ). According to the spiritual scientific (anthroposophic) posi - tion, the human being is developing itself through several lives on earth (karma and rein - carnation) towards optimal self-management, in close relationship with and responsible for the development of all other humans and the earth (Baars 2005) ( anthropology and societal vision ). From these four aspects of the AM worldview, three important values can be deduced that \u00b4drive\u00b4 AM healthcare professionals in their interactions with patients: equivalence (between all human beings), servitude (towards the development of other individuals) and presence of mind (in order to be able to find situational solutions) (Baars 2005) ( axiology ). 7.3.2 Contributions approach of self- management promotion Patient-centered care is a ' holistic (bio-psychosocial-spiritual) approach to delivering care that is respectful and individualized, allowing negotiation of care, and offering choice through a therapeutic relationship where persons are empowered to be involved in health decisions at whatever level is desired by that individual who is receiving the care ' (Morgan and Yoder 2012, p. 3). AM provides specific contributions to a patient-centered, collaborative approach of self-management promotion. Firstly, the three described values that drive 119 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAM healthcare professionals (equivalence, servitude and presence of mind) support a respectful and individualized approach, and allow negotiation of care (shared-decision making). Secondly, in AM specific practice methods are used to assess (a) the qualities of the higher organization levels in their relationship to the lower physical and physiological levels (Van der Bie and Huber 2003) and (b) the specific individual and complex situation of the patient. These methods are characterized by exact and non-judgmental observation, a methodological use of empathy and system thinking (Kruse 2003, Ziegler 2015, Sijmons 2008, Bortoft 2010, Schmidt 2010, Baars and Van der Meij 2011, Steiner 2014, Steiner 2015, Uitgeest 2016). Empirical patient evaluation studies of AM confirm these contributions from AM to a patient-centered, collaborative approach of self-management promotion. Table 7.1 shows corresponding items of three patient evaluation studies of AM treatments, based on a large qualitative study on patient relevant contributions of AM to health and quality of life (Koster et al. 2016). This qualitative study demonstrates relevant domains regarding a patient-centered collaborative approach, namely Care relation and Being well informed . Examples from two other studies, Koster et al. (2014) and Esch et al. (2008), are placed correspondingly. Koster et al. (2014) have studied patient experiences with AM general practitioners (GPs), with 2,063 patients from 22 GP practices. Esch et al.(2008) reports on an observational study that compares patient satisfaction aspects between conventional and AM primary care physicians in Switzerland. In addition to the information in table 1, Koster et al. (2014) demonstrated high overall satisfaction with Dutch anthroposophic GP practices: a mean of 8.4 on a scale from 0 to 10. Esch et al. (2008) demonstrated that significantly more AM patients expressed a general treatment satisfaction (56.1% vs. 43.4%), saw their expectations completely fulfilled at follow-up (38.7% vs. 32.6%) and gave significantly better ratings for thoroughness (70.4% vs. 56.5%). The interviews with patients about their experiences with AM (Koster et al. 2016) illustrate the described topics: JC: \"I have an anthroposophic GP and we interact on an equal footing. So communication is very easy.\" NP: \"That a doctor can listen with an open mind without assuming things. And ask: what would help you in your situation?\" SK: \"Together with others I organise information evenings at the healthcare centre. It is much stimulated and facilitated by the care providers. There, I'm a patient, but also a sort of colleague; there is not so much of a gap between me and the GPs or therapists. We do it together, and that is very helpful.\"120 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 7 .1 Patient -centred collaborative approach: corresponding domains and items from 3 patient evaluation studies Koster et al. 2016 Koster et al. 2014 Esch et al. 2008 Domain level Item level Item level 'Physician' (Ph.)

Because there are many ways to reduce distress, emotion-focused coping includes a wide range of responses, ranging from self-soothing (e.g., relaxation, seeking emotional support), to expression of negative emotion (e.g., yelling, crying), to a focus on negative thoughts (e.g., rumination), to attempts to escape stressful situations (e.g., avoidance, denial, wishful thinking) \" (Carver and Connor-Smith 2010, p. 685). AM contributes to patients developing better coping strategies. Firstly, it pro - vides a spiritual worldview that serves as a coping strategy (e.g. B\u00fcssing et al. 2007). Secondly, coping is improved by treating patients in such a way that they (further) develop self-regulating functioning, both on the physiological and the psychosocial level, thus en - abling their self-management of disease-related symptoms. (e.g. Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Koster et al. 2016) Finally, AM treatments (non-verbally) improve emotion-focused coping skills (e.g. B\u00fcssing et al. 2008, Bar-Sela et al. 2007). Current knowledge in the research field of spirituality/ religiosity demonstrates that the utilization of spirituality can be regarded as an active coping process (B\u00fcssing et al. 2007). Firstly, spirituality is strongly associated with better health behavior habits (e.g., low - er smoking and alcohol consumption), is more strongly linked to biomarkers and is posi - tively related to a variety of indicators of mental health, including subjective well-being and personality dimensions (Aldwin et al. 2014). Secondly, spirituality can play an important role in recovering from mental illness and protection against addictive or suicidal behaviors (Unterrainer et al. 2014). Finally, a spiritual worldview can result in a cognitive change. This means that the spiritual concepts may change the way we appraise the situation we are in, to alter its emotional significance, either by changing how we think about the situation or by changing our capacity to manage the demands it poses (Webb et al. 2012). The symptom and stress-reducing effects of AM therapies have been demon - strated in several studies, e.g., overall (Kienle et al. 2011), in non-verbal treatment with, for example, eurhythmy therapy (B\u00fcssing et al. 2008, Kanitz et al. 2011), art therapy (Bar Sela et al. 2007, Hamre et al. 2007), rhythmical massage (Hamre et al. 2007, W\u00e4lchli et al. 2014), with medicinal products (e.g., (Baars 2005, Baars and Savelkoul 2008, Baars et al. 2011, Baars et al. 2012b, Baars et al. 2012c, Hoffmann et al. 2016)), and in complex AM treatment for chronic indications (Ketelaars et al. 2001, Hamre et al. 2013). Empirical patient evaluation studies also confirm the contribution of AM regarding devel - oping better coping strategies of patients. Relevant domains from Koster et al. (2016) are Natural Healing, Active contribution/ Autonomy, and Meaning . Table 7.2 shows correspond -122 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineing items of Koster et al. (2016) and Esch et al. (2008) within these domains. In addition to the information in table 7.2, Koster et al. (2014) demonstrated that patients experienced positive effects of AM treatment on symptoms (89.8%) and quality of life (76%) and Esch et al. (2008) demonstrated that AM patients reported significantly fewer adverse side ef - fects (9.3% vs. 15.4%) and more other positive treatment effects (31.7% vs. 17.1%). The interviews with patients about their experiences with AM (Koster et al. 2016) illustrate the described topics: GH: \" I went to an anthroposophic doctor, because with my conventional GP I could not speak about other aspects of my disease and the story of my bi - ography.\" And: \"I'd like to be more positive and deal better with my feelings of suffering. (...) Biographic counselling gives me self-acceptation and help to step out of the pattern of feeling a victim of things. (...) And anthroposophy gives me tools to look to suffering from a different perspective.\" MJ: \" Rhythmic massages made me feel stronger and reduced my stress symptoms.\" SM: \"My physiological self-regulation has been completely wiped out during the last year, but it just revives, so it's still there! I try to have confidence and support my physiological self-regula - tion, especially with mistletoe therapy. For me it works very stimulating.\" JC: \"In conventional care I miss the extras of anthroposophy, for example, its medication.

Self-monitoring in conventional medicine often implies monitoring of self-mea - surements with medical instruments (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose) (Chiauzzi et al. 2015). In AM self-monitoring implies the monitoring (self-reflection) of (1) the quality of one's own activity during treatment (e.g., monitoring the quality of a movement one per - forms in eurhythmy therapy), (2) how one deals with treatment- and health-related issues (e.g., self-research in one's biography), and of (3) the physiological and/ or psychological responses to these self-reflection activities (Baars and Van der Bie 2008, 2009). This type of self-monitoring is supported by mindfulness-like training of non-judgmental attention skills (by means of e.g Goetheanistic methods and/or meditation training) (Van der Meij et al. 2017, Borthoft 2010, H\u00f6lzel et al. 2011) and the application of AM concepts (of health and disease, healing processes, and the relationship between disease and AM treatment), resulting in a cognitive change of how one thinks about the situation or of one's capaci - ty to manage the demands it poses (Baars and Van der Meij 2011). The development of this type of self-monitoring often results in the situation that patients develop a better connection with (the signals of) their body and mind, a better judgment regarding their health issues, and more responsibility towards and confidence in steering their own health situation (Van der Bie 2009, B\u00fcssing et al. 2011). In addition, a meaningful and personal connection between one's life and illness, which empowers a patient as a human being in general, can develop or can be strengthened (B\u00fcssing et al. 2005, 2007). Supportive evidence comes from mindfulness(-related) research. For example, H\u00f6lzel et al. (2011) demonstrate that mindfulness training results in a decrease in distress as well as an increase in positive mood states by means of effects on attention regulation, body awareness, and emotion regulation, and a change self-perspective. B\u00fcssing et al. (2011) demonstrated that active (emotional) engagement of individuals practicing these types of therapy is associated with stress and symptom reduction, and increases of life satisfaction and quality of life. Self-monitoring is also confirmed from the patients' perspectives in Koster et al. (2016). Monitoring is one of the items within the domain of Being well informed. Reflec - tive self-monitoring is confirmed by means of the domain Mindful inner attitude . Relevant items are \"Self-awareness\", \"Emotional \"Acceptance\", \"Confidence in own body\". The interviews with patients about their experiences with AM (Koster et al. 2016) illustrate the described topics: MD: \"Physiological self-regulation is the starting point, a force from the person itself (...) that wants to stay alive. (...) Being aware of what you feel and what 125 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineyou need, and act towards it. (...) You have to listen to it.\" GH: \"... because I have to take care that my physiological self-regulation can function properly, and I think that it only does when I listen to the signals my body gives me.\" JC: \" When I get ill, first I evaluate what I have done the last few weeks or months. Did I take more than I can handle? I try to accept it and adjust my lifestyle, so that after a while I'll find a balance again.\" ER: \" Therapy gives me support and advise so I can do it myself, and to practice what I have learned. (...) I have a stone in my pock - et. A trick to stay in the here and now. It is the force I need to fulfil something.\" Conclusions AM offers specific contributions to the promotion of the self-management of patients. 1) Contributions of AM to the patient-centered, collaborative promotion of the self- management of patients are: a. the application of basic values (equivalence, servitude and presence of mind) by healthcare professionals, and b. the application of specific methods by healthcare professionals to assess the qualities of the higher organization levels in their relationship to the lower physical and physiological levels of the human being and the specific individual and complex situation of the patient. 2) Contributions of AM to the improvement of the coping strategies of patients with health-related issues are: a. the provision of a spiritual worldview that serves as a coping strategy; b. treatment of patients in such a way that they (further) develop self-regulating functioning, both on the physiological and the psychosocial level, thus enabling the self-management of disease related symptoms, and c. treatment of patients with (non-verbal) therapies, in order to improve their emotion-focused coping skills. 3) The contribution of AM to an improvement of the self-monitoring of the patients' own health status comprises: a. training of the patients' monitoring skills of reflecting on one's own activity during treatment, of how one deals with treatment- and health-related issues, and on the physiological and/or psychological reactions to these self-reflection activities. 4) The specific contributions of AM to the promotion of self-management of patients 126 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinederived from the AM worldview, concepts, and methods have been confirmed by quali - tative and quantitative patient evaluation research. 7.4 Discussion One major current development in healthcare is that the individual patient with his/ her personal environment is moving more and more into the center of attention and is increasingly perceived as an equal partner alongside the healthcare professionals. Expres - sions of this development are the increase of shared decision-making and the increasing emphasis on self-management of patients. In this article we explored the specific contri - butions of AM to self-management of patients. We demonstrated that within the current definition of self-management, AM has specific contributions that are experienced by pa - tients as demonstrated in patient evaluation studies. A limitation of this article is its scoping character, exploring the relevant topics and supporting the described conceptual domains with evidence from clinical research and qualitative and quantitative studies on patient experiences, although not systemati - cally collected. Future studies should therefore focus on a more systematic review of the literature and more empirical studies in this field. However, given the increasing emphasis on patient self-management in healthcare, which is completely in line with AM values and worldview, supporting optimal self-management of patients could and should be further developed as an important branch of AM.

( Submitted )128 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAbstract Background: Self-management has become important in Western healthcare. Anthro - posophic Medicine (AM) adopts a holistic patient-centred approach to self-management, based on specific human values. Human values might influence patients' preferences and priorities regarding quality of care. The European Social Survey regularly measures a set of ten human value-orientations amongst populations. This study hypothesised that the value-orientations Universalism and Self-direction (UN-SD) are more prevalent amongst AM users than in the general Dutch population. In addition, it compares patient character - istics and health behaviour between AM users and the Dutch population. Methods: Design: Comparison of two cross-sectional surveys. Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics, general linear model with repeated measures, within-subjects factor HumanValues (levels: UN-SD and OthVal), between-subjects factor Population (levels: AM and NL), post hoc comparison of estimate marginal means, and logistic regression analyses. Results: Response: N=2693 (AM: N=830; NL: N=1863). In the AM group people are likely to be older, more often female and higher educated. An interaction of HumanValues* Population occurred (F(1, 2569)= 423.73, p<.001), with the AM group scoring highest on UN-SD. The effect was also conditional on covariates Education (F=121.27), Age (F=36.99) and Gender (F=15.49) . AM was a predictor of eating vegetables (B=0.94), smoking (B=-1.21) and use of alcohol (B=-0.51). UN-SD was a predictor of eating vegetables (B=0.30), physical activity (B=0.21), and use of alcohol (B=-0.19). Conclusion: The interaction-effect between human values and population confirmed that the values UN-SD were more prevalent amongst AM users than in the Dutch popula - tion. Both AM and UN-SD are positively related to a healthy lifestyle. 129 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine8.1. Introduction Faced with increasing numbers of chronically ill, promoting self-management of patients has become an important topic in Western healthcare systems. Previous research showed that Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) adopts a patient-centred approach to self-management, based on specific values and specific methods, focusing on coping strategies and self-monitoring (Baars et al. 2017). AM is a form of Integrative Medicine (IM), that combines all knowledge from conventional medicine with a holistic view on illness and health. In particular, it uses self-healing principles on physical, physiological, psychological and spiritual levels (Baars and Hamre 2017). This suggests, that distinctive elements of AM - specifically its approach to self-management - may be relevant for larger groups of patients than just current users of AM. Research about sustainable development argues that general human values affect the way people shape their behaviours and lifestyle (de Vries and Petersen 2009, Van Egmond and De Vries 2011, Hedlund-de Witt et al. 2014). Following, it is likely that human values also influence patients' preferences in healthcare and their priorities with respect to quality of care (Tilburt and Geller 2007, Lee et al. 2013, Bastemeijer et al. 2017). Since AM has developed as part of a larger set of values (aspects of the anthroposophic worldview), it begs the question how well anthroposophic values in general, and AM's emphasis on self-management specifically, would fit with the values of the Dutch population at large. AM patients, namely, are probably not a representative subsample of the general Dutch patient population (Kienle et al. 2006, Esch et al. 2008, Arman et al. 2011). The European Social Survey (ESS) measures human values amongst populations in different European countries. It uses the ten value-orientations of Schwartz: Conformity, Tradition, Benevolence, Universalism, Self-direction, Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, Power and Security (Schwartz 2003, ESS 2014). The AM worldview (Baars and Hamre 2017, Baars et al. 2018) and its focus on self-management and its holistic nature (Baars et al. 2017), suggest that the values Universalism and Self-direction might be more prevalent within the AM population compared to the general public. The values Self-direction contains the items 1) important to think new ideas and being creative; and 2) important to make own decisions and be free. The values Universalism contains the items 1) important that people are treated equally and justice for everyone; 2) important to listen and to understand different people; and 3) important to care for nature and environment (Schwartz 2003, ESS 2014). A motivation for using AM is more personal involvement in the healing process and control over decisions regarding ones health and treatment (Arman et al. 2011, Jong et al. 2012). This motivation mirrors the value Self-direction. Another motivation is the holistic nature of AM and its integration of scientific and spiritual knowledge (Arman et al. 2011, Jong et al. 2012). This motivation 130 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinemirrors the value Universalism. This study aims to generate more insight into the background characteristics, health behaviour, and human value-orientations of people that use AM in comparison with the general Dutch population. Specifically, we hypothesised that the values Universalism and Self-direction are more present in the AM population than in the Dutch population in general, while we did not have specific expectations regarding the other human values. The research questions are: - What are specific background characteristics, health behaviours and human values of AM users, in comparison with the general Dutch population? - Are the values Universalism and Self-direction more prevalent among AM users than in the general Dutch population? - Are AM and/or the values Universalism and Self-direction related to people's health behaviour/status? 8.2 Methods 8.2.1 Design A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Dutch AM users. AM users were asked to fill out a questionnaire containing the Human Values questionnaire, background character - istics and health behaviour questions from the ESS (ESS 2014). For comparison, the AM data set was merged with the existing ESS data from The Netherlands, round 7 (ESS 2014). Round 7 was chosen instead of the more recent round 8 (ESS 2016/2017), because round 8 did not contain items about health behaviour/status, which were relevant for answering research question three. The STROBE guidelines were followed as much as possible. 8.2.2. Data collection An invitation to participate in the survey was sent to all members of the Dutch anthroposophic patient organisation Antroposana. The survey was also publicly promoted and accessible on the website of the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. Respondents were included based on at least one of the following criteria: - Deliberate choice for a general practitioner who offers AM - Currently receiving AM treatment - Self-care with or interest in AM - Member of AM patient organisation Data collection took place during three months, from November 11th, 2017 to February 11th, 2018. People were invited to fill out an online questionnaire. Informed consent had to be 131 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinegiven at the start. 8.2.3 Variables The Human Values questionnaire (Schwartz 2003) contains 21 items and is part of the ESS survey rounds (ESS 2002 - 2018). It contains ten value-orientations: Conformity, Tradition, Benevolence, Universalism, Self-direction, Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, Power and Security. Each value is formed by two items, except Universalism, which contains three items (ESS 2004). The scores on the items are measured on a scale from 1 (very unlike me) to 6 (very like me). The ESS prescribes that the scores on human values should be standardised (ESS 2004). Scores were standardised per respondent. After standardisation a participant's score of 0 signifies a score on the exact mean of all his/her human value-scores. The background characteristics and health behaviour/status questions were chosen based on relevance and included: gender, age, education, perceived general health (PGH), limitation in daily life cause by chronic conditions (mental and/or physical), fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking habits and use of alcohol (details in table 8.1). Table 8.1.

However, while pre-exploring the data we found an extreme difference in age between the two populations. This would cause the weights for younger people in the AM data to be unrealistically high. Therefore, we decided to control for age differences between the two populations through adding it as a covariate instead (see 8.2.4.2). 8.2.4.1 Descriptive statistics Means and standard deviations were calculated for background characteristics, human values, and health behaviour/status variables. 8.2.4.2 Human value-orientations To test our hypothesis on human value-orientations within and between the AM and NL populations, we performed a general linear model (GLM) analysis with repeated mea - sures. Two new variables were constructed per participant: [UN-SD] containing the mean of a participant's standardised (ESS 2004) scores on Universalism and Self-direction and [OthVal] containing the mean of his/her standardized scores on the other values. [UN-SD] and [OthVal] comprise the two levels of the within-subjects factor named Hum - Val. The between-subjects factor was named Population, with levels NL and AM. To control for the effects of Age (continuous), Gender (M/F) and Education (9 levels), these were added as covariates in the model. 8.2.4.3 Health behaviour and health status To explore a possible influence of AM and the combined values Universalism and Self- direction [UN-SD] on aspects of health behaviour/status, logistic regression analyses were performed. Independent variables were: a dummy for being an AM user, UN-SD, age, gender and education (see table 8.1). For each aspect of health behaviour/status we performed a separate analysis and used a three step-method to see which factors were better predictors and generated the best fitting model. In the first block the variables age, gender and education were included. In the second block the dummy variable AM was added, and in the third block the variable UN-SD. The dependent variables were: PGH, limitations caused by chronic conditions, fruit intake, vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking habit, and use of alcohol. All dependent variables originally had different levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal and interval), but have consistently been recoded into two categories to be able to run similar analyses for all dependent variables (see table 8.1). To check the fit of the model we used the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test (Sieben and Linssen 2009). 133 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine8.3 Results 8.3.1 Response The initial response of the AM survey was N=841. Six respondents did not meet the inclu - sion criteria and five respondents had missing variables on age. Therefore the resulting response was N= 830. Of the respondents 87% were member of the patient organisation Antroposana. Based on \u00b14200 members (Antroposana 2018), it means that about 17% of its members were represented in the survey and not all users are member of the patient organisation. 71% of the respondents had deliberately chosen for an AM general prac - titioner and 60% received AM treatment at the time of measuring. The ESS database contained 1919 respondents. Within this database 56 respondents had age <18 or missing variables on age; these were excluded. The combined database contained 2693 respon dents (AM: N=830; NL: N=1863). 8.3.2 Descriptive statistics 8.3.2.1 Background characteristics Table 8.2 provides frequencies and means on age, gender and education. In the AM group women, people above 65 years of age, and people with on average higher education are overrepresented. In fact, the AM group was very high educated: 76,4% had at least a bach - elor degree, compared to 33,2% in the general population. 134 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 8.2 Background characteristics Characteristic Population p-value 19.2% Junior general secondary education 6.5% 10.1% Intermediate 8.3.2.2 Overview value-orientations Figure 8.1 and table 8.3 provide information on the distribution of human value-orienta - tions within and between the AM users and the general Dutch population (NL). Figure 1 suggests that the AM group identifies mainly with three value-orientations, - Benevolence, Universalism and Self-direction - and mostly with Universalism and Self-direction. Power and Achievement are the least identified with within the AM group. Figure 1 further sug - gests that the NL group identifies also mainly with Benevolence, Universalism and Self-di - rection, however, the means are lower than those of the AM group. 135 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicinePower Conformity Tradition Achievement Hedonism 8.1 Human value-orientations in AM and NL Table 8.3 Human value -orientations in AM and NL AM Mean (range -3 - +3) NL Mean (range -3 - +3) Mean The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine8.3.2.3 Health behaviour and health status Table 8.4 shows the mean scores of the AM and the NL group on health behaviour and health status. The AM group has higher averages on fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity, and lower averages on smoking and use of alcohol. In contrast, the AM population seems to have a slightly worse PGH and experiences more limitations in daily life caused by chronic conditions. Regarding physical activity the results reveal different patterns: in the general Dutch population the largest groups of people have physical ac - tivity on zero days (19,8%) and seven days (24,3%) a week, and the smallest groups on five (6,8%) and six days (3%), whereas in the AM group the frequencies or group sizes are much more evenly distributed over the number of days (range: 7,2% - 16,8%), and zero and one day(s) having the smallest groups (not presented in table).

Specifically, it was hypothesised that a difference would occur on UN-SD between the AM and NL group, while no such difference was expected to occur on OthVal. In other words; a statistical interaction effect was predicted between on the one hand the within-subjects factor HumVal with the two levels OthVal and UN-SD and on the other the between-subjects factor Population with two levels NL and AM. The predicted interaction of HumVal * Population occurred (F(1, 2569)= 423.73, p<.001, p2= .142) (see 137 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinefigure 2). The effect of HumVal turned out to be significant by itself (F(1, 2569)= 8.08, p=.005, p2= .003). The effect also turned out to be conditional on the other variables, i.e., in descending order the covariates Education, Age and The test of the interaction was significant with p<0.001, suggesting that the effects of HumVal (within-subjects factor) across populations are different. Figure 8.2 suggests further that this interaction was mainly due to the AM group scoring highest on the combined values of Universalism & Self-direction. This was confirmed by a (post-hoc) comparison of the difference on the estimated marginal means between AM and NL on UN-SD. It showed up as a major positive coefficient in the regression analysis with UN-SD - ates Gender, Education and Age these estimates were much smaller (resp. B= .078, 5.74, p<.001; intercept n.s.). As was the estimate for the simple effect on OthVal -.164 (S.E.= n.s.). These results confirmed our hypothesis that larger differences exist between AM users and the general Dutch population on the combined values of Universalism and Self-direction than on the combined other values of the ESS questionnaire, with AM scor - ing substantially higher on the combined values of Universalism and Self-direction than the general Dutch population.138 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of Anthroposophic Convariates appearing in the model are evaluated at the following values: Gender 1M2F = 1.60 Education = 5.81 Age = 55.98Human Values Estimated Marginal Means Legend: AM NL Figure 8.2 Interaction effect between Human values and Population 8.3.4 Health behaviour and health status Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyse whether being an AM user (AM) or having a preference for Universalism and Self-direction (UN-SD) has a relation with aspects on health behaviour/status (table 8.5a-c). The B-values of the model with the best fit are reported. 8.3.4.1 Fruit, vegetables and physical activity The regression analysis (table 8.5b) reveals that the difference in fruit intake between the AM and NL group is entirely caused by the influence of age, gender and education (model 1). It shows that older people, women, and people with higher education levels eat more often fruit on average. Regarding eating vegetables the results show a different pattern. 139 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineThe largest significant predictors of vegetable intake were AM (B=0.94), Gender (B=0.61), and UN-SD (B=0.30; Model 3). These results show that both the AM group and people with a higher value-orientation of UN-SD, as well as women, eat more vegetables. In ad - dition, age and education had a small positive influence on vegetable intake. Regarding physical activity, only UN-SD was a significant predictor (B=0.21; Model 3). 8.3.4.2 Smoking and alcohol Table 8.5c shows that AM is the main significant predictor of people's smoking habits (B=-1,21; Model 2), with the AM group smoking less. Also age, education and gender were significantly related, with women, older people, and people with higher education levels smoking less. A value-orientation of UN-SD does not influence peoples smoking habits. Both AM (B=-0.51) and UN-SD (B=-0.19; Model 3) are significantly related with the use of alcohol. The AM group and people with higher orientations on UN-SD drink less often alcohol. Men and people with higher education levels drink on average more often alcohol. 8.3.4.3 PGH and limitations in daily life Table 8.5a shows that the AM group experiences more limitations in daily life caused by chronic conditions than the general Dutch population (B=0.389; Model 2). However, using AM did not have an effect on PGH. This means that although the AM group experiences more limitations, these people perceive their health just as good as the general Dutch pop - ulation. UN-SD had no significant influence on PGH and neither on limitations. Only within the analysis of PGH the Hosmer and Lemeshow test was significant (p=0,029). However, because the sample was large enough (N >1000), the fit of the model could be trusted.140 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 8.5a Logistic regression: PGH and limitations PGH Block 1 Model Block 2 Block 3 Ch2 181.915** 181.915** .608 0.02 1.02 2 Model Block 3 Ch2 148.473** 12.526** 160.999 ** 0.05; ** = p < 0.001; = fittest model 141 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 8.5b Logistic regression: fruit, vegetables and physical activity Fruit Block 1 Model Block 2 Block 3 Ch2 146.497** 146.497** 33.876** Ch2 11.359* 7.752* p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.001; = fittest model 142 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 8.5c Logistic regression: smoking and alcohol Smoking Block 1 Block 2 Model Block 3 Ch2 316.177** 39.961** 28.434** 0.05; ** = p < 0.001; = fittest model 8.4. Discussion This study aimed to generate more insights into the relationship between age, gender, education, health behaviour/status, and human value-orientations of AM users, in com - parison with the Dutch population in general. We found that among AM users woman and people over 65 years of age were overrepresented, and the responding AM users were extremely high educated: 76,4% had at least a bachelor degree. Furthermore, the interac - tion-effect between human values and population that we demonstrated, confirmed our hypothesis that the values UN-SD were more prevalent among AM users than in the NL population. Finally, we showed that both AM and UN-SD are positively related to a healthy lifestyle. AM users and people with higher orientations on UN-SD eat more often vegeta - bles and drink less often alcohol. Higher orientation on UN-SD was also positively related to physical activity, and using AM was significantly related to healthy smoking habits. Our study confirms the importance of values in the combined domain of Univer - salism and Self-direction for AM users and their congruence with AM worldview. However, the relatively high means of these values within the general Dutch population indicates that within this population a group exists with similar values as AM users. This implicates that AM care has potential to meet healthcare preferences and patient values of a larger group of patients. Generating more insight into the way human values influence what patients find important will contribute to a better understanding of patients' values, pref - 143 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineerences and priorities. On a theoretical level, similarities exist between the values Universalism and Self-direction on the one side and specific patient-values on the other side. For example, Universalism theoretically resembles values of patient-centred care, holistic care and whole person medicine (Franzel et al. 2013, Milstein 2015, Foley and Steel 2017); Self-direc - tion may resemble self-management, autonomy and patient-empowerment (Bastemeijer et al. 2017). These issues are relevant in healthcare in general, not only in AM. For instance, the positive relation of UN-SD and using AM on health behaviour might be valuable to the practice and development of lifestyle interventions. Awareness of underlying human values might contribute to insight in effectiveness of interventions and compliance of patients. To our knowledge this is the first study that measures human value-orientations among AM users (or any specific group of patients) and combines these findings with those of the general population. Another strength of the study is the availability of two large data sets. The number of responders to the AM survey exceeded expectations, al - though we cannot establish to what extent these are a representative sample of the total Dutch AM population. Limitations of this study are that only 17% of all members of the AM patient organisation participated in the survey, and that people over 65 years of age were overrepresented and people under 40 years of age were underrepresented in the AM data set. This study reveals that outside the field of AM similar values exist, which res - onate with AM worldview. This implicates that the practice of AM based on its specific values and worldview is potentially relevant for a larger patient group. Further research should focus on if and if so, how this extended group of people could benefit from AM care. Ethics statement: The research has been discussed and approved by the Ethics Review Board of Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Tilburg University. There were no ethical concerns. Respondents have given informed consent at the start of the ques - tionnaire.144 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine 145 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine 9. General discussion146 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineIntroduction 9.1 Background Within Western healthcare, a major transformation regarding the position of patients has taken place over the past fifty years. Patients wish to be treated as whole human beings instead of illness cases, many have strong motivations to be actively involved in their treatment process and feel the need to participate in shaping healthcare in a way that addresses the issues that they consider to be important (Engelen 2012, Rademaker 2012, Boer 2013, Franzel et al. 2013, Miletus 2016, Smit 2018). On the policy level, this is reflect - ed in the view that patients should be empowered to play their role as \"third party\" and active consumers. Associated with this transformation of the role and position of patients is the increasing number of people that makes a deliberate choice for using T&CM in addition to conventional biomedical-based medicine. The most important reason for patients to choose for T&CM is dissatisfaction with conventional medicine (Fischer 2014). However, most patients do not wish to turn their back upon conventional medicine at all, but rather like to be able to choose best of both worlds and want a treatment that fits within their sit - uation and is line with their personal values and preferences (Maizes et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, Kemppainen et al. 2018). This calls for an integration of T&CM with conventional medicine, and subsequently for a further development of IM. This need is strongly under - lined by the WHO (WHO 2013), supported by a growing body of evidence roborating IM (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Herman et al. 2012, Baars and Kooreman 2014, Hamre et al. 2014, Kligler et al. 2016, Baars et al. 2018). So far, the scientific development of IM has largely focused on clinical research (Adams and Robinson 2013) and this has had many merits in developing good quality evidence on for example safety and (cost)effectiveness of IM interventions. However, to broaden the scope of IM's research field and to connect with other developments related to the delivery of healthcare and health services research (Adams and Robinson 2013), measuring patient-reported quality of care would be a legitimate next step. Measuring patient-reported quality of care in IM is important for several rea - sons. One, it will contribute to the further development of a sound scientific base for IM. Two, it will provide concrete patient-derived feedback to improve IM services. Three, from patients' perspective, IM has added value compared with conventional medicine and this value could be relevant for a large patient group (Frenkel et al. 2008, Greene Prabhu et al. 2009, Jong et al. 2012, Franzel et al. 2013, Foley and Steel 2017). In the light of the current 147 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinedebates on how to improve healthcare and reduce costs, the investigation of patient-re - ported quality of IM could reveal aspects that may be relevant to all patients, including those treated by only conventional practitioners. Four, measuring patient-reported quality in IM will contribute to the knowledge structure that is needed for the integration of safe and effective T&CM within Dutch healthcare. 9.2 This thesis Being a classical example of IM, this thesis has focused on AM. The thesis is the result of a thorough search on how to measure patient-reported quality of care in AM in a way that it addresses aspects of AM care that are relevant to patients. Therefore, it was important to address the topic mainly from the perspectives of patients. This thesis has grown over the years from a small scale measurement in a single AM institution, to measuring spe - cific patient experiences of over 2000 patients in 22 AM GP practices and comparing AM practices with conventional GP practices, to investigating patient-relevant outcomes of AM treatment and AM GP care, to reviewing how and to what extent patient-reported quality of care is measured in other forms of IM as well, and, eventually, to investigating human values of AM patients. At this point, the results will be looked back upon and what has developed along the way will be harvested. In doing so the results of this thesis can be drawn into a mean - ingful structure, supported by the three main research questions of this thesis: 1) What are characteristics of AM users, in terms of demography, health behaviour and human values? (In short: Who are AM patients?), 2) What specific aspects of AM care are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view? (In short: What do AM patients find important?), and 3) How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do AM patients evaluate their received care? (In short: How do AM patients evaluate their care?). The findings on these questions provide three structural parts that make up the heart of this general discussion. The first part describes and elaborates on the group of people who uses AM care. This includes patients' characteristics, health behaviour as well as their human val - ues and worldview. Worldviews are overarching philosophies, systems of meaning that act as the fundamental lenses through which humans see and interpret reality (De Witt et al. 2016). According to Van Egmond (2010) and De Witt et al. (2016) worldviews determine to a large extent the concepts humans find important in life, among which are human values (Van Egmond 2010). We suspect that these values are also related to what patients find important and their preferences regarding healthcare (Lee et al. 2013). For example Chapter seven suggests a possible relation between AM worldview and AM patient's pref - erences regarding self-management. These and other patient preferences make up the 148 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinesecond part. The second part is a description of and discussion on specific aspects of AM care and AM patients' preferences. In their turn, these preferences can be formulated into domains and actual items that can be used to measure quality of care. The results of the actual measurements are described and discussed in the third part. Looking from this end of the structure, the results of the measurements will give feedback on how received care meets patients' preferences and quality standards. This way the structure suggests that patients' preferences and quality standards are depending on values that - usually implicitly - lay behind the preferences. In their turn these values might be embedded in worldviews. In this general discussion a possible relation between worldview and measuring quality of care will be made more explicit. 9.3 Overview main findings Table 9.1 provides an overview of the main findings in this thesis. The structure of the table connects the chronological development of the chapters of this thesis with the conceptual structure of the three main research questions. The results of each sub-study are ordered following their contribution to answering the main questions. Here, a brief overview of the main results and their relation to the three overall questions is given. Sections 9.4 - 9.6 will elaborate on the findings, describe the results in more details, and discuss them. Chapter two reported the results of an evaluation survey among parents and their children who visited the Kindertherapeuticum in Zeist, an integrative healthcare centre for children. The results contributed to research question three. They showed that most parents were very satisfied with the care they received. In most cases the received care contributed to parents' understanding of and their capability to help, guide and support their child, and an improved health status of the child. In general, the integrative approach of the healthcare centre was very much valued. Chapter three and four reported the construction and validation of, and measur - ing with the CQ-Index Anthroposophic Healthcare. The results contribute to both research questions two and three. They showed that patient-reported experiences with AM GP care were good and slightly - although significantly - better than those with conventional GP care, also when controlling for patient characteristics, but not any more when controlling for care aspects. Two specific AM scales were developed: Anthroposophic Treatment and Interactional Style GP. A comparison of possible influencing factors demonstrated that Age, Diminishing health problems and specific aspects of care - GP Communication, GP Conduct and Practice Assistant - are most important for experience rating and recommen - dation. Chapter five reported a triangulation study, using within-method triangulation of four data sources. It makes an important contribution to research question two. It identi - 149 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinefied twelve outcome domains that are relevant to AM patients, of which seven were new compared to the domains that exist in currently often used PROMs and QOL measure - ment instruments. Chapter six reported a scoping review on how patient-reported quality of care is measured in AM/IM. It contributes to both research questions two and three. It revealed the use of a wide variety of instruments to measure patient-reported quality in IM, without actual consensus on what instruments to use best. In addition it showed a range of cate - gories that were evaluated with qualitative methods, were patient derived, and identified as relevant for AM/IM patients. The most prevalent ones have been put in table 9.1. Chapter seven investigated - both conceptually within the literature and empir - ically among patients - AM's contribution to the practice of self-management. The study contributes to both research questions one and two. It provided a description of AM worl - dview as a spiritual worldview and its contribution (according to patients) to the practice of self-management, and an investigation of (other) patient-relevant aspects of AM that contribute to the practice of self-management. Chapter eight reports of a survey that aimed to identify patient characteristics, human value-orientations and health behaviour aspects within the AM population in com - parison to the general Dutch population. The study contributes to research question one. The study confirmed the hypothesis that the values Universalism and Self-direction are more present within the AM population compared to the general Dutch population. It also revealed that AM users are more likely to have a healthier lifestyle than the general Dutch population.150 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 9.1 Overview study aims and results 1.

One database was generated during the CQ-Index AH validation study (Chapters three and four) and contains data from 2063 patients of AM GP practices and the other database was generated to measure human value-orientations and contains data from 830 people that choose deliberately for AM (chapter eight, AM data). Both databases were compared with data of respectively conventional GP practices and the general Dutch population. Considering basic population characteristics three aspects stand out: gender, age and education. Within the CQ-Index AH data 65% of the respondents were female. Within the AM data of the human values study 70% were female. In both cases the percentage was significantly higher than within conventional care and the general Dutch population. Considering age, the mean ages in both databases were significantly higher than in con - ventional care or the general Dutch population. Within the CQ-Index AH data the mean age was 54 years. In the AM human values data the mean age was 65 years and 58% of all respondents were 65 years and older. AM patients also have on average significantly high - er education levels than conventional GP patients or the general Dutch population: within the CQ-Index AH data 55% had a bachelor or master degree and within the human values AM dataset 76% had at least a bachelor degree, compared to 26,9% (CQ-index GP), respectively 33,2% (ESS round 7) in the general population. These findings show that it is likely that AM is often used by a group of patients containing more women, relatively older people, and people with higher education levels than the general Dutch population. These patient characteristics are in line with interna - tional research on AM (Kienle et al. 2006) and the wider field of IM (Jong et al. 2012, Van Vliet 2017), except for the factor age. Looking at the CQ-Index database - generated in 2011 - and the Dutch AM database - generated in 2018 - one can see that the mean age is much higher in the latter one. The Dutch AM population might be getting older, or maybe younger people are less likely to become a member of a patient organisation. In the end, the data in this thesis suggests that the Dutch AM population seems to be older than the AM population in other countries. If this is actually the case, and if so by which factors this 154 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineis caused, should be further investigated. Regarding health behaviour, chapter eight suggests that AM users tend to eat more vegetables, drink less alcohol and have healthier smoking habits compared to the general Dutch population. 9.4.2 Patients' values An important characteristic of patients that use AM is their often deliberate choice for this type of care. AM meets a demand for care that seems not to be met in conventional care. In other words, people choose deliberately for AM because they consider AM to have added value in comparison with conventional care (Chapter 2, 3). Within the CQ-Index data set 78% of the patients had chosen deliberately for AM. Of these 78% of the patients, 76% did so because they considered AM to have added value. This means that 57% of all respondents had chosen for AM because of its considered added value. Perceived added value of AM was also an important reason for visiting the Kindertherapeuticum (Chapter 2). In total, 88% of the parents choose deliberately for AM care. The most important reasons for consultation were perceived added value of AM (68%) and interest in AM (32%). It seems that for patients the perceived added value of AM is rooted within the AM worldview (Chapter 5 and 7). A worldview is an overarching (life) philosophy, a system of meaning that informs how humans interpret, enact and co-create reality (Van Egmond 2010, Lee et al. 2013, De Witt et al. 2016). Chapter seven describes the AM worldview based on five interrelated aspects: ontology, epistemology, axiology, anthropology and societal vision (De Witt et al. 2016): 1. Ontology : According to AM, the human being is a spiritual being that encompasses three organisational levels: a spirit, a soul and a living physical body. The human be - ing is viewed as a whole that integrates and balances these different 'levels' that are constantly interacting with each other and the outside world. Health and disease are expressions of interactions within the system of these organisational levels. Treatment is oriented at influencing different aspects of the involved levels in health and disease. AM treatments promote the person\u00b4s physiological and/or psychosocial ability to adaptively acquire or maintain health across changing personal and environmental conditions. Therefore, in essence, it is a sustainable health promotion strategy, one that supports and enables patients to actively contribute to and self-manage their own health and disease status. 2. Epistemology: AM is an integration of knowledge and methods from conventional med - icine and science with anthroposophy. It combines scientific and spiritual knowledge. With regard to healthcare, it practices an integration of a 'fighting disease' approach 155 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineand a health promotion approach. 3. Anthropology and societal vision : According to the spiritual position, the human being is developing itself towards optimal self-management, in close relationship with and responsible for the development of all other humans and the earth. 4. Axiology: from these four aspects of the AM worldview, three important values can be drawn: equivalence (between all human beings), servitude (towards the development of oneself and other individuals) and presence of mind (in order to be able to find situa - tional solutions). (Chapter 7) The combination of a scientific and spiritual view on health and illness seems to be in line with many patients' own point of view, their values and preferences (Chapters 5, 6 and 7). Moreover, the AM worldview offers a resource for meaning making and coping (Chapter 7). According to Tilburt and Geller (2007), Van Egmond (2010), Van Egmond and De Vries (2011) and De Witt et al. (2016) the influence of worldviews is profound, persistent and frequently overlooked. Worldviews hold - mostly implicit - assumptions about real - ity. This means that, although worldviews often remain largely subconscious, they could shape to a great extent people's view on the world, and one's role and position within it (Tilburt and Geller 2007, Van Egmond 2010, Van Egmond and De Vries 2011, De Witt et al. 2016). Van Egmond and De Vries (2011) and De Witt et al. (2016) argue that worldviews produce values that give direction to the way humans shape their lives and express their lifestyles. They influence our choices and priorities, and provide the background for our judgments (Van Egmond 2010, Van Egmond and De Vries 2011, De Witt et al. 2016). As such, worldviews interact with people's perceptions of societal issues, for example sustainability, economy, education and health care. De Witt et al. (2016) describes four major worldviews of Western society: traditional, modern, postmodern and integrative and have provided empirical validation of these worldviews by developing a comprehen - sive methodological framework to map and study these worldviews. If worldviews shape peoples view on reality, it is likely that worldviews or life philosophies also shape how people perceive the intrinsic aims of healthcare and medi - cine, the role of care providers, and their own role as a patient (Lee et al. 2013). Lee et al. (2013) has studied the role of value in patients' decision making and found that a group of values that is involved in making health decision is rooted in patients' life philosophy or worldview. Subsequently, Lee et al. (2013) argue that life philosophy may influence what people find important regarding healthcare and their medical decisions. Tilburt and Geller (2007) state that the culture of academic medicine has been 156 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinedominated by a biomedical worldview and in the practice of conventional medicine bio - medical assumptions largely persist. Biomedical worldview has its roots in Modernity (Bynum 2013, Baars and Hamre 2017) and has much in common with the so-called mod - ern worldview (Tilburt and Geller 2007, Van Egmond 2010, De Witt et al. 2016). Within the biomedical worldview facts are external, material, objective realities that can be measured (Tilburt and Geller 2007). The same goes for the concept of quality of care: it should be objective and measurable, based on clearly defined interventions, professional actions, indicators and/or parameters (Cleary et al.1997, IOM 2001, Starfield 2001, ICHOM 2019). Being a worldview that integrates both spiritual and scientific realities the AM worldview (Baars en Hamre 2017) has much in common with the integrative worldview described by De Witt (2016), Koster (2007) and Van Egmond (2010) Van Egmond and De Vries 2011). (Van Egmond (2010), Van Egmond and De Vries (2011), and Koster (2007) describe the integrative or holistic worldview as a worldview in which different viewpoints are integrated. It strives to overcome limitations from unilateral point of views, in order to pursue a greater sense of knowledge, insight and wholeness (Koster 2007, Gruwez and Van Egmond 2008, Van Egmond and De Vries 2011). Following, the holistic or integrative worldview integrates Modern viewpoints with viewpoints from other worldviews. Hence, it leaves the Modern worldview as well as other worldviews as the only way of looking at reality and incorporates them as one of the ways that help to understand reality. This fun - damental integrative character is similar to the integrative character of IM. It integrates T&CM point of views with biomedical point of views, to address the need and endeavour of patients to get access to the best (care) of both worlds. In this sense IM, and AM as a specific form of IM, are practical fields of medicine that come into being by using different lenses to understand health, disease and treatment. The results of chapter eight demonstrate that AM users have on average a hu - man value-orientation in which Universalism and Self-direction are more present than other value-orientations. Especially the value Universalism, which contains the themes human equality, listening to and understanding of others, and care for nature and the environment, seems to have meaningful similarities with the holistic or integrative world - view. The study shows also empirically that this value is connected with the use of AM care (Chapter 8). Also within conventional medicine, many values that are reported by patients fit much better within the integrative worldview than within the Modern or biomedical world - view. This goes especially for values of patient-centred care. In their review Bastemeijer et al. (2017) made a conceptualisation of patients' values and patient-centred care, derived from patients, to be used as a basis for guidelines, policy and daily practice. Bastemeijer et al. (2017) identified seven key values: uniqueness, autonomy, compassion, professional - ism, responsiveness, partnership and empowerment. 157 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Important reoccurring patient values are being seen, heard and taken seriously as a whole human being, instead of a patient with a health problem; providers taking time; and receiving treatment within the context of one's own social world and view on life (Schoot et al. 2005, Epstein and Street 2011, Bastemeijer et al. 2017, Adam et al. 2019). These widely mentioned values demonstrate that patient-centred care has many similar - ities with a holistic way of healthcare delivery (Franzel et al. 2013, Foley and Steel 2017) (more on this overlap will be described and discussed in section 9.5.5). By viewing values within the concept of worldview and by making worldviews more explicit we can better understand the clash of perspectives in the debate on integrating different healthcare ap - proaches. Subsequently, being conscious of worldviews may be helpful in implementing patient valuing and integrative values in healthcare in a more systematic way. 9.5 What do AM patients find important? - Specific aspects of AM care that are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view 9.5.1 Reflection on aspects of AM care This study demonstrates that to be able to evaluate patient-reported quality in AM and IM, a broader set of evaluation aspects is needed in comparison with current instruments and methods that are used to evaluate conventional medicine and healthcare. In the different sub-studies in this thesis a large variety of aspects that are relevant for AM pa - tients emerged. The construction and validation of the CQ-index AH has generated two addition - al scales - Anthroposophic Treatment and Interactional Style GP - representing a chief part of the added value of AM care. The scale Anthroposophic Treatment contains seven items, which are: 1) AM treatment options; 2) Free choice of treatment options; 3) Focus on physiological self-healing; 4) Patients' own responsibility; 5) Patients' active contribu - tion; 6) Giving meaning within daily life; and 7) Influence on quality of life. The scale Inter - actional Style GP contains five items, that are: 1) Making comfortable; 2) Showing under - standing; 3) Providing insight in background and causes; 4) Providing needed care; and 5) Balanced attitude. These items, for example, AM treatment options, Focus on physio - logical self-healing, Patients active contribution, Giving meaning, and a Balanced attitude reflect aspects of AM worldview and share similarities with the human values Universalism and Self-direction. The scales distinguish themselves also by two main aspects of care: one scale 158 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineaddresses relational aspects of care and the other one addresses interventional aspects of care. Also in the results of the scoping review these two aspects are reflected: the two evaluation aspects that were mostly mentioned were Agency & empowerment and the Pa - tient-provider relationship. This division and its complementary nature are also formulated by Milstein (2015) as healing and curing: being with versus doing to. Milstein points out the importance of implementing both elements to enhance healthcare, to improve patient experiences and to address patients' need for wholeness (Milstein 2015). Both chapters five and six revealed additional aspects of AM and other forms of IM care that are relevant to patients based on qualitative research methods. Chapter six revealed aspects of IM care that were patient-derived and generated in the qualitative stud - ies that were included in the scoping review. Seven aspects were most prevalent: - Agency & Empowerment - Patient-provider relationship - Perceived effectiveness - Coping & Psychological functioning - Inner awareness - MeaningGeneral wellbeing. Chapter five provided a comprehensive insight into outcome aspects of AM that are rel - evant to patients. Twelve domains were identified, seven of which were new compared to often used existing PROMs and QOL measurement instruments. The five common domains are: - Recovery/symptom reduction - General wellbeing - Functioning - Energy/ strength , - Social relationships The new QOL/PRO domains are: - Active contribution/Autonomy; - Meaning; - Rest/relaxation; - Mindful inner attitude; - Care relationship; - Natural healing; - Being well informed. 159 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineThe outcome domains identified in the triangulation study (Chapter 5) showed close sim - ilarities with the aspects that emerged in the scoping review (Chapter 6) as well as with items and domains from the other sub-studies. Also, all patient-derived outcome aspects fit well within the holistic worldview of AM. Although mentioned as new QOL/PRO domains, several domains are not new in the current debate on the delivery of healthcare or in evaluating healthcare performance as a whole. For example, the domains Being well informed and Care relationship are usually part of PREMs, for example in CQ-Indexes (Koopman et al. 2011, Kessel et al. 2014). In - cluded in PREMs, the patient-provider relationship and the information that is provided to patients are evaluated as part of the care process. Also, Active contribution/ autonomy is not new, since it has similarities with the concepts like self-management and patient em - powerment. However, what is new is that chapter five demonstrates that AM patients regard these domains as also contributing to their quality of life as outcome of care. In other words, from AM patients' perspectives a clear division between process factors and out - comes of care is not important. All factors can make a potential important contribution to a better, healthier life, preferably with a well-functioning body and mind, however many times dealing with impairments and illnesses. At the same time, also regarding conven - tional care, research and knowledge about patient-relevant aspects of care and patient preferences and values are growing (Greco et al. 2016, Bastemeijer et al. 2017). However, the integrative character of these aspects is hardly addressed in existing evaluation meth - ods and measurement instruments that are used to measure patient-reported quality of care (Epstein and Street 2011, Greco et al. 2016). The extent to which the domains from chapter five and six are described in the literature on patients' perspectives in healthcare varies enormously. Some have not been investigated very much, like Rest and relaxation or Natural healing , whereas others are com - plete research fields on their own, like Active contribution/ autonomy and Care relationship . Two large domains, that played a role in al sub-studies and of which the importance is also stressed in a growing body of research and attention within society, will be discussed below: patients' active contribution to their own health and the care relationship (Coleman and Newton 2005, Schoot et al. 2005, Street et al. 2009, Benzing and Verheul 2010, Meter - ko et al. 2010, Engelen 2012, Kelley et al. 2014, Kuis 2016, Bastemeijer et al. 2017, Hibbard 2017, Scheffelaar et al. 2018). In addition, their interaction will be described. This interac - tion seems to generate a synergy that might be valuable to understand patients' perspec - tives on and need for more integrative care. 160 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine9.5.2 Self-management and agency Patients' active contribution to one's treatment process, autonomy, self-management, patient empowerment, self-direction, or - with a more general term - agency (Gregory 1981, Street et al. 2009, Dyck and Kearns 2014, Berger and Heusser 2017) is an aspect that played a role in all sub-studies. Moreover, it is highly interconnected with other aspects of care and it functions as a vehicle generating a string of other health and treatment out - comes. Therefore, from patients' point of view AM fits very well within the current empha - sis on self-management and contributes to the practice of self-management in a way that suits individual preferences of patients. In chapter seven the concept of self-management in relation to AM is stretched and the study provides a deeper investigation - both conceptually and empirically derived from patients - of the specific potential of AM and AM's worldview to contribute to the promotion and practice of self-management. As such, this chapter provides further insight into the domain Agency from the perspective of AM patients. Chapter seven describes the way AM contributes to a better coping with health- related issues. According to patients, it does so by providing a spiritual worldview that serves as a coping strategy, treatments that support patients' self-regulating functioning, and (non-verbal) treatments that improve emotion-focused coping skills. In chapter five, self-regulation is clearly described by patients. Respondents de - scribed the positive effects of \"recharging\" as maintaining their physiological self-regula - tion. Recharging is assumed to enable patients to function better and have better self-reg - ulating strategies. This leads to a loop of positive feedback maintaining a well-functioning self-regulating ability. The use of self-regulation may offer individual tailored practical keystones for coping. It increases options and possibilities to actively contribute to one's health. Also, the right and complete information is essential for making one's own and informed choices. And a thorough insight of \"what is going on\" enables patients to give meaning to their situation. According to patients, AM contributes also to the improvement of self-monitor - ing skills (Chapter 7). Self-monitoring skills are reported to contribute to develop a better connection with one's body and mind and a better judgment regarding one's health issues. It often leads to more responsibility and confidence in performing self-direction regarding one's health situation. Chapter five adds that according to patients' experiences staying mindfully in contact with one's body increased one's self-regulating ability and improved general wellbeing. With regard to one's inner attitude, meaning is also important. Patients argued that giving meaning could positively influence one's inner attitude toward impairments and improve integration within daily life and functioning. 161 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineAgency and transformation of healthcare Through the concept of agency the double-faced transformation of the position of patients becomes - once more - clearly visible. It is widely recognised that self-management can be an empowering tool in patients' treatment process and managing chronic diseases (Wagner et al. 2001, Coleman and Newton 2005). With regard to the rising costs of health - care the concept of self-management is also used as a policy instrument in order to reduce healthcare costs (Van de Bovenkamp 2010). This can be an effective way of addressing both health problems as well as financial sustainability of the healthcare system. However, sometimes this leads to general self-management solutions that are not or less connected with patients preferences and unique situations (Engelen 2012). For example, it is known that the levels in which patients like to contribute to their own health differ among dif - ferent patient groups (Motivaction and dePraktijkIndex 2009, RVS 2017). Engelen (2012) describes the existence of a gap between needs and habits of the modern patient and the actual leading practices within healthcare. Obviously, self-management can only be effective and successful when the person involved is fully committed and has an intrinsic motivation to be in charge of his own situation (Hibbard 2017). And this situation is al - ways personal and unique. This thesis shows that AM provides contributions to the practice of self-manage - ment to shape and colour it in line with the way patients like to be involved, with tools that are well adaptable to personal situations. Being a WMS with a spiritual worldview, from the perspective of AM patients AM provides the opportunity of promoting health through more than strictly medical resources alone. By means of its holistic theory it provides patients with a coherent framework with practical tools including, lifestyle, food, psychology, up - bringing, personal development and spirituality. And uses all appropriate resources within its worldview to contribute to patients' experiences of a better health and a healthier life. 9.5.3 Care relationship In all sub-studies the findings - both qualitative and quantitative - clearly point out the importance of the care relationship for patients in evaluating quality of care. Although the domain is very broad and consists of many sub-aspects that need further investigation, the study indicates that the quality of the patient-provider relationship contributes to an improved quality of life and/or other outcomes of care as reported by patients. Sub- aspects that emerged in this thesis are: making comfortable, balanced attitude, support, trust and confidence, communication, human approach, being at ease, being heard/seen, understanding, taken seriously, equal footing, servitude, presence of mind, non- judgmental observation, empathy, recognisable picture. As mentioned earlier in this thesis, these aspects are generally considered as process aspects and hence, within the current method of evaluating healthcare 162 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineperformance that uses a division between PREMs and PROMs, these aspects are usually part of PREMs. However, in line with the findings in this thesis, the awareness for and research on the influence of the care relationship on outcomes of care is growing (Schoot et al. 2005, Franks et al. 2006, Street et al. 2009, Benzing and Verheul 2010, Meterko et al. 2010, Jagosh et al. 2011, Rademakers et al. 2011, Rakel et al. 2011, Kelley et al. 2014, Scheffelaar et al. 2018). Moreover, in their systematic review of randomized controlled trials on the influence of the patient-provider relationship on health outcomes Kelly et al. (2014) found a small significant effect. Although small, the effect size is similar to effect sizes of other factors, for example medication use and severity of disease, that influence health outcomes (Kelley et al. 2014). Also different qualitative studies have attempted to generate more insight in aspects of the care relationship and their influence on health outcomes. Street's (2009) findings suggest that the quality of the care relationship can affect health outcomes in several ways. By supporting patients and make them feel understood it can promote emotional wellbeing. Especially, validation of the patient's perspective and the expression of empathy by the care provider may contribute to improve emotional as well as physical wellbeing. Also, non-verbal communication such as caring touch and tone of voice may directly enhance wellbeing by lessening anxiety and providing comfort. In addition, patients' trust in their provider can lead to a better continuity of care, better patient satisfaction with decisions and an increased commitment to treatment plans. The care relationship itself is enhanced when providers are optimally informative, show empathy, when patients have the opportunity to express their concerns, and when the messages they receive from different providers are consistent and care is well coordinated (Street et al. 2009). The research of Adam et al. (2019) points out the importance of 'active listening' by the provider and sufficient 'time' during consultation. Jagosch et al. (2011) investigated the aspect of listening and found that it served both process and outcomes factors of care: it enables providers to make accurate diagnoses, it contributes to a good care relationship and it acts as a healing or therapeutic agent. Also Schoot et al. (2005) and Scheffelaar et al. (2018) conducted in-depth research on aspects of the care relationship. Schoot et al. stretched the importance of recognition by the professional of patients' values. This recognition takes place within the care relationship and was optimally felt in dialogue. The study identifies patients' values and professionals' competencies related to the care relationship (Schoot et al. 2005). Scheffelaar et al. (2018) found 27 determinants of the care relationship on different levels. On the level of \"the patient\", for example, attitude and client in the lead. At the level of \"the provider\" for example focus on individual client, encouragement and take time, and at the level \"between patient and provider\" for example closeness versus professional distance and reciprocity (Scheffelaar et al. 2018). 163 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineCare ethics A research field in which the care relationship plays an important role is the field of care ethics. In this field quality of care is intrinsically connected with the care relation and the empathic abilities of the care provider. In care ethics providing care is a relational practice in which it is very important to observe the other and to act, to provide care from a connection that evolved from the observation. From a care ethical point of view, it is important that the care provider is sensitive to what lives inside the patient and takes this into account. This touches the theme of being seen and heard. Care ethics advocates to incorporate this aspect - the sensitivity of the provider - as an aspect of quality of care, within evaluating healthcare performance (Goossensen 2011, Kuis 2016). A similar principle is described by Milstein (2015). She speaks about compassioned presence and the art of finding a balance between curing and healing elements in providing good quality care (Milstein 2015). 9.5.4 A synergy between the care relationship and agency Chapter seven demonstrated that the quality of the care relation is an important precondition for self-management and patients' agency. It described that in AM the care relationship provides embeddedness for treatment and a patient-centred, collaborative approach to self-management through the practice of basic values - equivalence, servitude and presence of mind - by care providers. These values show close similarities with aspects of the care relationship that are described in the previous section and with the values that are identified in the systematic review on patient values in healthcare of Bastemeijer et al. (2017), for example partnership, responsiveness, compassion and awareness for the uniqueness the patient as a whole human being (Bastemeijer et al. 2017). Chapter five adds that an open holistic worldview in which the patient is seen and heard as a whole human being, from the perspective of patients contributes to a care relationship that is based on an equal footing. Such a care relation provides an embeddedness in which the patient can be both active and autonomous as well as being cared for (Chapter 5). This process is also described by Grimes (2008). The author found that patients who felt valued by their care provider as a result felt encouraged to become more pro-active in the treatment process. These patients coped with their illnesses more effectively and described having a sense of self or identity separate from their illness. Ultimately, this involvement in the treatment process contributed, according the patients' narratives, to a relief of symptoms and better health status outcomes (Grimes 2008). Also Maizes et al. (2009), Lee and Lin (2010), Schoot et al. (2005), Street et al. (2009) and Entwistle et al. (2012) found a great importance of the care relationship for shaping and developing patients' agency. And in Lee and Lin (2010) a greater perceived support 164 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinefor autonomy was also linked with improved health outcomes. Chapter seven describes also that in AM specific methods are used to address the complex situation of each individual patient, for example non-judgmental observation and a methodological use of empathy (Baars 2005, Freeve et al. 2009, Baars 2011, Chapter 7). Baars (2019) and Van Baalen (2017) describe that different sources of knowledge, such as clinical expertise, tacit knowledge, patient-derived knowledge, patient observations, local knowledge and contextual knowledge could be used to build a picture of the patient in his/her situation. The knowledge from the different sources has to be weighted, validated and integrated by the care professionals themselves (van Baalen et al. 2017). Not only can this picture provide directions for treatment (van Baalen et al. 2017), when shared with the patient, it also can provide patients with added information about themselves and hence contributes to their need for being well informed and to have a better insight of what is going on and what it means for them personally (Chapter 5 and 7). In this way the provided treatment options are embedded in the fact that the patient is fully seen and heard as a human being. 9.5.5 Patient-centred care, individualised care and holism The search for aspects that are appropriate to measure quality of care in AM, as carried out in this thesis, which resulted in, for example, the new CQ-Index scales for AM, the patient-derived aspects from the scoping review, the new QOL-outcomes domains and the contribution of AM care to patients' agency, has close similarities with research on aspects of patient-centred (Epstein and Street 2011) and individualized care (Franzel et al. 2013). The Institute of Medicine has defined patient centred care as \"Providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.\" (IOM 2001). The Picker institute (PickerInstitute 2019) has identified eight principles of patient-centred care, including: involvement in decision and respect for preferences; clear information, communication and support for self-care; involvement of, and support for, family and carers; and emotional support, empathy and respect. Like the practice of AM, the practice of patient-centred care starts with the application of basic human values within the care relationship, which takes the form of a partnership (Foley and Steel 2017). Patients are seen as unique human beings, persons in the context of their own social worlds, are listened to, informed, respected and involved in their care process (Epstein and Street 2011). And similar to demands from the field of AM, also patient-centred care is in need of appropriate measures to evaluate its performance (Epstein and Street 2011). Moreover, AM, IM and T&CM have a long history in practicing healthcare based on the current principles of patient-centred care (Maizes et al. 2009, Kienle 2013, Van Vliet 165 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine2017). This experience with the practice of patient-centred care is slowly getting more attention and researchers have started to develop appropriate evaluation measures (Mulkins et al. 2003, Verhoef et al. 2006, Greene Prabhu et al. 2009, Ritenbaugh et al. 2011, Foley and Steel 2017). These studies, including the findings of this thesis, show also large similarities to the findings in research on non-specific aspects and contextual factors of care (Street et al. 2009, Entwistle et al. 2012, Greco et al. 2016). The attention for the influence of these aspects on outcomes of care is the central subject in a growing body of research (Kelley et al. 2014). In addition, Greco et al. (2016) has put an effort to transform understanding about these factors into the development of actual patient-reported measures, which are developed with inclusion of patients' perspectives and using the instrument development of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS@) (Greco et al. 2016). Greco identified six domains of non-specific factors: 1) Patient provider connection; 2) Healthcare environment; 3) Treatment expectancy; 4) Positive outlook; 5) Spirituality; and 6) Attitudes toward T&CM (Greco et al. 2016: CAM). This finding implicates that T&CM are not only important to patients, but also could make a valid independent domain in evaluating healthcare performance. The similarities described above demonstrate that research on and practice of AM and other forms of IM have potential to contribute to a further development and enhancing of patient-centred care and the insight in non-specific aspects of care and their influences on patient-relevant outcomes. Further reflecting on the finding in these studies, it seems that all of them reveal patients' wish, need and demand for a more holistic form of care: a form of care that focuses on the whole person and integrates knowledge from different point views. The overlap between patient-centred care and holism is identified in qualitative research of Franzel et al. (2013) as well as in the systematic review of Foley and Steel (2017). This review showed that characteristics of both concepts were conceptually synonymous and both were mentioned in the context of individualized medicine (Foley and Steel 2017). Also, from patients' point of view holism is an important contribution in the practice of individualised whole-person medicine (Franzel et al. 2013, Milstein 2015, Foley and Steel 2017). The paradigm of holism indicates once more that to patients, health is a very broad concept and many aspects contribute to people's health. This view on health has also recently been established in the concept of Positive Health and the newly proposed definition of health as \"the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social, physical and emotional challenges' (Huber et al. 2011, 2013). Since several researchers have pointed out the importance of patient-centred, individualised and holistic care for all investigated patient groups, among which are general conventional medicine patients (Adam et al. 2019), hospital inpatients (Montross- Thomas et al. 2017), long-term care patients (Scheffelaar et al. 2018) and patient groups 166 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinebased on various impairments or illnesses (De Boer et al. 2013), it can be stated that patient-centred care is relevant for almost all patients. Therefore, the similarities between patient-centred, individualised, and holistic care and AM on the one side, and the empirical results on the high prevalence of the values Universalism and Self-direction among the AM population as well as the general Dutch population on the other side, indicate that AM and probably other forms of IM care as well, may be relevant for a much larger patient group than its current users, and maybe even for all patients. 9.6 How do AM patients evaluate their care? - How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do AM patients eval - uate their received care? 9.6.1 Patient-reported quality of AM care In general, the patient-reported quality of AM is good and patients value the way in which AM care is shaped, tailored and delivered (Chapter 2, 3, 4). Chapter two reports the evalu - ation of parent-reported experiences and outcomes with a children's integrative healthcare centre, the Kindertherapeuticum . The study showed that parent-reported quality of care was very good. Most parents reported an improved health status of their child and a decrease in use of medication. Part of the service evaluation of the children's healthcare centre was focused on particular AM care. The AM care is anchored in the mission and aims of the centre. These are an integration of conventional and anthroposophic approach; working in a multi-disciplinary way; focus on the child as a unique human being by methodologically creating a picture of the child that provides a therapeutic direction; and a good internal organisation. Regarding specific AM aspects of care most parents reported positive expe - riences (63-84%). Only the referral back to primary care needed improvement (43%). Hav - ing a chief focus on the bigger picture of the child and the provision tools for the parents' agency and to cope with the situation of their child, are measured aspects that could be very well placed within the values Universalism and Self-direction. Chapter three and four measured patient-reported experiences with AM GP prac - tices, using the newly validated CQ-Index AH. Chapter three reported the results of the new AM scales and chapter four reports the results of the original GP scales. The quality of AM GP practices is good and general rating is 8.4 (sd=1.2) on a scale from 0-10. Regarding recommendation AM scored 3.54 points, on a scale from 1 ( unlikely ) to 4 ( very likely ). Re - garding the mean scores on the different sub-scales AM GP practices scored as followed (scale from 1 ( never ) to 4 ( always )): Accessibility: 3.42; Assistant: 3.72; treatment GP: 167 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine3.83; Communication GP: 3.77 and Tailored care: 3.50; meaning that the measured quality aspects were on average usually to always present in the delivery of GP care. The newly added scales scored as followed: Anthroposophic Treatment: 3.10; and Interactional Style GP: 3.60; meaning that, like the quality measured by the original items, the quality of the specific anthroposophic care aspects is also good. In addition, chapter four reports about a comparison study between AM and conventional (CM) GP care, using the CQ-Index data of 11695 records (AM: 2063 and CM: 9632). AM GP practices care score on average 0.25 points higher on general rating than CM GP practices. Also after correcting for age and gender this small though significant difference stands. However, when correcting in addition for aspects of care general rating of CM GP practices is slightly higher. The study investigates how this difference can be explained. It considers three possible explanations: firstly, it could be explained by charac - teristic in the patient population, secondly it could be explained by differences in quality of care and, thirdly, it could be an interaction of both. The study concludes that Age, Dimin - ishing health problems and specific aspects of care - GP Communication, GP Conduct and Practice Assistant are most important for Experience rating and Recommendation. The evaluation of the quality of AM does not depend on whether people choose deliberately for AM or not. In addition to the stated relevance of patient-centred care for many more patient groups (De Boer et al. 2013, Montross-Thomas et al. 2017, Scheffelaar et al. 2018, Adam et al. 2019) this confirms once more AM's fundamental idea that its contribution to medicine is not only for a particular group of patients, but could benefit a larger group of patients. Looking closer at particular aspects of care, chapter four demonstrated that besides the professional conduct and the communication of the GP, also the work of the assistant in the GP practices plays a significant role in explaining the high rating of AM GP practices. The relatively high importance of the assistant regarding patients' experiences is, however, relatively unknown. A study that does reveal this topic is the work of Grimes (2008). The author describes that in IM settings the attitude of the staff had a positive impact on patients' experiences. Patients reported to feel safer and to be more relaxed and comfortable compared to other medical settings. Also front desk clerks who remembered patients' names made people feel comfortable, eased anxiety and made patients feel ap - preciated (Grimes 2008). Notably, Grimes (2008) demonstrates that the role of the assis - tant is perceived as part of the healing environment that contributes to patients' comfort, wellbeing, and feelings of recognition within the healthcare setting. 9.6.2 Shortcomings in the field of IM The scoping review revealed that the field of IM lacks consensus about a standardised 168 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineway of measuring patient-reported quality of care. In total, 63 evaluation studies were included. Of these studies, 44 studies used quantitative methods and 33 used qualitative methods, and 14 studies had mixed methods. The quantitative studies used a wide vari - ety of measurement instruments, including some well-known validated instruments and many instruments of which validity was not mentioned or unknown. The degree of patient involvement in developing appropriate measures for evaluating patient-reported quality of care was quite low. In all quantitative studies patients were only respondents in the survey and were not involved in constructing the measures or decisions on which instrument(s) to use. This shortcoming correlates with finding in conventional medicine (Wiering et al. 2016). With regard to IM this shortcoming may be particularly undesirable because one of IM's leading principles is patient-centredness. Notably, most studies were conducted in integrative and academic centres in the USA. This result could be related to the progressive development of IM in integrative and academic centres in the USA (Van Vliet 2017). In addition, it might be linked to a sig - nificant difference in the prevalence of a holistic worldview between The Netherlands and the USA. Findings of De Witt demonstrated that the measured worldviews differed greatly between the USA and the Netherlands and the integrative worldview was much more prev - alent within the USA (De Witt et al. 2016). However, also within the field of IM in the USA there was not much consensus on measuring patient-reported quality of care. Hopefully, the finding off this thesis will encourage the field of IM towards achieving more consensus and concrete patient-derived measures. Conclusion of the main findings 9.7 Summary and conclusion Here, a brief summary of the findings in the previous section and conclusion on the three main research questions is given. With regard to research question one - What are characteristics of AM users, in terms of demography, health behaviour and human values? - the findings in this thesis suggest that AM is often used by a group of patients containing more women, relatively older people and people with higher education levels and a healthier lifestyle than the general Dutch population. Many users choose deliberately for AM, because they consider AM to have added value in comparison with conventional care. It seems that for patients the 169 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineperceived added value of AM is rooted within the AM worldview. AM worldview views the human being as a spiritual being that encompasses three organisational levels: a spirit, a soul and a living physical body. With regard to healthcare it integrates knowledge and methods from conventional medicine with anthroposophy, and it practices an integration of a 'fighting disease' approach and a 'health promotion' approach. The results of this thesis demonstrate that among AM users the human value-orientations Universalism and Self-direction are more prevalent than other human value-orientations, and than in the general Dutch population. With regard to research question two - What specific aspects of AM care are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view? - the findings of this study demonstrates that to be able to evaluate patient-reported quality in AM, a broader set of evaluation aspects is needed in comparison with current instruments and methods that are used to evaluate conventional medicine and healthcare. The study also revealed that from AM patients' perspectives a clear division between process factors and outcomes of care is not important. Existing QOL/PRO domains of which their importance for AM patients is confirmed in this study are: - Recovery/ symptom reduction - Functioning - Energy/strength/vitality - General well-being - Social relations New QOL/PRO-domains that are the result of this study are: - Agency - Meaning - Rest/relaxation - Mindful inner attitude - Care relationship - Natural healing - Being well informed Two of these aspects - agency and care relationship - played a role in all sub-studies. Regarding agency, this study shows that AM provides contributions to the practice of self-management in line with how patients like to be involved and with tools that are well adaptable to personal situations. Regarding care relationship, this study indicates that the quality of the pa - tient-provider relationship contributes to an improved quality of life or other outcomes of care as reported by patients. In addition, the study describes that in AM the care rela -170 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinetionship provides embeddedness for treatment that enables the patient to become more autonomous and to exercise more self-management. The search for aspects that are appropriate to measure quality of care in AM, has close similarities with research on aspects of patient-centred and individualized whole-per - son care as well as with research on non-specific aspects and contextual factors of care. With regard to research question three - How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do patients evaluate their received care? - this study shows that in general, the patient-reported quality of AM is good and patients value the way in which AM care is shaped, tailored and delivered. This goes for adults as well as children. Also, the positive evaluation of AM care is not biased by the fact that many people choose deliberately for AM. With regard to evaluating care in the wider field of IM, the scoping review re - vealed that this field lacks a consensus about a standardised way of measuring patient-re - ported quality of care. Also the degree of patient involvement in developing appropriate measures for evaluating patient-reported quality of care has been quite low. Implications for science and practice 9.8 Implications for AM, IM and conventional medicine In general, the findings of this thesis will make a contribution to a further development of a sound scientific foundation of AM as well as of the wider field of IM. The performed measurements of patient-reported quality of care in AM demonstrate that from patients' perspective this type of care is good quality care. The developed measurement instrument CQ-Index AH is able to continue to serve the purpose of evaluating patient experiences with AM and to provide concrete feedback to improve its services. In addition, it might also be usable for other integrative GP care. The identified aspects of AM show AM's specific characteristics and provide more insight in its perceived added value from patients' perspective. They reveal which aspects and their interaction are relevant for AM patients and this will be helpful in devel - oping robust methods to measure patient-reported quality of AM in an integrative way. As such, this thesis also contributes to the internationally developing specific body of knowl - edge that is dedicated to the perspectives of patients in AM care. The positive results on the patient-reported quality of AM GP practices and the Kindertherapeuticum provide a reliable basis and starting point to maintain and further develop the quality of AM care. The fact that AM GP care is at least just as good as con - 171 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineventional GP care from a patient experience perspective, is important with regard to the scientific foundation of AM and underlines the potential for further development of AM and IM in the future. However, the lack of consensus about a standardised way of measuring pa - tient-reported quality in IM, and the low degree of patient involvement in developing these measures, might be a threat to the so needed transparent communication about quality of care from patients' perspective. The research and work that has been carried out in AM could be helpful to develop and implement measuring patient-reported quality of care in other forms of IM in a coordinated way. Further development of patient-reported quality of care measures should be based on the full spectrum of domains that were identified in this study. In order to de - velop proper measures, these domains first need to be prioritised. Secondly, it would be worthwhile to reconsider the way in which measures are divided in process and outcome measure. In paragraph 9.9 a suggestion is presented for a more integrative way of measur - ing patient-reported quality of care. Thirdly, to serve a further development of measuring patient-reported quality of care in IM it would be valuable to connect the aspects that are important to patients with the aspects that make up the definition of IM in a coherent way. Also without having to measure, the findings in this thesis suggest aspects that are important to patients, and implementation of which in daily practice and patient care could be further improved and developed. More awareness for these aspects is likely to support the integration of T&CM and conventional medicine from patients' perspective. Two important ones, which have been described in the previous section, are patients' agency and the relationship between patient and provider. This study shows that AM offers contributions to the practice of self-manage - ment in a way that fits AM patients' values, preferences and situations. This approach might inspire other forms of IM, and maybe also conventional care. It is worthwhile to critically monitor this approach and collect information about its effect on outcomes of care, to serve further development of practical bottom-up self-management. The findings on patient characteristics suggest that AM care is often used by a specific group of patients that chooses deliberately for AM because, based on AM world - view, this type of care fits their patient values. The comparison of human value-orientations between AM users and the general Dutch population suggest that also within the general population a group of people exists with similar values as AM users. This implies that AM care has potential to meet health - care preferences and patient values of a larger group of people. The existence of a larger group of people that are potentially interested in AM and IM could be cutting both ways. On the one hand, AM and other forms of IM have potential to offer care that might be beneficial for this group of patients and might fulfill unmet patient needs, and on the oth -172 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineer hand, the existence of this larger group will contribute to the need for, and could serve the legitimacy of a broader implementation of AM and the further development of IM in general. The aspect of worldview and patients' values will hopefully contribute to more awareness of underlying worldviews and AM's philosophy in relation to patients' values and preferences. This thesis demonstrates the importance of taking a holistic view in evaluating healthcare performance from patient perspectives in general. More awareness and recog - nition of different viewpoints will hopefully contribute to a further integration of patient relevant aspects within the delivery of healthcare and subsequently the further develop - ment and practice of IM. Also on other levels the findings in this study have potential to contribute to the further development of IM. Various findings are meaningful with regard to the aspects that make up IM's definition. For example, firstly, measuring patient-reported quality of care will contribute to IM's scientific underpinnings and hence increases its possibilities to be informed by evidence. Secondly, the suggestion that the care relationship provides embeddedness for treatment that enables the patient to become more autonomous and to exercise more self-management might be relevant with regard to reaffirming the impor - tance of the patient-provider relationship. And thirdly, the growing body of knowledge on patient-centred and whole person care underlines the legitimacy and fortifies the evidence of this approach in IM. This thesis has also a potential to contribute to further development of measur - ing patient-centred care and non-specific treatment factors. It reveals that patients' values of patient-centred care are very much in line with a holistic view on health and illness, and subsequently with an integrative worldview. This implies that the findings of this thesis are probably relevant for more patients than the current patient populations of AM. Es - pecially AM, which has its roots in the natural sciences, is embedded in the development of western philosophy, and has a well-organised international network of researchers and practitioners, might have a potential to develop a successful connection with other IM and conventional medicine patients who share a need for genuine patient-centred care. Finally, measuring patient-reported quality in AM and other fields of IM will pro - vide more valid information that is needed to enable patients to make informed decisions on the use of IM. Subsequently, this thesis contributes to the IM knowledge infrastructure that is currently in development in the Netherlands to serve the integration of safe and effective T&CM within Dutch healthcare. 173 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine9.9 Towards an integrative method of measuring patient- reported quality of care As stressed in the discussion of the finding of the thesis, the practice of AM fits well within the increasing awareness and knowledge of the importance of patient-centred care and interpersonal and non-specific factors that may contribute to the quality of care. However, regardless of the chosen point of departure, there is a gap between the available knowl - edge and the application of this knowledge by using appropriate measures and developing an adequate framework to evaluate patient-reported quality of care (Street et al. 2009, Epstein and Street 2011, Entwistle et al. 2012, Dowdy et al. 2013, Greco et al. 2016, Schef - felaar et al. 2018, Chapter 6). Hence, from the paradigm of patient-centred care and holism in healthcare, one that is strongly in line with patients' values, there is a demand and necessity for adequate patient-reported quality of care measures. Based on the findings of this thesis measuring patient-reported quality of care in AM should incorporate the following prior conditions: - The measuring framework should address aspects that are relevant for patients; this includes taking into account patients values and worldview (that is not necessarily the same as the worldview that still dominates academic medical culture). - The measuring framework should integrate both process and outcomes measures. Since to patients a division between the two seems not always to be relevant. - The measuring framework should address the integrative principle of IM and the aspects that make up its definition. - The measuring framework should incorporate the current knowledge on aspects of patient-centred care and non-specific treatment factors. Based on the findings within this thesis and taking these prior conditions into account this thesis proposes an integrative framework for measuring patient-reported quality of care is: the patient-provider engagement model. The framework uses two complementing aspects of treatment and healing as a base for integrating patient-relevant measures. These aspects have repeatedly emerged within this thesis and can be identified as the interventional and the relational aspect. From the provider perspective Milstein (2015) and Entwistle et al. (2012) have identified these aspects as doing to and being with [the patient]. From the per - spective of patients these aspects can be formulated as being cared for and agency. The patient-provider engagement model integrates these two aspects each from both the patient and the provider perspective. This leads to a matrix with four fields corre - sponding with four different interaction processes that contribute to health and treatment (see figure 9.1). 174 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine In field one both patient and provider are focused on their relationship. In field two the provider performs the intervention while the patient is receiving the intervention. In field three the provider takes on a relational attitude that enables the patient to exer - cise and develop agency, and in field four both patient and provider are actively working together regarding the treatment intervention. The aspects, items and domains that are identified and have emerged in this thesis can be placed into this frame, according to their content. Patient Being cared for Agency Care provider Being with 1. Both patient and provider are focused on the relationship 3. The provider takes on a relational attitude that enables the patient to develop and exercise agency Doing to 2. The provider performs the intervention while the patient is receiving the intervention. 4. Both patient and provider are actively working together on the treatment intervention and/or towards improved health of the patient. Figure 9.1 Patient-provider engagement model This patient-provider engagement takes place within a certain context. The first level of this context is the healing environment of the healthcare setting, the physical and social surrounding of the practice: for example, the building, the interior, the atmosphere, facilities and staff, but also the family. The second level of the context is shaped by world - view, defined in this thesis as the fundamental lenses through which humans interpret and co-create reality. As such, they might influence the way patient and provider interact with each other as well as have an effect on treatment options. Adding the context of healing environments and worldviews on the one hand and aspects of care on the other hand, provides the model in figure 9.2. 175 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine 42Patient-provider engagement arena: Embeddedness Interventional: Doing toWorldview Healing environment Interventional: Agency The provider takes on a relational attitude that enables the patient to develop and exercise agency Facilitating autonomy/active contribution; Stimulating mindful inner attitude/ self- re/f_lection; Attention for social relationships ...

An important strength of this study is that it brings together different fields of research. Firstly, it forms a bridge between the world of IM and the world of mea - suring patient-reported quality of care and health services research. This bridge works both ways. On the one side it integrates measuring patient-reported quality of care with the practice of IM. This is an important widening of the research focus compared to all the necessary clinical research, which has been dominating research in IM in the last decades since studying clinical effectiveness was primary focus. This thesis adds to this arena the perspectives of patients and patient-reported quality of care. In the practice of IM the per - spective of the patient is most important, since patient-centred care is one of the leading principles of IM. This thesis adds that patient perspective to IM's body of knowledge, and hence empowers that patient perspective on a scientific level. On the other side of that same bridge, this thesis integrates new insights from research within IM with existing knowledge on measuring patient-reported quality of care in conventional medicine. It proposes an integrative framework for measuring patient-reported quality of care that can be used in IM settings as well as conventional medicine setting. Therefore, this thesis is not only relevant for enhancing quality of care in IM, but also in conventional medicine. Ideally, the framework can be used as that bridge, and facilitate the integration of different healthcare approaches. Secondly, this study incorporates both quantitative and qualitative research. This enabled us to study patient-reported quality of care from patients' perspective with a focus on qualitatively investigating aspects that are important to patients, as well as to address patient-reported quality of care for a large patient group and to make a compari - son between different patient groups. 9.11 Limitations The main limitation of this study is the absence of a master plan in advance. This means that, for example, the scoping review, instead of logically being performed in the beginning of the study, was conducted in a later phase. However, in the current situation, more re - cent studies could be included. 177 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineThe fact that most studies in this thesis covered two worlds, namely the one of IM and the one of measuring patient-reported quality of care, was also a limitation in finding appropriate journals to publish the articles, because generally, a single journal covered only one world, leaving the other world behind in review. Parts of this thesis have a scoping character. This has provided an overview of themes and aspects that are important to patients and/or have potential to further devel - op healthcare according to patients' values. Although the research has been conducted very thoroughly, due to the time frame and resources of the current thesis, parts of this thesis, for example chapter six, still lack a systematic character, which should be addressed in future research. Another limitation is the current focus on AM to address also the wider spectrum of IM. Although we do state that AM is theoretically, methodologically and practically a legitimate field to study also IM, IM is much wider than AM alone. This also goes for the empirical data of patient groups. In the current study empirical data on patient charac - teristics and values is only available for AM users. Although literature exists on patient characteristic in IM, future research should further and more systematically investigate whether other IM users or groups of IM users have similar, other or changing patient char - acteristics and patient values than AM users. The ESS questionnaire and database could be valuable resources on these topics. Due to the time frame and resources of this thesis we could only use a small part of the ESS. Future research Based on the science and practice implication and the limitations of the thesis, future research should focus on the following: - Bringing together the scientific fields of IM on the one side and patient reported quality on the other side. - Systematically developing patient relevant aspects and patient values in actual concrete measures (items and domains) and tools that meet patients' preferences and needs. The very next step is to prioritise the QOL/QOC outcome domains that have been identified this thesis. - Systematically broadening the investigation of patient relevant aspects in other forms of IM and making a coherent connection between patient-relevant aspects and the aspects that make up IM's definition. - Increasing the involvement of patients in identifying quality of care aspects and establishing concrete outcome measures. 178 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine- Enhancing systematic research on the relation between patient-centred care, the patient-provider relationship and non-specific treatment aspects on the one hand and outcomes of care on the other hand. - Broadening and deepening the investigation on worldviews and human values, and their relation with patient characteristics, patient values, preferences and priorities both wit in AM and within a wider group of IM users; in the Netherlands as well as internationally. And using the full potential of the ESS questionnaire and database to address these topics. - An finally, to carry on and enhancing evaluating patient-reported quality of care in AM and other forms of IM, in a coordinated way, as well as in comparison with conventional care, to keep building on AM/IM's scientific foundation and to provide patients with valid information to make informed decisions. 179 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine References 180 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineReferences Aaronson, N.

For prioritising the QOL/QOC domains (Koster et al. 2016) the method of the CQ-Index importance scores (Koopman et al. 2011) was used. The importance scores were measured as part of the data collection of chapter eight and were collected for two reasons. Firstly, to make a first prior - itisation of these patient relevant QOL/QOC domains. Secondly, to investigate a possible relation between human values and patient relevant aspects of quality of care. However, the significant correlations between the human value-orientations and the importance scores were quite low: range (0.07 - 0.14) and the importance scores were only available for AM users. For a valid analysis the importance scores on the QOL/QOC domains should also be measured within the general population. Due to limited resourc - es and time this was not feasible in the current study. Because the measured importance scores as such could, however, be valuable for future research, they are made publicly available in this appendix. As mentioned, measuring importance scores is part of the method of the CQ-In - dex (Koopman et al. 2011). The method contains the following phrase and answer catego - ries: \" How important would you consider... \"; answer categories: 1) Not important , 2) Quite important, 3) Important, 4) Very important (Koopman et al. 2011). The importance score is simply the average on the scale of one to four. The domains were reformulated into single items and put in the usable concrete context of general practice care. Because reasons for consulting a GP are very diverse, the items were formulated as generally as possible, using following overall question: \"If you had to choose a new GP, how important would you consider the following aspects?\". After initial formulation the questions were put to a cognitive test among pa - tients of two AM GP practices. During two days in total, all patients arriving in the waiting room of the GP practice were asked to comment. (Net response: N=27). Based on the comments the items were reformulated. The final questions are formulated in table 8.6. The importance scores are reported in the table 8.7.207 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Table 8.6 QOL/QOC domains and items* Domain QOL (Koster 2016, Chapter 5) General Practitioner (GP) - Item How important would you consider that...

In the past two decades, concepts and policies were designed to strengthen the position of patients, to measure outcomes that matter to patients (ICHOM 2019), and to enable patients to perform their role in shared decision-making, self-management, and patient-centred care (Mead and Bower 2000, Wagner et al. 2001, Coleman and Newton 2005, Van de Bovenkamp 2010, Van der Weijden et al. 2011, Rademaker et al. 2012, Victoor 2015, Smit and De Knecht 2018). Mirroring these policies, bottom-up movements show that many patients wish to be taken seriously and have strong motivations to be involved and to perform an active and competent role in their treatment process (Bopp et al. 2005, Engelen 2012, Franzel et al. 2013, Miletus 2016). Associated with this transformation of the role and position of patients is the increasing number of people that makes a deliberate choice for using Traditional & Com - plementary Medicine (T&CM), in addition to conventional biomedical-based medicine. The group of patients that uses T&CM has gradually grown over the past two decades (Maizes et al. 2009, Templeman and Robinson 2011, Jong et al. 2012) and patients have many different reasons and motivations for using T&CM (Vlieger et al. 2006, Wapf and Busato 2007, Dulmen et al. 2010, L\u00e4engler et al. 2010, Jong et al. 2012). From the perspec - tive of patients a strong wish, need and motivation exists for integration of T&CM with conventional medicine (Frenkel et al. 2008, Jong et al. 2012) and subsequently for a further development of Integrative Medicine (IM). The transformation of the position of patients combined with the introduction of regulated markets and the growing importance of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has resulted in a call for transparency about quality of care (Delnoij et al. 2010, Krol 2015, Vic - toor 2015) and subsequently the development of indicators about quality of care (Delnoij et al. 2002, Delnoij et al. 2010, Van den Berg et al. 2014). The influence of EBM has also demanded and stimulated research regarding the effectiveness of interventions. In the field of T&CM and IM this has lead to a focus on clinical research, resulting in many mer - its in developing good quality evidence of IM (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2011, Herman et al. 2012, Baars and Kooreman 2014, Hamre et al. 2014, Kligler et al. 2016, Baars et al. 2018). Now, to broaden the scope of IM's research field and to connect with other developments related to the delivery of healthcare and health services research (Cleary and Edgman 1997, Sixma et al. 1998, Delnoij 2009) measuring patient-reported quality of care would be a legitimate next step (Adams and Robinson 2013, Nissen et al. 2013, Fischer et al. 2014). 211 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Measuring patient-reported quality of care in IM/AM is important for several reasons. Firstly, it will make the actual quality of IM from patients' perspective more vis - ible, and will provide concrete feedback to improve its services. Secondly, from patients' perspective, IM has added value compared with conventional medicine and this value could be relevant for a large patient group (Frenkel et al. 2008, Jong et al. 2012, Foley and Steel 2017, Greene et al. 2009, Franzel et al. 2013). Thirdly, in line with the WHO's recom - mendation for a worldwide integration of T&CM with conventional medicine (WHO 2013), The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) has for - mulated recently an advice to create a knowledge infrastructure that would contribute to the integration of safe and effective T&CM within Dutch healthcare (ZonMw 2015). Further developing health services research and measuring patient-reported quality of care will contribute to this knowledge infrastructure and provides more valid information that is needed to enable patients to make informed decision on the use of IM. Anthroposophic Medicine Being a classical example of IM, the focus of this thesis will be on anthroposophic med - icine (AM). AM has originated in Europe and was founded in the 1920s by the scientist Rudolf Steiner and the medical doctor Ita Wegman. AM combines all knowledge from biomedical medicine with a holistic view on illness and health (Kienle et al. 2013, Baars et al. 2018). It provides specific therapies, including medicinal products and non-medication therapies, and encompasses multiple sectors, such as general practice, psychiatry, special needs care, clinical specialists and hospital care. It also contains various therapeutic dis - ciplines like physiotherapy, art therapy, music therapy, speech therapy, eurhythmy therapy, psychotherapy and counselling, dietetics, and nursing. Important features of AM are its health promotion-oriented strategies, its patient-centred, individualised approach, its di - agnostic procedures, its complex interventions and its focus on self-management and the patient-provider relationship (Baars 2011, Kienle et al. 2013). The choice for AM in this thesis is based on both scientific and practical reasons as well as reasons regarding the content of AM. Scientifically, AM is very well defined and described in literature as an extension of conventional medicine, and is based on an in - creasingly sound scientific fundament (Kienle et al. 2011, Heusser 2016, Baars et al. 2018). The fact that AM is embedded in western science and philosophy makes it a logic field to start studying the integration of T&CM with biomedical medicine from patients' per - spective. Especially, because based on its worldview and philosophy, AM emphasises the position and the active role of the patient within his/her own treatment (Kienle et al. 2006, 212 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineMedizinische Sektion 2018). For AM it is important that its specific features are described, compared to conventional medicine, and that its added value from patients' perspectives is scientifically tested. By focusing on AM this thesis will contribute to addressing this need. Main research questions and research structure This thesis is the result of a thorough search on how to measure patient-reported quality of care in IM/AM in a way that it addresses aspects of IM/AM care that are relevant to patients. It will address the following main questions: 1. What are characteristics of AM users, in terms of demography, health behaviour and human values? (In short: Who are AM patients?) 2. What specific aspects of AM care are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view? (In short: What do AM patients find important?) 3. How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do AM patients evaluate their received care? (In short: How do AM patients evaluate their care?) This thesis encompasses seven studies and uses both quantitative and qualitative meth - ods. It is structured in two ways. The first way is a chronological narrative of the develop - ment of this thesis. The second way is a conceptual framework based on the three main re - search questions. Table 1.1 shows how each sub-study fits within the conceptual structure of this thesis and table 9.1 provides an overview of the main findings in this thesis. Chapter two reported the results of an evaluation survey among parents and their children who visited the Kindertherapeuticum in Zeist, an integrative healthcare centre for children. Chapter three and four reported the construction and validation of, and mea - suring with the CQ-Index Anthroposophic Healthcare. Chapter five reported a triangula - tion study, using within-method triangulation of four data sources. It identified twelve out - come domains that are relevant to AM patients, of which seven were new compared to the domains that exist in currently often used PROMs and QOL measurement instruments. Chapter six reported a scoping review on how patient-reported quality of care is measured in AM/IM. It revealed the use of a wide variety of instruments to measure patient-reported quality in IM. In addition it showed a range of categories that were evaluated with qualita - tive methods, were patient derived, and identified as relevant for AM/IM patients. Chapter seven investigated - both conceptually within the literature and empirically among pa - 213 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinetients - AM's contribution to the practice of self-management. It provided a description of AM worldview as a spiritual worldview and an investigation of (other) patient-relevant aspects of AM that contribute to the practice of self-management. Chapter eight reports of a survey that aimed to identify patient characteristics, human value-orientations and health behaviour aspects within the AM population in comparison to the general Dutch population. Main findings and discussion With regard to research question one - What are characteristics of AM users, in terms of demography, health behaviour and human values? - the findings in this thesis suggest that AM is often used by a group of patients containing more women, relatively older people and people with higher education levels and a healthier lifestyle than the general Dutch population. Many users choose deliberately for AM, because they consider AM to have added value in comparison with conventional care. It seems that for patients the perceived added value of AM is rooted within the AM worldview. AM worldview integrates both spiritual and scientific realities (Baars en Hamre 2017) and has much in common with an integrative or holistic worldview (Koster 2007, Van Egmond 2010, Van Egmond and De Vries 2011, De Witt et al. 2016). With regard to healthcare it integrates knowledge and methods from conventional medicine with anthroposophy, and it practices an integration of a 'fighting disease' approach and a 'health promotion' approach. The combination of a scientific and spiritual view on health and illness seems to be in line with many patients' own point of view, their values and preferences. The results of this thesis demonstrate that among AM users the human value-orientations Universalism and Self-direction are more prevalent than other human value-orientations, and than in the general Dutch population. With regard to research question two - What specific aspects of AM care are relevant and necessary to measure from patients' point of view? - the findings of this study demon - strate that to be able to evaluate patient-reported quality in AM, a broader set of evaluation aspects is needed in comparison with current instruments and methods that are used to evaluate conventional medicine and healthcare. The construction and validation of the CQ-index AH has generated two addition - al scales - Anthroposophic Treatment and Interactional Style GP - representing a chief part of the added value of AM care. The scales distinguish themselves also by two main aspects of care: one scale addresses relational aspects of care and the other one addresses interventional aspects of care. Also in the results of the scoping review these two aspects 214 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicineare reflected. The triangulation study revealed outcome domains that are relevant for AM pa - tients. Existing QOL/PRO domains of which their importance for AM patients is confirmed in this study are: - Recovery/ symptom reduction - Functioning - Energy/strength/vitality - General well-being - Social relations New QOL/PRO-domains that are the result of this study are: - Agency - Meaning - Rest/relaxation - Mindful inner attitude - Care relationship - Natural healing- Being well informed The outcome domains identified in the triangulation study showed close similarities with the aspects that emerged in the scoping review as well as with items and domains from the other sub-studies. Also, all patient-derived outcome aspects fit well within the holistic worldview of AM. Although mentioned as new QOL/PRO domains, several domains are not new in the current debate on the delivery of healthcare or in evaluating healthcare performance as a whole. However, what is new is that chapter five demonstrates that AM patients regard these domains as also contributing to their quality of life as outcome of care. In other words, from AM patients' perspectives a clear division between process factors and out - comes of care is not important. All factors can make a potential important contribution to a better, healthier life. However, the integrative character of these aspects is hardly ad - dressed in existing evaluation methods and measurement instruments that are used to measure patient-reported quality of care (Epstein and Street 2011, Greco et al. 2016). Two of these aspects - patients' self-management or agency (Gregory 1981, Street et al. 2009, Dyck and Kearns 2014, Berger and Heusser 2017) and care relationship - played a role in all sub-studies. Regarding agency, this study shows that AM provides con - tributions to the practice of self-management in line with how patients like to be involved and with tools that are well adaptable to personal situations. Moreover, it is highly inter - connected with other aspects of care and it functions as a vehicle generating a string of other health and treatment outcomes. 215 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine It is widely recognised that self-management can be an empowering tool in patients' treatment process and managing chronic diseases (Wagner et al. 2001, Cole - man and Newton 2005). Obviously, self-management can only be effective and success - ful when the person involved is fully committed and has an intrinsic motivation to be in charge of his own situation (Hibbard 2017). This thesis shows that AM provides contri - butions to the practice of self-management to shape and colour it in line with the way patients like to be involved, with tools that are well adaptable to personal situations. By means of its holistic theory it provides patients with a coherent framework with practical tools including, lifestyle, food, psychology, upbringing, personal development and spiri - tuality. It uses all appropriate resources within its worldview to contribute to patients' experiences of a better health and a healthier life. In all sub-studies the findings point out the importance of the care relationship for patients in evaluating quality of care. This thesis indicates that the quality of the pa - tient-provider relationship contributes to an improved quality of life and/or other out - comes of care as reported by patients. As mentioned earlier, these aspects are generally considered as process aspects of care. However, in line with the findings in this thesis, the awareness for and research on the influence of the care relationship on outcomes of care is growing (Schoot et al. 2005, Franks et al. 2006, Street et al. 2009, Benzing and Verheul 2010, Meterko et al. 2010, Jagosh et al. 2011, Rademaker et al. 2011, Rakel et al. 2011, Goossensen 2011, Kelley et al. 2014, Milstein 2015, Kuis 2016, Scheffelaar et al. 2018). The findings also demonstrated that from patients' point of view the quality of the care relation is an important precondition for self-management and patients' agency. An open holistic worldview in which the patient is seen and heard as a whole human being contributes according to patients to a care relationship that is based on an equal footing. Such a care relation provides an embeddedness in which the patient can be both active and autonomous as well as being cared for. This thesis describes also that in AM specific methods are used to address the complex situation of each individual patient. The search for aspects that are appropriate to measure quality of care in AM, as carried out in this thesis, has close similarities with research on aspects of patient-cen - tred (Epstein and Street 2011) and individualized care (Franzel et al. 2013). Like the prac - tice of AM, the practice of patient-centred care starts with the application of basic human values within the care relationship, which takes the form of a partnership (Foley and Steel 2017). Moreover, AM, IM and T&CM have a long history in practicing healthcare based on the current principles of patient-centred care (Maizes et al. 2009, Kienle et al. 2013, Van Vliet 2017). This experience with the practice of patient-centred care is slowly getting more attention and researchers have started to develop appropriate evaluation measures (Mulkins et al. 2003, Verhoef et al. 2006, Greene Prabhu et al. 2009, Riten -216 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinebaugh et al. 2011, Foley and Steel 2017). These studies, including the findings of this the - sis, show also large similarities to the findings in research on non-specific aspects and contextual factors of care (Street et al. 2009, Entwistle et al. 2012, Greco et al. 2016). The similarities described above demonstrate that research on and practice of AM and other forms of IM have potential to contribute to a further development and en - hancing of patient-centred care and the insight in non-specific aspects of care and their influences on patient-relevant outcomes. Further reflecting on the finding in these studies, it seems that all of them reveal patients' wish, need and demand for a more holistic form of care: a form of care that focuses on the whole person and integrates knowledge from different point views. Since several researchers have pointed out the importance of pa - tient-centred, individualised and holistic care for all investigated patient groups (Adam et al. 2019, Montross-Thomas et al. 2017, Scheffelaar et al. 2018, De Boer et al. 2013), it can be stated that patient-centred care is relevant for almost all patients. The similarities be - tween patient-centred, individualised, and holistic care and AM indicate that AM and prob - ably other forms of IM care as well, may be relevant for a much larger patient group. With regard to research question three - How can patient-reported quality of AM care be measured and how do patients evaluate their received care? - this study shows that in general, the patient-reported quality of AM is good and patients value the way in which AM care is shaped, tailored and delivered. This goes for adults as well as children. Also, the positive evaluation of AM care does not depend on whether people choose deliberately for AM or not. In the Kindertherapeuticum it showed that the integrative approach of the health - care centre was very much valued. In most cases the received care contributed to parents' understanding of and their capability to help, guide and support their child, and an improved health status of the child. Patient-reported experiences with AM GP care were good and slightly - although significantly - better than those with conventional GP care, also when controlling for pa - tient characteristics, but not when controlling for care aspects. A comparison of possible influencing factors demonstrated that Age, Diminishing health problems and specific as - pects of care - GP Communication, GP Conduct and Practice Assistant - are most important for experience rating and recommendation. Regarding general practice care this thesis demonstrated that besides the professional conduct and the communication of the GP, also the work of the assistant in the GP practices plays a significant role in explaining the high rating of AM GP practices. The importance of this aspect is relatively unknown. With regard to evaluating care in the wider field of IM, the scoping review re - vealed that this field lacks a consensus about a standardised way of measuring patient-re - ported quality of care. Also the degree of patient involvement in developing appropriate 217 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinemeasures for evaluating patient-reported quality of care has been quite low. Implications for science and practice In general, the findings of this thesis will make a contribution to a further development of a sound scientific foundation of AM as well as of the wider field of IM. The developed mea - surement instrument CQ-Index AH is able to continue to serve the purpose of evaluating patient experiences with AM and might also be usable for other integrative GP care. The identified patient relevant aspects of AM care will be helpful in developing robust methods to measure patient-reported quality of AM in an integrative way. The fact that AM GP care is at least just as good as conventional GP care from a patient experience perspective, is important with regard to the scientific foundation of AM and underlines the potential for further development of AM and IM in the future. This study shows that AM offers contributions to the practice of self-manage - ment in a way that fits AM patients' values, preferences and situations. It is worthwhile to critically monitor this approach and collect information about its effect on outcomes of care, to serve further development of practical bottom-up self-management. This thesis has also a potential to contribute to further development of measuring patient-centred care and non-specific treatment factors. It reveals that patients' values of patient-centred care are very much in line with a holistic view on health and illness. The comparison of human value-orientations between AM users and the general Dutch popu - lation suggest that also within the general population a group of people exists with similar values as AM users. This implies that AM care has potential to meet healthcare preferences and patient values of a larger group of people. This thesis demonstrates the importance of taking a holistic view in evaluating healthcare performance from patient perspectives in general. More awareness and recognition of different viewpoints will hopefully contribute to a further integration of patient relevant aspects within the delivery of healthcare and sub - sequently the further development and practice of IM. Finally, measuring patient-reported quality in AM and other fields of IM will provide more valid information that is needed to enable patients to make informed decisions on the use of IM. Based on the findings within this thesis it proposes an integrative framework for measuring patient-reported quality of care is: the patient-provider engagement model. The framework uses two complementing aspects of treatment and healing - the interventional and the relational aspect - as a base for integrating patient-relevant measures, and inte - grates them from both the patient and the provider perspective. This leads to a matrix with four fields corresponding with four different interaction processes that contribute to health and treatment (see figure 9.1). Evaluation aspects of care that are identified in this thesis 218 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicinecan be placed into this frame, according to their content (see figure 9.2). An important strength of this study is that it brings together different fields of research. Firstly, it forms a bridge between the world of IM and the world of measuring pa - tient-reported quality of care and health services research. Therefore, this thesis is not only relevant for enhancing quality of care in IM, but also in conventional medicine. Secondly, this study incorporates both quantitative and qualitative research. This enabled us to study patient-reported quality of care from patients' perspective with a focus on qualitatively investigating aspects that are important to patients, as well as to address patient-reported quality of care for a large patient group and to make a comparison between different pa - tient groups. The main limitation of this study is the absence of a master plan in advance. Another limitation is the current focus on AM to address also the wider spectrum of IM. Although we do state that AM is theoretically, methodologically and practically a legitimate field to study also IM, IM is much wider than AM alone. Future research should focus on: - Bringing together the scientific fields of IM on the one side and patient reported quality on the other side. - Systematically developing patient relevant aspects and patient values in actual concrete measures. - Increasing the involvement of patients in identifying quality of care aspects and establishing concrete outcome measures. - Enhancing systematic research on the relation between patient-centred care, the patient provider relationship and non-specific treatment aspects on the one hand and outcomes of care on the other hand. - Broadening and deepening the investigation on worldviews and human values, and their relation with patient characteristics, patient values, preferences and priorities. - And finally, to carry on and enhancing evaluating patient-reported quality of care in AM IM, as well as in comparison with conventional care, to keep building on its scientific foundation and to provide patients with valid information to make informed decisions. 219 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine Dankwoord 220 The relevance of holistic healthcare: Patient-reported quality of care in Anthroposophic and Integrative MedicineDankwoord Het onderzoek en de artikelen die Een oud gezegde verhaalt \" It takes a village to raise a child \" en dat geldt in mijn gesprekken en je opbouwende feedback.
