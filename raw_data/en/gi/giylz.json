Don't get Marcia Angell started on the pharmaceutical industry. She will tell you how it manipulates the law and buys off regulators; of its blatant disregard for the wellbeing of the people who use its products. As for the claim that it innovates and saves lives - forget it. In Angell's world view, the medicines juggernaut is an ideas void, teetering on the brink of intellectual bankruptcy as companies churn out cynical copies of rivals' drugs and raid publicly funded research for their own profiteering ends. Drug makers have copped their fair share of serves in the past, but never from someone with such impeccable establishment credentials. At the New England Journal of Medicine, where she worked for two decades, Angell sat in judgement over some of the most high-stakes medical science of her generation. Demanding exacting standards of scientific proof, the journal is regarded as the pinnacle of academic publishing. To have it accept your research means not just kudos but the chance to rewrite the ground rules of your specialty. In the case of drug trials, a landmark study in the journal can change standard treatment overnight, with enormous financial ramifications for manufacturers. Now Angell, who was editor-in-chief when she left the journal in 2000, has dumped on the industry that once revered and courted her. The title of her book, The Truth about Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do about It, lays out the territory. And Angell delivers in spades. In a fast-paced account, she paints a commercial landscape stacked in favour of drug companies and their massive profits. But most confronting of all is the complicity of doctors and scientists. While, officially, drug companies may not market their pills and potions for uses that have not been approved by the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, Angell details how they do so anyway. \"You do that by carrying out 'research' that falls way below the standard required for FDA approval,\" she writes, \"then 'educating' doctors about any favourable results. That way, you could circumvent the law. You could say you were not marketing for unapproved uses; you were merely disseminating the results of research to doctors - who can legally prescribe a drug for any use. But it would be bogus education about bogus research. It would really be marketing.\" Many drugs are prescribed outside their official recommendations, she says. Neurontin, for example, was initially approved only for epilepsy. But, after a slow start, it grew to become a $US2.3 billion ($3 billion today) blockbuster for its owner, Pfizer, in 2003. \"About 80 per cent of the prescriptions were for unapproved uses - conditions like bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, hot flashes, migraines and tension headaches,\" Angell writes. \"In fact, Neurontin has become a sort of all-purpose restorative for chronic discomfort of almost any type - yet there is almost no good published evidence that it works.\" Looking back over her career, Angell says the first signs of inappropriate industry influence were apparent in the mid '80s, but the balance did not tip until a decade ago. \"My feelings changed as the industry changed and became much more overt in controlling the design of trials,\" she told the Herald. \"Our very best academic institutions were allowing their research to be skewed by the industry. People who I thought would have refused to take part did so.\" Suddenly, eminent scientists were comparing new drugs with placebos - instead of addressing the more relevant question of whether they were better than existing medicines. Angell says she is a sceptical person, and had insisted her journal stick to papers that were medically important. Still, under her stewardship, the journal did publish some studies that, in hindsight, were on the nose. \"I think I was sometimes naive,\" she says. Angell portrays an industry chasing its own tail with a proliferation of \"me-too\" drugs, as the supply of genuinely new treatments under development or trial diminishes. These drugs are differentiated from the original only by the fact their sponsors have tested them in groups of patients or applications their rivals may not have thought of. This week in the GPs' newspaper Australian Doctor, for example, the drug giant Lilly is advertising its impotence drug, Cialis, which works along similar lines to the earlier and better-known Viagra. It claims: \"Only Cialis has up to 36 hours of efficacy.\" But that does not mean Viagra or the other me-too drugs have flunked the 36-hour test. Check the fine print and you find there was no comparison study - just a survey of men taking only Cialis. The 36-hour efficacy turns out to apply to only 60 per cent of intercourse attempts and is \"statistically significant\" - science-speak for outperforming a placebo pill, though not necessarily by much. Besides, the ad does not say what is so good about 36-hour operation for a type of drug that men typically pop an hour or two before they hope to have sex. A growing proportion of all research - at least 25 per cent, according to Angell - is conducted after drugs have hit the streets. And while post-marketing studies are vital, because that is when unusual side effects often show, many amount to the scientific equivalent of push-polling - using valid research methods to spruik dubious benefits. Recently, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration has said it will follow more closely the work of the US regulator in determining the conditions under which medicines should be available, so as not to duplicate that agency's research effort. Last year, for example, it waited for the agency to rule on the contentious use of anti-depressant drugs in depressed children, before deciding to upgrade safety warnings here. But, to hear Angell tell it, the FDA is the last agency you would want to follow. She points to a crisis at the US regulator, which must try to maintain integrity in the face of an overwhelming workload, rapacious company lawyers and an anti-regulation government. Several pieces of legislation, enacted from the Reagan era onwards, have played into the hands of Big Pharma - the collective name for the top 10 drug companies that between them netted $US36 billion in profits in 2002 - more than all the other 490 Fortune 500 companies together. It sounds like high farce but it is fact: the US Patent and Trademark Office is paid a piece rate according to how many applications it processes, which, naturally, predisposes it to grant patents rather than having to justify rejecting them. Bingo: patents on new dosages, combinations of old drugs, and even on the coatings and colours of pills. Pity the drug regulator as it wades through the resulting patent mountain to figure out which of these supposed innovations should earn the companies an extension on their lucrative exclusive marketing rights. Of course, the pharmaceutical industry and free-market pundits decried Angell and her work when the book was published in the US last year. She was lampooned as a woolly leftie by James Pinkerton, a fellow of the think tank New America Foundation. \"She argues that the same government that has given us the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy Regulation Commission, the Federal Elections Commission, and a hundred other acronymic agencies, will do a wonderful job of overseeing the pharmaceutical industry,\" he sniggered. \"So if you are sick and tired of capitalism, your ship may be coming in.\" Henry Miller, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, got more personal, accusing Angell of a crusade to deny people life-saving innovations. \"Dr Angell's analysis of companies' profitability downplays their huge investments in research and development,\" he wrote. This investment, as a proportion of sales, was about four times as much as the electronics, telecommunications or aerospace sectors. Drug companies were obliged to charge heavily for their products, Miller argued, to recoup the cost of research and development in a climate where fewer than one in 5000 drug \"candidates\" will make it onto the market. But even Miller conceded that this situation leads to \"structural problems\" that push industry to \"focus increasingly on financial blockbusters - usually treatments for chronic conditions that affect large populations - and to neglect products with more modest prospects, no matter how medically important ... Although they are tremendously critical and cost-effective, antibiotics and vaccines are out of favour.\" On the other hand, Angell has won at least one unlikely supporter. Pfizer's vice-president of marketing, Peter Rost, contributed an adulatory review of her \"business thriller\" to the website of the online bookseller Amazon. \"I have spent close to 20 years marketing drugs,\" Rost wrote. \"So I guess I'm not supposed to like this book. But the truth is I thought it was fantastic.\" Breaking ranks with his industry, Rost criticised laws that allow drug manufacturers to set prices, instead of negotiating with US health insurers, government health providers or other bulk buyers. Still more controversially, he agreed that individuals and organisations should be allowed to reimport cheaper medicines from countries such as Canada and Australia, which do regulate pricing. Offshore drug buying is technically illegal in the US (supposedly for safety reasons), but it is widespread, especially since the advent of internet pharmacies. Rost agreed with Angell that such people power might ultimately rein in Big Pharma's excesses where government has failed to. \"They have antagonised grannies all over the US with their work to stop reimportation of cheaper drugs into the US,\" he wrote. \"And anyone in marketing or public relations can tell you that no money in the world can help you win against millions of mad grandmothers.\" The Truth About the Drug Companies (Scribe Publications, $32.95) by Marcia Angell, is published on Monday. NEXT TIME YOU'RE AT THE DOCTOR ... 1. What evidence is there that the drug you are prescribing is better than other drugs or alternative treatment approaches? 2. Is this drug better only because it is given at a higher dose? Would a cheaper drug be as effective if it were given at an equivalent dose? 3. Are the benefits worth the side effects, and the risk of interactions with my other medications? 4. Is this a free sample from a pharmaceutical rep? If so, can I transfer to a cheaper equivalent when it is finished? 5. Do you have any financial ties with the maker of this drug? 6. Are you being paid to enrol me in a drug company study? * Adapted from Angell's book. "}
