One element is predominant and is considered your constitution. The element is determined by the time and location of your birth and other factors such as your parents individual constitutions and environmental nurturing. Your elemental influences your behaviors, career choices, relationship styles, emotional states, and myriad daily interaction choices. It even determines what imbalances, diseases and disorders you may be more inclined to have. Coaching consists of a determination of your Elemental, explanation of creation and support cycles and discovery of areas of imbalance and potential pathologies. This one-off treatment can be combined with ongoing coaching as needed for proper alignment and wellbeing. Food Medicine & Chinese Dietary Therapy Coaching & Consulting Food Medicine & Chinese Dietary Therapy is based on the energetics and medicinal qualities of foods according the Chinese Medicine and Daoist food principles. We work directly with farmers, food purveyors, culinary professionals, food insecurity advocates and culinary schools to help create food that not only tastes amazing but heals the body in ways never before considered. Growing, harvesting, preparation and food combinations within the Daoist and Chinese Dietary principles creates food that is not only ethically sustainable but food but honors the land and animals as part of a cycle of energy. We look at food as a layered experience of 5 tastes and 5 energetics that create food formulations of healing food medicine. We are currently taking new patients!
