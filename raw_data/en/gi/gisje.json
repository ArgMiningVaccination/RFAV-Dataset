In 2012, Texas Health Resources and Adventist Health System formed a partnership to own Tex as Health Huguley Hospital, with Adventist Health System managing the daily operations of the hospital. The 2020 -2022 Implementation Plan was completed by Texas Health Resources and was approved via email unanimously by the Texas Health Huguley Board on June 1 4, 2020. The Board approved the goals, objectives and next steps. A link to the 2020 Implementation Plan was posted on the Hospital's website prior to July 15, 2020. The Community Health Plan can be found at https://www.adventhealth.com/community -health- needs -assessments .Texas Health Huguley's fiscal year is January - December. Implementati on of the 2020 CHP begins upon its approval by the Board. The first annual evaluation will begin from the date of implementation through the end of the calendar year. Evaluatio n results will be attached to the Hospital's IRS Form 990, Schedule H. The colle ctive monitoring and reporting will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective. Goal(s) Integrate and strengthen the delivery systems mechanism to decrease health disparities and improve health outcomes in target communities. Objective(s) Increase the visibility of THR's Community Health Improvement (CHI) interventions among internal and external stakeholders to create opportunities for collaboration and integration at the departmental and system levels. - Measured by the number and types of collaborations between internal and external stakeholders. - Measured by the number of outreach efforts for THR's Community Health interventions through internal and external stakeholders' channels. Finalize sustainability plans and collectively support strategies that increase resources, funding, and collaboration opportunities that strengthen THR's Community Health Improvement interventions . - Measured by the level of funding secured for each priority area. Demonstrate innovation at the departmental or system -level focused on improving the delivery of health services to our target population/communities . - Measured by the types of innovative strategies that are leveraged to enhance the delivery of THR's Community Health Improvement (CHI) interventions between 2020 - 2022. Target Audience(s) Individuals and communi ties (zip codes) experiencing health disparities due to structural inequities that impact Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). Strategic Alignment Partnerships, Consumer s Priority Areas Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Behavioral Health Access, Health literacy, and Navigation Inclusive of social determinants that negatively impact each priority area. Sustainability/Resources 2020 - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) - Implementation Plan 2 Priority Area 1: Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Focus Areas: Diabetes, Hypertension , Cancer and Cholesterol Management Need s Statement: Chronic diseases are the major causes of illness, disability , and death in Texas, accounting for over 50% of all deaths per year. There is evidence that the social context of a person's life determines their risk of exposure, degree of susceptibility , and the course and outcome of chronic diseases. Chronic conditions are devastating for quality of life and are costly conditions to tr eat and manag e. In 2014 , Texas reported over $34 billion in hospital charges related to just three chronic diseases: heart disease, cancer, and stroke. There is mounting evidence that focusing interventions , policies, and investments on addressing structur al inequities can improve the health status and outcomes of vulnerable populations , thereby reducing health disparities. of Chronic Disease.

If left untreated, uncontrolled behavioral health can lead to high utilization of preventable hospitalization, which in turn leads to high health expenses for many patients and health care systems . According to SAMHSA, the cost of care is 75 percent higher for people with co -morbid behavioral and physical health con ditions. Limited health care access and unsafe environments are potent ial risk factors for behavioral health disorders. Also , exposures to violence, social isolation, and discrimination are sources of toxic stress that significantly contribute to the devel opment and exacerbation of behavioral health disorders. It is important to empower individuals with the skills and resources to access and utilize appropriate behavioral health services. Data Sources: American Hospital Association (2019).

Evidence shows that poor health literacy is associated with higher hospitalizations, greater use of emergency care, lower receipts of screenings and va ccines, reduced ability to demonstrate medication adherence, and poor overall health status and higher mortality rates. Individuals or groups that lack economic resources , reside in neighborhoods with high con ditions of crime, have limited green space , and grocery stores are at risk for adverse health outcomes. There is evidenc e that a person's zip code has powerful influences on their health status, access to resource s, and the ability to navigate those resource s.
