In part, this renewed curiosity is probably du e to the revolutionizing natural movement in the cosmetic indus- try. In this article, we provide an overview of th e historical aspects of the use of natural ingredients in cosmetics, which mostly come from botanical an d mineral sources. We begi n with an introduction to the art and science of cosmetics in the ancient world, which includes a ccounts of Egyptian, Mes- opotamian, Greek, and Roman cosmetics as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine. These dermatological an d cosmetic practices, which were advanced for the time, paved the way for the current revolution of natural ingr edients in cosmetic products. Without providing a comprehensive historical account, we surveyed selected cultures during di erent periods of time to provide some perspective of our current understanding of natural ingredients in cosmetics. A tten- tion is also given to the rich contributions of body art by tribal societies to our knowledge base, especially in the areas of dy es and pigments. Finally, we o er some perspective of natural ingredient cosmetics in the Information Age. Keywords: natural ingredients; cosmetics; Roman cosmetics; body art 1. Introduction Dating back thousands of years, the use of cosmetic products has played an im- portant role in humans' lives. They allowed for the enhancement of beauty, protection of the skin, care of the teeth, use of fragrance, and painting of the skin for cultural and reli- gious purposes. Early in history, all cosmetic products were made of natural ingredients, mostly derived from plants, minerals, and anim als. It was not until the twentieth century that synthetic and chemically modi ed ingredients became universally employed in cos- metics. Returning in the direction of early hist ory, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the use of natural ingredients in cosmetic formulations started to become in vogue\u2014a trend most likely set in motion by consumer demands an d cosmetic manufacturers trying to distin- guish themselves in the competitive marketplac e. Initially, most of the natural ingredients were skin care actives, which elicited a biological response in the skin typically with the desired outcome of enhancing the structural integrity of the skin, providing solar protec- tion, reducing chronic and photo-aging, and a host of other e ects. Since then, there has been a much greater e ort across many industries to pr oduce more sustainable products. Materials and products characterized as sustainable should provide bene ts to the con- sumer without harming the environment. This movement has led many companies in the cosmetics industry on a quest to nd natural ingredients to replace their synthetic coun- terparts in formulation chassis. In this arti cle, we provide a comprehensive review of the history of natural ingredients used in cosmetics with the hope that it will o er the reader some insight to developing novel natural-based products.

Ahead of their time, the Egyptian s were sophisticated co smetic chemist formu- lators. Bathing was a part of their daily life, with most Egyptians bathing at home or in the river. Cleansing cream was made of animal fat or vegetable oil mixed with powdered lime and perfume. Oils and creams were used for protection against the harsh sun, wind, and dry climate. The lips and cheeks were treated with red ochre ground in water. People rubbed themselves daily with perfumed unguent oil that was soaked in scented wood. Perfumes were made of myrrh, thyme, marj oram, chamomile, lavender, lily, peppermint, rosemary, cedar, rose, aloe, olive oil, sesame oil, and almond oil [1]. The use of perfume had a very spiritual signi cance and was believed to optimize body function. Fingernails and the palms of the hands were treated with henna, producing an orange-red tone. In general, the variety of pigments based on na tural minerals used by the ancient Egyptians for cosmetics is impressive [5,6]. One of the most distinctive cosmetic prepar ations used by the ancient Egyptians was kohl [7]. It is a dark cosmetic applied to th e eyebrows, eyelashes, and perimeter of the eye. The wall painting displayed in Figure 1 clearl y demonstrates the use of kohl by the ancient Egyptians. Analysis of samples from burial excavations provided evidence that green kohl was used in predynastic times (5000-3000 BC) with the principal ingredient being mala- chite ore (basic copper carbonate; Cu 2(OH) 2CO 3). In the Egyptian dynastic periods (3100- 30 BC), kohl often contained galena ore (lead sul de; PbS) as the most abundant ingredi- ent, which provided a black color [8]. Throughout history, it was presumed that black kohl was predominantly made of stibnite (Sb 2S3), a rarer mineral which gives a similar tone as galena ore. While stibnite has been found in excavated kohl samples, galena ore was more common. This misconception migh t stem from the use of the Latin word stibium for kohl or possibly the reference to stibnite in ancient Muslim texts as the proper ingredient for formulating kohl [9]. Often, minor components in kohl consisted of other lead-based com- pounds, such as phosgenite ((PbCl) 2CO 3) and laurionite (PbCl(OH)), which provided lighter tones to the resulting formula. Long chain fa tty acids of animal origin were also found in kohl compositions. Although less prevalent, magnesium oxide (MnO 2) and brown ochre/iron oxide (Fe 2O3 \u00b7 nH 2O) were also used as primary kohl ingredients. Later in history, kohl made from soot was more fr equently used. See Figure 2 for an illustration for some of the minerals that were used in Egyptian cosmetic preparations. Figure 1. Wall painting from Theban Tomb TT93. The to mb, located in the ancient Egyptian Theban Necropolis, is from the 18th Dynasty (1550-1292 BC). It belongs to Qenamun, who was the high Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 3 of 31 steward for the pharaoh Amenhotep II. The use of ko hl around the eyes is evident in the painting.

Minerals used in ancient Egypt for cosmetic preparations: ( a) e) ore. Hematite is the primary ingredient in brown ochre. Photographs of the minerals by Krim Kate were obtained through a license agreement with iStock (Ge tty Images), Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Kohl was typically applied as a powder or paste (using a water-soluble gum) with a kohl stick. In addition to its cosmetic appeal, it was also applied as a salve to treat condi- tions and diseases of the eye. Today, kohl is still used in parts of Northern Africa and the Middle East. An analysis published in 2006 on the composition of modern-day Egyptian kohl products demonstrated that about 25% of the tested products were based on galena ore [8]. It should be noted that compounds containing lead are toxic and can enter the blood circulation by inhalation, ingestion, and percutaneous absorption. Lead compounds bioaccumulate in the body and are signi cantly more toxic to infants and children than to adults. They can cause intellectual disabilities , loss of hearing, and various other ailments. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve the use of kohl products due to the presence of lead-based compounds. Howe ver, there are products that are labeled as kohl in the U.S., although in this case, kohl is a marketing term that is used to describe extremely dark shades of eyeliner. Another important aspect of ancient Egyptian life was oral care [10]. Since the Egyp- tians used stone to grind wheat into flour, it is very likely that sand from the stones dam- aged enamel and other structural elements of the tooth [11]. Most archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians su ered from tooth decay, tooth loss, and dental abscesses. Interestingly, the earliest recorded dentist in the world was the Egyptian Hesy-Ra who lived during the Third Dynasty (First Dynast y of the Old Kingdom\u20142600 BC) [12]. Chew- ing sticks and wood have been used throughout history to clean the teeth. However, the ancient Egyptians are often credited for the rst written recording of a toothpaste formula (ca. fourth century BC) containing a mixtur e of salt, pepper, mint leaves, and iris flowers [13]. Historically, salt and ash were used in dentifrices as abrasive ingredients serving a similar function as silica in today's modern-day preparations. Ironically, several (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 4 of 31 commercial brands available on the market today contain salt as one of the principal in- gredients. Most texts describe the rst mints made by the Egyptians as containing frank- incense, myrrh, and cinnamon, which were bo iled with honey and shaped into pellets. Ointments and perfumes also played an important role in Egyptian life. Ointments, principally composed of animal fats and probably scented, were applied to the skin to protect it from the harsh elements and extr emely arid environment. Perfume was applied to the body and was important for funeral and temple rituals. Typical ingredients used in ancient Egyptian perfumes consisted of ca rdamon, cassia, cinnamon, and frankincense [14]. Other ingredients often described in the literature include myrrh, thyme, marjoram, chamomile, lavender, lily, peppermint, rosemary, cedar, rose, aloe, olive oil, sesame oil, and almond oil [1]. Perfumes from this period were fat-based, since modern techniques of preparation based on distillation were not disc overed until later. Therefore, perfumes of- ten contained animal fats or plant oils since they absorb and retain fragrance molecules [15]. Most of the historical analyses of anci ent Egyptian perfumes only describe the base material as fat- or oil-based due to the limi ted advances in chemical analysis techniques in the early 1900s. Some of the ingredients th at would have been locally available in the region at the time would have been plant-based oils such as sesame oil ( Sesamum indicum as ), as well as animal fats (ox, sheep, and fowl fat) could have also been used [14]. Hair styling is another facet of the ancient Egyptian cosmetic pale tte. Recent archae- ological evidence has shown that hair gels were employed in ancient Egypt [16]. Tombs of people who underwent a mummi cation process were compared to those of tombs that were naturally mummi ed by extremely arid conditions. Mummies from both groups were found to have fa tty material (palmitic and stearic acid) applied to their styled hair. Therefore, this data suggests th at the coating of hair with a fa tty substance was not neces- sarily a part of the embalming procedure. Ho wever, it should also be pointed out that during the mummi cation procedure, hair was often tr eated with fat-based preparations. It should also be noted that, in some case s, ancient Egyptians shaved their heads to cope with the extreme heat as well as for sani tary reasons. Wigs have been found in exca- vations of Egyptian tombs, and it is believed that wigs probably were worn on the shaved scalp [17]. Furthermore, archeologists suggest that wigs were placed on the heads of shaved mummies to prepare them for the afterlife. For example, Queen Nodjmet who was relatively old when she died in 1064 BC, was found to have a wig believed to help her look younger for the afterlife (see Figure 3). The analysis of another ancient Egyptian wig from the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom; buried at Thebes ca. 1400 BC) held in the British Museum indicated there was a coating present with a composition of about two-thir ds beeswax and one-third resin [18]. Unfor- tunately, the resin was never properly analyzed; however, myrrh gum resin ( Commiphora myrrha ) was commonly used in ancient Egypt. There are several di erent species of Com- miphora indigenous to the northeastern African continent. In addition to its antimicrobial properties, myrrh is a reme dy for numerous ailments in herbal me dicine [19]. While most of the cosmetic treatments in ancient Egypt used natural ingredients that provided e ective results, there are examples in the literature of potions that probably were not very e cacious. For example, a remedy for gr ay hair was published in the Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1550 BC) that consisted of placing a donkey's liver in a pot and le tting it sit until it becomes ro tten [20]. The liver should then be cooked in water and mixed with lard prior to application to the scalp. More than likely, this treatment probably does not work, although there are not any studies to the author s' knowledge that disprove it. In general, herbal medicine was important in ancient E gypt. Some medical prescriptions in derma- for treating skin diseases and burns as well as serving as wound healing agents [21]. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 5 of 31 Figure 3. Photograph of the mummy of Queen Nodjmet (death in 1064 BC) illustrating her elaborate wig made of human hair. She was buried at the anci ent Egyptian city Thebes and is now held at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The photograph of the mummy was obtained through a license agree- ment with Science Photo Library, Ltd., London, UK. The ancient Egyptians are also renowned for their technique and understanding of the conservation of the human body for the afterlife. Mummi cation was a process that took about 70 days and consisted of rst removing all the internal organs (including the brain) except the heart, which was believed to carry all the good and bad deeds of a person and, therefore, to be necessary for the nal judgement in the afterl ife. After organ removal, the body would then be covered in salt (natro n) and allowed to dry for 40 days. Perfumed oils and plant resins were then applied to the skin followed by a thick layer of resin, which was used to glue strips of linen to the body. It is believed that embalming ingredients consisted of plant oil (e.g., sesame), balsam -type plant or root extract (e.g., bullrush), plant-based gum (e.g., acacia), and conifer tree resin (e.g., pine) [22]. 3. Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine has been practiced in China for over two millennia. It is a system of medicine based on maintaining the balance between the internal organs of the body and the external elements. Essentiall y, it is balanced ha rmony between the two opposing forces: yin and yang. Practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine may use ac- upuncture, acupressure, moxibustion (burning herbal leaves near the body), exercising (e.g., tai chi), cupping (placing hot cu ps on the body to increase blood flow to the skin), or herbal remedies. Qi describes the vital energy that flows by di erent channels throughout our body. A primary goal of Traditional Chinese Medicine is to maintain the flow of qi. Herbal preparations can often be composed of many di erent types of ingredients, plant- and animal-based, that are mixed before consumption. Bencao Gangmu ( ), also known as Compendium of Materia is an encyclopedic work wri tten by the 16th-century Chinese doctor Li Shizhen that covers all aspects of Traditional Chinese Medicine. There is considerable interest in the cosmetic and dermatologic community to be tter understand the potential Traditional Chinese Medicine ingredients for skin care [23-26]. Most of the skin remedies in Traditional Chinese Medi- cine are decoctions (multi-ingredient) that are taken orally for several weeks. Topical Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 6 of 31 preparations often consist of a single ingredie nt. Treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermati- tis, eczema, and other skin ailments are described in Bencao Gangmu. Herbal extracts are obtained by performing an extraction procedure on an indicated component of the plant (e.g., root, leaf, bark, etc.). Table 1 contains a list of several plant species that are used for the treatment of sk in ailments in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Carthami flos is the floret of the sa ower ) family. Mugwort has been used in traditional systems of medicine in dierent parts of the world. Nowadays, oral administration of mugwort is suggested for digestive problems, irregular menstruation, and high blood pressure . It also has prop- erties that make it useful as a sedative, laxative, and liver tonic. Semen benincasae , also re- ferred to as Dong Gua Zi, is a melon whose s eeds are crushed into a paste and then applied to skin. Taoren ( Semen persicae ) is the fruit kernel of peach (the kernel is the soft part of a seed). In general, there is renewed interest in understanding the history of skin care in China; however, there is not very much info rmation available in the academic literature [27]. Table 1. Selected list of botanicals used in Tradit ional Chinese Medicine to treat skin [28]. Plant Species Function First Recorded Use Carthami flos flower juice ( Car- thamus tinctorius BC) Mugwort ( Artemisia stelleriana ) Hair growth Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BC-24 AD) Chinese Waxgourd Seed ( Se- men benincasae ) Skin brightening and anti- aging Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BC-24 AD) Taoren skin mica Known as Yun-Mu cream and used to relieve black spots and acne Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) The Gingko biloba tree is native to China and is the oldest living tree species. In west- ern medicine, Gingko leaf extracts have been used for the last several decades to increase peripheral and cerebral blood flow as well as for the treatment of dementia. The extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves contains flavonoids and for the structure of selected terpene tri-lactones (gingkolides) found in the Gingko biloba plant. Gingko seeds are used in Traditional Chi- nese Medicine to treat skin infections (top ical antimicrobial). Present-day studies have shown that Ginkgo skin Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 7 of 31 Figure 4. Molecular structure of selected terpene tri-la ctones (gingkolides) isolated from the Gingko biloba plant. Pearl powder has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine since the early part of the Common Era as a health, cosmetic, and nu trient supplement. The empress Wu Zetian (625-705 AD) consumed pearl powder and applied it to her face for its brightening/light- ening properties. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) is the most abundant ingredient in pearls. The organic matrix contains proteins, glycopro teins, and polysaccharides. Pearls also con- tain silica, calcium phosphate (Ca 3(PO 4)2), aluminum oxide, and iron oxide as well as trace elements (sodium, manganese, selenium, al uminum, and copper). Recent studies have shown the potential of pearl powder to treat wo unds and atopic dermatitis as well as to stimulate broblast proliferation and collagen synthesis [30]. Nail polish was introduced in China around 3000 BC. Nail polish formulations con- sisted of beeswax, egg whites, and gelatin with orchids or roses. Initially, red and black tones were preferred, and nail polish was reserved for the higher echelon of society [31]. During the Zhou Dynasty (1050-221 BC), wo men of all classes could wear nail polish. Higher social ranking individuals painted their nails and covered them with silver and gold dust. Average Chinese women were allowed to wear neutral colors (e.g., pink). Not abiding to these norms could result in puni shment and even the death penalty. During the same period, the early Egyptians also pa inted their nails (mostly with henna). Cleo- patra is known for wearing a henna-based red na il polish. Berries were also used to stain the nails. Nail painting was also carried ou t during the era of the Babylonian empire. 4. Ayurvedic Medicine India has a deep-rooted tradition of herbal medicine that has been facilitated through several systems of medicine, namely Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, naturopathy, and home- opathy. In recent years, there has been gr eat interest in understanding the scienti c mech- anisms responsible for many of th e phytochemicals used in these di erent medical mo- dalities, especially from an herbal cosmetics perspective [32-36]. For the sake of brevity, we only touch upon certain aspects of Ayur vedic medicine and the treatment of skin. Developed in India, Ayurveda has been practiced for more than 3000 years. Literally translated, Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). It is an herbal medicine system deeply rooted in the philosophy of healthy living and maintaining proper balance in our physiological and psychological being. Ill- ness is treated using natural ingredients which target the disease with the intent to restore proper balance. India is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, o ering a variety of plant sources for the many treatment modalities of Ayurveda. Skin care is an important part of Ayurveda [37,38]. Diet and wa ter are believed to play an important role in the overall health state of the skin. In general, Ayurvedic treat- ments focus on skin beauty as well as treating skin disorders, such as acne vulgaris, aging skin, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Sesame oil, which contains lignan compounds (sesa- min and sesamolin) is used as a base in many Ayurvedic cosmetic preparations. Face mask preparations traditionally contain bu ttermilk and goat milk powder\u2014rich in vitamin A, B6, B12, and E\u2014providing emollient properties to the skin. A popular shampoo ingredient is the herb shikakai, which comes from the shikakai pods and nuts of the Acacia concinna shrub. The pods contain saponins, wh ich acts as mild detergents [39]. Some examples of botanical ingredients used in ayurveda for the treatment of skin are provided in Table 2. Aloe vera has been used by some of the ancient cultures for mil- lennia, including China, Greece, Egypt, India, and Mexico. Mucopolysaccharides in Aloe vera bind water and help maintain moisture levels of the skin. Aloe vera contains numer- ous vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene), enzymes (anti-in flammatory and metabolism of sugars and fats), minerals (t o promote enzyme activi ty), anthraquinones (laxatives), and hormones [40]. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 8 of 31 Calendula o cinialis (marigold) has reported wound healing properties, especially during the in flammation stage of wound healing and production of granulation tissue [41]. Curcuma longa (Curcumin) is the yellow pigment obtained from the rhizome of the perennial herb turmeric. It has received a lot of interest in recent years as a skin treatment due to anti-in flammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-neoplastic properties [42]. Table 2. Selected list of botanical ingredients used in Ayurvedic Medicine for skin care. Medicinal Plant Botanical Name Function Reference Aloe vera Aloe barbadensis botanicals in Ay urveda may not be readily available. There- fore, practitioners of Ayurveda often use subs titute ingredients (due to limited availabil- ity), which should have similar pharmacological activity to the original botanical ingredi-ent. One example is Ativisha ( Aconitum heterophyllum ), which is used for treating a variety of ailments, but has limited availability [46]. Coco grass (a substitute for Ativisha) is con- sidered one of the world's worst weeds, know n for infecting crops and other plants. In addition to its role as an alternative for At ivisha, coco grass was also shown to regulate hair growth, which was suggested to result from the activity of flavonoids on the andro- genic plant that has been used to treat a host of ailments in Ayurveda and other traditional medicines. The principal active ingredients are saponins (triterpenoids), which are surface ac tive glycosides. Gotu kola is used to treat wounds, eczema, psoriasis, and many other skin ailments [47]. In wound healing, its mechanism of action is believed to result from the proliferation of broblasts leading to an increase in collagen synthesis, elevated levels of bronectin in the extracellular matrix, and a reduction of in flammation [45]. 5. Color Cosmetics on the Indian Subcontinent Historically, India has a very rich cosmetic cultural tradition, although it can be very diverse from region to region. Some of thes e traditions extend beyond present-day India into Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other neighboring countries. Many customs are associated with religious ceremonies or social status. In the paragraphs that follow, we provide a few examples of natural ingredie nts used in Indian color cosmetics [48]. 5.1. Kumkum Kumkum, also known as kumkuma, is an important color cosmetic powder tradi- tionally made from lime water and turmeric. Lime water\u2014also referred to as slaked lime\u2014is a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide, which is produced when calcium ox- ide is mixed with water. Calcium oxide (quicklime), which is caustic and alkaline, results from the thermal decomposition of limestone and seashells. Curcumin, the principal in- gredient of turmeric, is responsible for its yellow color, which becomes red with increasing pH (see Figures 5 and 6). Early in history, lime was used as a plaster agent, fertilizer, hair dye, and soap ingredient. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 9 of 31 Figure 5. Photograph of ( a) turmeric and ( b) kumkum. The image by Ak ash Kharvi was obtained through a license agreement with Alam y Ltd., Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK. Figure 6. Molecular structure of curcumin, the chief comp onent of turmeric. At low pH, it primarily exists in the ( a) keto form, which tautomerizes to the ( b) enol form at higher pH. Kumkum is still commonly used today for social and religious rituals in India. For example, one of its popular uses is for puja, which is a ritual o ering to gods in Hinduism. In addition, married Indian women part their hair and apply kumkum daily at the part Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 10 of 31 line at the top of the forehead. This application is often referred to as vermilion (sindoor in Hindi). In some cases, kumkum is applied as a dot (known as bindi) to the forehead of women as part of the religious tradition of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Although, nowadays it is more common to use a sticker or some other type of material. Over the last several decades, numerous commercial kumkum products have become available to the consumer in the form of po wders, liquids, and pastes. Many of these for- mulations contain conventional synthetic or natural ingredients that have been processed. Possibly, this could be the reason for studie s in the literature, which report contact der- matitis resulting from the use of kumkum [49, 50]. Nowadays, some of the products that claim to be organic and/or natural kumkum use borax (sodium borate salt), alum (hy- drated sulfated salt of aluminum), lemon/lim e juice, plant powders, and plant oils (e.g., sesame, jojoba, almond). The salts provide th e necessary caustic conditions for curcumin to change its color from yellow to red. 5.2. Kajal Like the ancient Egyptians, pe ople residing on the Indian subcontinent used to apply (and still do) a dark eyeliner known as kajal. Essentially, it was the same composition as kohl (already discussed in the section Egypti an Cosmetics) where the mineral galena was the primary ingredient. Its use stems from the perceived protective e ect of the eye from UV radiation and for religious reasons. Even today, in the medical community there is signicant concern of its use, especi ally by the younger generation [51]. In addition to lead sulde (PbS) found in galena, commercial formul ations have been reported to contain magnetite (Fe 3O4), and zincite [52]. Carbon black has become a more common modern-day version of kajal, which circumvents any issues that could be associated with lead poisoning from traditional kajal. It should be pointed out that some scientists distinguish between the chemical composition of kohl and kajal [48]. 5.3. Henna Henna comes from the plant Lawsonia inermis and is a traditional ingredient with a long history of use which dates to the ancien t civilizations. In Ayurveda, it is recom- mended for various ailments including some skin diseases and scabies. It is most well- known for its hair dyeing proper ties, especially in the region s of present-day India, Paki- stan, and Iran. Lawsone (see Figure 7) is the principal dye molecule component responsi-ble for its characteristic orange-red color. Henna is also the primary dye component used in the body art Mehndi, which has been practi ced since the 4th or 5th century BC and is still common today in India and surrounding regions. Mehndi is typically administered on the hands and/or legs and is especially popular for traditional Hindu weddings. Figure 7. Molecular structure of lawsone, the principal dye molecule in henna. Modern-day hair dyes based on henna often contain other dyes in addition to henna as well as metallic salts [53]. The preparation and application of henna hair formulations is a more time-consuming process than conventional hair dye systems. In addition, the colorfastness of conventional commercial hair systems is greater than natural henna dyes. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 11 of 31 6. Cosmetics in Ancient Mesopotamia Often referred to as the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia (today known as the Mid- dle East) developed in the region bound by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Southwest Asia. The Sumer civilization played an important role in developing culture, commerce, and infrastructure. The Sumerians were the rst people to develop citi es in this area dating back to approximately 3000 BC. Later, Babylon and Sumer became two important cities in this region. Cosmetic chemistry was not as well developed in Mesopotamia as it was in ancient Egypt; however, cosmetic practices by its inhabitants were later adopted by the Ancient Greeks, Romans, and other civilizati ons in the Mediterranean region [54,55]. Much of what is known about Mesopotami an cosmetics comes from ancient texts written in cuneiform as well as archaeological expeditions of burial sites, which have re- vealed a variety of cosmetic containers. Fragrance and incense were very important to the Sumerians and even represented a mode of co nnecting with the deities. Herbs, oils, and wood were used to create many of the incense varieties. Di erent colors of pigments were applied to the face as a form of color cosmetics. Eye cosmetics were an important aspect of color cosmetics and primarily consisted of antimony paste, which could be applied us- ing an object shaped like a needle [56]. The use of eye cosmetics was very similar to the customs in Egypt\u2014essentially another form of kohl. Lotion and unguent formulations were devised to care for the skin and protec t it from the powerful UV radiation and dry climate in the region. 7. Cosmetics and Dermatology in Ancient Greece and Rome According to ancient Greek literary and archeological evidence, cosmetic use in Greece did not appear until the bronze age (3 200-1100 BC). Fragrances and unguents were applied for their cosmetic and medicinal prop erties and at times used for rituals [57]. There was a noteworthy Egyptian in fluence on the development of Greek cosmetics. Some of the cosmetic ingredients used during that time for color cosmetic applications included chalk (limestone), lapis-lazuli (a deep blue metamorphic rock), and malachite (discussed in the section Egyptian Cosmetics) [58]. During the archaic period (800-490 BC), women started to treat their skin with lead-bas ed creams that provided a whitening e ect. The use of such lead-based formulas to make the skin appear whiter persisted until the 18th century in Europe. Cosmetics in Rome evolved from the Greek tradition and continued to play an im- portant role in people's lives. Most of what we know about Roman cosmetics comes from the scienti c writings of Pliny the Elder and Cornelius Celsus [59]. Other information comes from literature and poetry (e.g., the poet Ovid). Some of the beauty a ttributes dur- ing this period include pale skin, joining of the two eyebrows by a patch of hair (mono- brow), and blonde or auburn (reddish-brown) hair. Skin lightening became increasingly important since Roman women spent more time outside of the house than their Greek predecessors. While cosmetics were used by all echelons of society, for women with a higher standing in society, cosmetics were ty pically applied in a small room with the help of female slaves known as cosmetae. In addition to color cosmetics, skin care and dermatology were also important in an- cient Rome. Table 3 contains a selection of di erent treatments that were included in the works of Pliny the Elder and Cornelius Celsus and summarized by Ursin et al. [60]. Rather than an exhaustive list, selected ingredients are discussed. The rst ingredient in the table is Alcyonium \u2014the soft coral genus (sponge-type) fr om the Mediterranean Sea\u2014which, ac- cording to ancient legends, served as the nest for the halcyon, a bird nowadays that is identi ed as the king sher. While there is certainly a fair amount of literature describing dierent ingredients in Alcyonium , to the authors' knowledge there are not any published studies focused on its e cacy in the treatment of the skin. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 12 of 31 Table 3. Ingredients used to treat certain ailments of the skin as described by Pliny the Elder and Cornelius Celsus [60]. Many of the ingredients are used in combination with other ingredients for treatment. Ingredient Botanical Name Pliny the Elder Cornelius Celsus Soft coral Alcyonium Removes rous Bulb of narcissus (daffodil) Narcissus tazetta Removes blemishes and softens skin Erodent that exfoli- ates skin Honey Mel An emollient and used to remove pim- ples Used to prevent pim- ples, freckles, and moles Myrrh Commiphora myrrha Made into a tisane; cures sores on the head and face Erodent that removes cicatrices Orris root Iris germanica or Iris pallida Used for remedy for skin con- ditions and freckles Cleanser Vitiligo in ancient times is dist inct from modern-day vitiligo. The second ingredient in Table 3 is narcissus, which is a genus of perennial plant that is commonly known as the da odil. There are two published studies (by the same group) that demonstrate its e cacy in the prevention of chronological skin aging\u2014it was pro- posed that a decrease in cell turnover time produces this e ect [61,62]. In another study looking at cell proliferation and dermal structural components, an increase in the produc- tion of growth factors, signaling molecules, structural biomarkers, and oxidative stress indicators was observed for a blend of Narcissus taze tta bulb extract and Schisandra chinen- sis fruit extract [63]. According to Pliny the Elder and Cornelius Celsus, honey was used in ancient Rome for its emollient properties and to treat pimple s, freckles, and moles. In recent decades, there has been a signi cant amount of interest in the therapeutic properties of honey for treatment of the skin [64,65]. In addition to simple carbohydrates (fructose and glucose), honey contains enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and other molecules with bioactivity. Fur- thermore, honey has antimicrobial properties, wh ich has led to interest in its use against pathogenic microorganisms that mitigate the sk in [66,67]. More than likely, its potential as a wound healing agent stems from its antimicrobial activity [68-70]. Moreover, the im- munomodulating properties of honey should provide additional support for wound heal- ing and the treatment of other skin disorders [71]. Myrrh has been used to treat ailments of the skin since antiquity. It is obtained from the sap that is secreted as an exudate from the Commiphora myrrha tree. Myrrh is consid- ered a natural remedy for wounds, infections, and acne and is also used as a perfume agent. The antiseptic, anesthetic, and antitumor properties of myrrh are the terpenoids (isoprenoids), especially the fura nosesquiterpenes [72]. See Figure 8 for a rep- resentative example of a molecule from the fu ranosesquiterpenes clas s. Surprisingly, there have not been many studies aimed at be tter understanding the potential of myrrh in skin care [73,74]. There has been concern about po tential skin sensitizers in myrrh due to the high degree of variability in the sources of myrrh and the complex nature of the myrrh exudate [75]. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 13 of 31 Figure 8. Molecular structure of furanoeudesma-1,3-dien e, one of the furanosesquiterpenes, which contributes to providing myrrh with its unique fragrance characteristic. Orris root ( Rhizoma iridis ) is or Iris pallida . Tra- ditionally, it was used as a skin treatment in folk medicine in several di erent cultures. Nowadays, it is an important fragrance and perfume ingredient [76]. There are many bio- active molecules present and triterpenes [77]. Irones (see Figure 9) are the key molecules that provide the typical orris root scent and are commercially important in the fragrance industry [78]. In a recent study, there was interest about the potential of orris root to impede the activity of the stress hor- mone, cortisol, in skin [79]. Figure 9.

Cosmetics in Europe during the Renaissance and Modern Era The Renaissance was a cultural movement in Western Europe (born in Florence, Italy) resulting in a rebirth of the arts, sciences, and humanities. The Renaissance period (15th and 16th centuries) was a transition from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era, which began around 1500 AD. Keeping in mind the in fluence of the Roman Catholic Church on society during the Middle Ages, it is not surprising that the use of cosmetics, or more speci cally makeup, was frowned upon and often viewed as a de ance of God's natural creation. 8.1. Venetian Ceruse One of the hallmark cosmetic treatments of the Renaissance and early Modern Era was a concoction based on lead carbonate (2PbCO 3\u00b7Pb(OH) 2), which was applied to the face to give women a lighter appearance. Light skin symbolized youth and fertility. While this was not the rst time in history that such treatmen ts were applied to skin (the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese also us ed lead carbonate in cosmetics), it is the most notorious period probably due to its widespread use among the aristocracy and its display in artistic portraits [80]. Ceruse was typically prepared with water, vinegar, and lead carbonate. Venetian ceruse refers to a part icular type of ceruse that was of the highest quality, probably due to the purity of white lead. Queen Elizabeth I of England (see Figure 10) is probably one of the most well-known historical gures that used Venetian ceruse to whit en her face. As a child, she had small- pox, which in sixteenth-century Europe had a mortality rate of 30%, leaving her deeply scarred for life. For this reason, she used ceruse and other preparations, giving her an almost clown-like appearance. Maria Coventry, Countess of Coventry (1733-1760 AD) Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 14 of 31 and London society hostess, was another known gure during this period who was af- flicted with the negative consequences of usin g lead carbonate-based cosmetics. At the age of 28, the Countess of Coventry died from lead poisoning [81]. Often, the use of ceruse led to the formation of eruptions on the skin, which women tried to cover up by applying more ceruse, thereby creating a vicious cycle. Figure 10. Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I of England an d Ireland ca. 1588 AD by George Gower. The photograph by Ann Ronan Pictures was obta ined through a license agreement with Ge tty Images, Seattle, Washington, USA. Elizabet h I ruled from 1558 to 1603 AD and was the last monarch from the house of Tudor. The original painting is he ld at the National Portrait Gallery, London, UK. The symptoms of lead poisoning consist of abdominal pain, constipation, hearing loss, irritability, learning disorders, seizures , and vomiting. In a recent study, it was sug- gested that many post-Renaissance artists (e.g., Francisco Goya, Caravaggio, Michelan- gelo) were a icted by this disease, often referred to as saturnism, due to exposure to lead in paints [82]. Today, exposure to heavy metals in face paint is still a concern for Chinese opera actors [83]. 8.2. Cinnabar Queen Elizabeth I was also known for wearing lipstick containing cinnabar as well as applying cinnabar to the cheeks to obtain a rouge e ect. Cinnabar is a mercury sul de mineral (Figure 11). It is the most common ore used to obtain re ned elemental mercury. Overexposure to mercury leads to neurotoxicity, which a ects the body's nervous system. Cinnabar has been used in Traditional Chines e Medicine and Ayurveda for thousands of years; however, in today's health-conscious environment, there certainly are concerns about its toxicity [84]. Nowadays, some comme rcial color cosmetics (e.g., lipstick) brands use the word cinnabar as a description of the makeup color. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 15 of 31 Figure 11. Photograph of cinnabar illustrating its red color and dull luster. The photograph by Bjoern Wylezich was obtained thro ugh a license agreement with Shu tterstock, Inc., New York, USA. 8.3. Perfumed Gloves During the Elizabethan period (1558-1603 AD), perfumed gloves were also a popular item for members of the upper strata of the soci al scale. They were often hung on the belt as an indication of a woman's status. A recommended procedure for producing the per- fumed glove is as follows: aloes , and Acorus calamus to a mixture of angelica and rose water. Boil until half of the liquid vaporizes, then strain it. Immerse the gloves in the liquid and allow them to hang dry. Repeat this proce-dure two times [85]. Angelica ( Angelica archangelica ) is an herb, which, according to folklore, is named for the archangel Michael who appeared to a monk in his dream during one of the plagues in Europe. The angel le d the monk to the Angelica archangelica plant, which cured people with the disease. Angelica water is made by boiling the angelica root in water, while rose water is prepared by placing rose pe dals in boiling water. Cloves are flower buds from the tree Syzygium aromaticum , which is native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. Ambergris is a substance produced by the sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ). Much of the whale's diet consists of squid and cu ttlesh, which contain indigestible components. Over a long period of time, they form a solid mass known as ambergris, which is secreted by the whale. Used for millennia, ambergris is a rare and expensive ingredient that is highly sought after in the perfume market [86]. Musk has been used in perfumery for many years. It is the glandular secretion from several di erent species of animals (e.g., the musk deer, muskrat, etc.). Some plants (e.g., Angelica archangelica ) also produce compounds that have a characteristic musk smell. Nat- ural animal musk is no longer used due to ethical reasons; however, plant-based as well synthetic musk has been used in the fragrance industry. Lignum aloes (agarwood) come from the heartwood of Aquilaria trees that are native to Southeast Asia and have been used since antiquity in incense and perfumes [87]. The aroma of the essential oil is extremely sought after, especially in the Arab world, and is extremely expensive (agarwood is the most ex pensive wood in the world) [88]. Stress to the tree caused by a fungus induces the formation of the aroma. The aromatic and medic- inal properties of agarwood are th ought to arise from about 150 identi ed compounds that include sesquiterpenoids, chromones, and volatile aromatic compounds [89]. Acorus calamus (sweet is an herbaceous plant that contains psychoactive chemi- cals. If ingested, it can be toxic, which is why its commercial sale is banned in the United Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 16 of 31 States. Methyl isoeugenol and cyclohexanone are two major components of the essential oil, which has antimicrobial activity against a range of microorganisms including Propion- ibacterium acne [90]. 9. The Perfume Industry in France Perfumes played an almost essential role in most of the ancient civilizations [91]. Dur- ing the crusades, many scents were brought back to Europe from the Eastern Mediterra- nean. The crusades were a series of wars (ca. 1096-1291 AD) between the European Chris- tians and Muslims to take control of the Holy Land, located in modern-day Israel. In the Renaissance period, perfume was mostly worn by royalty and the upper echelon of society to mask body odor. During the reign of Louis XV (18th century AD), his court became known as la cour perfume due to their excessive use of perfume. Madame Pompadour (mis- tress of Louis XV), Marie Antoine tte (18th century AD; last queen of France before the French Revolution), and Duchesse d'Aumont (18th-19th century AD) are well-known g- ures in French history who were perfume enth usiasts. The nobility did not practice very good personal hygiene primarily due to their fear of water and the belief that most dis- eases were transmi tted through water. It is not surprising that France converted into the perfume capital of the world. As early as the 14th century, the cultivation of perfume-bearing plants began in the south of France [92]. Grasse, a small village just north of the French Riviera, became the center of the perfume industry. Some of the plant specie s harvested in the south of France consisted of 12 contains a photograph of a blooming lavender eld in Grasse, France. Figure 12. Field of lavender in Grasse, France.

Traditional Japanese Customs Cosmetics in Japan evolved from face painting (with red pigment) during the Kofun period (300-538 AD) to some of the most adva nced products in today's market. Early cos- metics in Japan (ca. 6th century AD) were in fluenced by China and Korea, which later transitioned into its own distinct form. Histor ical hallmarks of Japanese cosmetics include whitening the face, applying beni to the lips, and blackening the teeth\u2014treatments which provided an almost mask-like appearance [93]. The white powder applied to the face and known as oshiroi contained lead carbonate, with the same composition as ceruse, which was applied in Europe during the Renaissanc e and Modern era. Beni (lipstick) was for- mulated by making a pulp of the sa ower plant ( Carthamus tinctorius L.) and then extract- ing the red and yellow dyes. Beni was normally placed in small bowl and became red when moistened. Komachi beni\u2014made from pure high-quality sa ower\u2014dates as far back as the Edo period (1603-1867 AD) in Japan. Two principal dye components in the saower plant are carthamidin (yellow) and ca rthamin (red), whose molecular structures are provided in Figure 13 [94,95]. Carthamin is not soluble in water while carthamidin is water soluble. Nowadays, carthamin (Natural red 26) is used as a color additive in food and cosmetic products. The sa ower plant contains many molecules of pharmacological importance [96]. Figure 13. Molecular structures of ( a) carthamidin and ( b) carthamin, the yellow and red dye mole- cules, respectively, found in sa ower. Staining the teeth black (o-haguro) dates back thousands of years ago in Japan. Dark objects were considered beautiful in Japanese culture. Kanemizu solution was made by mixing ferric acetate (from iron lings) with vinegar and tannins (from tea or vegetables). Traditionally, tooth darkening indicated a person was at the beginning of adulthood. Later, aristocrats and nobles stained their teeth daily. These customs were also adopted by the geisha in which case a maiko would stain her teeth black when graduating to be- come a geisha. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 18 of 31 11. Body Art in Tribal Cultures Body art has been practiced by humans since prehistoric times and is still common among many indigenous and tribal cultures worldwide. It serves to express identity, pre- pare for ba ttle, attract the opposite sex (e.g., courtship), and perform rituals (honor the gods and other spiritual motives) among many other reasons. We will discuss body art that is still practiced today by societies in Africa and South America as well as provide some historical perspective of the body painting customs of indigenous tribes in North America and Mesoamerica. A variety of natural ingredients have been used to paint the body and face throughout history including se veral types of ochre, minerals, and botani- cal preparations. Typically, black, white, red, and yellow have been the principal colors used by most ancient and present-day tribal so cieties. Most of the ingredients used to ob- tain these colors require minimal processing (e.g., simple grinding to a powder) and are mixed with a binder material. 11.1. Body Painting by African Tribes Let us begin our journey in the African cont inent where the art of body painting is still in full force today. The text entitled Painted Bodies: African Body Painting, Ta ttoos, and Scari cation by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher is highly recommended for readers who wish to learn more about the body painting customs in Africa [97]. Beckwith and Fisher spent many years traveling across Africa photographically documenting the customs of many of its inhabitants. In the paragraphs that follow, we summarize some of their nd- ings in relation to the art of body painting. Chalk and red ochre are two of the most common ingredients used to adorn the skin. In many areas in Africa, they are easily obtained at riverbanks where they are exposed due to erosion. Both mate rials are ground into a ne powder and then mixed with either animal fat (e.g., to make an unguent) or wa ter (to make a paste). Chalk (limestone) is a soft, porous material composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Ochre is a natu- ral clay pigment that can range in color from yellow to orange, red, and violet. Ochres contain various types of iron oxides such as hematite and goethite as well as white ments quar tz, and calcium minerals) [98]. Red ochre has been one of the most used pigments worldwide throug hout history and contains the mineral hem- atite, which gives it is characteristic reddish hue [99]. In general, clays have been used to treat dermatological diseases, clean the skin , provide moisturization, and provide UV pro- tection [100,101]. The Surma and Karo tribes in Ethiopia are known for their use of chalk and red ochre in body paint. Chalk can be applied to the en tire body, and designs can be made using the ngers, providing a stark contrast with the dark skin of the subject. Alternatively, a natu- ral paintbrush can be used to apply the chalk, creating various pa tterns on the skin. Figure 14 contains a photograph of a Surma man with facial and body painting demonstrating the use of chalk. The Masai people in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania also use red ochre quite extensively. Every 7-12 years during the eunoto ceremony, young warriors paint themselves with red ochre to mark their tr ansition into elderhood. The Masai are re- nowned for the intense hue of their red ochre as compared to other African tribes. Herbs or plant extracts are often added to the red ochre formulation. The Himba people live in the northwest corner of Namibia (near the Namib desert) and are also renowned for their use of red ochr e in the form of paste called otjize, which contains red ochre, fat, herbs, and powdered bark. Similar to other indigenous societies, red ochre symbolizes blood. The Himba apply ot jize every day, which provides protection against the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun and the arid conditions of the desert. Figure 15 contains a photograph of a young Himba woman with otjize applied to the skin and hair giving it a reddish hue. The hair arrang ement is typical for Himba women styled into thick lustrous braids that symbolize their fertility. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 19 of 31 Figure 14.

The photograph by Jim Zuckerman was obtained by a license agreement with Alamy Ltd., Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK. The Wodaabe nomads in Niger make ta ttoos on their body by creating incisions and applying charcoal, which results in a bluish hue. Typically, these ta ttoos are situated near the mouth and eyes as it is believed that ev il spirits can enter the body though the ori ces. Mothers start ta ttooing their children as infants to prot ect them from the spirits. Interest- ingly, in the early 1990s, the body of \u00d6 tzi the Iceman (estimated to have lived ca. 3250 BC during the Copper Age) was found preserved in an Alpine glacier on the boarder of Aus- tria and Italy with approximately 61 ta ttoos in the form of lines and crosses also made with charcoal [102]. The ta ttoos appeared to be located along acupuncture and pressure points, suggesting that they were for therapeutic reasons and not for cosmetic adornment. Voodoo is a major religion in West Africa. During voodoo ceremonies, a white kaolin paste, ash, and palm oil are applied all over the body and represent a food o ering to the gods. Kaolinite (Al 2Si2O5(OH) 4) is the principal clay mineral found in kaolin, which has a white to gray characteristic color. In cent ral Africa, the Dinka me n from South Sudan ap- ply the ash from ca ttle dung res all over their body each night to provide protection against mosquitoes and other insects. They also bleach their hair with ca ttle urine. 11.2. Ingredients Used in Native American Body Art Native Americans have a deep-rooted tradition of adorning themselves with dyes and pigments. Face and body painting were conducted for a variety of reasons including battle (war paint), spiritual reasons, mourning, a ttracting the opposite sex, and many other motives. Each color had a meaning. For example, in many tribes, red was for war while white was for peace and purity. In some tribes, only men painted their skin, while in oth- ers, the women also painted themselves. Some tribes practiced body painting on special occasions for rituals while others applied pigments to their skin on a daily basis. The Plains Indians (indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairie) were partic-ularly known for painting themselves in relation to their achievements in ba ttle [103]. Much of what we know about the cosmetic painting customs of Native Americans comes from the work of George Catlin who painted portraits and provided a historical account of their customs and practices. The Native American tradition of body painting in North America was very diverse due to the number of di erent tribes spread across a large landscape. Today, the United States government recognizes 574 tribes in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. Like mainly places in the world, red ochre was a principal ingredient of the Native American palette. In many instances, it was applied over the entire body. For this reason, Caucasians who migrated from Europe probably mistakenly identi ed Native Americans as having red skin. Figure 16 provides an example of th e very subtle use of red ochre by a member of the Ojibbeway Nation. Some examples of pigments used by select ed Native American tribes, located in pre- sent day California, are provided in Table 4. While charcoal had various uses, in some Native American societies, a charcoal preparation was painted around the eyes and often- times even on the eyelids to prevent sun gl are from decreasing visibility and damaging the eye. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 21 of 31 Figure 16. Painting of Boy Chief, Ojibbeway (1843) by Geor ge Catlin held at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., USA.

Cosmetic Practices in South America and Mesoamerica In pre-Columbian America, archaeological evidence demonstrates that applying col- orants to the skin was a common practice in ma ny societies and civilizations that inhabited these lands. Cosmetics were used to decorate the dead for funerary rituals and to adorn the alive. Just like in many other societies in Africa, North America, Asia, and Australia, the people of South America and Mesoamerica utilized basic ingredients from the Earth for their painting rituals. For example, blac k hues were obtained from charcoal (burnt wood), charred bone (burnt animal bone), and manganese compounds (e.g., manganese oxide). On the other hand, white pigments typi cally came from natural earth clays (e.g., kaolin), limestone (one of the principal minerals is calcite, which is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3)), and gypsum (calcium sulfate). Red ochre and its derivatives provided reddish Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 22 of 31 hues to the South American and Mesoamerican pale tte. Body painting in the Americas was also accomplished with botanical ingredients. Table 5 provides a list of several ingredients that were popular in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Carmine is a bright red dye that is obtained by extracting carminic acid from the cochineal insect and mixing with aluminum or calcium salts. Nowadays, carmine (also known as C.I. Natural red 4 or C.I. 75470) is a popular dye ingredient in cosmetics and food products (see Figure 17). It can be found in color cosmetic preparations, such as lipstick and some selected foundations. Carminic acid itself is a dye as well as several of its derivatives such as carmine. In the wester n hemisphere, carminic acid is obtained from the Dactylopius coccus species of cochineal. However, carminic acid can also be obtained from the Porphyrophora hamelii (Armenia) and Porphyrophora polonica (north-central Eu- rope) species. Table 5. Selected list of some botanical ingredients used in Mesoamerica as skin colorants [105].

Palo de campeche (Haemoto- xylum campechianum ) Dye is obtained from the heartwood of the tree Black dye Figure 17. Molecular structure of carminic acid (Natural red 4; C.I. 75470). The achiote shrub, sometimes referred to as the lipstick tree, produces a hairy fruit (similar in appearance to the lychee) that contains seed pods. Red body paint can be made by grinding the seeds into a paste producin g a red-orange color substance called anna tto. Today, anna tto is used in food products, cosmetic s, and pharmaceuticals. Bixin (an apo- caretonoid) is the principal ingredient providing anna tto with its characteristic color (see Figure 18). Figure 18. Molecular structure of bixin, the primary apocarotenoid found in anna tto. Boiled extracts of mealy bugs, Coccus axin , had many applications in traditional an- cient Mexican culture including ointment, lacquer, and perfume. It was applied to skin as a treatment for ailments and burns as well as an anti-in flammatory agent [106]. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 23 of 31 Finally, the last item in Table 5 is palo de campeche, a member of the legume family, which is also known as the blackwood, longwood, or bloodwood tree. A black dye, ob- tained from the red heartwood, was traditionally used as face paint in Mesoamerican tribes. Later, the Europeans used it as a textile dye in the 17th-19th centuries. The Kayap\u00f3 are a tribe known for their body art skills from the Amazonian region of Brazil. In recent years, the Kayap\u00f3 people ha ve been protagonists in Brazil's struggle with balancing economic development and protecting the Amazon Forest. Much debate arose during the construction of the Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River, which was completed in 2019. Typically, women and children of Kayap\u00f3 society paint themselves with pa tterns that demonstrate their harmony with the insects an d bees\u2014a belief that stems from their an- cestral heritage. Figure 19 co ntains a photograph of seve ral young Kayap\u00f3 women where one can observe such pa tterns. Typical ingredients used by the Kayap\u00f3 as body paint in- clude crushed seeds from the achiote shrub (red hues), liquid from the Genipa americana fruit (black color), and charcoal (dark hues). Interestingly, the liquid obtained from the Genipa americana fruit becomes black upon oxidation. After application to the skin, it re- mains in the upper levels of the epidermis for a couple of weeks. Figure 19. Group of young women from the Kayap\u00f3 tribe in Brazil.

Cosmetic Traditions in Oceania Rich in tradition and rituals, tribal societ ies in the Oceania region often use pigments to color their bodies and faces. In addition, animal and plant derived raw materials are commonly employed for cutaneous remedies. Ma ny of the present-day practices of skin care and body painting by the indigenous population of Ocea nia have a long history. Oce- ania is typically categorized by anthropologists as containing four regions: Aus- tralasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. In modern-day Australia, the two principal indigenous groups (those people whose herita ge precedes the era of British colonization) are the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Aboriginals predominantly live Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 24 of 31 in mainland Australia, while the Torres Straig ht Islanders, who are Melanesian, hail from the sea region between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. Tribes in Melanesia (i.e., New Guinea and surrounding areas) are well known for utilizing body paint and ta ttoos to reinvent their body and express their emotions as well as their social status. Red ochre or white clay are the most common colorants, although plant-based pigments are also employed. Functi onal skin care cosmetics have also been developed. In the Asaro and Jale skin renewal, Betel (Piper betle ) leaf extract is often combined with eucalyptus leaves. As a hydrating treat- ment, a formula containing boiled sago palm ( Metroxylon sagu ) leaves, which generate a creamy with macerated pandan ( and Asmat tribes, it is interesting to note the use of a combination of mangroves, rhus, and acacia tree bark derived powders as astringents to reduce and ab- sorb sebum in oily skin. In New Zealand, facial ta ttoos are one of the most distinct traits of the M ori tribes, but functional cosmetics using indigenous plants are also a common practice. K mara tubers (a New Zealand Sweet Potato) are cooked in water to create a creamy texture that, when applied on the face, provides smoother and softer skin. As a hydrating formula, a combination of ground fern leaves with beech fruits (the seed oil is known to have anti- wrinkle properties) is used. Eucalyptus leaf and Helichrysum flower extracts are also often used as cutaneous remedies. Australian Aboriginals from the coastal Yulengor tribes do not ta ttoo themselves but color their entire bodies using red or white ochre as well as white clay. The colors are often associated with speci c ceremonies (see Figure 20). Give n the high sun exposure in Aus- tralia, dry skin is very common. Therefore, formulations are prepared to address dryness by using tubers from di erent plants from the jungle, while astringent preparation is de- rived from eucalyptus and acacia bark. Preparations based on eucalyptus and white/red cedar leaves are used for wound healing. Figure 20. Aboriginal man wearing white body paint an d playing the digeridoo.

Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 25 of 31 Tribes from the Fiji Islands in Melanesia have the tradition to drink crushed kava (Piper methysticum ) roots strained in water during gatherings. The drink induces a state of euphoria, since kava root contains kavalact ones, which are associated with its psycho- tropic eects. Interestingly, kava roots have been used in cosmetic preparations, often in combination with the dried bark of wild hibiscus (Fiji's most common flower) for skin regeneration. A composition of dried frangipani-like flowers (local name ceviga) added to warm coconut oil can be used to condition hair and as a body and face lotion. Mono\u00ef oil is one of the most common cosmetic ingredients of the Tahitian tribes in Polynesia and is used predominantly to enhance the shine and gloss of hair as well as moisturize the skin and protect it from the su n. The petals of Tahitian gardenias (tiar\u00e9 flowers) are allowed to soak in coconut oil, in direct sunlight, for approximately three weeks to produce the popular mono\u00ef oil. To combat dry skin, inland tribes use a mask composition based on macerated leaves of the mountain fern ( Gleichenia used topical applica- tions. To treat pimples and skin mixture of banana and manioca paste\u2014can be applied to the skin. Tribal societies from Bora Bora and Morrea have made bark decoctions with giant taro ( Alocasia macrorryza ), also known as ape, for dermatosis and to combat skin aging. Information in this section was garnered fr om a previously published source [107]. 12. Urotherapy in Folklore Medicine Urine therapy dates to antiquity. It is believed to have originated in India and later practiced by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans [108]. Its use continued in the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance period. Urin e predominately consists of water (95% (<1%). Figure 21 contains the molecular structure of urea. Interestingly, urea is one of the components of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) of skin. It is used as a moisturi skin with urea provides moistur- ization at concentrations less than 10% ( w/w) and acts as a greater than 10% ( Figure 21. Molecular structure of urea. Urine-based therapeutics have played an important role in Spanish folklore medi- cine. It is prescribed to treat various skin diseases such as eczema, chloasma, and alopecia in addition to its role as a therapeutic for burns, chapped skin, wounds, and venomous bites [111]. In recent years, urotherapy (or pee facials) has become increasingly popular [112]. 13. Essential Oils Essential oils are present in flowers, leaves, stems, roots, seeds, barks, resins, and fruit rinds and often provide them with their fragrant odors [113]. They are volatile substances that are obtained by distillation of the plant. Essential oils have been used in medicine, pharmacology, and cosmetics for centuries due to their antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-fungal properties [114]. They are rich in antioxidants and usually contain terpenes and terpenoids as well as a variety of phenolic compounds [115]. The use of essential oils for their medicinal properties is known as aromatherapy. The bene ts of essential oils for the skin have been known for quite some time. For example, chamomile essential oil has been used for centuries as an anti-in flammatory Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 26 of 31 agent and for the treatment of eczema and dermatitis [116]. As another example, the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of tea tr ee oil protects against bacterial, viral, fun- gal, and protozoal infections of the skin [117]. There are many cases in the literature high- lighting the bene cial eects that essential oils provide to the skin [118,119]. Due to the properties of essential oils already discussed, they also o er promise as wound healing agents [120]. There have been a signi cant number of studies investigating the permeation-en- hancing properties of essential oils for the tr ansdermal delivery of drugs and other agents [121]. It is believed that essential oils func tion as good permeation enhancers due to their ability to compromise the lipid phase of th e stratum corneum due to interactions they have with stratum corneum proteins that might undergo conformational changes and weaken the skin's barrier properties. While many essential oils have been found to be ef- fective permeation enhancers, it is not certain to what extent this was ever really put into commercial practice in the dermatological world. Essential oils have also been reported for insect repellent activity [122,123]. The plant families most cited as having insect repellent properties are Cymbopogon spp presence of such as citronellal, citronellol, and thymol has been noted [124]. Figure 22. Molecular structures of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes found in some essential oils, which citronellol, and (e) thymol. 14. Natural Ingredients in the Information Age The late 20th and early 21st century have witnessed an explosion of activity in the cosmetic industry regarding the development of sustainable products based on natural ingredients [125-131]. This movement began with products based on naturally derived polysaccharides from cellulose, guar gum, starch, and many other ingredients. These are functional biopolymers in the form ulation that serve as rheology modi ers, binding agents, emulsi ers, and lm formers. In more recent years, great e orts were made in the skin care active ingredient arena. This falls under the realm of cosmeceuticals and typically involves the intervention of peptides and botanical ingredients in the viable epidermis and dermis. Successful treat-ments ultimately lead to improvements in the reduction of skin aging or improvements in skin whitening and skin hydration. Cosmetics 2023 , 10, 71 27 of 31 Antioxidants found in botanical ingredients has also been a vast area of skin care technology that has greatly advanced in the la st two decades [132]. Today, almost every skin care formulation contains some form of an tioxidant, either to be delivered to the skin so that it can biochemically exert its action or to help prevent oxidation in the cosmetic formula. Consumer products companies in the personal care industry are under increasing pressure to develop sustainable products that do not harm the environment. As a result, product development programs increasingly re quire that a large percentage of the for- mula's ingredients come from natural sources. However, there are many challenges when trying to meet the same level of e cacy that is provided by conventional ingredients. There is still a lot of activity in the person al care product development arena in the quest to develop green preservatives, surfactants, hair styling agents, sunscreens, and many other ingredients. 15. Understanding the Safety of Natura l Ingredients in Modern-Day Cosmetics In recent years, there has been some concern about the toxicity of natural ingredients in personal care products [133,134]. Many of today's product labels contain claims that the product is free of parabens, sulfates, PEGs, silicones, phthalates, and a growing list of chemicals that have become blacklisted in cosmetics. However, much less a ttention has been given to the potential toxicity of natural ingredients. A major conc ern is that labeling requirements of personal care products does not guarantee that a consumer will be aware of potentially hazardous ingredients. For exam ple, many plant oils contain limonene, cit- ral, citronellol, linalool, and other fragrance allergens. According to INCI requirements, only the Latin name of the botanical extract should appear on the label, which provides no indication of individual molecules that might create a hazardous condition. In addition, there is also concern that the harvesting and use of toxic natural ingredi- ents in personal care products can lead to contamination of our waterways, ultimately leading to human exposure [135]. For example, in a grassland eld, it was shown that isoflavone production (phytoestrogens) can reach up to 220 kg per hectare per year [136]. The harvesting of an increasing number and variety of plants for use in cosmetics could likely result in elevated levels of some toxic natural compounds, which could contaminate our waterways and soil. In addition, cosmetic ingredients that are washed from our skin and hair during showering and bathing could also accumulate in our waterways. 16. Concluding Remarks The natural ingredients movement in cosmetics and personal care are revolutioniz- ing the cosmetic industry. Looking back to distant times provides us with insight of some of the ingredients still in use today. It also makes us keenly aware of the need to conduct rigorous e cacy and toxicological testing. Not all natural ingredients are necessarily safe. In any event, we hope you enjoyed this journey to near and distant lands and have gained an appreciation for the sophistication of pa st and present-day cosmetic technological in- novations.
