Teething can be a stressful time for all and lead to parents scouring the internet to find a way to combat the teething blues. As the name suggests, teething is the process of a child's teeth growing through the gums. This can make even the happiest baby a little fussy and cranky. We have provided some natural teething remedies that will help to ease the pain for your child while keeping them safe from harmful substances. Signs and symptoms of teething Teething can occur in children anywhere between 4 months old to the age of 2, and during this time your baby may become fussy and irritable as their new teeth begin to emerge. Every child handles teething symptoms differently. Some children may experience little to no symptoms while others may display the following: - Decreased appetite - Drooling - Gnawing or chewing on things around them - Irritability - Red and swollen gums Always confirm with your child's pediatrician which remedies are safe to use with your child before trying a remedy. Natural Remedies Breastmilk Freezing breast milk into ice cubes can help calm your child's sore gums. Pour the breastmilk into an ice cube tray and freeze. Once frozen, smash up the ice cubes into smaller bites and offer them in a teething mesh or baby feeder. Nursing can also offer some relief as the sucking action may relieve pressure on your baby's gums. Chamomile tea has wonderful properties ideal for reducing the stress and fussiness of teething. Mothers can drink this caffeine-free tea and pass the benefits of the tea along to the baby as well! Cool or frozen items Cold or frozen foods such as carrots, bananas, or apples can be safe items for your baby to gum or gnaw on. Foods should be monitored and given in a mesh or silicone teether to prevent larger pieces from getting into your baby's mouth. A slightly frozen washcloth is a favorite of many parents. Soak a clean washcloth in water or diluted caffeine-free chamomile tea and freeze it for several minutes. When your baby is showing signs of teething, feel free to offer them the cold cloth to chew on. This can help decrease inflammation and provide a soothing effect. Massage As your baby's teeth emerge, tension can build up along the jaw creating pain that travels from their mouth up to their ears. Giving your baby a gentle facial massage can help reduce pain and irritation often caused by teething. Begin by massaging with the pads of your fingertips along your baby's chin or above the top lip. Slowly move your hands to their cheeks and begin to move your fingers in a circular motion. Moving your fingers higher, draw the pads of your thumbs gently across your baby's eyebrows to remove tension. This is a great teething remedy that reduces teething symptoms, calms your baby, and is also an excellent bonding opportunity. Teething toys or rings Using a safe non-toxic teething ring or toy is a great choice for a teething remedy that allows your baby to chew and relieve pressure. Silicone or rubber are safe choices. Another option can be a wooden teether, but be sure to use a brand that uses water-based sealants and be aware that some may need to be oiled before use. For teething toys that can be placed in the freezer or refrigerator, select one that is filled with water in case a seam breaks or a hole develops. Using a clean finger Last but not least, one of the best and oldest of natural [teething remedies](https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/natural-teething-remedies) is using a clean finger! Rubbing your finger across your child's sore gums or allowing them to chew on your finger can help relieve tension and pain.

After approval, try some of these natural teething remedies to help alleviate your child's symptoms and pain.
