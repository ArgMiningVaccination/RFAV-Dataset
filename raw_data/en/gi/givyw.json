Regular physical activity not only improves general health but also can positively impact asthma outcomes, such as control and quality of life. Despite this, many asthma patients do not engage in regular physical activity because they mistakenly believe thatthey should restrict exercise participation. Health care providers have an opportunity to in fluence the physical activity levels of their patients during regular of ce visits. Nonetheless, health care providers often overlook physical activity counseling as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy in asthma patients, and in particular, overlook physical activity counseling. Some providerswho acknowledge the bene ts of physical activity report beingunaware how to approach a conversation with patients about this topic. To address these issues, members of the Sports, Exercise, and Fitness Committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) performed a focusedliterature search to identify and evaluate the effects of physical activity in patients with asthma. The purpose of this report is to summarize the evidence for physical activity 's impact on asthma patients 'disease control, pulmonary function, and overall well- being. Several subpopulations of patients with asthma, including children, adolescents, and older adults, are consideredindividually. In addition, this report offers practical recommendations for clinicians, including how to identify and overcome barriers to counseling, and methods to incorporatephysical activity counseling into asthma treatmentpractice. /C2112021 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & 80% of U.S. adults and adolescents are insufciently active.1Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better.1It also reduces the risk of many chronic diseases, including asthma.1,2Physical activity is de ned as any bodily movement generated by the skeletal muscles that results in en- ergy expenditure. Individuals with asthma may be particularly atrisk for being physically inactive, owing to the fear of provoking exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Although effective therapies (both pharmacological and nonpharmacological) areavailable to manage asthma symptoms and EIB, individuals with asthma may avoid or limit their physical activity in order toaDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Ill bDivision of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Med- icine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn cLake Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, Tavares, Fla dOklahoma Allergy and Asthma Clinic, Oklahoma City, Okla, and Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies, Washington, DC eBernstein Allergy Group, Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio fDivision of Immunology/Allergy Section, Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio gAsthma and Allergy Center, Lewisville and Flower Mound, Texas hDivision of Allergy and Immunology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas No funding has been received for this study.

Recent systematic re-views of physical activity levels in adults with asthma found lower levels of physical activity compared with controls (meta-analysis sample n \u00bc32,606). 4,5Sex and age contribute to differences in physical activity levels among individuals with asthma. Olderadults with asthma had lower levels of physical activity, 6whereas some studies found children and younger adults with asthma to have equal or even higher levels of physical activity than incontrols. 2,7-9Females had lower levels of physical activity than males and exercise-avoidance behavior appeared at a younger age in women than in men with asthma.6,10Although sex and age differences in physical activity are also seen in the general population, the fact that the discrepancy among asthma patients occurs earlier may suggest a greater impact on overallhealth. Much of the existing research in this area is in people with mild-to-moderate asthma. Of the few studies in the severeasthma population, Cordova-Rivera et al 11found adults with severe asthma had signi cantly lower daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity compared with controls. Similar ndings of reduced physical activity have been found in children with severe asthma.9,12 This work group report highlights the importance of physical activity to asthma patients as well as the barriers patients face,with an ultimate aim of providing suggestions for practicing clinicians on how to approach physical activity when counseling individuals with asthma. WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN ASTHMA PATIENTS? Children and adolescents Children and adolescents bene t from physical activity.13 These bene ts are so great, and carry such low overall costs and risks, that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for decades has set exercise recommendations for chil- dren. Multiple studies have shown that children who exercise ona regular basis have a lower risk of depression, 14improved life- time bone health,15lower risk of obesity and hypertension,16 decreased insulin resistance,17and improved lung function.18,19 These bene ts expand in children with chronic diseases including asthma. Several asthma-speci c bene ts have been demonstrated including reduced hospitalizations, reduced school absenteeism, fewer primary care provider visits, reduced rescuemedication usage, and a general improvement in ability to manage asthma. 13,20,21 At baseline, children with asthma have lower exercise tolerance to both aerobic and anaerobic exercise than their peers without asthma.22,23There are multiple reasons for this including con- cerns about the safety of the activity, poor baseline asthmacontrol, and exacerbation of symptoms by physical activityitself. 20,24,25It is known that prolonged inactivity can lead to breathlessness when activity is resumed, even in those without asthma. This exercise fatigue may lead to further inactivity, thus worsening the child 's deconditioned state.26,27Nonetheless, children with asthma have shown themselves able to subse- quently improve their tness and their asthma control. Studies evaluating asthma control in children have considered a variety of primary outcomes from symptom control to aerobic capacity to lung function. One review speci cally considered the nocturnal bene ts for children with asthma.28This analysis evaluated 5 studies and concluded that 6 weeks of twice-weekly exercise was associated with reduced nocturnal wheezing. Further, a more intensive regimen of supervised aerobic activityfor 8 weeks can both alleviate nocturnal symptoms and improveaerobic tness. 29-32 A 2013 Cochrane review evaluated 8 studies of swim training for children with stable asthma, from mild to severe.33The in- terventions involved 30 minutes of swimming 2 to 6 times a week for 6 to 12 weeks. The outcomes most commonly evalu- ated were aerobic capacity, asthma exacerbations, asthma control,or corticosteroid use. Interestingly, this review found swimming was associated with an improvement in lung function (demon- strated by increased forced expiratory volume in1 second [FEV 1], forced vital capacity [FVC], forced 25% e 75% of FVC). The FEV 1improved by 100 mL, near the effect seen with daily inhaled fluticasone proprionate 100 mg. How- ever, this nding may be an outlier because the majority of physical activity interventions in children with asthma have not yielded signi cant improvement in lung function measure- ments.34,35Although the effects of physical activity on lung function are mixed, the positive effect on cardiovascular tness is more de nitive. The degree of improvement in cardiovascular tness measures has been as high as 25% when compared with asthmatic control subjects.32,36-40The variable degree of improvement may be due to nuances within the physical activity interventions, such as intensity and duration. Participants withthe greatest improvement had longer training sessions severaltimes per week. 34 Also, multiple studies speci cally evaluated quality of life and exercise training in children with asthma.31,41,42Finally, other studies have found exercise is associated with a reduction in the need for medications, fewer emergency department visits, and less absenteeism from school.25,43Although 1 large study did not, this was attributed to a population with relatively strong baseline asthma control.44Across the board, physical activity appears to improve quality of life, lung function, cardiovasculartness, and depression in children with asthma. Adults The most recent Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, recommends regular physical activity for adults withchronic health conditions and disabilities because it can provide physical and cognitive bene ts. 1Ideally, the physical activity should be moderate-to-vigorous because substantial health ben-ets are seen at these levels of physical activity, but reducing sedentary time and increasing physical activity at any level may also yield health bene ts. 1Speci cally in asthma, observational and cross-sectional studies have found individuals who engage in regular physical activity had fewer asthma exacerbations, improved disease control and an improvement in lung function(peak expiratory flow and FEV activity.4These ndings have spurred an interest in randomized controlled studies to assess physical activity as a treatment for asthma in adults. Evidence from a number of randomized controlled studies has revealed positive effects of physical activity on physiological and psychological outcomes. The majority of studies conducted focus on the moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise. ACochrane review of aerobic training in asthma showed a signif- icant improvement in maximum oxygen uptake but no other metrics of lung function (peak expiratory flow, FEV 1, or FVC).35 Since the Cochrane review was published, 2 studies47,48found improvements in lung function (FEV 1, FVC) with only 1 showing clinical signi cance47,49(/C2120% change). A recent meta- analysis of aerobic exercise training in adults with asthma foundFEV 1slightly increased with a standard mean difference of e0.36 (e0.72 to 0.00) in favor of aerobic exercise training.50 Other effects of the physical activity interventions were an improvement in asthma symptoms and cardiopulmonary tness (measured by maximum oxygen uptake), and a trend toward improved quality of life and reduced airway in flammation (measured by sputum eosinophil counts and fractional exhaled nitric oxide).28,35,48,51,52One study compared breathing exer- cises plus aerobic activity versus breathing exercise alone in adultswith asthma found that, in addition to increasing the number ofsymptom-free days, aerobic exercise was signi cantly associated with lower psychosocial stress. 53Further, physical training was well tolerated in adults with asthma, with no signi cant adverse effects identi ed.35 The physical activity interventions that were studied ranged from running, cycling, swimming, high-intensity intervaltraining, walking, and gymnasti cs. All of these were shown to be safe and to improve asthma outcomes, suggesting that the de- cision to pursue physical activity is more important than themodality chosen. However, swimming has often been the rec- ommended exercise for patients with asthma owing to prom- ising results from observational studies. 54,55A 2013 Cochrane review found that swimming training had a meaningful effecton asthma outcomes and patients 'exercise capacity, while noting that no signi cant differences could be established when comparing swimming with other physical activities. 35Further study is needed to determine the relative ef cacy of exercise modalities. We should note tha t exposure to pool chemicals is also associated with asthma exacerbations and has been shownto increase airway eosinophil and mast cell counts. 56The Cochrane review acknowledged this effect but noted there were insufcient studies comparing chlorinated and nonchlorinated pools. Asthma patients interested in swimming may need to be cautiously monitored for chemical-induced exacerbations. In addition to controller asthma me dications, premedicating with an inhaled mast cell-stabilizing agent may be an option for thesepatients. 57 In summary, physical activity is well tolerated in adults with asthma of any severity as in children with asthma. Regular aer-obic physical activity can improve asthma outcomes including asthma symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and cardio- pulmonary tness. Physical activity should be considered as a nonpharmacological add-on treatment in adults with asthma. One limitation of the existing literature is much of it has focused on moderate-to-vigorous levels of aerobic physical activity, whichmost Americans do not achieve. 1Three studies have focused on lifestyle physical activity (eg, walking) and all foundimprovements in disease control and quality of life.58-60Addi- tional studies are needed that focus on the impact of lifestyle physical activity and reduced sedentary time on asthma outcomes.61 BARRIERS TO EXERCISE IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA ( TABLE I ) Children and adolescents International guidelines encourage physical activity in in- dividuals with asthma; however, unique barriers to physical ac- tivity may be present in children and adolescents.62,63 Disease-related barriers. Children and adolescents with asthma face many added challenges at school, including embar- rassment because of their disease, feeling different from their peers, and bullying.64Physical activity can exacerbate asthma symptoms and can negatively in fluence motivation and partici- pation in extracurricular activities.65Uncontrolled asthma has the potential to impact children 's social interactions, academic progress, and self-con dence. Children, adolescents, and their parents or caregivers may perceive asthma as a rm barrier to physical activity or sports. Negative experiences, including fear of being excluded or isolated from group physical activities, have ledto children avoiding participation in activities they otherwise would have been interested in pursuing. 66 Fear of physical activities exacerbating asthma may lead par- ents to enforce unnecessary limitations. Indeed, parental beliefs about asthma triggers have been shown to predict lower activity levels in children and adolescents with asthma.24Some parents or caregivers intentionally reduce activity in children as a strategy to avoid asthma exacerbation. In a cross-sectional study, 37% of mothers acknowledged restricting their children 's physical ac- tivity. Nearly the same proportion of surveyed mothers believedexercise is dangerous for children with asthma. 67 School personnel. Inadequate asthma management in schools may be a signi cant barrier to children 's participation in school-based physical activity. In the setting of urban elementary education, 1 study found limited teacher knowledge aboutasthma and asthma management, especially among those whosestudents have intermittent manifestations of asthma. 68In addi- tion, communication between school personnel, students, and parents was observed to be lacking. In a qualitative interview study of 23 inner-city minority children with asthma, aged 8 to 10 years, a majority of students (17 of 23) admitted experiencing asthma symptoms while per-forming any physical activity during the school day. 64All stu- dents were either unaware or did not adhere to a formal asthma action plan. Furthermore, there was lack of accessible medicationand a perceived stigma around publicly administering asthmamedication before physical activity. Physical education teachers and coaches play a crucial role in management of asthma and as motivators for participation inphysical activities and sports. A qualitative study examined the perspective of physical education teachers on in-school asthma management and barriers to physical activity for children withasthma attending urban elementary schools. 69The study revealed that physical education teachers may have a lack of knowledge about the disease, which could lead to delayed identi cation of asthma symptoms, underestimation of the severity ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 10, NUMBER 2NYENHUIS ET AL 435situation, ineffective treatment, and inadequate exercise levels in students with asthma. Children with asthma need encouragement and reminders to administer appropriate medications prior to physical activity andwhen symptoms present during physical activity. Having well- dened asthma management plans and trained school personnel are effective ways for schools to help children andadolescents with asthma participate in physical activity. Physical education teachers and coaches must encourage safe physical activity and be familiar with asthma action plans. 63The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute developed recommendations on the roles and responsibilities for physical education teachers for asthma management, including a guide to enabling fullparticipation for students with asthma. Incorporating asthmaeducation into the health curriculum at school can increase asthma awareness and promote physical activity for children and adolescents with asthma. 63 Obesity. Obesity represents an indirect barrier to exercise in children and adolescents with asthma. In a cyclical manner, physical activity deterred by asthma symptoms predisposes chil-dren and adolescents with asthma to weight gain. 70Obesity is associated with increased asthma severity, poor asthma control, and impaired quality of life.71,72Furthermore, the combination of obesity and physical inactivity is associated with uncontrolledasthma and decreased response to therapy. 73This same combi- nation can increase airway in flammation and lead to further exercise avoidance in the obese child with asthma. Physical ac-tivity in obese and overweight children with asthma is known to contribute to reduced body mass index and improvements in tness as measured by maximal oxygen uptake, lung function, and quality of life. 74 Nonadherence. Nonadherence to asthma management is a widely reported barrier to achieving and maintaining asthmacontrol. Uncontrolled asthma is, in turn, a frequently reported barrier to physical activity. Despite evidence supporting the safety and ef cacy of controller medications in prevention of uncontrolled asthma, adherence to asthma treatment regimens inchildren and adolescents is below 50%. 75A systematic review found the mean level of inhaled corticosteroid adherence ranged from 22% to 63% and poor adherence was responsible for 24%and 60% of exacerbations and asthma-related hospitalizations, respectively. 76 Poor adherence is often dif cult to detect and can be over- looked in clinical practice, leading to an inappropriate titration of asthma medications. Although there is no consensus approach to achieving adherence in children and adolescents with asthma,barriers must be identi ed and treatment strategies adjusted to promote adherence. Understanding the barriers to exercise in children and ado- lescents with asthma is crucial when implementing a successfulphysical activity program that improves health outcomes. Unless baseline asthma control is poor, exercise intolerance should not be a limiting factor among children and adolescents with asthma. Adults Disease-related. Similar to children and adolescents, many adults with asthma avoid or limit physical activity. A negative association between exercise and asthma has been propagated formany years due to misunderstandings about EIB. 77Althoughthere are several studies examining the barriers to exercise among children and adolescents with asthma, few studies have examined the barriers to physical activity among adults with asthma. A small survey examined barriers to physical activity among 60men and women with asthma. 78The study identi ed concerns for physical activity triggering asthma, but extreme weather or air-quality triggers and an overall lack of knowledge regarding thebenets of physical activity were also cited as barriers. 78In addition, negative perceptions of physical activity were found in patients with less asthma knowledge and self-direction.78 Another study evaluated barriers to physical activity among ur- ban African American women with asthma. Whereas commonly cited barriers to engaging in physical activity were found (eg,time, nonenjoyment), 2 asthma-speci c barriers were identi ed: fear related to past personal experiences with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and a lack of community with others living with asthma. 79These were in addition to numerous other barriers urban African American women face, such as social and culturally based preferences for hair and body type, neighbor- hood characteristics (violence, walkability), family or caregiverresponsibilities, and few role models. 80-82Additional studies in identifying barriers to physical activity among adults with asthma are needed. Comorbid conditions. An estimated 45% of all Americans, or roughly 150 million individuals, suffer from at least 1 chronic disease, and the number is growing.83Chronic diseases such as obesity and arthritis and overlap with chronic obstructive pul- monary disease may pose a barrier to physical activity in adults with asthma.84,85These conditions can result in reduced exercise tolerance and/or mobility, which can lead to, or exacerbate,obesity. As described previously, obesity is associated with greater asthma severity and poorer asthma outcomes. 86 DISCUSSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH PATIENTS Despite the known bene ts of exercise in asthma patients, there remain gaps in physician knowledge of exercise recom- mendations and counseling behaviors. A 2019 national survey of U.S. and Canadian allergy/immunology and pulmonology phy-sicians revealed that, whereas 92% believe exercise should be acomponent of asthma management, only 69% regularly perform exercise counseling. 87One respondent commented that, whereas exercise is \"probably the most important [recommendation] \"for asthma patients, lack of time presents a barrier to counseling. A lack of con dence in discussing exercise with patients was also noted among survey respondents: 26% described having noknowledge or very little knowledge on exercise counseling, whereas only 9% felt that they were very knowledgeable about encouraging patients to exercise. Eighty percent of physicianssurveyed reported that they were unaware of exercise guidelinesfor asthma patients (unpublished data, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology). These results are consistent with those of a global survey distributed by the World AllergyOrganization to asthma providers, 88in which less than half (46%) of respondents considered themselves to have suf cient knowledge to advise asthma patients about physical activity and95.5% responded that doctors need more training in preventive care, including expanded knowledge around physical activity. With the arrival of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic, emphasizing exercise to all patients inJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT FEBRUARY 2022436 NYENHUIS ET ALan allergy and immunology practice, including those with asthma, is paramount.89Physical activity can help improve mental as well as physical well-being.89 Because no 2 asthma patients are identical, successful man- agement of asthma requires a personalized approach. Accord- ingly, the discussion of exercise with an asthma patient or caregiver should start with an individual assessment. The pro-vider may begin by evaluating the patient 's beliefs about exercise, readiness to discuss physical activity, and con dence in his or her exercise abilities. Combining motivational interviewing tech-niques with the transtheoretical model of change (TTM) offers 1framework for evaluation. 90The provider begins by recognizing the patient 's autonomy and listening actively while withholding judgment. The TTM outlines 4 stages a patient may fall intoduring the initial visit: precontemplation, contemplation, prep- aration, and action. A full elaboration of these stages is beyond the scope of this report; however, to illustrate 1 example, a pa-tient who has not previously attempted exercise for personal asthma management would be in the precontemplation stage. 90 When a patient 's TTM stage is assessed, recommendations may be tailored appropriately. Some providers who use this model may nd additional value in quantifying a patient 's level of motivation using a validated 1 to 5 scale.91 The remainder of the assessment aims to identify patient factors that may be used to guide individualized recommenda- tions. These include the patient 's asthma knowledge, current physical activity level, social support, material resources, andestimated free time. The provider will also want to take note of the patient 's age group, asthma severity, and medication adher- ence level at this time. Finally, and most importantly, the pa-tient 's general health including nonasthma medical history should be considered. It is worth reemphasizing here that certain subpopulations of asthma patients may have unique needs related to exercisecounseling. Parents of young children may not be aware when their child is intentionally avoiding physical activity owing to perceived limitations from asthma. 92These parents may bene t from education about exercise safety in children with asthma.Adolescents and teenagers perceive a stigma around discussing asthma and feel ashamed, for instance, to use their medication in public prior to exercise. 93However, patients in this age group may be encouraged by the idea of using exercise to take control of their asthma and assert their independence from caregivers.94 Older adults may have, in addition to medical comorbidities, mechanical limitations on exercise intensity.1The older adult with asthma should be encouraged to be as active as their body allows and be reminded that quality of life even at advanced age is improved by increasing exercise and decreasing sedentary be-haviors. 95Adult patients with highly restricted time owing to personal or professional obligations may be counseled that 75 minutes of more vigorous physical activity per week is believed tobe comparable with the 150 minutes at moderate intensity currently recommended by professional guidelines. 96 High-intensity interval training is another option for this group. Asthma patients, especially adults, may have other chronic medical conditions that should be addressed before exercise recommendations are made. The Physical Activity and ReadinessQuestionnaire is a screening instrument designed to identifypatients with serious comorbidities. 96Patients who score highly on this questionnaire should be referred to a specialist (such as a cardiologist in the case of coronary artery disease) prior to beingcleared for strenuous exercise. In patients who are physically unt, providers can consider referral to a pulmonary rehabilita- tion program or supervised exercise in a gym to start a gradualregimen. Providers with limited of ce time may nd alternative ways to incorporate discussion of physical activity. For example, physicalactivity habits may be inquired about as part of the social historyTABLE I.

Any physical activity tracking information the patient provides, including from their ownwearable technology, can be copied into the vital signs section of the physical examination. The Of ce of Disease Prevention and Health promotion has tools to help health care providers talk topatients about physical activity ( www.health.gov ). At the most basic level, the physician may discuss physical activities that a patient enjoys or wants to perform. It is important to counselthat both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities are useful,and patients may receive additional exercise resources such as handouts (many of which can be found on www.health.gov ). After exercise recommendations are discussed and a plan agreed upon, the provider may take steps to promote adherence. These include adding exercise to the patient 's asthma action plan and avoiding overly complex exercise recommendations. Patientsshould be cautioned that the bene ts of physical activity may not be perceived immediately. Highly motivated patients may bene t from daily record-keeping and setting speci c goals. 90 An asthma patient who has committed to exercise is at only the beginning of her or his journey. Studies demonstrate that patients view support from their provider as a facilitator tophysical activity. 97Providers, therefore, would do well to check in with the patient 's exercise habits at periodic wellness visits. In addition to serving as a gentle reminder for the patient, a check- in has the added bene t of allowing the provider to adjust rec- ommendations based on previous successes and disappointments. Asthma frequently has a variable course and it is far from uncommon for patients to experience setbacks. Promoting life-style change in an individual is dif cult for a friend or relative, let alone for a physician who only sees that person once every several months. It is, therefore, important to avoid the tempta-tion to view exercise as prescriptive. The effective physician willuse shared decision-making tools to personalize physical activity recommendations. When counseling exercise, the asthma pro-vider may take heed of the author Dale Carnegie 's advice that \"There is only one way .to get anybody to do anything. And that is by making the other person want to do it. \" 98 TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO PROMOTE EXERCISE Innovations in personalized tness technology over the last decade have promoted connected models built around a person 's own needs rather than those of a generic group. Exercise trends in thepast tended to focus on large groups gathered in 1 location, a modelthat failed to cater to individual tness goals. Personal training fo- cuses on individual needs but is prohibitively expensive for many. By creating a tailored experience through technology, tness companies are granting consumers access to customizable exercise routines that have only grown in popularity with the arrival of COVID-19. Personalized tness tools have the potential to enable asthma pa- tients to overcome their physical activity barriers. Therst technological milestone in personalized tness came in 2014 with the advent of wearable technology like tness trackers and smartwatches. Current health trackers provide userswith snapshots of their activity and recovery data, including advanced performance metrics like step tracking, heart rate, body fat percentage, and sleep quality. 99Currently, 19% of Americans use a wearable tness tracker (eg, Fitbit, Apple Watch). Sales are projected to double by 2022, to an estimated $27 billion.100,101 The goal with these applications is to deliver accurate feedback to users so that they can have a better sense of how their daily ac- tivities and behaviors impact them physically, providing addi- tional motivation to stay engaged and more proactively managetheir health.

An integrative connected tness model can also offer social support through online forums or networks where users are able tointeract with peers with similar tness goals, helping to further enhance the experience and improve adherence. Home exercise company Peloton pioneered the concept of interactive tness back in 2012. What makes tness models like Peloton so successful at retaining subscribers is their extremely compelling tness studio content, engaging instructor personalities, and a wide range oftness class types well beyond just cycling. Noncycling classes including yoga, meditation, walking, running, boot camp, strength, and stretching programs add to the depth and variety oftheir content. Despite these bene ts, the main reason for loyalty cited by Peloton users is not the fancy bike or easy-to-use app, but the community of fellow riders and the company 'sp e r s o n a b l e coaches. Asthma patients will be reassured to know that theirexercise journey is not something they need to face alone. By harnessing exciting developments in personalization, digi- tization, wellness, and consumer engagement, tness companies can improve access and increase compliance in ways never before possible. Providers would do well to counsel asthma patients about the potential of these tools because this may help overcomebarriers. NEXT STEPS Implications for clinical practice The importance of addressing physical inactivity in asthma should not be underestimated. One analysis found that increase in physical activity was associated with a 25% reduction inasthma exacerbations that required emergency department visits or hospitalizations. 45Improving overall physical activity rates may, therefore, lead to a larger proportion of asthma patientswith well-controlled disease and a decreased reliance of phar- maceutical therapy. Naturally, there are also economic bene ts to be found in reducing emergency department visits. Becauseemergency care accounts for much of the economic burden in asthma, increasing physical activity levels by 20% could yield over $23 million of savings in emergency department visits and$117 million in hospitalizations each year. In addition,increasing physical activity may have additional health bene ts such as reducing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases risk, which could have long-term impact on quality of life and lifeexpectancy. With this in mind, it is important that physical activity levels are routinely assessed in our asthma patients and patients areassisted in achieving age-appropriate physical activity levels that not only positively impact their asthma but also aid in the pre- vention of other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. Using asystematic approach to physical activity assessment may helpspecialists incorporate it into practice. Tools such as Physical Activity Vital Sign or Exercise Vital Sign can be completed in less than 30 seconds and could alert providers of inadequate physicalactivity to prompt counseling or referral ( Table II ). 102,103There are several counseling strategies that can be used ( Table III ). Using a longitudinal approach to changing physical activitybehavior is another option. With this model, clinicians can spend a little bit of time spread out over several visits to enlist the patient in shared goal-setting leading to improved outcomes asdiscussed previously. Effective educational tools to help providersimplement physical activity assessments into their practice and feel more comfortable providing physical activity counseling are needed. To further guide clinicians, we agree with the recent editorial by Bacon and Platts-Mills 104that physical activity counseling is worthy of inclusion in national asthma treatment guidelines. Last but not least, the physician who spends considerable effort on counseling patients on physical activity should expect to be reasonably reimbursed. Time-based endocrine and metabolic coding may often be appropriate. An InternationalClassi cation of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), code for comorbidities of physical inactivity, such as depression, over- weight or obesity, asthma, or fatigue, could be linked to theendocrine and metabolic code. Documentation must includethe total time spent with the patient as well as a description of the counseling or coordination of care activities. As the evi- dence regarding the dangers of physical inactivity comes tolight, even specialty health care providers will need to take a role in promoting physical activity and, as such, should be adequately reimbursed for the time and greater medicalcomplexity. Implications for research Although evidence to date supports the safety and bene ts of physical activity in asthma, many research questions still remain. When asthma patients do engage in physical activity, many prefer low-intensity activities such as walking, which has a lowlikelihood of causing asthma symptoms. 78,105,106Only 3 studies to date have examined the effects of lifestyle physical activity (walking) in people with asthma.59,60,107Whereas all studies found walking to be safe and led to improvements in asthmaoutcomes (control and quality of life), 1 was conducted 60in a supervised exercise facility and none examined sustainabil- ity.59,60,107Well-designed studies that address the impact and sustainability of physically active lifestyles, such as walking, are needed in asthma populations. A recent update to the physical activity guidelines for Amer- icans highlighted the importance of reducing sedentary time.1 Few studies in asthma have assessed sedentary time, despite anassociation of sedentary behavior with higher health care use andpoorer lung function, asthma control, and exercise capacity. 4 Interventions that target sedentary behavior are needed to determine the full impact of reducing sedentary time on asthma outcomes. Future research in physical activity interventions should include identifying subpopulations that bene t most from physical activity promotion as well as best practices for incor-porating physical activity into treatment guidelines and clinical practice. Speci c subpopulations to consider are those with varying asthma phenotypes. Three physical activity interventionshave shown reductions in eosinophilic airway markers (fractionalexhaled nitric oxide, sputum eosinophils) and this may be an indicator of which patients respond positively to these interventions. 45,48,49 The behavioral and biological mechanisms of physical activity in asthma are not well understood. Early physical activity research did not include behavior change theory, but over the last2 decades, its importance has been recognized. 79It is crucial that, when designing behavioral physical activity interventions, re- searchers identify and test speci c hypotheses about theoretical factors that will be changed in the intervention.78LimitedJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT FEBRUARY 2022440 NYENHUIS ET ALevidence exists on the biological mechanisms of physical activity in asthma. Available evidence suggests that it is mediated by physiological, metabolic, and immune pathways.61Conse- quently, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms thatyield improved asthma outcomes is needed. DISCUSSION Asthma affects millions of people worldwide. Using physical activity to improve the lives of patients with asthma has beenunderrecognized and underutilized. Evidence supports the ben-ets of physical activity on asthma control and quality of life, yet implementation of physical activity counseling into clinical practice has been slow. A thorough examination of the barriers toimplementation in clinical practice is essential, from both the patient and the health system perspectives, as is increased awareness of reimbursement policies for physical activity coun-seling. Physical activity may be 1 of the most important adjunct strategies in the management of asthma, with the extra bene to f improving other prevalent chronic disease outcomes.
