The methodology of identifying and testing new vaccine candidates could be improved with rational design and in vitro testing prior to animal experimentation. The tularemia vaccine, Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS), does not elicit complete protection against lethal challenge with a virulent type A Francisella strain. One factor that may contribute to this poor performance is limited stimulation of antigen-presenting cells. In this study, we examined whether the interaction of genetically modified LVS strains with human antigen-presenting cells correlated with effectiveness as tularemia vaccine candidates. Humandendritic cells infected with wild-type LVS secrete low levels of proinflammatory cytokines, fail to upregulate costimulatorymolecules, and activate human T cells poorly in vitro . One LVS mutant, strain 13B47, stimulated higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines from dendritic cells and macrophages and increased costimulatory molecule expression on dendritic cells compared to wild type. Additionally, 13B47-infected dendritic cells activated T cells more efficiently than LVS-infected cells. A deletion allele of the same gene in LVS displayed similar in vitro characteristics, but vaccination with this strain did not improve survival after challenge with a virulent Francisella strain. In vivo , this mutant was attenuated for growth and did not stimulate T cell responses in the lung comparable to wild type. Therefore, stimulation of antigen- presenting cells in vitro was improved by genetic modification of LVS, but did not correlate with efficacy against challenge in vivo within this model system.

Obtaining licensure after discovery of avaccine, however, can take up to 20 years due to the stringenttesting required to confirm the safety and efficacy of the vaccine[2]. To expedite this process, in vitro tests could be developed to define correlates of protection and identify more promisingvaccine candidates. These assays would be particularly beneficialwith vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic organisms, such asthe bacterium Francisella tularensis , when challenge studies cannot be performed in humans because of contemporary regulations thatgovern clinical trials [3]. F. tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia [4]. This zoonotic disease is endemic in North America and parts of Europe andAsia, and outbreaks in these regions are frequently associated withthe handling of infected animals or transmission by arthropodvectors [4,5]. F. tularensis is also classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Category A bioterrorismagent [6]. When inhaled, less than 10 organisms can cause anacute pneumonia that is lethal in up to 60% of infected individualsif left untreated [7]. The World Health Organization predictedthat if virulent F. tularensis was aerosolized over a metropolitan area of five million people, more than 19,000 people would die and 250,000 individuals would be incapacitated [6]. An effectivevaccine would be useful to reduce the number of naturallyoccurring tularemia cases and to protect against a possibleintentional release. To date, two different types of tularemia vaccines have been studied in humans. The Foshay vaccine consisted of chemicallykilled F. tularensis and was effective at reducing the incidence of laboratory-acquired tularemia cases from approximately 100% to30% in the 1950s [8,9]. However, killed F. tularensis provided only minimal protection from aerosol type A Francisella challenge in a PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31172vaccine trial [10]. Researchers in the former Soviet Union took a different approach and developed a range of live attenuated Francisella strains to immunize people against tularemia [11]. One of these strains, a live attenuated strain of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica , live vaccine strain (LVS), was superior to the Foshay-type vaccines at providing protection [10,12,13]. While two clinical studies involving small numbers of human vaccinees demonstrated effectiveness ofLVS against aerosol challenge by virulent type A Francisella [10,12], a later study showed variable efficacy that diminished over time [14].Vaccination of individuals by aerosol improved the efficacy of LVS but this required a high dose of 10 6to 108organisms which frequently resulted in severe adverse side effects [14]. Currently, LVS is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to concerns about its undefined attenuation, mechanism of protection, and reversion frequency[15]. In order to obtain FDA approval, several groups are workingto address these issues. Recent work by Salomonsson et al. identified two regions of difference, RD18 and RD19, which are deleted in LVS and account for its attenuation [16]. Additional studiesimproved the manufacturing process of LVS in compliance withgood manufacturing practice guidelines [17]. This new lot of LVS was further characterized in human phase I clinical trials [18]. Researchers are also introducing mutations into LVS in order toimprove its efficacy and bolster attenuation. One example is an LVSmutant deficient in iron ( sodB Ft). Compared to LVS, sodB Ftincreases median time to death and percent survival of C57BL/6 mice from pulmonary type A Francisella challenge [19]. As work toward the licensing of LVS continues, attempts have beenmade to replace LVS with a genetically defined, attenuated type provide respectively, from virulent type A Francisella challenge in BALB/c mice [20,21]. Nevertheless, LVS remains the leading tularemia vaccine to date that has shownactivity in humans [10,12]. A potential limitation of LVS as a vaccine is its relative stimulation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Published work hasshown LVS stimulates murine and human DCs [22,23], though it is now known that culture conditions influence stimulation of innate immunity [24,25,26,27,28]. In contrast, other studies haveshown that LVS suppresses to no proinflammatory cytokines in vitro compared to DCs cultured with other bacteria or TLR ligands [24,29,30,32]. Stimulation withTLR ligands such as Escherichia coli LPS fails to restore cytokine secretion by these cells suggesting that LVS is actively suppressing TLR signaling [24,25,29,32]. Another study showed that thissuppression is due to downregulation of critical inflammatorysignaling pathways involved in MAPK and NF- kB activation [30]. In this study, we tested whether in vitro screening of potential tularemia vaccine candidates for enhanced stimulation of APCswould improve a candidate's immunogenicity, and ultimatelyprotection after challenge. After initial testing of several LVS strains, we evaluated one genetic locus in detail with mutant strains that showed desirable vaccine characteristics in vitro , including attenuation in macrophages and enhanced DC stimulation.Despite these traits, they did not predict better protection against virulent type A Francisella challenge. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement Human cells were purified from discarded buffy coats obtained from the Central Blood Bank (Pittsburgh, PA). The use of thesesamples was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh, which made a ''no human subjects'' determination and waived requirement for consent. Allresearch involving animals was conducted in accordance withanimal care and use guidelines, and animal protocols were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use Committee (protocols 1003587 and 1002514). Francisella strains and growth conditions For cultivation of F. tularensis LVS strains and Schu S4, frozen stock cultures were streaked onto chocolate II agar plates and incubated at 37 uC, 5% CO 2for 2-3 days. LVS strains were grown in Chamberlain's chemically defined broth medium (CDM) [33]or MH for infections. For mouse MH broth or TSBc [trypticase of LVS strains. Schu S4 was grown in MH broth for infections of vaccinated mice.Broth cultures were grown at 37 uC with shaking for 14-18 hours. When required, antibiotics were added to the media at the following concentrations: kanamycin at 10 mg/ml, chloramphen- icol at in MH broth as described above. Following overnight culture, bacteria were washed, resuspended in PBS (Gibco), and adjusted to an OD 600of 0.3. Bacteria were resuspended in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) and incubated at25uC for 10 min with shaking (200 rpm). Bacteria were washed five times and resuspended in PBS for an approximate concentration of 1-3 610 8CFU/ml. Bacterial killing was con- firmed by plating of formalin-fixed Schu S4 on chocolate II agarplates in which no colonies were observed following extensive incubation (data not shown). Prior to formalin fixation, an aliquot of the bacterial suspension was removed and tested for viable CFUby plating serial dilutions on chocolate II agar. Construction of LVS mutants Construction of LVS strain described previously [34]. The F. tularensis LVS DcapC mutant was generated using homologous recombination with a suicide plasmid. This plasmidcontained two segments homologous to regions flankingFTL_1415 and one third of the 5 9and 3 9ends of this ORF, surrounding a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene ( cat) under the control of the F. tularensis groE promoter (Table 1). Linearized plasmid was electroporated into LVS [35] and double cross-over were selected on cysteine heart agar with 5% defibrillated rabbit blood chloramphenicol. Recombina- tion was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). To generate strain 13B47, plasmid pSD26 (a gift from Eric Rubin and Simon Dillon) was electroporated into LVS aspreviously described [36]. pSD26 is an E. coli plasmid delivery vector ( ,A p R) that encodes Himar1 transposase [37] and a transposon containing a resistance cassette under thecontrol of the F. tularensis groE promoter (Table 1). Following recovery in trypticase soy broth supplemented with 0.1% cysteine, bacteria were plated on cysteine heart broth with 5% defibrinated rabbit blood containing kanamycin (5 mg/ml). Colonies that emerged in the presence of kanamycin were isolated and screened for lack of response to extracellular spermine [38].

Strain 13B47 elicited high concentrations TNF- DNA sequencing showedthat the precise location of this transposon was in base pair 115 of842 from the 5 9end of FTL_0883. Construction of an in-frame deletion mutant, DFTL_0883, and a cis-complement strain was described previously [38]. Infection of macrophages and DCs with F. tularensis LVS strains Human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and DCs by in vitro culture as described previously [34]. For generation of murine DCs, bone marrow was flushed fromfemurs and tibias of with complete GlutaMAX and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (all from Gibco)].Freshly isolated cells were wash ed and red blood cells were lysed with ACK Lysis Buffer (Gibco). After washing and counting,cells were resuspended in complete DC media supplementedwith 500 U/ml GM-CSF (eBioscience) and seeded into T75flasks or plates at a concentration of 20-30 million cellsper flask or 1 610 6cells/well, respectively. Cells were incubated at 37 uC, 5% CO 2for 5-6 days and fresh complete DC media with 500 U/ml GM-CSF was added every 2 days. Bone marrowDCs (BMDCs) were purified using CD11c magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) per the manu facturer's resulting cells were greater than 90% CD11c +as assessed by flow cytometry. For cytokine and flow cytometry experiments, human cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM were into 24- well plates (Costar) at 5 610 5cells/well and 1.5 6105cells/well, respectively. Infections were conducted using two different methods with the goal of maintaining eukaryotic cell viability. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 was used for 24-hour co- cultures at 37 uC with 5% CO 2, allowing cultures to proceed without washing. In other experiments, DCs were cultured withbacteria at an MOI of 500 for two hours as described below, which results in a high infection rate but with minimal effects on cell viability [25,34]. As a positive control, macrophages and DCs were stimulated with E. coli strain sd-4 (ATCC 11143) [39]. Supernatants were collected at various times post infection (6, 12, 24, and 48 hours) and DCs were prepared for flow cytometric analysis. Gentamicin protection assays were used to assess intracellular growth [40]. Here, macrophages and DCs were seeded in Primaria 96-well culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at a density of 5610 4cells/well and infected with bacteria at an MOI of 500. After two hours, cells were incu bated with Hanks balanced salt solution (Gibco) conta ining gentamicin (20 mg/ml) for 20 min to kill extracellular bacteria. Cultures were then washed three times with warm Hank's balanced s alt solution and incubated at 37uCw i t h5 %C O 2for another 22 h with fresh culture medium. Actual MOIs were measured by plating serial dilutions of inocula on chocolate II agar plates. At the indicated time points post infection, viable CFU were measured as described previously [34,41].

Following infection, DCs were removed from 24-well plates using a 2 mM EDTA solution. Cells were washed once and resuspended human uC for 30 min. Isotype control antibodies were included in each experiment to confirm specificity of staining. After washing and fixing in 2% parafor-maldehyde for 30 min at 4 uC, cells were analyzed using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo Software (Tree Star).Statistically significant differences in CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR expression by infected DCs were determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni comparison of means. Human DC-CD4+T cell co-culture DC-T cell co-cultures were performed similarly to previous studies [42,43,44]. CD4+T cells were purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that passed through theOptiprep gradient by positive selection using the Dynal CD4 Positive Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) per These cells were .95% +CD4+T cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Purified CD4+T cells were then stained with 2.5mM CFSE for 10 min at 37 uC, washed, and resuspended in complete T cell medium. CFSE-labeled T cells from a single donor were then added to DCs from a different donor that had been exposed to bacteria. DC-T cell co-cultures were performed ina 96-well round bottom plate at a ratio of 10:1 (2 610 5T cells/ 26104DCs/well) for a period of 5 days at 37 uC with 5% CO 2. After harvesting supernatants, cells were washed once and resuspended in FACS staining buffer, treated with human OKT4, eBioscience) at 4 uC for 30 min. After washing and fixing in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 uC, fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJoSoftware (Tree Star). For T cell proliferation, CFSE lowcells were measured in the CD4+gate. Statistically significant differences in the percentage of proliferating T cells following co-culture with infected DCs were determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni comparison of means. Mice Six- to eight-week old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housedin microisolator cages under specific pathogen-free conditions in abiosafety level-3 animal facility. Immunization of mice LVS and DFTL_0883 were cultured in MH broth or TSBc as described above. Mice were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) (i.t.). Vaccinations instillation as described previously [41]. A subsetof mice was sacrificed at 2 hours post infection, and their lungswere homogenized and plated to confirm delivery of bacteria to the respiratory tract. Actual administered doses were determinedby plating serial dilutions of the inocula onto chocolate II agar plates. Infection of mice with F. tularensis Schu S4 Schu S4 was grown in MH broth as described above. Mice were infected i.t. with 100 CFU of Schu S4 six weeks following LVS or DFTL_0883 vaccination. The actual dose was calculated by plating serial dilutions of the inoculum onto chocolate II agar plates. Following infection, mice were monitored daily for survival. Measurements of bacterial burden in vivo Bacterial burdens in the organs of mice vaccinated with LVS strains were measured as previously described [38,41]. Mice weresacrificed at the indicated time points and lungs, spleens, and livers were removed and homogenized in 1 ml (lungs, spleens) or 2 ml (livers) of TSBc. A portion of the organ homogenates were serially diluted and plated onto chocolate II agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 uCa t5 %C O 2and individual colonies were enumerated. In vitro stimulation of lung cells from vaccinated mice Six weeks following vaccination with LVS or DFTL_0883, lungs were excised, minced, and incubated in mented mg type I collagenase (Gibco), 100 mg DNase I (USB), and 3 mM CaCl 2for 30 min at 37 uC with shaking (170 rpm). The digested tissue was passed through a 40 mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to generate single cell suspensions. Erythrocytes were lysed with ACK Lysis Buffer (Gibco) and remaining cells were washed with RPMI. Viable cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion. Cells were resuspended in complete 2-mercaptoethanol (all from Gibco)] and into 96-well round bottom plates at 1.5 6106 cells/well. Lung cells from na \u00a8ve mice served as controls. BMDCs were generated as described above without CD11c magnetic bead purification. BMDCs were resuspended in complete RPMI and added at a 1:10 ratio (1.5 6105BMDCs/1.5 6106lung cells) to lung cells. Preliminary experiments were performed with lung cells from LVS-vaccinated mice to determine the optimal antigen concen- tration and length of co-culture for this assay. Peak cytokine production was detected after 48 hours of co-culture with similarresults observed at 72 hours (data not shown). Little to no cytokine production was detected from lung cells cultured with BMDCs and ffSchu S4 below an MOI of 10 (data not shown). As a result, cells were incubated at 37 uC with either media alone or ffSchu S4 at dose of 10 CFU per cell. After 48 hour co-culture, supernatants were collected for analysis of Chemokine Assays DCs and macrophage supernatants were tested by ELISA using commercially available kits to measure TNF- a(R&D Systems), IL- 12p40 (human, R&D Systems; mouse, eBiosciences), and IL-6 (human, R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's instruc-tions. IFN- cin supernatants from human DC-CD4 +T cell co- cultures was also measured by ELISA (human, R&D Systems). The limits of detection for the ELISAs were: human TNF- a- 15.6 pg/ml, human and mouse IL-12p40 - 31.2 pg/ml, human IL-6 - 9.7 pg/ml, and human IFN- c- 15.6 pg/ml. Cytokine and chemokine levels in lung supernatants from in vitro re-stimulation assays were determined by ELISA (mouse IFN- c, R&D Systems; mouse IL-17A, Biolegend) or by using the Milliplex 32-plex MouseAPC Stimulation and Vaccine Efficacy of LVS Mutant PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31172Cytokine/Chemokine Panel (Millipore) on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Analyte concentrations were calculated against the standards using Milliplex Analyst software (version 3.5; Millipore). The limits of detection for the ELISAs were 31.2 pg/ ml for mouse IFN- cand 15.6 pg/ml for mouse IL-17A. Statistically significant differences in cytokine production were identified by one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni comparison of means. Results Limited inflammatory response of human DCs to LVS We have shown previously that human macrophages have a limited capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines followinginfection with LVS [25]. We hypothesized that human DCs would also be hyporesponsive to LVS stimulation. To test this, human macrophages and DCs were co-cultured with LVS, and thensupernatants were harvested and analyzed for the proinflamma- tory cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-12p40. Similar to our findings with macrophages (Fig. 1A), LVS elicited little to no (Fig. 1B). Pre-treatingLVS with 100% human serum failed to enhance cytokineproduction (data not shown). As a positive control, human DCswere stimulated with E. coli [39]. E. coli -stimulated DCs produced significantly higher levels of all cytokines measured compared tountreated DCs or DCs cultured with 1B). Identification of an immunostimulatory F. tularensis LVS strain We hypothesized that a LVS mutant inducing a stronger proinflammatory response from APCs in vitro would be a more effective tularemia vaccine candidate. Surveying pre-existing LVSmutants generated in our laboratory, we tested several for their Figure 1. F. tularensis LVS strain 13B47 and overnight in a chemically defined media (CDM) or Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth. The four bacterial cultures were used to inoculate macrophages (A, 1.5 6105cells/well) and DCs (B and C, 5 6105cells/well) at an MOI of 10. As a positive control, DCs and macrophages were cultured with E. coli strain sd-4 (MOI = 10). Supernatants were harvested after 24 hours (A-B) or at indicated times (C), and TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-12p40 were measured by ELISA. Data are expressed as the mean 6SEM of three individual experiments with different donors. The level of cytokine production from each group was compared by a one (A-B) or two-way ANOVA (C), followed by theBonferroni comparison of means. ( $$$,p,0.001 for E. coli vs. all other groups). When comparing only the DCs infected with the F. tularensis strains, 13B47 elicited higher cytokine production than the uninfected group (A-B) or LVS cultured in the same media (C). *, p ,0.05; **, p ,0.01; ***, p,0.001.

Human DCs and macrophages were co- cultured with each of the mutants in parallel with wild-type LVS, and macrophages DcapC or 1664d was similar to LVS-infected cells at 24 hours post infection (Fig. 1A-B). In contrast, DCs and macrophages infected with the 13B47 strain produced elevated levels of all cytokines measured (Fig. 1A-B). Similar results were observed when cytokine levels were measured 48 hours after infection (data not shown).Although the cytokine levels elicited by 13B47 were lower than those produced by cells stimulated with E. coli (Fig. 1A-B), each was readily detected. Among the LVS strains tested, therefore, 13B47 stimulated the most proinflammatory cytokines from human APCs. We next assessed whether the medium used to grow the bacteria would influence stimulation of DCs. LVS grown in media containing high levels of polyamines such as CDM stimulates low levels of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages [25,27,38]. To address the effect culture conditions may have on the DC phenotypes observed here, LVS and 13B47 were cultured in CDM or MH broth prior to co-culture with human DCs. At various time points post infection, supernatants were harvested and analyzed for detection of IL-12p40. At 24 and 48 hours post infection, greater than 10-fold higher levels of IL-12p40 were produced by human DCs cultured with 13B47 compared to wild- type LVS (Fig. 1C). IL-12p40 production by DCs was higher regardless of whether 13B47 was cultured in CDM or MH broth (Fig. 1C). This result indicated that induction of cytokine production by 13B47 was not dependent on the growth medium used to culture this strain. Maturation of DCs infected with F.tularensis strain 13B47 In addition to the secretion of cytokines, DCs must undergo a process called maturation in order to efficiently prime T cells and initiate the adaptive immune response [45]. Among these alterations, the expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules increases. Since 13B47 stimulated cytokine production fromhuman DCs, we next evaluated whether these cells also changed their surface phenotype in response to this mutant. The expression of CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR was measured on DCs wild-type F. tularensis LVS, 13B47, DcapC, 1664d, or E. coli as a positive control for maturation. LVS elicited little to no change in expression of maturation markers on the surface of human DCs (Fig. 2A-C). Similar results were observed with the LVS mutants DcapC and 1664d (Fig. 2B, C). In contrast, the percentage of high-expressing cells and/or geometric mean fluorescence intensity increased after culture with 13B47 for CD80 and CD86 (Fig. 2). A similar trend of heightened expression of HLA-DR was also observed with 13B47-infected DCs (Fig. 2). Likewise, E. coli -stimulated DCs increased expression of costimu- latory molecules and MHC (Fig. 2). These data suggest that DCs undergo maturation after exposure to F. tularensis strain 13B47 and, therefore, may be better suited to initiate an adaptive immune response. Growth of 13B47 in human macrophages and DCs Intracellular growth is a hallmark of pathogenic Francisella strains. Although 13B47 stimulated APCs to secrete cytokines and upregulate costimulatory molecules, it was unclear if its intracel- lular growth was altered. To test this, human DCs andmacrophages were infected with either wild-type LVS or strain 13B47, and lysed at various times post infection to enumerate intracellular bacteria. 13B47 was attenuated for growth at24 hours post infection in human macrophages (Fig. 3). Surpris- ingly, 13B47 was still capable of replicating in human DCs (Fig. 3), albeit with a slightly slower rate compared to wild-type LVS (estimated generation time of 783 minutes versus 275 minutes forwild-type). These phenotypes could not be attributed to a generalgrowth defect since 13B47 grew similar to wild-type LVS inbacterial growth medium (data not shown). These data suggestthat, while the cytokine response to 13B47 is similar between macrophages and DCs, these cells differ in their ability to control growth of this mutant. Enhanced activation of CD4+T cells by F. tularensis strain 13B47-infected DCs Enhanced maturation of human DCs by 13B47 led us to hypothesize the resulting DCs would stimulate T cells moreeffectively. This was tested by measuring human CD4 +T cell proliferation and with LVS, 13B47, or E. was measured by CFSE dilution after co-culture withinfected DCs for 5 days as described previously [42,43,44]. An increase in the percentage of proliferating CD4 +T cells was CD4 +T cells and B). This increased percentage of proliferating CD4+T cells was comparable to the level of proliferating T cells observed following co-culture with E. coli-infected DCs (Fig. 4A and B). Similar rates of CD4+T cell proliferation were observed after 7 days of culture with infected DCs (data not shown). In contrast, the percentage of proliferatingCD4 +T cells following co-culture with LVS-treated DCs was not significantly different from the baseline level of proliferationobserved with unstimulated DCs (Fig. 4B). T cell activation following co-culture with infected DCs was also assessed by cytokine production. IFN- cconcentrations in the supernatants of the DC-T cell co-cultures described above showeda similar trend to the proliferation data. CD4 +T cells cultured with 13B47-infected DCs produced higher levels of IFN- c compared to those stimulated with LVS-infected DCs (Fig. 4C). T cells stimulated with bacteria alone in the absence of DCs did not proliferate or produce measurable levels of IFN- c(data not shown). The proliferation and cytokine production data togethersuggest DC maturation induced by 13B47 had measurableconsequences on T cells in vitro . Evaluation of the LVS FTL_0883 deletion mutant as a tularemia vaccine Protection from virulent type A Francisella infection is largely dependent on the development of robust T cell-mediatedimmunity [46]. Based on the data obtained with human cells in vitro, we hypothesized that vaccination with 13B47 would prolong survival and improve T cell responses compared to LVS in mice challenged with virulent Francisella . However, 13B47 is not optimal since it contains a transposon that could be unstable. To generatea more suitable vaccine candidate, an in-frame deletion mutantwas created in LVS, DFTL_0883, that does not incorporate an antibiotic resistance marker [38]. Similar to human macrophages [38], more IL-12p40 and TNF- than wild-type LVS (Fig. 5A-B). These cytokine levels were similar to, or greater than, that produced byDCs cultured with 13B47 (Fig. 5A-B). Moreover, IL-12p40 andTNF- alevels continued to rise from 24-48 hours when DCs were cultured with DFTL_0883 (Fig. 5B). To confirm the heightened stimulation of macrophages and DCs was due to deletion of FTL_0883, an in cis-complementing construct (pJH1-FTL_0883)APC Stimulation and Vaccine Efficacy of LVS Mutant PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31172was generated and introduced into DFTL_0883 [38]. Comple- mentation of DFTL_0883 with the wild-type the gene significantly reduced IL-12p40 and TNF- aproduction by human macrophages [38] and DCs 5B). of human DCs by FTL_0883 mutants and wild-type LVS was also observed at a higher MOI of 500 (Fig. 5C). Changes in CD80 and CD86 expression were also evaluated in human DCs cultured with either wild-type LVS or FTL_0883 mutants. As demonstrated previously in Fig. 2, expression of CD80 and CD86 was not altered on human DCs cultured with wild-type LVS at a low MOI (Fig. 5D). Culturing of human DCswith 13B47 or DFTL_0883, however, caused a statistically significant increase in expression of both costimulatory molecules on the surface (Fig. 5D). CD80 and CD86 expression were also higher on DCs cultured with 13B47 or DFTL_0883 than on LVS- infected DCs using a higher MOI (Fig. 5D). Lower levels of CD80 and CD86 were also measured on human DCs cultured with the DFTL_0883 strain complemented with a wild-type copy of the gene compared to DCs cultured with DFTL_0883 (Fig. 5D).Deletion of FTL_0883 in LVS reduces its ability to replicate in human and murine macrophages [38]. Additionally, the LVSmutant gene,13B47, was attenuated for growth in human macrophages andreplicated slowly in human DCs (Fig. 3). To measure DFTL_0883 replication in human DCs, DCs were infected with either wild- type LVS, 13B47, DFTL_0883, or the complemented strain, and lysed at various times post infection to enumerate intracellularbacteria. DFTL_0883 replicated more slowly in human DCs than wild-type LVS, exhibiting at least 5-fold less growth 24 hours post infection (Fig. 5E). Similar results were observed 48 and 72 hours post infection with up to a 20-fold difference in growth betweenDFTL_0883 and LVS measured 72 hours post infection (Fig. 5E). The growth kinetics for DFTL_0883 and 13B47 in human DCs over the 72 hour period were indistinguishable (Fig. 5E). Com- plementation of DFTL_0883 with a wild-type copy of the gene restored growth of the mutant to near wild-type levels (Fig. 5E). Insummary, 13B47 and DFTL_0883 were similar with 1) reduced growth in human DCs, 2) increased expression of CD80 and Figure 2. Human monocyte-derived DCs mature following exposure to LVS strain stimulated with either LVS, 13B47, DcapC, 1664d, or E. coli for 24 hours (MOI = 10). Cells were harvested and analyzed for changes in surface expression of CD86, CD80, and HLA-DR. Cells were gated on CD1b-positive population. (A) Representative histograms for CD86, CD80, and HLA-DR expression on LVS-, 13B47-, and E. coli - treated DCs from one experiment.

To test whether phenotypes observed in human DCs were species-specific, murine DCs were also tested with these LVSstrains. IL-12p40 levels were higher in supernatants from murineDCs cultured with either 13B47 or DFTL_0883 compared to LVS (Fig. 5F). Growth of strains with mutations in FTL_0883 was alsoless than wild type in murine DCs Similar DFTL_0883 grew robustly in murine DCs, which was less than wild-type at 24, 48,and 72 hours post infection (Fig. 5G). Growth of the DFTL_0883 was nearly restored to wild-type levels by the complementingconstruct containing a wild-type copy of the gene (Fig. 5G). Theseresults showed that human and murine DCs responded similarly to13B47 and DFTL_0883. Having established the in vitro phenotypes of the DFTL_0883 strain, we next assessed its ability to stimulate adaptive immuneresponses in vivo . C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated by either subcutaneous (s.c.) or respiratory (i.t.) routes with LVS orDFTL_0883. Mice were challenged six weeks later i.t. with the type A F. tularensis strain Schu S4. Vaccination of C57BL/6J mice with LVS prolongs survival but does not completely protectagainst a secondary challenge with a type A Francisella strain [47,48]. This experimental design allowed us to determinewhether DFTL_0883 vaccination conferred better protection than LVS. All mice that received a sham vaccination with PBSsuccumbed to the Schu S4 infection within 5 days followingchallenge (Table 2). Although mice vaccinated s.c. with LVS andDFTL_0883 survived longer than sham-vaccinated controls, theystill required euthanasia within 7 days of Schu S4 infection (Table 2). No survival differences were observed between animalsvaccinated s.c. with LVS and DFTL_0883 (Table 2). Vaccination by a respiratory route, however, showed statisti- cally significant differences in protective efficacy. The median time to death of mice vaccinated i.t. with LVS was approximately 10- 12 days following Schu S4 challenge (Table 2). This median timeto death was double the median time to death for sham-vaccinated controls (5 days, Table 2) and was similar to previous work [47]. In contrast, mice vaccinated with DFTL_0883 survived for a median of 6 days (Table 2). Therefore, vaccination with DFTL_0883 by a respiratory route provided less protection than that elicited by wild-type LVS. To investigate the differences in the protection elicited by the two strains, we evaluated bacterial burdens in the lung and peripheral organs following respiratory vaccination. LVS replicat-ed exponentially in the lung for the first three days following i.t. immunization (Fig. 6). The lung bacterial burden remained steady until day 6 post immunization and then slowly began to decline upto day 10 (Fig. 6). Dissemination to the spleen and liver occurred at day 3 with LVS burden peaking at day 6 and being cleared by day 10 (Fig. 6). Despite comparable doses of bacteria used in thevaccinations, lower levels of DFTL_0883 were detected at all time points in the lung and beginning at day 3 in peripheral organs post immunization (Fig. 6). While clearance of LVS from the lung doesnot occur until 22 days post infection [49], DFTL_0883 was cleared more rapidly at approximately 10 days post infection (Fig. 6). Viable DFTL_0883 were measured in the spleens and livers of seven of eight mice by day 6, but none were detected in these organs at day 10 (Fig. 6). Therefore, LVS achieved higher numbers for a longer period of time in the lung and peripheryfollowing vaccination. We next sought an immunological explanation for the performance of DFTL_0883 vaccination. We hypothesized wild- type LVS induced superior T cell responses than DFTL_0883, and measured cytokine and chemokine responses by lung cells after i.t.vaccination. Cells were harvested from the lungs of LVS- and DFTL_0883-vaccinated mice and were re-stimulated in vitro with ffSchu S4. Cells from mice vaccinated with LVS produced higheramounts of IFN- cwith re-stimulation than cells from na \u00a8ve mice or those that received DFTL_0883 (Fig. 7). IFN- cproduction by lung cells from mice vaccinated with DFTL_0883, however, was not statistically significantly different than na \u00a8ve controls (Fig. 7). Increasing the vaccination dose of DFTL_0883 by three-fold failed to improve IFN- cresponses by the lung cells (data not shown). Consistent with the IFN- cresults, the IFN- cinducible chemokine MIG was also higher in cultures from mice vaccinated with LVS (data not shown). In contrast to IFN- c, cells from both vaccination groups produced comparable amounts of IL-17 after re-stimula- tion. A 2-3 fold increase in IL-17 production was observed in lung cells from mice vaccinated with DFTL_0883 and LVS compared to na \u00a8ve controls (Fig. 7). No other statistically significant differences were consistently detected in the other cytokines and chemokines that were tested (data not shown). Therefore, theprotection elicited by LVS against Schu S4 challenge correlated with IFN- cproduction by lung cells after re-stimulation with antigen. Discussion Several studies, including this one, indicate LVS poorly stimulates innate immune cells [24,25,27,29,30,32]. This suggests insufficient activation of DCs could contribute to incompleteprotection engendered by LVS. In this study, we sought to Figure 3. LVS strain 13B47 is attenuated for growth in human macrophages and replicates slowly in DCs. DCs or macrophages were infected in gentamicin protection assays (MOI = 500) with LVS or 13B47 and lysed at the indicated times post infection. Data shown are mean6SEM from three individual experiments with different donors. Statistically significant differences in growth at 24 hours post infectionwere determined by Student's t-test (*, p ,0.05). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0031172.g003APC Stimulation and Vaccine Efficacy of LVS Mutant PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31172improve vaccine efficacy with a LVS strain that stimulated APCs better than wild-type LVS. The LVS mutants used in this study (Table 1) were selected based on specific characteristics. All threeof these genes (FTL_1415, FTL_1664, and FTL_0883) have beenidentified in negative selection screens in F. novicida and/or LVS to be necessary for growth and/or survival in mice [50,51]. The DcapC mutant was of interest because another LVS mutant in the capBCA operon, DcapB, afforded protection in BALB/c mice against challenge with the virulent Francisella strain Schu S4 [49]. Mutation of in diminished uptake byhuman DCs [34], which may impact DC activation. Recently, our laboratory has shown that LVS FTL_0883 mutants like 13B47 stimulate innate immune cells and are attenuated in vitro and in vivo, making this mutant a possible vaccine candidate [38]. Strains with mutations in the FTL_0883 locus of LVS showed promise based on in vitro results. The 13B47 and DFTL_0883 derivatives of LVS stimulated human DCs and macrophages(Fig. 1, 2, and 5), which was associated with better stimulation of Tcells in vitro (Fig. 4). Contrary to our hypothesis, however, improving APC stimulation in vitro with the DFTL_0883 strain did not enhance protection in vivo . The median time to death doubled in mice vaccinated in the respiratory tract with LVScompared to na \u00a8ve animals. In contrast, the median time to death of mice vaccinated with DFTL_0883 was similar to na \u00a8ve animals (Table 2). Enhancing DC stimulation with DFTL_0883, therefore, failed to establish a protective immune response.The poor performance of DFTL_0883 as a vaccine may be due directly to its attenuation. Mutation of the FTL_0883 locus in LVS attenuates 3, 5E, and 5G,and [38]). In addition, bacterial burdens in the lung and peripheryofDFTL_0883-vaccinated mice are less than in animals receiving wild type (Fig. 6). Based on these findings, the attenuation and accelerated clearance of DFTL_0883 in vivo may prevent a sufficient adaptive immune response from being established.Consistent with this model, restimulation of lung cells isolatedfrom DFTL_0883-vaccinated mice produced less IFN- cthan mice receiving wild type (Fig. 7). Since IFN- cis a critical mediator of protective immunity against tularemia [48,52,53], the diminished IFN-cresponse we observed following restimulation likely contributed to the lack of protection after vaccination withDFTL_0883. Additional factors may also contribute to the vaccination results seen in this study. Though the molecular function of theprotein encoded by FTL_0883 is unknown, it is possible thatprotective antigens may not be expressed since spermineresponsiveness and transcription are altered after mutation of FTL_0883 [38]. Alternatively, different cytokine profiles stimu- lated in the host by the DFTL_0883 mutant may influence the vaccine performance. Inflammatory signals such as IL-12 canmodulate T cell differentiation, promoting the generation of moreshort-lived effector cells compared to memory precursors [54]. The higher levels of IL-12 stimulated by DFTL_0883 (Fig. 5) may Figure 4. Enhanced proliferation and IFN- cproduction by CD4+T cells stimulated with LVS strain 13B47-infected DCs.

Each of these possibilities is consistent with thereduced IFN- cobserved during re-stimulation of . The mechanism(s) acco unting for the poor re- call responses observed with DFTL_0883 is currently being investigated. Figure 5.

Mutation of iglC ormglA, genes important for intracellular deletion of the purMCD purine biosynthesis operon resulted in highly attenuated strains that did not provide better protection than LVS against virulent Francisella challenge [55,56,57]. In contrast, vaccination with a DclpB mutant in the Schu S4 background is superior to wild-type LVS [21]. A greater IFN- cresponse was measured four days after challenge of mice vaccinated with the more successful DclpB mutant than those vaccinated with LVS [58]. Coupled with our results, IFN- cresponses measured during restimulation could be a useful predictor of vaccine efficacy. Several recent studies have shown that IL-17 is also required for control of F. tularensis growth and the generation of an effective Th1 response following pulmonary challenge [59,60,61]. Althoughthe role of IL-17 in the immune response to acute F. tularensis infection has been characterized [59,60,61], its role in vaccination against tularemia remains to be elucidated. Paranavitana et al. demonstrated that PBMCs from LVS-vaccinated individualsproduce high levels of IL-17 following in vitro re-stimulation [62]. Similarly, we have shown that pulmonary vaccination of mice with LVS results in an increase in IL-17 compared to na \u00a8ve controls (Fig. 7). Production of IL-17, however, did not correlate withvaccine efficacy since comparable levels of IL-17 were producedby cells from mice receiving wild-type or DFTL_0883 vaccinations (Fig. 7). Additionally, neutralization of IL-17 in mice successfully protected by a Schu S4 DclpBvaccine did not reduce survival after a pulmonary type A challenge despite increasing bacterial burden[58]. Therefore, IL-17 alone is not sufficient to predict vaccine efficacy. Defining an optimal strategy for vaccine development remains a significant challenge for many pathogens. Improving APC stimulation using genetic modifications of LVS in this projectfailed to improve protection against a virulent F. tularensis strain. In addition, modeling vaccination and challenge in vitro with human cells did not predict in vitro responses in mice. Comparison of different vaccine strains and the protection conferred, however,confirmed IFN- cproduction as a potential correlate of protection. A similar experimental approach by Shen et al. . successfully characterized the immune response to Francisella strains that varied in vaccine efficacy [58]. Nevertheless, our current study and thatof Shen et al. are limited by the conditions tested (the number of vaccine and mouse strains used), the limited number of output variables measured (relying primarily on multiplex cytokinemeasurements), and the timing of sampling (responses tested afterchallenge in vitro orin vivo ). This leaves open the possibility that more comprehensive investigations could yield additional insights. Recently, a systems-wide analysis of vaccine responses againstyellow fever has met with significant success [63,64]. In thisapproach, genome-wide transcriptional studies using microarrays provided a broader assessment of in vivo host responses to vaccination [63]. A seminal application of these concepts toFrancisella was also recently published by DePascalis et al. [65]. Here, an in vitro lymphocyte-macrophage co-culture was used to model the immune responses elicited by LVS vaccines of varyingefficacies [65]. Analysis of 84 immunologically-relevant genes byreal time PCR identified a list of immune mediators whose expression pattern correlated with protection from F. tularensis infection, including IFN-g [65]. These higher order analyses,which integrate multi-parameter data sets of a variety ofmeasurements, combined with traditional testing of specific Figure 6. DFTL_0883-vaccinated mice have reduced bacterial burdens. Mice were vaccinated i.t. (1.5 6103CFU) with either LVS or DFTL_0883 (n = 4 mice/group/time point). At indicated time points (days 1, 3, and 6 for experiment 1; days 3, 6, and 10 for experiment 2), mice were sacrificed and the CFU/organ was determined as described in Materials and Methods. The limits of detection for the lung, spleen, and liver aredepicted by the black dashed lines and were 100, 100, and 200 CFU, respectively.
