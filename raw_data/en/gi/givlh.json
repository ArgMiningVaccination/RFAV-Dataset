Peptic ulcer disease refers to painful sores or ulcers in the lining of the stomach or first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. What Causes Ulcers? [Why Do I Get Ulcers?](whydopeoplegetgerd.asp) No single cause has been found for ulcers. However, it is now clear that an ulcer is the end result of an imbalance between digestive fluids in the stomach and duodenum. Ulcers can be caused by: - Infection with a type of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - Use of painkillers (Motrin, Advil, Midol, and others), and many others available by prescription. Even aspirin coated with a special substance can still cause ulcers. - Excess acid production from gastrinomas, tumors of the acid producing cells of the stomach that increases acid output; seen in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. - More common, emotional stress related to frustration, resentment, and indecision which leads to low self-esteem and a lack of control over events will cause a person to have an increase in stomach stress and result in an increase in stomach acid. How Serious Are Ulcers/How Likely and Diagnosis How Serious Is an Ulcer? Though ulcers often heal on their own, you shouldn't ignore their warning signs. If not properly treated, ulcers can lead to serious health problems, including: - Bleeding - Perforation (a hole through the wall of the stomach) - Gastric outlet obstruction from swelling or scarring that blocks the passageway leading from the stomach to the small intestine. - Taking NSAIDs can cause any of the above without warning. The risk is especially concerning for the elderly and for those with a prior history of having peptic ulcer disease. Who Is More Likely to Get Ulcers? You may be more likely to develop ulcers if you: - Are infected with the H. pylori bacterium - Take NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and many others - Have a family history of ulcers - Have another illness, such as [liver](liver-disease.asp), [kidney](kidney-health.asp), or [lung disease](lung-disease.asp) - Drink alcohol regularly - Are 50 years old or older - Suffer from [Gallbladder stress](gall-bladder-condition.asp) related to frustration, indecision or resentment How Are Ulcers Diagnosed? Your doctor may be able to make an ulcer diagnosis just by talking with you about your symptoms. However, to confirm the diagnosis one of several tests should be taken. First, your doctor may ask you to take an acid-blocking medication such as those used to treat heartburn for a short period of time to see if your symptoms improve. If needed, your doctor may recommend a procedure called an upper endoscopy. It involves inserting a small, lighted tube (endoscope) through the throat and into the stomach to look for abnormalities. This procedure is usually given if you are having severe symptoms of ulcers. Often, doctors will frequently treat without confirming the diagnosis using endoscopy. If the cause is not likely to be from NSAIDs, then it is very likely to be from H. pylori. Most doctors will now test for H. pylori and will treat specifically for that in addition to giving medications to reduce the symptoms. How Are Ulcers Treated? How Are Ulcers Treated? Though ulcers often heal on their own, you shouldn't ignore their warning signs. If not properly treated, ulcers can lead to serious health problems. There are several ways in which ulcers can be treated, including making changes to one's lifestyle, consulting with a Holistic Chiropractor, taking medication, and/or undergoing surgery. Lifestyle Changes to Treat an Ulcer To treat an ulcer, first eliminate substances that can be causing the ulcers. If you smoke or drink alcohol, stop. If the ulcer is believed to be caused by the use of NSAIDs, they need to be stopped. The Medical Perspective Ulcer Medications As with any medication, certain side-effects are known and sometimes side-effects are not known. Since everyone is different, please consult with your medical doctor or pharmacist for any abnormal changes when taking medication. Taking medication to treat your symptoms, although it helps you feel better, it is not addressing the underlying cause and this may lead your condition getting worse or may lead to other concerns. Ulcer medications can include: - Proton pump medications (PPI). Proton pump medications reduce acid levels and allow the ulcer to heal. They include you have H. pylori infection, then antibiotics are used. There are multiple combinations of antibiotics that are taken for one to two weeks along with a PPI. Some doctors also recommend taking Pepto-Bismol. - Upper Endoscopy. Some bleeding ulcers can be treated through the endoscope. - Surgery. Sometimes an operation is needed if the ulcer has created a hole in the wall of the stomach or if there is serious bleeding. Will Drinking Milk Help Cure an Ulcer? No. Milk can make your ulcer worse. Milk provides brief relief of ulcer pain because it coats the stomach lining. But milk can also stimulate your stomach to produce more acid and digestive juices, which can aggravate ulcers.
