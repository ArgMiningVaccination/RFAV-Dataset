By using readily available, inherently non-toxic and non-flammable energy storage materials, Alsym is working to deliver wide-duration storage with performance comparable to lithium ion at a much lower cost, speeding the pace of decarbonization for people around the world. Markets We Serve - Short & Long-Duration Storage Short & Long-Duration Energy Storage Electricity generation is shifting to renewables, but solar and wind power must be backed up at scale to ensure 24/7 availability. High battery prices are slowing the pace of storage deployment, and storage integrators are competing with automakers for supply. Lithium-ion systems are mostly unsuitable for urbanized areas due to fire risks and production of highly toxic gases. Safer options exist, but most have low energy densities and low power with large footprints. Our low-cost non-lithium technology allows utilities and project owners to deploy sustainable storage without the need for subsidies, and non-flammable and non-toxic materials enable use in areas with high population densities. Alsym technology combines fast charge rates and user-configurable discharge durations with high round-trip efficiency in a minimal footprint for maximum energy and power with low LCOS. With high power density and on-demand user-configurable discharge rates, wide-duration Alsym batteries are an ideal solution for both short-duration and long-duration energy storage (LDES) needs. Marine, Maritime & Off-Shore There's little tolerance for hazardous battery chemistries in maritime applications. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, Alsym batteries are made from materials that are inherently non-flammable, reducing the risks to human life and cargo and helping to lower insurance costs and cumulative liabilities. Motorcyles, Scooters, & Two-Wheelers The global electric motorcycle and scooter market is set to triple by 2030. Today, over sixty million are sold every year, and most run on fossil fuels. Battery electric models are in demand, but buyers are extremely cost-sensitive and concerned about battery fires. Lithium-ion batteries in two wheelers can spontaneously combust due to poor heat dissipation\u2014a problem that will only get worse as the world warms. Our low-cost, non-flammable batteries are poised to be an ideal solution for the two-wheeler market, maximizing performance and profit margins while greatly improving rider safety. Electric Vehicles Even with recent advancements, the cost of lithium-ion batteries is roughly double what's needed for EVs to reach cost parity with comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This means that EVs are largely confined to the premium and luxury end of the market. Low-cost, high-performance Alsym batteries will enable global adoption of battery-electric vehicles across consumer and commercial segments. Energy storage technology without lithium and cobalt Our energy storage technology avoids many of the issues that surround lithium-ion batteries and uses no lithium or cobalt. Alsym energy storage batteries are non-flammable and non-toxic by design, using readily available materials. - News(31) - Press Releases(6) - All(37) As the world transitions toward clean energy to power our vehicles and buildings, technology is advancing faster than ever.
