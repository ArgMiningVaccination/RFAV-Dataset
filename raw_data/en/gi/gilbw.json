There is something for everyone and to suit all budgets with this glorious range. The simple answer is yes, as long as you know how to use them! Firstly, you need to understand what essential oils are. They are highly aromatic, volatile chemicals produced from the flowers, leaves, stems, roots of plants. Essentially they are the essence/life force of the plant. And these oils have therapeutic benefits which can affect us both physically and also mentally. Freya sees them as mother nature's rescue remedies. However, as they are chemicals we do have to be careful and should never apply directly on the skin or ingest (unless advised by a professional). In Freya Natural Therapy's range of products, the essential oils are carefully measured to be a completely safe, yet therapeutic dose. Only a selection of oils have been deemed safe for use during pregnancy. Our Freya Natural Therapy Simply Pregnant range has been designed for pregnant women once they have reached their second trimester. It contains a safe percentage of oils and only uses oils that have been deemed safe for you and your unborn baby. Are Freya Natural Therapy aromatherapy products safe for children? For children over the age of 3 it is OK to use the Simply Pregnant range as it has a safe percentage of essential oils. However, for children any younger, it is generally accepted as safe to diffuse essential oils around children from 6 months but only in very small doses eg 1-2 drops in a diffuser and stick to oils such as Lavender, Mandarin. There are important safety guidelines when it comes to which oils should be avoided when diffusing for babies and young children. These are: Eucalptus*, Peppermint, Cardamon, Ginger, Rosemary, Spike Lavender, Clove, Cinnamon, oils high in 1.8 cineole can cause CNS and breathing problems in young children - do not apply to or use near the face of infants or children under 10 years of age. (Tisserand and Young). This is a really important question. Essential oils are so concentrated that you really don't need much for them to be effective and its very common for people to put too many drops in. If you are diffusing for an adult, in a small diffuser a guide would be between between 4 and 6 drops, a large diffuser between 6-10 drops would be plenty but always check the manufacturers recommendations. However, if you have a baby (only diffuse over 6 months) as a guide just use 1 drop and do not diffuse for long - say 15 minutes. Again, for children under 5, 2-3 drops of oil for 15 minute internals is plenty and ensure the room is well ventilated. If the child is asleep turn the diffuser off and also never diffuse near the face "}
