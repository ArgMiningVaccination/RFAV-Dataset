To do this we provide a range of learning experiences: - Adviser of Studies Acts as a first point of contact for students with academic or personal issues that they may require guidance and/or support with. - E-Learning technologies Information associated with lectures and assignments is often communicated via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) called Canvas. Recordings of lectures are made available after lectures on this platform. A range of e-learning experiences are also embedded in the degree programme through the use of, for example, interactive support materials, podcasts and web-based learning activities. - Induction A formalised induction for all undergraduate students. For Stage 1 students, this includes several the week before the programme begins to allow students to familiarise themselves with the campus and the degree programme and their fellow classmates. During Stage 1 there are a number of follow-up sessions throughout the year. Topics such as academic writing, referencing, plagiarism, communication skills, examination preparation and managing time effectively are all covered in these practical sessions. - Lectures These introduce foundation information about new topics as a starting point for further self-directed private study/reading. As the module progresses this information becomes more complex. Lectures, which are normally delivered in large groups to all year-group peers, also provide opportunities to ask questions and seek clarification on key issues as well as gain feedback and advice on assessments. Additional guest lectures are also delivered by researchers or experts in their fields. - Peer Mentoring Scheme Whereby students in second and third year of their degree programme volunteer to mentor Stage 1 students. This informal interaction helps with transition from School to University with the help of trained and enthusiastic fellow students. - Practical laboratory Biomedical Science has practical classes contributing to most modules, and the hands-on experience is hugely popular with our students. In the first year this includes extensive work in Physiology, Anatomy, Molecular Biology and Microbiology. Further advanced and clinical experience is offered in 2nd and 3rd year and includes visits to NHS laboratories. - Self-directed study This is an essential part of life as a Queen's student when important private reading, engagement with e-learning resources, reflection on feedback to date and assignment research and preparation work is carried out. Through this, students become independent learners. - Seminars/tutorials In these sessions, the class is split into small groups (typically 4-5 students). These sessions are designed to explore, in more depth, the information that has been presented in the lectures. This provides students with the opportunity to engage closely with academic staff who have specialist knowledge of the topic, to ask questions of them and to assess their own progress and understanding with the support of their peers. - Summer Studentships Competitively available to students (usually 6-8) about to move into 2nd or 3rd year, these studentships provide additional hands on laboratory experience in one of our research laboratories for up to 6 weeks over the summer breaks, and are useful for general laboratory experience as well as for skills to be employed in 3rd year projects. - Third year Supervised Projects Based on choices made from the list of projects available each year, students are assigned their third year project, usually carried out as a valued member of a research group in one of our World-leading Research Centres within the Faculty, over the course of two semesters. This will often involve designing and conducting of experiments, presenting data and analysing it in the context of the area of research. In addition to the submitted write-up, our students regularly get the opportunity to present their results at scientific meetings or are included as part of a full paper publication. Assessment Details of assessments associated with this course are outlined below: - Assessment will vary according to the Learning Objectives of each module. Some modules are assessed solely through project work or written assignments. Others are assessed through a combination of coursework and end of semester examinations. Details of how each module is assessed are shown in the Student Handbook which is provided to all students during their first year induction. Students are assigned an Advisor of Studies who can advise on personal and academic matters. Feedback As you progress through your course you will receive general and specific feedback about your work from a variety of sources including lecturers, module co-ordinators, personal tutors, Advisors of Study and your peers. As a university student, you will be expected to take a greater role in reflecting on this and taking the initiative in continuously improving the quality of your work. - Feedback provided via formal written comments and marks relating to work that you, as an individual or as part of a group, have submitted. Face to face comment. This may include occasions when you make use of the lecturers' advertised \"office hours\" to help you to address a specific query. On-line or e-mailed comment. General comments or question and answer opportunities at the end of a lecture, seminar or tutorial. Pre-submission advice regarding the standards you should aim for and common pitfalls to avoid. In some instances, this may be provided in the form of model answers or exemplars which you can review in your own time. Feedback and outcomes from practical classes. Comment and guidance provided by staff from specialist support services such as, Careers, Employability and Skills or the Learning Development Service. Once you have reviewed your feedback, you are encouraged to identify and implement further improvements to the quality of your work.

The four main tissue types are covered but the focus in each is on the structural components of cells that characterise whole tissues and how such elements are impacted by disease and its treatment. In recent years it has been recognised that surgical biopsy material represents a huge reservoir of disease-specific information, little of which is exploited in routine histopathology. The ability to localise specific proteins by immunohistochemistry is constantly translating more basic research to the diagnostic setting and large studies are already utilising gene expression profiles from biopsy material to obtain full molecular signatures of particular tumours with far-reaching implications for accurate targeting of increasingly expensive modern therapies. Haematology in health and disease will also be covered as this is an area that has been revolutionised by the introduction of cell and molecular biological techniques. Haematology was among the first branches of medicine to embrace molecular biology through work on haemoglobin, chromosomal rearrangements, growth factors, oncogenes and molecular therapeutics. This module seeks to equip our students with the knowledge base to embrace such advances and to play innovative roles in their development. Learning Outcomes On completion of this module the successful student should be able to: 1. Discuss how the ultrastructural elements common to all cells and tissues relate to their cell and tissue-specific roles. 2. Describe the process by which unspecialized cells change into specialized cells with distinctive structural and functional characteristics, using specialised tissue types and organ systems as examples 3. Design and appraise experimental approaches for the evaluation of hypotheses in Biomedical Research 4. Appraise the relative value of the cytoskeleton, cell junctions, and organelles in terms of their cell, tissue and organ-specific functions, and their constituent proteins using molecular models 5. Discuss cell and matrix proteins as products and targets of disease 6. Evaluate the cellular and molecular bases of modern research in haematology 7. Discuss how the study of haemoglobin exemplifies the development of molecular medicine 8. Summarise how defects in cellular and molecular processes can lead to haematological disorders 9. Evaluate how current research may lead to a better understanding of normal and abnormal blood cell function and the rational design of molecular therapeutic strategies 10. Discuss trends in drug design and other therapeutic approaches in haematological disorders Skills Transferable Skills: 1. Problem solving and critical analysis of information 2.

For applicants offering Irish Leaving Certificate, please note that performance at Junior Certificate is taken into account. For last year's entry applicants for this degree must have had, a minimum of 5 IJC grades C/Merit, though this profile may change from year to year depending on the demand for places. The Selector also checks that any specific entry requirements in terms of Leaving Certificate subjects can be satisfied. Offers are normally made on the basis of three A-levels. Two subjects at A-level plus two at AS would also be considered. The offer for repeat candidates is normally one grade higher than for first time applicants. Grades may be held from the previous year. Applicants offering two A-levels and one BTEC Subsidiary Diploma/National Extended Certificate (or equivalent qualification) will also be considered. Offers will be made in terms of the overall BTEC grade(s) awarded. Please note that a maximum of one BTEC Subsidiary Diploma/National Extended Certificate (or equivalent) will be counted as part of an applicant's portfolio of qualifications. The normal GCSE profile will be expected. A-level General Studies and A-level Critical Thinking would not normally be considered as part of a three A-level offer and, although they may be excluded where an applicant is taking four A-level subjects, the grade achieved could be taken into account if necessary in August/September. Applicants offering other qualifications, such as relevant BTEC Higher National Certificates (HNC) and BTEC Higher National Diplomas (HND), will also be considered. A relevant HNC/HND is defined as a course with substantial relevant Biology and/or Chemistry content (eg HNC/HND Science (Applied Biology), HNC/HND Applied Biology, HNC/HND Applied Biological Sciences, etc).
