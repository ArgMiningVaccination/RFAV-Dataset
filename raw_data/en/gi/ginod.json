These minimum standards: were developed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) with the assistance of child -care operations, parents, stakeholders, and other experts in a variety of fields; reflect what the citizens of Texas consider reasonable and minimum; and meet the guidelines set forth in Chapter 42 of the Texas Human Resources Code (law) fo r what must be included in the minimum standards. The Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act requires that proposed minimum standards be published for public comment before they are adopted as rules. All members of the public, including providers , are encouraged to provide input when proposed minimum standards are published for public comment. The commission considers recommendations from interested persons or groups in formulating the final draft, which is filed as rules with the Secretary of St ate. Deficiencies A deficiency is any failure to comply with a minimum standard, rule in Texas Administrative Code Chapter 745, law, specific term of the permit, or specific condition of probation or suspension. Weights The minimum standards and rules are weighted based on a common understanding of the risk to children presented if the standard or rule is violated. The weights are high, medium -high, medium, medium -low, and low. The assigned weights do not change based on the scope or severity of an actual deficiency. Scope and severity are assessed by Child Care Regulation (CCR) staff, documented, and considered in conjunction with the weight when making CCR decisions. You will see the weight is noted at the end of each st andard or subsection in green. Only those minimum standards and rules which can be cited as a deficiency are weighted. For example, the minimum standard prohibiting physical discipline is weighed but standards that are definitions are not weighted. 5 Revised: 3/29/2023Maintai ning Compliance It is essential that you, your employees, and your caregivers recognize four critical aspects of CCR's efforts to protect the children in care and to help operation employees and caregivers comply with the law, rules, and standards. The fou r aspects are: Inspection Technical assistance Investigations Caregiver's rights and entitlements The Inspection Various aspects of regulated operations are evaluated for compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law during regular inspections. The emphasis on these inspections is to prevent risk to children in care. The frequency of inspections will fluctuate depending on the type of permit and the operation's history of compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law. During any inspection, if we find that your operation does not meet minimum standard, rule, or law, the deficiencies are discussed with the person in charge at the time of the inspection. You will be given an opportunity to correct deficiencies within a specified period of time. If you have questions, concerns, or disagree with the citation, we encourage you to talk with us before we leave your operation. If your concerns are not resolved, you may request an administrative review. Technical Assistance We are available to offer c onsultation to potential applicants, applicants, and permit holders regarding how to comply with minimum standards, rules, and laws. While we most often provide technical assistance during inspections and investigations, technical assistance can be request ed at any time. The Child Care Regulation section of the HHSC website has a Technical Assistance Library that allows you to view or download information about a variety of topics related to child care. You can view it by going to https://hhs.texas.gov/doi ng-business -hhs/provider -portals/protective -services - providers/child -care-licensing and selecting Technical Assistance Library from the Resources section. A feature of the minimum standards publication are the Technical Assistance boxes that follow certain minimum standards to provide additional guidance, clarification, resources, and/or best practices related to the applicable rule. 6 Revised: 3/29/2023Investigations When a report alleges a violation of minimum standards, rule, or law, CCR must investigate the report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation results within prescribed time frames. When a report alleges abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the Department of Family and Protective Services must investigate the re port, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation results within prescribed time frames. Your Rights and Entitlements Waivers and Variances You may request a waiver if your operation is unable to comply with a standard for economic reasons. You may request a variance if your operation wishes to meet the intent of a standard in a way that is different from what the standard specifies. Waiver and variance requests are submitted through your online provider account or made in writing to your assigned CCR inspector. Administrative Review If you disagree with a CCR decision or action, you may request an administrative review, during which you are given an opportunity to show compliance with applicable minimum standard , rule, law, action, permit restriction(s) and/or permit condition(s). Appeals You may request an appeal hearing on a CCR decision to deny an application, revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew a permit or a condition placed on the permit after initial issuan ce. Appeal hearings are conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH). For Further Information It is important that you, your employees, and your caregivers clearly understand the purpose of minimum standards and the reasons for CCR's inspections and investigations. Do not hesitate to ask us questions that will help you understand any aspect of our regulation.

(g) For an assistant caregiver or substitute caregiver described in \u00a7747.1303(4)(B) of this division, at least five of the required 24 annual training hours must come from instructor -led training. The remaining 19 required annual training hours may come from s elf-instructional training, of which no more than three hours may come from self - study training [Medium -Low]. (h) Annual training is exclusive of any requirements for orientation, pediatric first aid and pediatric CPR training, transportation safety training, and any training received through a high school child -care work -study program. Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (b)(1), annual training in child growth and development includes the major domains of child development, which are: o Cognitive development; o Social development; o Emotional development; o Physical development; and o Approaches to learning. Regarding paragraph (d), a caregiver is required to have annual training in topic areas (d)(1) -(d)(6), but the child -care home can determine how many hours a caregiver must have in each of those topics, based on the length of the training, caregiver experi ence, caregiver duties, etc. For example, the caregiver may have one hour of training in each topic area, or one hour in emergency preparedness, one hour in communicable disease prevention, two hours in medication administration, etc. 88 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph ( e), additional examples that may fall within the required categories include child mental health, social and emotional learning, and positive behavior interventions and supports. Regarding paragraphs (f) and (g), CCR will only evaluate the number of requir ed training hours an assistant or substitute caregiver completes. As long as: o An assistant or substitute caregiver in a registered child -care home has at least three hours of instructor -led training; or o An assistant or substitute caregiver in a licensed child-care home has at least five hours of instructor -led training. An assistant or substitute caregiver who exceeds the minimum number of required hours can complete the extra hours through instructor -led or self -instructional training as determined by the primary caregiver. Regarding paragraphs (f) and (g), most of a caregiver's training should come from sources that allow an assessment of the caregiver's understanding and feedback from an instructor. While self -study from materials such a s videos, books, and articles provides an opportunity for a caregiver to expand knowledge on subjects of interest to him or her and for which there may not be an established training, this type of training does not assess what the caregiver learned. It is important that the majority of training come from sources that allow an assessment of the caregiver's understanding and feedback from an instructor to ensure that the caregiver appropriately applies the information learned in a child care setting. \u00a7747.1309. What areas of training must the annual training for the primary caregiver cover? Subchapter D, Personnel Division 4, Professional Development March 2023 (a) You must obtain at least 30 clock hours of training each year relevant to the ag e of the children for whom you provide care. [Medium] (b) At least six clock hours of the annual training hours must be in one or more of the following topics: (1) Child growth and development [Medium] ; 89 Revised: 3/29/2023(2) Guidance and discipline [Medium] ; (3) Age-appropriate curriculum [Medium] ; and (4) Teacher -child interaction.

(j) The 30 clock hours of annual training are exclusive o f any requirements for the Licensing pre -application course, pediatric first aid and pediatric CPR training, and transportation safety training. 91 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Research has shown that caregivers who are better trained are better able to prevent, recognize, and correct health and safety problems. Annual ongoing training provides caregivers an opportunity to learn the newest techniques for addressing children's behaviors, to discover the latest findings on what children need as they develop, and to refresh and re -energize their skills. Some re-training on previously studied topics is necessary to keep skills and knowledge up-to-date. Regarding paragraph (b)(1), annual training in child growth and development includes the major domains of child development, which are: o Cognitive development; o Social development; o Emotional development; o Physical development; and o Approaches to learning. Regarding paragraph (d), a primary caregiver is required to have annual training in topic areas (d)(1) -(d)(6), but the primary caregiver can determine how many hours the primary caregiver must have in each of those topics, based on length of training, primary caregiver experience, etc. For example, the primary caregiver may have one hour of training in each topic area, or one hour in emergency preparedness, one hour in communicable disease prevention, two hours in medication administration, etc. Regarding paragraph (i), CCR will only evaluate the number of required training hours a primary careg iver completes. As long as a primary caregiver has at least six hours of instructor -led training, a primary caregiver who exceeds the minimum number of required hours can complete the extra hours through instructor -led or self -instructional training as det ermined by the primary caregiver. Regarding paragraph (i), most of a primary caregiver's training should come from sources that allow an assessment of the primary caregiver's understanding and feedback from an instructor. While self -study from materials su ch as videos, books, and articles provides an opportunity for a primary caregiver to expand knowledge on subjects of interest to him or her and for which there may not be an established training, this type of training does not assess what the primary careg iver learned. It is important that the majority of training come from sources that allow an assessment of the primary caregiver's understanding and feedback from an instructor to ensure that the primary caregiver appropriately applies the information learn ed in a child care setting. 92 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.1311. When must the annual training be obtained? Subchapter D, Personnel Division 4, Professional Development April 2017 (a) The annual training for a primary caregiver must be obtained within 12 months from the date you are r egistered or licensed with us and during each subsequent 12 -month period. [Low] (b) The annual training for each assistant caregiver and substitute caregiver must be obtained within 12 months from the date of the caregiver's employment and during each subsequent 12 -month period. [Low] (c) If a caregiver obtains more than the minimum number of annual training clock hours required, the caregiver may not carry the additional hours over to the next year. \u00a7747.1313. Who must have pediatric first -aid and pediatric CPR training? Subchapter D, Personnel Division 4, Professional Development October 2018 (a) The primary caregiver, each substitute caregiver, and each assistant caregiver must have a current certifi cate of training with an expiration or renewal date in: (1) Pediatric first aid with rescue breathing and choking [Medium -High] ; and (2) Pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). [Medium -High] (b) The pediatric CPR: (1) Must adhere to the guidelines for CPR for a layperson established by the American Heart Association, and consist of a curriculum that incudes use of a CPR manikin and both written and hands -on skill -based instruction, practice, and testing [Medium - High] ; and (2) May be provided through blended learning that utilizes online technology, including self-instructional training, as long as the criteria in paragraph (1) of this subsection is met. 93 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, knowledge of pediatric first aid, including management of a blocked airway and rescue breathing and the confidence to use these skills, are critically important to the outcome of an emergency situation. The pediatric CPR training obtained from resources that meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) will help ensure that the techniques and information the caregiver receives is up to date. Due to the risk of fraudulent CPR and First Aid courses, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends individuals check with their employer about the course completion cards the employer accepts before paying anyone for CPR and First Aid courses. The AHA furth er clarifies: \" The American Heart Association does not approve training courses created by other organizations, does not allow its course completion cards to be given to students who do not complete the skills check portion of American Heart Association tr aining, and there are no \"AHA -compliant\" training courses or \"AHA -certified\" professionals conducting training. An organization that has been approved to issue cards with the AHA logo upon successful completion of an AHA training course should display the \"Authorized Training Center\" logo to help you know they are authorized.\" \u00a7747.1314. What additional training must an employee and caregiver have if the home transports children? Subchapter D, Personnel Division 4, Professional Development October 2018 (a) If the home transports children whose chronological or developmental age is younger than nine years old, two clock hours of annual transportation safety training is required for: (1) Each employee prior to transporting a child [Medium -High] ; and (2) The primary caregiver.

As with administrative duties, a caregiver who is engaged in these tasks is not fully available to the children in care and is unable to supervise and interact with them in a way that meets their needs and keeps them safe. Regarding paragraph (4)(C), a child -care home may use an electronic device, such as a cell phone or tablet, so that th e caregiver can record daily attendance, document a child's day, take photographs for parents, etc. However, the caregiver cannot use any electronic device for personal reasons such as texting, using social media, internet browsing, checking email, etc., e xcept as otherwise specified in th e rule. 104 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.1503. What responsibilities does a caregiver have when supervising a child or children? Subchapter D, Personnel Division 6, General Responsibilit ies for Caregivers and Household Members March 2023 (a) The caregiver is responsible for: (1) Knowing which children the caregiver is responsible for [High] ; (2) Knowing how many children the caregiver is responsible for [High] ; (3) Knowing each child's name and having information showing each child's age [Medium-High] ; (4) Providing the level of supervision necessary to ensure each child's safety and well-being, including physical proximity and auditory or visual awareness of each child's on going activity as appropriate [High] ; and (5) Being able to intervene when necessary to ensure each child's safety [High] . (b) In deciding how closely to supervise a child, the caregiver must take into account: (1) The child's chronological age ; (2) The child's current stage of development ; (3) The child's individual differences and abilities ; (4) The indoor and outdoor layout of the operation; (5) The circumstances, hazards, and risks surrounding the child; and (6) The child's physical, mental, emotional, and social needs . Technical Assistance Supervision is basic to the prevention of harm. Parents have an understanding that caregivers will supervise their children in their absence. Adults who are attentive and understand young children's behaviors are in the best position to safeguard their well - being. A primary caregiver can also establish an understanding with parents rega rding who (when the parent and when the caregiver) is responsible for the child while the parent and the child are both on the grounds . These understandings could be laid out in the enrollment agreement. 105 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the caregiver must always know which children he or she is responsible for as well as how many children are in his or her care. This requirement is critical, especially during transitions, to ensure all children are accounted for and appropriately supervised. 106 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 1, Determining Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes \u00a7747.1601. What is child/caregiver ratio? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 1, Determining Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes September 2003 The child/caregiver ratio is the maximum number of children one caregiver may be responsible for. \u00a7747.1603. How do I determine child/caregiver ratio? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Size s Division 1, Determining Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes December 2010 In determining child/caregiver ratio, the following apply: (1) The total number of children you may supervise is determined by the ages of the children in the child -care home. [Medium -Low] (2) You may use the developmental or emotional age, rather than the chronological age, of a child with special care needs, if this is recommended by a health -care professional or a qualified professional and is documented in the child's record. [Medium -Low] (3) All children present, including children related to you, assistant and substitute caregiver's children, and drop -in and part -time children must be counted in the child/caregiver ratio, by age of the child, regardless of the length of time they a re present. [Medium] (4) You must also count neighborhood children visiting your child -care home, if you are responsible for their care and supervision in the absence of the parent. [Medium] 107 Revised: 3/29/2023(5) In a registered child -care home, you may count a child who is at leas t four years of age and attending a pre -kindergarten program away from the home during the customary school day in the same way children five years old and older who are in care after school hours are counted. The pre-kindergarten program must be operated by or in collaboration with the local school district. [Medium] Technical Assistance Research has shown that when caregivers have fewer children to supervise and the group size is limited it reduces the likelihood of injuries and illness in children and increases opportunities for positive interaction with children. Excessive numbers of young children may also increase the danger of high caregiver stress and l oss of control. \u00a7747.1605. May I ever care for more than 12 children in my registered or licensed child -care home? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 1, Determining Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes September 2003 No. The total number of children in care must never exceed 12, and may be fewer than 12 depending on the ages of the children in the child -care home. This number includes all children present in the child -care home and any children in your care away from the child- care home, such as those on a field trip or being transported. [Medium] \u00a7747.1607. May I reduce the number of caregivers supervising children during naptime? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 1, Determining Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes September 2003 No. You may not reduce the number of caregivers while children are napping. [Medium -High] 108 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.1609. May I adjust the child/caregiver ratio when I am opening and closing my child -care home?

Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 3, Regular Ratios and Group Sizes in the Licensed Child -Care Home September 2003 If your child-care home is licensed and more than two caregivers are present caring for the children, then you may care for 12 children of any age from birth through 13 years. [Medium -High] 115 Revised: 3/29/2023Division 4, Ratios for Field Trips \u00a7747.1901. Do I need additional caregivers when I take children away from my licensed or registered child -care home for field trips or walks? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 4, Ratios for Field Trips September 2003 (a) When childr en are on a field trip and are mixing with children and adults who are not from your child -care home, including but not limited to, trips to the skating rink, shopping, public park, or amusement park, you must meet the following child/caregiver ratio [Medi um-High] : Ratios for Field Trips Mixing with Other Children or Adults Away from the Child -Care Home If the age of the youngest child in the group is... Then you must have (Number) adults to supervise... Every (Number) children 0 through 23 months 1 3 2 years 1 6 3 years 1 6 4 years 1 9 5 years 1 11 6 years and older 1 12 (b) The child/caregiver ratio for field trips may include adult volunteers or household members who are not qualified as caregivers only for trips when children are mixing with children and adults who are not from your child -care home, as long as you maintain at least the regular ratio for your registered or licensed child-care home, as applicable, with qualified caregivers. [Medium -High] 116 Revised: 3/29/2023(c) You must maintain the regular child/caregiver ratio specified in this subchapter for registered and licensed child -care homes, as applicable, when children are on a field trip in an enclosed controlled area, including but not limited to, events planned only for your group such as libra ry story time, tours of the fire department, or on a walk in the neighborhood. [Medium] Technical Assistance Field trips involve higher risk to children and require increased supervision by adults. Injuries and serious incidents are more likely to occur when a child's surroundings change or when there is a change in routine. When children are excited or busy playing in unfamiliar areas, they are likely to forget safety measures unless they are closely supervised. \u00a7747.1903. If I provide transportat ion, how many caregivers must I have in the vehicle to supervise the children? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 4, Ratios for Field Trips September 2003 (a) You must have one caregiver in addition to the driver if you transport mor e than four children who are younger than 24 months. [Medium -High] (b) When you transport children two years and older, you must comply with the regular child/caregiver ratio. The driver may be counted in this ratio if the driver meets the caregiver qualifications. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Research indicates motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death in children in the United States. Additional adults are needed when transporting younger children to free the driver from the distraction of supervising children while driving, and to assist in the evacuation and supervision of children in case of an accident or breakdown. 117 Revised: 3/29/2023Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities \u00a7747.2001. Must I have additional caregivers for wading/splashing activities? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities September 2003 (a) Whenever children use a wading or splashing pool (two feet of water or less), you must use the child/caregiver ratio for wading/splashing activities for all children in care. [Medium -High] (b) If there is more than one child under 24 months in care, a second adult must be present. [High] (c) The maximum number of children one caregiver can supervise while children use a splashing or wading pool (two feet of water or less) is based on the age of the youngest child in the group and is specified in the following chart [Medium -High] : Ratio for Splashing or Wading Pools (Less Than Two Feet Deep) If the age of the youngest child is...

Must I have a certified lifeguard on duty when children are swimming in more than two feet of water? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities September 2003 Yes. When children are swimming in more than two feet of water, a certified lifeguard must be on duty at all times. [High] \u00a7747.2011. May I count the certified lifeguard in the child/caregiver ratio? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities September 2003 (a) You must not count the certified lifeguard in the child/caregiver ratio when people other than the children from your child -care home are swimming. [Medium -High] (b) If only children from your child -care home are swimming, you may count the certified lifeguard in the child/caregiver ratio, although the lifeguard must never be left alone with any of the children unless the lifeguard is also a qualified caregiver for your child care home. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance The lifeguard has the necessary skills to rescue a child in distress; however, being responsible for assisting and supervising children who are in the water at the same time may take away from their ability to react quickly in an emergency. 120 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2013. Must persons who are counted in the child/caregiver ratio during swimming know how to swim ? Subchapter E , Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities September 2003 Yes. Each person included in the child/caregiver ratio for swimming in two feet of water or more must be able to swim and must be prepared to do so in an emerge ncy. [High] Technical Assistance The ability to swim is crucial to adequate supervision and safety of children and allows a caregiver to intervene when necessary to protect the child. \u00a7747.2015. May I include volunteers or household members who do not meet minimum qualifications for caregivers in the child/caregiver ratio for water activities? Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes Division 5, Ratios for Water Activities September 2003 Yes. To meet the child/caregiver ratio for splashing/wading and swimming activities, you may include adult volunteers and adult household members who do not meet the minimum qualifications for caregivers specified in Subchapter D of this chapter (relating to Personnel), provided that [Medium -High] : (1) You maintain at least the child/caregiver ratios required in Division 2 of this subchapter (relating to Regular Ratios and Group Sizes in the Registered Child -Care Home), or Division 3 of this subchapter (relating to Regular Ratios and Group Sizes in the Licensed Child -Care Home), as applicable, with caregivers who do meet the minimum qualifications for caregivers [Medium -High] ; (2) All persons included in the ratios for water activities must be able to swim and must be prepared to do so in an emergency [High] ; and (3) You ensure compliance with all other minimum standards, including, but not limited to, standards relating to supervision, discipline, and guidance.

What must I consider when providing planned activities for the children in my child -care home? Subcha pter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan March 2023 You must provide a planned program of activities designed to meet the individual needs and developmental levels of the children in the group. [Medium] Technical Assistance Research has shown that learning in young children is the result of interaction between the child's thoughts and experiences with materials, ideas, and people. The quality of these interactions is enhanced by providing structure and a variety of opportunities to practice and explore new skills. While planning children's activities, keep in mind the diverse and ever -changing developmental needs of children, the abilit ies and interests of the children in the group and the importance of children's play in developing physically, emotionally, intellectually and socially. \u00a7747.2102. What written ac tivity plans must I follow? Subchapter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan December 2010 (a) You must develop and follow a written activity plan that complies with \u00a7747.2103 of this subchapter (relating to What must a written activity plan include?). [Medium] (b) The activity plan must include all children in the group regardless of special care needs . [Medium] Technical Assistance Planning daily activities ensures the children have a variety of activities that meet their developmental needs. A written activity plan helps to clarify for parents the services a home provides and also provides the caregi ver with a guideline to follow. 123 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2103. What must a written activity plan include? Subchapter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan March 2021 (a) A written activity plan must : (1) List the dates (daily, weekly, or monthly) the plan covers [Medium] ; (2) Outline the specific daily activities, as required by \u00a7747.2104 of this subchapter (relating to What specific activities must I include in a written activity plan?) [Medium] ; (3) Include suff icient time for activities and routines so that children can progress at their own developmental rate; and [Medium] ; (4) Not include long waiting periods between activities or prolonged periods during which children stand or sit. [Medium] ; (b) A written activity plan may include one or more screen time activities, as specified in \u00a7747.2105 of this subchapter (relating to May I use a screen time activity with a child?), if you also include alternative activities for children who do not want to participate . [Medium] Technical Assistance Research indicates children receive significantly more developmental benefits from attending child-care that offers a variety of activities addressing emotional, social, intellectual, and physical development. A planned but flexible program that allows children to make decisions about their activities fosters independence and creative expression. \u00a7747.2104. What specific activities must I include in a written activity plan? Subchapter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan March 2021 (a) You must include these daily activities in your written activity plan: (1) A minimum of two daily opportunities for outdoor play, weather permitting, in which a child makes use of both small and large muscles [Medium] ; 124 Revised: 3/29/2023(2) A balance of active and quiet play that incorporates group and individual activities both indoors and outdoors [Medium] ; (3) Child-initiated activities where: (A) The equipment, materials, and supplies are within reach of the child [Medium] ; and (B) The child chooses the activity on the child's own initiative [Medium] ; (4) Caregiver -initiated activities that the caregiver directs or chooses, at least two of which must promote movement [Medium] ; (5) Regular meal and snack times as specified in Subchapter Q of this Chapter (relating to Nutrition and Food Service) [Medium] ; and (6) Supervised naptimes or rest times. [Medium] (b) Your written activity plan must also include the approximate times that each child may engage in outdoor play and moderate to vigorous active play, as provided in Fig ure 26 TAC \u00a7747.2104(b). [Medium] Figure: 26 TAC \u00a7747.2104(b) Type of Play Amount of Time a Child May Engage in Activities (1) A minimum of two daily opportunities for outdoor play, weather permitting, in which the child makes use of both small and large muscles (A) An infant birth through 12 months of age may engage in outdoor play for an amount of time as tolerated by the infant; and (B) An infant 13 months through 17 months of age, a toddler, or a pre -kindergarten age child must engage in outdoor play for a minimum of 60 total minutes daily. 125 Revised: 3/29/2023Type of Play Amount of Time a Child May Engage in Activities (2) Opportunities for active play that incorporate group and individual activities both indoors and outdoors (A) A toddler must engage in moderate to vigorous active play for a minimum of 60 minutes daily; and (B) A pre -kindergarten age child must engage in moderate to vigorous active play for a minimum of 90 minutes daily. (c) Children in your care must be able to engage in outdoor and active play for the times provided in subsection (b) if your home: (1) Has more than one caregiver [Medium] ; or (2) Only cares for one age range of children described in subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. For example, if your home does not care for an infant birth through 12 months of age, you must allow the children i n your care to engage in outdoor play for 60 total minutes. [Medium] (d) If your home only has one caregiver and cares for more than one age range of children described in subsection (b)(1) and(b)(2) of this section, children in care must engage in outdoor and active play for the time required for the younger age group. [Medium] 126 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (b)(1) of this section and outdoor play: o For an infant from birth through 12 months of age, there is no recommended total minutes of outdoor play; o You may divide the total minutes of outdoor play into shorter time frames that total 60 minutes; o You may accommodate weather and air quality by adjusting the scheduled outdoor play, the length of time outdoors, and children's clothing; o When you shorten or cancel outdoor play to accommodate weather or air quality, you should increase the time of indoor physical activity so the total amount of physical activity remains the same; and o You should incorporate opportunities to actively enjoy physic al activity into part -time programs by prorating these requirements accordingly (e.g. 20 minutes of outdoor play for every three hours at the center). o Regarding paragraph (b)(2) of this section and active play: Opportunities for active play may overlap wit h outdoor play and do not need to be counted separately (e.g. 30 minutes of active outdoor play that includes moderate to vigorous physical activity may be counted toward the required 60 or 90 minutes of active play). Outdoor play provides for greater free dom and flexibility, fuller expression through loud talk, and a greater range of active movement. Outdoor play also extends opportunities for large muscle development, social -emotional development, and small muscle development by offering variety, challeng e, and complexity in ways that are not attainable in a confined indoor space. \u00a7747.2105. May I use a screen time activity with a child ? Subchapter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan March 2021 (a) You may not use a screen time activity for a child under the age of two years . [Medium] (b) You may use a screen time activity to supplement, but not to replace, an activity with a child who is two years old or older that is described in \u00a7747.2407 of this chapter (relating to What activities must I provi de for a toddler?), \u00a7747.2507 of this chapter (relating to What activities must I provide for a pre -kindergarten age child?), and \u00a7747.2607 of this chapter (relating to What activities must I provide for a school -age child?). [Medium] 127 Revised: 3/29/2023(c) If you use a screen t ime activity for a child at your home, you must ensure that the activity : (1) Is related to the planned activities that meet educational goals [Medium] ; (2) Is age -appropriate [Medium] ; and (3) Does not exceed one hour per day [Medium] ; (4) Is not used during mealtime, sn ack times, naptimes, or rest times [Medium] ; (5) Does not include advertising or violence [Medium] ; and (6) Is turned off when not in use. [Medium] (d) A school -age child may use screen time without restriction for homework. [Medium] Technical Assistance The requirements for screen time activities are consistent with the Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards, 4th Edition . For children under the age of two no media time is recommended since during the first two years of life children's brains and bodies are going through critical periods of growth and development. It is important that very young children have positive social interactions with their parents and caregivers instead of through media time that takes away from these vital interactions. Excessive media use has been associated with lags in achievement of knowledge and skills, as well as negative impacts on sleep, weight, and social and emotional health. Children should view screen time activities with an adult who can help the children apply what they are learning to the world around them. Research indicates that screen time is most appropriate and offers the most benefit when children are actively engaged with the content they are viewing. Labeling objects, identifying people on screen, a nd asking questions are all active viewing strategies that maximize children's learning during screen time. Caregivers serve as role models and should not be using digital media that is not directly involved in the care of children. Also see \u00a7747.1501(c)(6 )(C) of this chapter, which does not allow caregivers to use personal electronic devices, such as cell phones, tablets, and video games that are not directly involved in the teaching, care, or supervision of children in care. Cell phones may be used briefl y for necessary phone calls, as long as appropriate supervision is maintained. 128 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Screen time activities apply to media content a child views. Listening to music playing on a television is not included as a screen time activity as long as the child is not watching videos or a display that accompanies the music. Regarding paragraph (c)(3), the one hour limit on screen time does not apply to field trips away from the home. Regarding paragraph (d), homework refers to assignments given by a child's public, private, or charter school teacher that are intended to be completed outside of regular school hours. Homework does not include work assigned by the child -care home. \u00a7747.2107. What are my responsibilities when planning activities for a child in care wit h special care needs? Subchapter F, Developmental Activities and Activity Plan March 202 3 You must: (1) Provide a child with special care needs with the accommodations recommended by [Medium - High] : (A) A health -care professional; or (B) A qualified professional affiliated with the local school district or early childhood intervention program; (2) Utilize as recommended any adaptive equipment that has been provided to the home for a child's use [Medium -High] ; (3) Ensure that a child who receives early intervention services or special education services can receive those services from a qualified service provider at your home, with parental request and approval [Medium -High] ; (4) Ensure that activities integrate children with and without special care needs [Medium -High] ; and (5) Ensure that caregivers adapt equipment and procedures and vary methods as necessary t o ensure that you care for a child with special needs in a natural environment [Medium -High] . 129 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Research has shown that children with disabilities benefit from learning alongside their peers in high -quality inclusive settings. One study found that young children with disabilities in high -quality inclusive early childhood programs made larger gains in their cognitive, communication, and social -emotional development compared to their peers in segregated setting s. In addition, inclusion has benefits for all children, not just children with disabilities. Young children without disabilities who participate in an inclusive classroom learn life skills such as empathy and compassion. Child-care programs can be a great resource for parents who hav e questions about their child's development and specialized services available in the community. In order to best serve parents who have questions about their child's development, a child -care home should make available to pare nts information regarding early intervention services in the community. Access to such information enables parents to request an evaluation of their child's development from experts who are qualified to assess the child's development and recommend appropri ate services for the child. Early Childhood Intervention Services (ECI) has additional information regarding the specific services they provide, as well as locations in your community. If a child's parent has shared with the child -care home an Individualized Educational Program (IEP) from a school district or an Individualized Family Service Plan (ISFP) from ECI, the child -care home should make every effort t o incorporate the plan, where applicable, into the child's daily activities. The child -care home is not responsible for the purchase or maintenance of adaptive equipment recommended for a child. The child -care home is not responsible for ensuring ECI or another qualified service provider visits the home to provide services. However, the child will receive the benefit of services in a natural environment and the caregiver will learn methods for best serving the child when the home encourages caregivers to incorporate ECI or another service provider into activities. A child -care home is considered a place of public accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title III, because it holds itself out to the public as a business. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title III (Title 3) & Child Care Operations - FAQ and Commonly Asked Questions About Child Care Centers and the Americans with Disabilities Act have additional information regarding ADA and child -care operations. 130 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants \u00a7747.2301. What are the basic care requirements for infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 Basic care for infants must include: (1) Individual attention given to each infant including playing, talking, cuddling, and holding [Medium -High] ; (2) Holding and comforting an infant who is upset [Medium -High] ; (3) Prompt attention given to physical needs, such as feeding and diapering [Medium -High] ; (4) Talking to infants as they are fed, changed, and held, such as naming objects, singing, or saying rhymes [Medium -High] ; and (5) Ensuring objects less than 1 and 1/4 inches in diameter are kept out of the reach of infants or toddlers. [High] Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (3), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that the wishes of children, regardless of their ages, should always be respected with regard to physical contact and their comfort/discomfort with it. If a child indicates that the child does not wish to be held or comforted, even \"friendly contact\" with a child should be avoided. Regarding paragraph (5), objects, materials, and toys less than 1 and \u00bc inches in diameter can be stored in places where children of certain age groups may not have access to them. Examples of items that present a choking hazard for infants and toddlers include coins, balloons, safety pins, marbles, Styrofoam\u00a9 and similar products, and sponge, r ubber, or soft plastic toys. 131 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2303. How must I arrange the space where I care for infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants September 2003 The room arrangement of the infant care area must: (1) Make it possible for caregivers to see and/or hear infants and be able to intervene when necessary [High] ; (2) Include safe, open, floor space for floor time play [Medium -High] ; (3) Have cribs far enough apart so that one infant may not reach into another crib [Medium - High] ; and (4) Provide caregivers enough space to walk and work between cribs, cots, and mats. [Medium - High] Technical Assistance Infants need calm environments away from the stimulation of older children. Placing cribs far enough apart to prevent one infant from reaching into the crib of another infant protects the safety of the infants. This spacing also reduces the likelihood of transmission of infectious respiratory diseases spread by large droplets generated by a sneeze or cough, and can be effective in controlling the spre ad of other infectious diseases in the child care environment. \u00a7747. 2305 . What furnishings and equipment must I have available for infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 Furnishings and equipment for infants must include at least the following: (1) An individual crib to sleep in for each non -walking infant younger than 12 months of age [Medium -High] ; (2) An individual crib, cot, bed, or mat that is waterproof or washable for each [Medium -High] : (A) Walking infant; and 132 Revised: 3/29/2023(B) Non-walking infant 12 months of age or older; (3) A sufficient number of toys to keep the infants engaged in activities. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Paragraphs (1) and (2) outline the specific sleep equipment the home must provide for each infant. Aside from a non -walking infant younger than 12 months of age who is required to sleep in a crib, the rule does not specify whether an older infant must sleep in a crib, cot, bed, or mat. Transitioning an infant from a crib to a co t, bed, or mat will depend on the individual infant's development, sleep habits, etc. and is not solely dependent on the child's age. While not required, a chair or rocker allows the caregiver to hold, rock, comfort, talk, sing, and read to infants in an intimate, nurturing manner. It also provides a place for a mother to breastfeed her child. \u00a7747.2307. Must the equipment I use for infants be equipped with safety straps? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 If the manufacturer requires safety straps on a chair, swing, stroller, infant carrier, bouncer seat, or similar type of equipment, then the safety straps must be fastened whenever a child is using the equipment. [Medium -High] \u00a7747.2309. What specific safety requirements must my cribs meet? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirem ents for Infants April 2017 (a) All full -size and non -full-size cribs must have: (1) A firm, flat mattress that snugly fits the sides of the crib and that is specifically designed for use with the crib model number. The mattress must not be supplemented with additional foam material or pads [Medium -High] ; (2) Sheets that fit snugly and do not present an entanglement hazard [Medium -High] ; (3) A mattress that is waterproof or washable [Medium -High] ; 133 Revised: 3/29/2023(4) Secure mattress support hangers, and no loose hardware or improperly installed or damaged parts [Medium -High] ; (5) A maximum of 2 3/8 inches between crib slats or poles [Medium -High] ; (6) No corner posts over 1/16 inch above the end panels [High] ; (7) No cutout areas in the headboard or footboard that would entrap an infant's head or body [High] ; (8) Drop gates, if present, which fasten securely and cannot be opened by a child [High] ; and (9) Documentation that each crib meets the applicable federal rules at Title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1219 or 1220, concerning \"Safety Standards for Full-Size Baby Cribs\" and \"Safety Standards for Non -Full-Size Baby Cribs,\" respectively, or documentation that each crib is a medical device listed and registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. [High] (b) You must sanitize each crib when soiled and before another infant uses the crib. [Medium - High] (c) You must never leave an infant in a crib with the drop gate down. [High] Technical Assistance Research shows more babies die in incidents involving cribs than with any other piece of nursery equipment. Non-full-size cribs may be either smaller or larger than a full size crib, or shaped differently than the usual rectangular crib. The category of non -full-size cribs in cludes oversized, specialty, undersized, and portable cribs, but does not include any product with mesh/net/screen siding, non -rigidly constructed cribs, cradles, car beds, baby baskets or bassinets. For requirements for play yards, which are mesh or fabri c sided products, see \u00a7747.2311. Regarding paragraph (1), a mattress is too loose if there are more than two finger widths between the edge of the mattress and the crib side. Regarding paragraph (5) if a soda can fits easily between the slats on a crib, th e slats are too wide. Regarding paragraph (9): o Cribs manufactured before 06/28/2011 may not meet the safety standards established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 134 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance o Documentation that you may use to verify your crib is in compliance with CPS C regulations includes the certificate of compliance, registration card, or tracking label. You may request this documentation from the manufacturer or retailer. o Cribs manufactured before 06/28/2011 may not meet the safety standards established by the Cons umer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). o The applicable federal rules at Title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1219, concerning \"Safety Standards for Full -Size Baby Cribs\" are the rules amended on December 9, 2013. You can review them here. o The applicable federal rules at Title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1220, concerning \"Safety Standards for Non -Full-Size Baby Cribs,\" are the rules effective on December 28, 2010. You can review them here. o Documentation that you may use to verify your crib is in compliance with CPSC regulations includes the certificate of compliance, registration card, or tracking label. You may request this documentation from the manuf acturer or retailer. o The certificate of compliance is a document that describes the crib and whether the crib complies with 16 CFR 1219 or 16 CFR 1220. The certificate includes the contact information for the importer or domestic manufacturer and the testi ng lab. It also lists the date and location of manufacture and testing. o The registration card is a postage -paid form provided by the crib manufacturer. The card includes the manufacturer's name and contact information, model name, model number, and the dat e of manufacture. o The tracking label is attached to the crib and contains basic information such as the date of manufacture and the source of the crib. o You may find additional guidance on obtaining supporting documentation for your cribs on the CPSC websit e at http://www.cpsc.gov . In order to maintain the required documentation for each crib consider developing a system to easily tie the required documentation to the appropriate crib. Examples may include photographs of e ach crib attached to the documentation or a tracking sheet that includes information such as the date of purchase, manufacturer and model number, date of manufacture, and what documentation is on file (certificate of compliance, tracking 135 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance label, or registra tion card). A crib that meets the definition of \"device\" in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(h)) is subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not CPSC. A crib that is not a \"device\" is subject to CPSC's crib standards. \u00a7747.2311. Are play yards allowed? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 You may use a play yard, which is a mesh or fabric sided crib, if it meets the following safety requirements: (1) The play yards must be used according to the manufacturer's instructions, including the cleaning of the play yard [Medium -High] ; (2) Play yards must have: (A) A firm, flat mattress that snugly fits the sides of the play yard and that is designed by the manufacturer specifically for the play yard model number. The mattress must not be supplemented with additional foam material or pads [Medium -High] ; (B) Sheets that fit snugly and do not present an entanglement hazard [Medium -High] ; (C) A mattress that is waterproof or washable [Medium -High] ; (D) Secure mattress support hangers, and no loose hardware or improperly installed or damaged parts [Medium -High] ; (E) A minimum height of 22 inches from the top of the railing to the mattress support at its lowest level [Medium -High] ; (F) Folded sides that securely latch in place when raised [Medium -High] ; (G) For play yards that have mesh sides, mesh openings that are 1/4 inch or less [Medium -High] ; and (H) Mesh or fabric that is securely attached to the top rail, side rail, and floor plate [Medium -High] ; and (3) You must never leave an infant in a play yard with a side folded down. [High] 136 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2313. Are stacking wall cribs allowed? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 You may use a stacking wall crib that meets the requirements specified in \u00a7747.2309 of this title (relating to What specific safety requirements must my cribs meet?), and you: (1) Do not stack more than two cribs [Medium -High] ; (2) Only use a stacked crib for an infant who cannot stand or is able to stand without hitting the infant's he ad on either the top crib or the ceiling above the top crib [Medium -High] ; (3) Use the crib according to manufacturer's directions [Medium -High] ; and (4) Securely latch the crib's doors/gates anytime an infant is in the crib. [Medium -High] \u00a7747.2315. What specific types of equipment am I prohibited from using with infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 (a) You may not use the following equipment for infants, which has been identified as unsafe for infants by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Academy of Pediatrics: (1) Baby walkers, which are devices that allow an infant to sit inside a walker equipped with rollers or wheels and move across the floor [Medium -High] ; (2) Baby doorway jumpers, which are devices that allow an infant to bounce while supported in a seat by an elastic \"bungee cord\" suspended from a doorway [Medium -High] ; (3) Accordion safety gates [Medium -High] ; and (4) Bean bags, waterbeds, and foam pads used as sleeping equipment. [High] (b) Except for a tight -fitting sheet and as provided in subsection (c), the crib or play y ard must be bare for an infant younger than twelve months of age. [High] 137 Revised: 3/29/2023(c) A crib mattress cover may also be used to protect against wetness, but the cover must: (1) Be designe d specifically for the size and type of crib and crib mattress that it is being used with [Medium -High] ; (2) Be tight fitting and thin [Medium -High] ; and (3) Not be designed to make the sleep surface softer. [High] Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (a)(1), baby walkers present a hazard due to risk of falls down stairs or steps, and tipping over thresholds or carpet edges. They provide infants accessibility to potentially hot surfaces such as oven doors, heaters, and fireplaces; co ntainers of hot liquids such as coffee, soup, or cooking oils; dangling appliance cords; poisonous plants, hazardous materials , and buckets, toilets, or other containers of water. Regarding paragraph (a)(2), baby doorway jumpers require individual supervision of the infant and are not appropriate for use in a group setting. A caregiver, alone with children of mixed ages to supervise, would not be able to provide the one -on-one supervision this type of equipment requires, if they are to be used safely. Regarding paragraph (a)(3), accordion gates with large V -shaped openings along the top edge and diamond shaped openings between the slats present entrapment and entanglement hazards resulting in strangulation, choking, or pinching to infants who try to crawl through or over the gate. Regarding paragraph ( b), studies on SIDS support eliminating soft bedding materials, sleep positioning devices, and stuffed toys used for infants under twelve months. 138 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2317. What activities must I provide for an infant ? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2021 Daily activities for an infant must include at least the following : (1) Opportunities for outdoor play, weather permitting, as specified in \u00a7747.2104 of this chapter (relati ng to What specific activities must I include in a written activity plan?) [Medium] ; (2) Multiple opportunities to explore that ensure the infant is: (A) Outside the crib [Medium -High] ; and (B) Not seated in any restrictive device for more than 15 minutes, unless the infant is eating or being transported [High] ; (3) Opportunities for physical activity, including supervised tummy time, reaching, grasping, pulling up, creeping, crawling, and walking in a safe, clean, uncluttered area [Medium -High] ; (4) Opportuni ties for visual stimulation through nonverbal communication. Examples of age - appropriate equipment include large pictures of faces and familiar objects; simple, soft, washable books and toys; unbreakable mirrors or mobiles attached to cribs visible from th e baby's position; and brightly patterned crib sheets [Medium -High] ; (5) Opportunities for auditory stimulation. Examples of age -appropriate equipment or activities include verbal communication, soothing music, and musical or sounding toys [Medium - High] ; (6) Oppor tunities for sensory stimulation. Examples of age -appropriate equipment include surfaces, fabrics, textured toys, or washable dolls, and toy animals [Medium -High] ; (7) Opportunities for small -muscle development. Examples of age -appropriate equipment or activit ies include busy boxes, rattles, teethers, grasping toys, shaking or squeezing toys, or cloth toys [Medium -High] ; and (8) Opportunities for large -muscle development. Examples of age -appropriate equipment or activities include blankets or quilts for floor or su pervised tummy time, crib and play gyms, variety of light -weight balls, or pillows or supportive equipment for those learning to sit up . [Medium -High] 139 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Each infant should follow an individual schedule that will vary based on the infant's individual needs, but caregivers should offer a variety of opportunities that aid in the development of social, cognitive, and motor skills. Participation in activities will be dependent on the ability and developmental level of each individual in fant. For example, an infant who cannot roll over independently or crawl may engage regularly in supervised tummy time, while an infant with more advanced gross motor skills may p ractice crawling or pulling up to stand instead of supervised tummy time. Regarding paragraph (3) of this section and supervised tummy time, please see \u00a7747.2318 for additional requirements relating to tummy time. You should always encourage the least restrictive environment when planning activities for infants. \u00a7747.2318. What are the requirements when an infant is engaged in tummy time? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants June 2022 When an infant is positione d for tummy time activities, you must: (1) Ensure that you can see and hear the infant [High] ; (2) Move the infant into another position as necessary to maintain the infant's comfort and safety [High] ; and (3) If the infant has fallen asleep, move the infant immediately to the infant's crib and position the infant on the infant's back as required by \u00a7747.2327 of this subchapter (relating to Are infants required to sleep on their backs?) [High] . 140 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Tummy time is for an infant who is awake and being watched. You must be able to both see and hear an infant who is on his or her tummy so that you can intervene if the infant falls asleep or has difficulty breathing. If you must step away from the room where an infant is in tummy time and will no longer be able to see and hear the infant, you must remove the infant from tummy time. You should play and interact with the infant while the infant is awake and on the tummy throughout each day for a short period of time (3 -5 minutes), increasing the amount of time as the infant shows he or she likes the activity. Providing tummy time throughout the day develops an infant's arm, shoulder, stomach, and back strength. It also prepares the infant for roll ing and crawling. Tummy time gives the infant a new perspective on the world, which builds thinking skills. When an infant reaches for toys in tummy time, the infant is developing arm, hand, and finger skills, and hand-eye coordination. Once an infant can over independently or crawl, other activities are more appropriate for the infant's development. You can find more information about tummy time in the CCR TA Library , on the American Academy of Pediatrics' website: Back to Sleep, Tummy to Play , and on Zero to Three's website: Top 5: What You Need to Know About Tummy Time . \u00a7747.2319. Are there specific requirements for feeding infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 Yes. You must: (1) Hold infants who are unable to sit unassisted in a high chair or other seating equipment while feeding them [Medium -High] ; (2) Never prop or support bottles with some object. The infant or an adult must hold the bottle [High] ; (3) Provide regular snack and meal times for infants who eat table food [High] ; 141 Revised: 3/29/2023(4) Ensure infants no longer being held for feeding are fed in a safe manner [Medium - High] ; (5) Label, color -code, or otherwise distinguish among bottles and training cups used by different infants [Medium -High] ; (6) Never allow infants to walk around with or sleep with a bottle or training cup [Medium -High] ; (7) Never use the bathroom sink or diaper -changing surface for food preparation, or for washing food service/preparation equipment, bottles, pa cifiers or toys [Medium -High] ; and (8) Sanitize high chair trays before each use. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (2), research has shown that propping bottles can cause choking, aspiration, and increased risk for development of ear infections, tooth decay, and injuries to the teeth, as well as depriving infants of much -needed face -to-face interaction. Regarding paragraph (7), using diaper changing surfaces and hand -washing sinks for food preparation or for washing items used for food service increases the spread of germs from cross contamination. \u00a7747.2321. What written, feeding instructions must I obtain for an infant not ready for table food? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 (a) For an infant who is not ready for table food, you must obtain and follow written feeding instructions that are signed and dated by the infant's parent or health -care professional. [Medium] (b) You must review and update the feeding instructions with the parent every 30 days until the infant is able to eat table food. [Medium] 142 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (a), \"table food\" refers to non-baby food and regular , non-pureed meals and snacks provided to other children in the child -care home . If parents, rather than the child -care home, provide meals, written feeding instructions are still required because infants not yet ready for table fo od have rapidly changing nutritional needs. The amount of formula or breastmilk, baby cereal, and types of baby food changes multiple times throughout the infant's early stages. Caregivers must have updated information to ensure they are feeding each infan t according to the current needs of the infant. Written feeding instructions ensure that all caregivers have clear instructions for feeding infants. Each infant's needs vary greatly during this critical time of growth and development. Reviewing and updating feeding instructions every 30 days ensures that caregivers are following parent instructions as the nutritional needs of the infants change. \u00a7747.2323. What are the requirements regarding a regularly scheduled naptime for infants? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 Each infant must have a nap period that: (1) Allows the infant to maintain his or her own pattern of sleeping and waking periods [Medium] ; and (2) Is supervised by the caregiver to ensure auditory or visual awareness of the infant in accordance with \u00a7747.1503 of this c hapter (relating to What responsibilities does a caregiver have when supervising a child or children ?). [High] 143 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance A caregiver who uses auditory supervision and is unable to see an infant during the infant's naptime should consider: Leaving doors open or using a baby monitor to better hear the infant; and Visually checking the infant throughout the infant's nap to ensure the infant's head is uncovered and the infant's breathing is normal. \u00a7747.2324. Where must an infant sleep? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 An infant must sleep: (a) In a designated crib, cot, bed, or mat as required by \u00a7747.2305 of this subchapter (relating to What furnishings and equipment must I have available for infants?) [High ]; and (b) In an area where the caregiver has auditory or visual awareness of the infant [High ]. \u00a7747.2325. How long are infants allowed to remain in their cribs after awakening? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 An infant may remain in the crib for up to 30 minutes after awakening, as long as the infant is content and responsive. [Medium] Technical Assistance Exploring outside of the crib gives infants freedom of movement, which cannot be met in swings, infant carriers, strollers, or otherwise physically limiting equipment. 144 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2326. May I allow infants to sleep in a restrictive device? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 (a) If you do not have a Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a health - care professional stating that the child sleeping in a restrictive device is medically necessary: (1) You may not allow an infant to sleep in a restrictive device [High ]; and (2) If an infant falls asleep in a restrictive device, you must remove the infant from the device and place the infant in a crib as soon as possible [High ]. (b) You may allow an infant to sleep in a restrictive device if you have a completed Sleep Exception Form t hat includes a signed statement from a health -care professional stating that the infant sleeping in a restrictive device is medically necessary. Technical Assistance Infants sleeping in restrictive devices are at risk for strangulation, injury, and positional asphyxiation. Documentation from a health -care professional is required for an infant to sleep in a device other than a CPSC approved crib. Infants arriving at the child-care home asleep in a car seat must be removed from the car seat and placed in a crib. You must not place the car seat in the crib with a sleeping infant. \u00a7747.2327. How must I position an infant for sleep? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants March 2023 (a) You must place an infant in a face -up sleeping position in the infant's own crib, unless you have a completed Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a health -care professional stating that a different sleeping position for the infant is medically necessary [High] . (b) An infant who is developmentally able to roll from back to stomach and stomach to back may do so independently after you have placed the infant in a face -up position for sleep. 145 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, is the major cause of death in babies between 1 and 4 months old. After 30 years of research, scientists still cannot find a cause for SIDS; however, research has found the risk of SIDS may be reduced by placing a healthy infant on his or her back to sleep. If the infant was born with special needs , has gastroesophageal reflux, often spits up after eating, or has a breathing, lung or heart problem, a doctor or nurse may recommend a different sleep position to use. For additional information, see the CDC webpage Safe Sleep for Babies . \u00a7747.2328. May I swaddle an infant to help the infant sleep? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 You may not lay a swaddled infant down to sleep or rest on any surface at any time, unless you have a completed Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a health - care professional stating that swaddlin g the child for sleeping purposes is medically necessary. [High] Technical Assistance There is evidence that swaddling can increase the risk of serious health outcomes, including SIDS and hip disease, and research does not provide definitive data to support the use of swaddling. Even with newborns, research does not provide conclusive data about whether swaddling should be used. Swaddling blankets that become loose during sleep pose an additional risk for infants. For concerns with maintaining an infant's temperature, appropriate clothing and/or a sleeveless infant sleep sack that does not r estrict the infant's movement can be utilized. For more information on safe sleep, see the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Initiatives for Safe Sleep and the National Institutes of Health Safe to Sleep Campaign . 146 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2329. If an infant has difficulty falling asleep, may I cover the infant's head or crib? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants September 2003 No. Infants must not have their heads, faces, or cribs covered by items such as blankets, linens, or clothing at any time. [High] \u00a7747.2331. Must I share a daily report with parents for each infant in my care? Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants April 2017 No, you are not required to provide a daily written report to the infant's parent. Technical Assistance Recommendation: Although a written report is not required, children benefit when caregivers share any significant information with the child's parents. 147 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter I, Basic Care Requirements for Toddlers \u00a7747.2401. What are the basic care requirements for toddlers? Subchapter I, Basic Care Requirements for Toddlers April 2017 Basic care for toddlers must include: (1) Routines such as diapering, feeding, sleeping, and indoor and outdoor activity times, maintained as closely as possible [Medium] ; (2) Individual attention given to each toddler including playing, talking, and cuddling [Medium -High] ; (3) Holding and comforting a toddler who is upset [Medium -High]; and (4) Ensuring objects less than 1 and 1/4 inches in diameter are kept out of the reach of infants or toddlers. [High] Technical Assistance A commercial choke tube or empty toilet paper roll can be used to test toys and objects in the room that an infant or toddler may easily choke on. Try to place the toy or object into the tube. If the object easily passes through the tube, an infant or toddler may choke on it and it must be removed from the children's access. If the object does n ot fit through the tube, an infant or toddler is not likely to choke on it. \u00a7747.2403. How must I arrange the space where I care for toddlers?

[Medium] 157 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Research has shown that school -age children benefit from an after -school care program that provides an enriching contrast to the formal school environment. Activities including team sports, cooking, art, dramatics, music, crafts, and games allow them to explore new interests and relationships. Indoor and outdoor active play enhances fitness and general health and supports creativity, learning, and development. Naptime and rest time for school -age children will vary with each child's i ndividual needs. Children in full -day care benefit from resting or napping during their long day. A rest period may be reading books or listening to soft music or books on tape. 158 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter L, Discipline and Guidance \u00a7747.2703. What methods of discipline a nd guidance may I use? Subchapter L, Discipline and Guidance April 2017 Discipline must be: (1) Individualized and consistent for each child [Medium] ; (2) Appropriate to the child's level of understanding [Medium -High] ; (3) Directed toward teaching the child acceptable behavior and self -control [Medium] ; and (4) A positive method of discipline and guidance that encourages self -esteem, self -control, and self-direction, including the following [Medium -High] : (A) Using praise and encouragement of good behavior instead of focusing only upon unacceptable behavior [Medium -High] ; (B) Reminding a child of behavior expectations daily by using clear, positive statements [Medium -High] ; (C) Redirecting behavior using positive statements [Medium -High] ; and (D) Using brief supervised separation or time out from the group, when appropriate for the child's age and development, which is limited to no more than one minute per year of the child's age. [Medium] Technical Assistance Research has shown that positive guidance teaches children skills that help them get along in their physical and social environment. The goal is to develop personal standards in self -discipline, not to enforce a set of inflexible rules. Giving children understandable guidelines and re-directing their behavior helps them to develop internal control of their actions and encourages acceptable behavior. 159 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.2705. What types of discipline and guidance or punishment are prohibited? Subchapter L, Discipline and Guidance March 20 23 There must be no harsh, cruel, or unusual treatment of any child.

[High] ; and (10) Requiring a child to remain silent or inactive for inappropriately long periods of time for the child's age [High] . 160 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Child development research supports that physical punishment such as pinching, shaking, or hitting children teaches them that hitting or hurting others is an acceptable way to control unwanted behavior or get what they want. Children will also mimic adult s who demonstrate loud or violent behavior. Rapping, thumping, popping, yanking, and flicking a child are all examples of corporal punishment. Regarding paragraph (9), you must never withhold active play from a child who misbehaves (i.e., keeping a child indoors with another caregiver while the rest of the children go outside or making a child sit out of active play in the afternoon for a behavior that occurred in the morning). However, if a child is exhibiting poor behavior during active play, you may se parate the child from the group, as described in \u00a7747.2703(4)(D), to allow the child to settle down before resuming cooperative play or activities. 161 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter M, Naptime \u00a7747.2801.

[High] (b) A walk around the caregiver's neighborhood must comply only with paragraphs (2), (5) and (9) of subsection (a) of this section. [Medium -High] 165 Revised: 3/29/2023Technic al Assistance Regarding paragraph (3): o Conducting multiple name to face checks while away from the home will help ensure a child has not wandered off, gotten lost, or been left behind; o Conducting multiple name to face checks while away from the home will alert you to begin an immediate search if a child is missing; and o Caregivers should record the count of children on an attendance sheet or on a pocket card, along with the time the count occurred. For child/caregiver ratios and groups sizes, see subch apter E of this chapter (relating to Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes. \u00a7747.2903. Must I notify parents before I take a child away from my child -care home on a field trip? Subchapter N, Field Trips September 2003 Yes. You must notify the parent of each child who will be on the field trip, indicating when and where the child will be going, and when the child is expected to return to your child -care home. [Medium -High] 166 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter P, Nighttime Care \u00a7747.3001. What is nighttime care? Subchapte r P, Nighttime Care September 2003 (a) Nighttime care is care given on a regular or frequent basis to children who are starting or continuing their night sleep, or to children who spend the night or part of the night at the child -care home betwe en the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (b) Nighttime care does not include the occasional sleep -over program offered at infrequent intervals.

[Medium] (b) You cannot exceed these limits. [Medium] Technical Assistance The only way to exceed these limits would be to obtain a separate residential child -care license and comply with the standards relevant to that license. 167 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3005. Must I stay awake while supervising children during nighttime care? Subchapter P, Nighttime Car e September 2003 No. Caregivers supervising children during nighttime care in your child -care home do not have to be awake to supervise the children if: (1) The children are asleep before the caregivers [High] ; (2) The caregivers are on the same floor as the sleeping children [High] ; and (3) The caregivers are close enough to the children to respond or intervene if a child awakens for feeding, becomes ill, is afraid of the dark, or in the event of an emergency.

What are the basic requirements for meal and snack times ? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service March 202 3 (a) You must serve all children regular meals and morning and afternoon snacks as specified in this subchapter. [Medium -High] (b) The meals and snacks must follow the meal patterns established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) that is administered by the Texas Department of Agriculture. You must follow these patterns regardless of whether you are participating in the program for reimbursement . [Medium -High] (c) If you serve breakfast, you do not have to serve a morni ng snack . (d) A child must not go more than three hours without a meal or snack being offered, unless the child is sleeping . [Medium -High] (e) You must serve enough food to allow a child to have second servings from the vegetable, fruit, grain, and milk groups, if the child requests it . [Medium] (f) You must ensure a supply of clean, sanitary drinking water: (1) Is always available to each child at every snack, mealtime, and during and after active play [Medium -High] ; and (2) Is served in a safe and sanitary manner [Medium -High] . (g) You must not serve beverages with added sugars, such as carbonated beverages, fruit punch, or sweetened milk except for a special occasion such as a holiday or birthday celebration , unless otherwise allowed by the CACFP . [Medium] (h) You must not use food as a reward. [Medium -High] 170 Revised: 3/29/2023(i) You must not serve a child a food identified on the child's food allergy emergency plan as specified in \u00a7747.3617 of this chapter (relating to What is a food allergy emergency plan?). [Medium -High] Technical Assistance You can find the CACFP meal and snack patterns at https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp/meals -and-snacks. All infant formula and dry infant cereal must be iron -fortified. Look for \"infant formula with iron\" or a similar statement on the front of the formula. Make sure the formula is not an \"FDA exempt infant formula\", which should only be used if there is a statement from a healthcare professional. To help ensure that grains are whole grain -rich, look c losely at the ingredient list to make sure a whole grain is listed as the first ingredient or second after water. Research indicates serving drinking water to children ensures they are properly hydrated and facilitates reducing the intake of extra calories from nutrient poor foods and drinks which are associated with weight gain and obesity. Water should not be a substitute for milk at meals or snacks where milk is a required component. It is appropriate to require children to first drink the milk before s erving themselves water. Water for infant formula must not come from private well water sources unless it meets the requirements outlined in \u00a7747.3227 of this chapter (relating to May I use water from a private water supply instead of a public water suppl y for my child -care home?) . Beverages with added sugars should be avoided because they can contribute to child obesity, tooth decay, and poor nutrition. The CACFP meal pattern for infants does not allow homes to provide fruit and vegetable juices for infants. You may only use pasteurized full -strength juice to meet the vegetable or fruit requirement at one meal or snack per day. Caregivers should encourage children to sample a variety of foods of different colors and textures. Regarding paragraph (e), because it is unlikely that every child in care will request two servings from every food group, you do not need to prepare a quantity of food that allows two servings for every child in care. You need to have enough food from each of the re quired food groups so that if a child requests a second serving, there is enough food to fulfill the child's request. In addition, if you participate in the CACFP 171 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance program for reimbursement, it is important to be aware of the reimbursement requirements and limitations of the program as it relates to second servings. You can consult your local CACFP administrator for additional information. Regarding paragraph (g), the CACFP allows flavored fat -free (skim) or low -fat (1 percent fat or less) milk for children 6 years old and older . \u00a7747.3103. How often must I feed a child in my care?

(3) Six to eight hours One meal and one snack. (4) More than eight hours (A) Two meals and one snack; or (B) One meal and two snacks. (5) During the nighttime Depending on the time the child arrives and leaves: (A) An evening meal and breakfast; (B) A bedtime snack and breakfast; or (B) An evening meal, a bedtime snack, and breakfast. 172 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Well-balanced meals provide the food children need to grow, think, fight infection, and fuel their bodies. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) affirms that, since young children eat in small feedings and a child's appetite and interest in food may vary from one meal or snack to the next, children need to be fed often. As a result, snacks often become a significant part of a child's daily food intake. \u00a7747.3109. May parents provide meals and snacks for their children instead of my child -care home providing them ? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service March 2021 (a) Yes. However, your enrollment agreement, or an addendum to the agreement, signed by the parent must include a statement that the par ent: [Medium] (1) Is choosing to provide the child's meals and snacks from home [Medium] ; and (2) Understands the child -care home is not responsible for its nutritional value or for meeting the child's daily food needs. [Medium] (b) If the parent provides a meal but not a snack, you are responsible for providing a snack as specified in this subchapter [Medium] ; (c) You must provide safe and proper storage and service of the individual meals and snacks provided by parents. [Medium] (d) Snacks provided by a parent must not be shared with other children, unless: (1) A parent is providing baked goods for a celebration or party being held at the home [Medium] ; and (2) You ensure that the shared snacks meet the needs of children who require special diets. [Medium] Technical Assistance When a parent provides the child's meals and snacks from home, it is important to share information with the parents on the nutritional value of foods, sample menus, information on food allergies, and choking hazards, such as: o Sample menu items, introducing new foods, MyPlate materials, understanding nutrition labels, and more can be found at www.fns.usda.gov/tn/myplate ; and 173 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance o Resources on choking foods, food allergies, nutrition for young children, and other information can be fo und or downloaded from the Licensing Technical Assistance Library. A child with food allergies is at risk when eating foods that have not been prepared or served by the child's parent or the primary caregiver who has knowledge of the food ingredients and t he child's needs. \u00a7747.3111. What are the requirements for a child who requires a special diet or does not want to eat foods I serve ? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service March 2021 (a) To serve a child a therapeutic or special diet, you must: (1) Have writte n approval from: (A) A physician or health -care professional with prescriptive authority if the diet relates to a disability that restricts the child's diet [Medium -High] ; or (B) A health -care professional or a registered or licensed dietician if the diet does not relate to a disability that restricts the child's diet [Medium -High] ; (2) Maintain the written approval in the child's record [Medium -High] ; and (3) Give the information to all caregivers preparing and serving food. [Medium -High] (b) You must discuss recurring eat ing problems with the child's parent. [Medium] (c) You may encourage, but not force children to eat. [Medium] (d) You must not serve nutrient concentrates and supplements such as protein powders, liquid protein, vitamins, minerals, and other nonfood substances without written instructions as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. [Medium] 174 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance You may serve meat alternatives to accommodate vegetarian diets without special authorization from a health -care professional or dietician. The CACFP offers guidance on how to include meat alternatives as part of the meal pattern. \u00a7747.3113. Must I post and maintain daily menus? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service September 2003 No, h owever you must :Maintain menus showing all meals and snacks prepared and served at your child-care home for the previous three months. [Medium] (1) Keep a record of any substitutions made. Substitutions must be of comparable food value. [Medium] (2) Date the menu s. If you rotate menus, there must be a record of which menu was used for each date. [Medium] (3) Make menus available to Licensing and parents for review upon request. [Medium] Technical Assistance Planning menus in advance helps to ensure that adequate food will be on hand. Posting menus helps to inform parents about food served in the child -care home and enables the parent to balance it with the food they serve at home. \u00a7747.3117. What general requirements apply to food service and preparation ? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service April 2017 All food and drinks must be of safe quality and stored, prepared, distributed, and served under sanitary and safe conditions [Medium -High] , including: (1) You must sanitize food service equipment, dishes, and utensils after each use [Medium - High] ; 175 Revised: 3/29/2023(2) If your child -care home lacks adequate facilities for sanitizing dishes and utensils, you must use only disposable, single -use items [Medium -High] ; (3) You must wash re napkins, bibs, and tablecloths a fter each use (4) You must discard single -service napkins, bibs, dishes, and utensils after use [Medium -High] ; (5) You must serve children's food on plates, napkins, or other sanitary holders, such as a high chair tray, and you must not place food on a b are table or eating surface, which includes the floor [Medium -High] ; (6) You must not serve foods that present a risk of choking for infants and toddlers [High] ; (7) You must cover all food stored in the refrigerator [Medium -High] ; and (8) You must not store poisonous or toxic materials and cleaning supplies with food. [Medium - High] Technical Assistance Research has shown that 90% of fatal choking occurs in children younger than four years of age. Examples of foods that present a risk of choking include hot dogs sliced into rounds, whole grapes, hard candy, string cheese, nuts, seeds, raw peas, dried fruit, pretzels, chips, peanuts, popcorn, marshmallows, spoonful's of peanut butter, and chunks of meat larger than can be swallowed whole. Tables are often used for many purposes in child care. Although the tables should be washed before mealtime, they will still bear a heavier load of infecting organisms than plates or sanitized food holders. Expiration dates should be monitored to ensure that food and beverage quality is safe for consumption. \u00a7747.3119. Must I serve meals family style? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service March 2021 (a) You do not have to use family style meal service, although all meals and snack times must: (1) Be unhurrie d [Medium] ; 176 Revised: 3/29/2023(2) Allow children to feed themselves according to their developmental level [Medium] ; and (3) Include adult supervision of children. [Medium -High] (b) If meals and snacks are served family style, you must supervise children to prevent cross-contamination of the food. [Medium] Technical Assistance Mealtime is a great opportunity for children to learn about new food, develop new motor skills, increase their dexterity, and develop language and social skills through conversation. They also learn about counting, colors, shapes, amounts, smells, temperatures, and tastes. While feeding themselves, children use fine motor skills and learn self -help skills that build a child's self-esteem. The presence of adult caregivers during mealtime: o Helps prevent behaviors that increase risk, such as fighting, children feeding each other, children stuffing food in to the mouth, etc.; o Ensures that children do not increase their risk of choking by eating while talking, crying, laughing, or playing; and o Offers an opportunity for caregivers to model appropriate dining etiquette. \u00a7747.3121. Are children allowed to use toothbrushes after meal and snack times? Subchapter Q, Nutrition and Food Service September 2003 (a) Yes, although toothbrushes and tooth powders or pastes provided for each child's individual use must be: (1) Labeled with the child's full name [Medium] ; (2) Stored out of children's reach when not in use [Medium] ; and (3) Stored in a manner that prevents the toothbrushes from touching each other during storage. [Medium] (b) Children must have adult supervision during tooth brushing activities. [Medium] 177 Revised: 3/29/2023Subchapter R, Health Practice s Division 1, Environmental Health \u00a7747.3201. Must my child -care home have an annual sanitation inspection? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 No. We do not require you to have an annual sanitation inspection, although your local ordinances may require this. \u00a7747.3203. What steps must I take to ensure a healthy environment for children at my child -care home? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health April 2017 You must clean, repair, and maintain your child -care home, grounds, and equipment to protect the health of the children [Medium -High] , including: (1) Setting aside toys and equipment that are placed in children's mouths or are otherwise contaminated by body secretion or excr ement, to be sanitized daily or before handling by another child [Medium -High] ; (2) Machine washing used cloth toys at least weekly and when contaminated [Medium -High] ; (3) Machine washing used linens at least weekly, and when soiled and before another child uses them [Medium -High] ; (4) Sanitizing sleeping equipment before a different child uses it and when soiled [Medium - High] ; (5) Sanitizing potty chairs after each child's use [Medium -High] ; 178 Revised: 3/29/2023(6) Emptying water play tables and toys used in water play tables daily, saniti zing, and ensuring children and caregivers wash their hands before using the water table [Medium -High] ; (7) Maintaining sand boxes and sand tables in a sanitary manner [Medium -High] ; (8) Making all garbage inaccessible to children, and managing it to keep the chil d-care home, inside and outside, free of insects, rodents, and offensive odors [Medium -High] ; (9) Keeping all floors, ceilings, and walls in good repair and clean [Medium -High] ; (10) Ensuring paints used at the child -care home are lead-free [Medium -High] ; (11) Keeping all parts of the child -care home used by children well heated, lighted, and ventilated [Medium -High] ; (12) Sanitizing table tops, furniture, and other similar equipment used by children when soiled or contaminated with matter such as food , body secretions, or excrement [Medium -High] ; (13) Clearly marking cleaning supplies and other toxic materials and keeping them separate from food and inaccessible to children [Medium -High] ; and (14) Using, storing, and disposing of hazardous materials as recommended by the manufacturer. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Research supports preventive steps to help limit the spread of infections, such as regular and proper hand washing, ventilating rooms regularly with lots of fresh air, and establishing cleaning routines. Germs have difficulty growing in clean, dry and well - ventilated environments. Contamination of toys and other objects in the room contributes to the transmission of diseases and germs in child -care homes. Providing enough toys to rotate through the cleaning process allows children to stay in active play while maintaining a healthy environment. Regarding paragraphs (1) and (12), secretion s are bodily fluids that may contain virus particles or bacteria that can be transmitted to others. Examples of secretions include blood, saliva, mucus, and urine. Regarding paragraph (9): o Surfaces in and around the operation should be free from mold and mildew ; and 179 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance o All painted surfaces should be free from chipping, peeling, and flaking to ensure children are not exposed to hazards . o Regarding paragraph (10) , construction or renovations of child-occupied facilities built before January 1, 1978 should ad here to the EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) rule . EPA's RRP rule requires that renovations of child -occupied facilities be carried out only by Lead -Safe Certified renovation firms, using certified renovators trained in lead -safe work practices. This is to ensure that these renovations do not inadvertently contaminate your home and expose children to hazardous lead dust . The Texas Department of State Health Services has more information regarding the Environmental Lead Program ; Regarding paragraph (11), areas that are well ventilated can help control temperature, reduce dampness, and reduce the risk of allergies, asthma, and headaches. You can reduce chemi cal exposure and asthma triggers inside the child -care home by : o Selecting fragrance and dye free products for cleaning and sanitizing ; o Ensuring adequate ventilation when cleaning ; and o Using chemicals that may produce fumes or are irritants when children are not present. The EPA has additional information about how to protect the indoor air quality in your home . \u00a7747.3209. May I use a dishwasher or washing machine to sanitize items at my child - care home? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 Items that can be washed in a dishwasher or hot cycle of a washing machine which runs at a temperature of 160 degrees F ahrenheit or higher for five or more minutes do not need additional disinfecting because these machines use water that is hot enough, for long enough, to kill most germs. [Medium] 180 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3211. When must caregivers wash their hands? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health April 2017 Caregivers must wash their hands: (1) Before eating or handling food or medication [Medium -High] ; (2) Before feeding a child [Medium -High] ; (3) After arriving at the child -care home [Medium -High] ; (4) After diapering a child [Medium -High] ; (5) After assisting a child with toileting [Medium -High] ; (6) After personal toileting [Medium -High] ; (7) After handling or cleaning bodily fluids, such as after tending sores and wiping noses, mouths, or bottoms [Medium -High] ; (8) After handling or feeding animals [Medium -High] ; (9) After outdoor activities [Medium -High] ; (10) After handling raw food products [Medium -High] ; (11) After eating, drinking, or smoking [Medium -High] ; (12) After using any cleaners or toxic chemicals [Medium -High] ; and (13) After removing gloves. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance When hand washing and cleaning routines are modeled, the children learn good health and safety practices. 181 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3213. When must children wash their hands? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 Children must wash their hands: (1) Before eating [Medium -High] ; (2) Before playing in a water play table or other water activities [Medium -High] ; (3) After toileting or having a diaper changed [Medium -High] ; (4) After outdoor activities [Medium -High] ; (5) After playing in sand [Medium -High] ; (6) After feeding or touching animals [Medium -High] ; and (7) Any other time that the caregiver has reason to believe the child has come in contact with substances that could be harmful to the child. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance It is a best practice to require all children to wash their hands immediately upon entering your home. It is also a best practice to require all parents visiting your home to wash their hands upon entering. Studie s have shown an increase in overall health in a child -care setting when programs eliminate the transmission of germs from the child's home environment to the child - care setting by requiring hand hygiene for all entering the child -care home. 182 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3215. Ho w must children and caregivers wash their hands? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health April 2017 Children 18 months and older and caregivers must wash their hands with soap and running water. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Research has shown the single most effective practice that prevents the spread of germs in the child -care setting is good hand washing by caregivers and children. Rubbing hands together under running water is the most important part of washing away infectious germs. Deficiencies in hand washing, including sharing basins of water, have contributed to many outbreaks of diarrhea among children and caregivers in child -care settings. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends these hand washing steps: o Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soap; o Rub your hands together to make lather and scrub them well, and be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails; o Continue rubbing your hands fo r at least 20 seconds (tip: hum the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice); o Rinse your hands well under running water; o Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry; and o Use a paper towel to turn off the faucet. 183 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3216. May I use hand sanitizer as a substitute for washing hands? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health April 2017 You may use hand sanitizers as a substitute for washing hands if all of the following conditions are met: (1) You only use hand sanitizers on children 24 months and older [Medium -High] ; (2) You do not use hand sanitizers to wash hands that are visibly dirty or greasy or have chemicals on them, unless you are away from the activity space and soap and water are not available for hand washing [Medium -High]; (3) You follow the labelling instructions for the appropriate amount to be used and for how long the hand sanitizer needs to remain on the skin surface to be effective [High] ; (4) Children have adult supervision when using hand sanitizers [Medium -High] ; and (5) You store hand sanitizers out of the reach of children when not in use. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance The use of hand sanitizers does not substitute for hand washing in the group care setting. Supervision of children is required to monitor effective use of hand sanitizers and to avoid potential ingestion or inadvertent contact with a child's eyes, mouth, or nose. The FDA has additional information and recommendations regarding safely using hand sanitizer. 184 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3217. How must I wash an infant's hands? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health April 2017 (a) Until the infant is old enough to be raised to the faucet and reach for the water, you must wash the infant's hands using an individual cloth or disposable towel with soap, followed by a cloth or disposable towel used to rinse with clear water and dry. [Medium -High] (b) Use soap and running water as specified in this division when infants are old enough to be raised to the faucet and reach for the water and any other time that the caregiver has reason to believe the infant has come in contact with subst ances that could be harmful to the infant. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance An infant that does not have muscle control of the infant's head and neck must not be raised to the sink to wash the infant's hands. Baby wipes may be used for infants that do n ot have the muscle control to hold up their head and reach for the water. However, the baby wipes must state they are safe to use for infants and must be discontinued once the infant is able to be raised to the faucet and reach for the water. \u00a7747.3219. Must I have hot water for hand washing? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 No. We do not require you to have hot water for hand washing. However, if hot water is accessible to the children, a thermostat must control it so that the water temperature is no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Although hot water is not required, adults and children are more likely to wash their hands when the running water can be adjusted to a comfortable temperature. Many local health departments require hot water. 185 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance When children have access to a hand -washing sink, it is important to protect them from being scalded. Research indicates tap water burns are a leading cause of non-fatal burns and children under five are the most frequent victims. If a local health department requires water hotter than 120 degrees F for other uses in the child -care home, several measures are available to adjust water temperature at a hand -washing sink. \u00a7747.3221. Must caregivers wear gloves when handling blood or bodily fluids containing blood? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2016 Yes, caregivers must follow universal precautions outlined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) when handling blood, vomit, or other bodily fluids that may contain blood including: (1) Using disposable, nonporous gloves [Medium -High] ; (2) Placing gloves contaminated with blood in a tied, sealed, or otherwise closed plastic b ag and discarding them immediately [Medium -High] ; (3) Discarding all other gloves immediately after one use [Medium -High] ; and (4) Washing your hands with soap and running water after using and disposing of the gloves. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Although human milk is a body fluid, it is not necessary to wear gloves when feeding or handling human milk. 186 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3223. Must I use a licensed exterminator to treat my child -care home for insects, rodents, or other pests? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 No, although you must keep your child -care home and yard free of insects, rodents, or pests. [Medium -High] \u00a7747.3225. Are there general precautions I must take when my child -care home is being treat ed for insects, rodents, or other pests? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 Yes. You must do the following when your child -care home is being treated for insects, rodents, or other pests: (1) Ensure children are not present in an area being treated with chemicals as required by label directions [Medium -High] ; (2) Apply over -the-counter products used for insects, rodent, and pest control only by following label directions [Medium -High] ; (3) Minimize children's exposure to chemical residue that may be harmful to them, including odors [Medium -High] ; (4) Store all pest control products according to label directions [Medium -High] ; (5) Immediately dispose of dead insects and rodents in a safe and sanitary manner. [Medium - High] 187 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.3227. May I use water from a private water supply instead of a public water supply for my child -care home? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 Yes, you may use water from a private water supp ly, although you must: (1) Maintain the water supply in a safe and sanitary manner. [Medium -High] (2) Maintain written records indicating that the private water supply meets the requirements of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, if applicable. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Caring for Our Children recommends well water be tested annually , or as required by the local health department, for bacterio -logical quality, nitrates, total dissolved solids, pH levels, and other water quality indicators as required by the local health department. Testing for nitrate is especially important if there are infants under six months of age in care. High levels of nitrates in drinking water can be dangerous and potenti ally fatal to infants. If you are unsure if your private water supply may contain nitrates, you can contact your state certification officer for a list of laboratories in your area that will perform tests on your water supply for a fee. \u00a7747.3229. May I use a septic system for sewage disposal? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 1, Environmental Health September 2003 Yes, if the septic system is sanitary and meets the standards of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including any routine inspections required by law. [Medium -High] 188 Revised: 3/29/2023Division 2, Diaper Changing \u00a7747.3301. What steps must I follow for diaper changing? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 2, Diaper Changing April 201 7 Caregivers must: (1) Promptly change soiled or wet diapers or clothing [Medium -High] ; (2) Thoroughly cleanse the child with individual cloths or disposable towels. You must discard the disposable towels after use and launder any cloths before using them again [Medium - High] ; (3) Ensure that the children are dry before placing a new diaper on the child. If the child must be dried, you must use a clean, individual cloth or disposable towel to dry the child. You must discard the disposable towel after use and launder any cloth before using it again [Medium -High] ; (4) Not apply powders, creams, ointments, or lotions unless you obtain the parent's written permission. If the parent supplies these items, permission is implicit and you do not need to obtain permission for each use [Medium -High] ; (5) Label powders, creams, ointments, or lotions with the individual child's name [Medium - High] ; and (6) Keep all diaper -changing supplies out of the reach of children. [Medium -High] 189 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance A pleasant attitude while changing a child's diaper, even if a child has had a loose stool, helps to develop a child's positive sense of self. Wipes are helpful in removing residue, such as food off a baby's face or feces from a baby's bottom during diaper changing. Parents need to give permission before over -the-counter creams or powders are used. A parent can address whether the child has a skin allergy or if a child's pediatrician does not recommend use of topical products when diapering. Caregivers may seek written permis sion to use these products before the need arises. \u00a7747.3303. What equipment must I have for diaper changing? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 2, Diaper Changing March 2023 (a) You must have a diaper changing table or surface that is: (1) Smooth, non -absorbent and easy to clean [Medium -High] ; and (2) Located so that the caregiver using the diapering surface can supervise children at all times, as specified in \u00a7747.1503 of this chapter (relating to What responsibilities does a caregiver have when supervising a child or children? ). [Medium -High] (b) You must not use areas for diaper changing that children come in close contact with during play or eating, such as dining tables, sofas, or floor play areas. [Medium -High] (c) If the diaper changing t able or surface is above the floor level, then at all times when the child is on the table/surface: (1) There must be a safety mechanism (such as raised sides) that is used [Medium -High] ; (2) The caregiver's hand must remain on the child [Medium -High] ; or (3) The caregiver must be facing the child and within an arm's length of the child. [Medium -High] 190 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance A separate area used for diaper changing and/or changing of soiled underwear reduces contamination of other parts of the child -care environment. Safety straps on a diaper changing table or surface should not be used because the straps are difficult to sanitize and can cross contaminate. \u00a7747.3307. What must I do to prevent the spread of germs when diapering children? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 2, Diaper Changing April 2017 (a) You must wash your hands after each diaper change. Refer to \u00a7747.3215 of this title (relating to How must children and caregivers wash their hands?). [Medium -High] (b) You must wash the infant's hands or see that the child's hands are washed after each diaper change. Refer to \u00a7747.3217 of this title (relating to How must I wash an infant's hands?) [Medium -High] (c) If you use disposable gloves, you must discard them after each diaper change and wash your hands with soap and running water. [Medium -High] (d) You must sanitize the diapering -changing surface after each use, or use a clean, disposable covering on the diapering surface that must be changed after each use. [Medium -High] (e) You must cover co ntainers used for soiled diapers or keep them in a sanitary manner, such as placing soiled diapers in a tied, sealed, or otherwise closed plastic bag. [Medium -High] (f) You must place soiled clothing in a tied, sealed, or otherwise closed plastic bag to be sen t home with the child. [Medium -High] 191 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Recommendation: Assembling all of the supplies necessary for a diaper change before bringing the child to the changing table ensures the protection of the child. If the hand - washing sink is not adjacent to the diapering area, wipes may be used, as a temporary measure only, to clean the caregiver's and child's hands while supervising the child on the changing table. During diaper changing, a child's hands often stray into the area of the child's b ody covered by the diaper. Germs are contained in human waste and body fluids and are present on the skin and the diaper even if they cannot be seen. Washing an infant's or child's hands after each diaper change helps reduce the spread of germs. Because of the risk of splashing and gross contamination of hands, sinks, and bathroom surfaces, rinsing diapers or clothes soiled with fecal material in the child -care setting increases the risk that you, other caregivers, and the children would be exposed to germs that cause infection. Rotating two changing mats throughout the day, using one while another is sanitized and dries, provides an alternative to waiting between diaper changes. Division 3, Illness and Injury \u00a7747.3401. What type of illness would prohibit a child from attending the child -care home? Subchapter R, Health Practices Division 3, Illness and Injury March 2023 You must not allow an ill child to attend your child -care home if one or more of the following exists: (1) The illness prevents the child from participating comfortably in child -care activities including outdoor play [Medium -High] ; (2) The illness results in a greater need for care than caregivers can provide without compromising the health, safety, and supervision of the other children in care [Medium - High] ; 192 Revised: 3/29/2023(3) The child has one of the following (unless a medical evaluation by a health -care professional indicates that you can include the child in the child -care activities): (A) An oral temperature above 101 deg rees that is accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness [Medium] ; (B) A tympanic (ear) temperature above 100 degrees that is accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness. Tympanic thermometers are not recomme nded for children under six months old [Medium] ; (C) An axillary (armpit) temperature above 100 degrees that is accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness [Medium] ; or (D) An infrared temporal (forehead) temperature above 100 degrees tha t is accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness [Medium] ; or (E) Symptoms and signs of possible severe illness such as lethargy, abnormal breathing, uncontrolled diarrhea, two or more vomiting episodes in 24 hours, rash with fever, mouth sores with drooling, behavior changes, or other signs that the child may be severely ill [Medium] ; or (4) A health -care professional has diagnosed the child with a communicable disease, and the child does not have medical documentation to indicate that the child is no longer contagious. [Medium] 193 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (3), when taking a child's temperature, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) indicates : o Electronic devices for measuring temperature require periodic calibration and specific training in proper technique; o Using infrared temporal thermometers outside in direct sunlight may affect readings; and o The height of fever does not indicate the severity of the illness. Regarding subparagraph ( E), as with temperatures a child does not have to be sent home unless there are multiple symptoms and signs of possible severe illness. Some children may also have medical issues that cause one or more symptoms, but the symptoms ma y not be a sign of possible severe illness (for example, a child that is lactose intolerant or is taking an antibiotic that causes digestive side effects may have diarrhea but no other symptoms of an illness). To clarify \"uncontrolled diarrhea\", this is when: o A diapered child's stool: Is not contained in the diaper; and/or Exceeds two or more stools above the normal for that child; and o A toilet -trained child's diarrhea is causing soiled pants and clothing. \u00a7747.3403.

Some immunizations given during adulthood may include: Influenza (Flu) - this immunization helps protect against the flu. When determining if a flu shot is required some factors to consider are people at a higher of risk of severe flu and persons with close contact with others who are at a higher risk of flu including persons who care for children younger tha n 12 months of age. HepA (Hepatitis) - this immunization helps protect against the hepatitis A disease. Factors to be considered when determining the need for the HepA immunization can include anyone who will be in close contact with a person or child from a country that has high rates of Hepatitis A. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) - two immunizations known as DTap and Tdap help protect against this disease. Whooping cough is very contagious and most severe for babies. Factors to consider when determining the need for this immunization include determining the level of risk associated with certain persons and caregiv ers who are in close contact with infants.

What safety precautions must I take to protect children in my child -care home? Subchapter S, Safety Practices Division 1, Safety Precautions March 2023 All areas accessible to a child must be free from hazards including, but not limited to [Medium - High] , the following: (1) Electrical outlets accessible to a child younger than five years must have child -proof covers or safety outlets [Medium -High] ; (2) 220-volt electrical connections within any child's reach must be covered with a screen or guard [Medium -High] ; (3) Air conditioners, electric fans, and heaters must be mounted out of all children's reach or have safeguards that keep any child from being injured [Medium -High] ; (4) Glass in sliding doors must be clearly marked with decals or other materials placed at children's eye level [Medium -High] ; (5) Play materials and equipment must be safe and free from sharp or rough edges and toxic paints [Medium -High] ; (6) Poisonous or potentially harmful plants must be inaccessible to children [Medium -High] ; (7) Bottle warmers must be inaccessible to all children and used only according to manufacturer instructions [Medium -High] ; (8) All storage chests, boxes, trunks, or similar items with hinged lids must be equipped with a lid support design ed to hold the lid open in any position, be equipped with ventilation holes, and must not have a latch that might close and trap a child inside [Medium -High] ; and 200 Revised: 3/29/2023(9) All bodies of water, such as, pools, hot tubs, ponds, creeks, birdbaths, fountains, buckets, and rain barrels, must be inaccessible to children. [High] Technical Assistance The environment must be free of health and safety hazards to reduce risks to children. Additional examples of hazards to children include: sharp scissors, plastic bags, knives, cigarettes, matches, lighters, flammable liquids, drugs/medications, sharp inst ruments such as ice picks, power tools, cleaning supplies, chemicals, and other items labeled keep out of the reach of children. It is also important to secure televisions and furniture (for example book cases) so they cannot tip over. For example: o Mount flat televisions to the wall, so they cannot be pulled down; o If you have an old box television, put it on furniture that is low, stable, and designed for the size and weight of the television; and o Use brackets, braces, or wall straps to secure furnit ure to the wall. Buildings, grounds, and equipment in a state of disrepair threaten the health and safety of children. Regarding paragraph (9), according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), any body of water including bathtubs, pails, and toilets presents a drowning risk to young children. An estimated 50 infants and toddlers drown each year in buckets containing liquid used for mopping floors and other household chores. The 5 -gallon bucket presents the greatest hazard to young children because of its tall straight sides and its weight with even a small amount of liquid. It is nearly impossible for top -heavy infants and toddlers to free t hemselves when they fall into a 5 -gallon bucket head first. To assist in ensuring safety with respect to the outdoor grounds of the home, the Texas Department of State Health Services provides free safe siting resources to child -care providers. These resou rces aid in determining whether the child -care home is located in an area where past or current chemical use could pose a threat to children.

Subchapter U, Indoor and Outdoor Active Play Space and Equipment Division 4, Playground Surfacing September 2003 Unitary surfacing materials are manufactured materials includ ing rubber tiles, mats, or poured in place materials cured to form a unitary shock -absorbing surface. [Medium] Technical Assistance Studies have shown that falls to the surface are the leading cause of playground injuries in children. Shock -absorbing surfaces can help disperse the momentum of a falling body or head, thus reducing the risk of life threatening injuries. Equipment heights can double the probability of a child getting injured from a fall. Equipment over 8 feet has close to three times the injury rate of equipment under that height. Considering the ceiling height in the average home is eight to ten feet, a four-foot child falling from a platform more than eight feet high is the equivalent of a child falling from a second -story window. \u00a7747.4709. How should unitary surfacing materials be installed?

What safety precautions must I follow when children in my care use a swimmin g pool? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play September 2003 In addition to complying with the child/caregiver ratios specified in \u00a7747.2005 of this title (relating to What are the child/caregiver ratios for swimming a ctivities?) and other safety requirements specified in \u00a7747.2009 and \u00a7747.2013 of this title (relating to Must I have a certified lifeguard on duty when children are swimming in more than two feet of water? and Must persons who are counted in the child/car egiver ratio during swimming know how to swim?), you must comply with the following safety precautions when any child uses a swimming pool (more than two feet of water) both at and away from your child -care home: (1) A minimum of two life -saving devices must b e available [High] ; (2) One additional life -saving device must be available for each 2,000 square feet of water surface [High] ; (3) Drain grates must be in place, in good repair, and must not be able to be removed without using tools [High] ; (4) Pool chemicals and pumps must be inaccessible to any child [High] ; (5) Machinery rooms must be locked when a child is present [High] ; (6) Caregivers must be able to clearly see all parts of the swimming area [High] ; (7) The bottom of the pool must be visible at all times [High] ; and (8) An adult must be present who is able to immediately turn off the pump and filtering system when a child is in a pool. [High] 245 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (1), some examples of life -saving devices include U.S. Coast Guard approved life jackets, ring buoys, rescue tubes, and reaching poles or shepherd's hooks. It is best practice to pre -identify all children w ho cannot swim and ensure that they are wearing U.S. Coast Guard approved life jackets upon arrival to swimming facilities. Children should remain in these jackets until they have been swim tested. Ensuring that the pre - identified non -swimmers wear the app ropriate and properly fitted U.S. Coast Guard approved life jackets before entering the swimming pool area adds an additional layer of protection for non -swimmers. As a reminder, life jackets do not make a child drown proof and are not a substitute for supervision. Regarding paragraph (6) and (7), all caregivers should provide constant visual supervision of children and remain undistracted and within arm 's reach while watching children in and around water. Adults can wear physical reminders that they are r esponsible for supervising children who are swimming and while there is access to water. Regarding paragraph (8) , the power of suction of a pool drain often requires that the pump be turned off before a child can be removed, therefore immediate unobstructed access is necessary. \u00a7747.4803. How should the swimming pool be maintained? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play April 2017 Swimming pools at the child-care home must be maintained according to the standards of the Texas Department of State Health Services for public pools, and any other state or local regulations. [High] \u00a7747.4805. Do the same safety precautions apply fo r above - ground pools? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play September 2003 Yes. Above -ground pools must meet all pool safety requirements specified in this subchapter and must have a barrier that prevents a child's access to the pool. [High] 246 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.4807. Must I have a fence around a swimming pool at my child -care home? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play April 2017 (a) You must prevent children from entering the pool area by a wall, fence, or other durable impenetrable barrier at least four feet high. [High] (b) Fence gates leading to the pool area must have self -closing and self -latching hardware out of children's reach. Gates must be locked when the pool is not in use. [High] (c) Doors from the child -care home leading to the pool area must have a lock out of children's reach that can only be opened by an adult. [High] (d) These doors and gates must not be designated as fire and emergency evacuation exits. [High ] Technical Assistance The installation of multiple barriers around swimming pools helps to restrict a child's unsupervised access to water. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes an effective barrier as one that prevents a child from getting over, under, or through it and keeps the children from gaining access to the pool or body of water. Colin's Hope, a water safety advocacy group, recommends that pools have 4 -sided isolation fencing at least six feet in height, with self-closing and self -latching gates. Isolation fencing completely surrounds a pool, isolating it from the home, yard, and adjacent properties. Isolation fencing does not use the home as a barrier. All outdoor areas must be free of furniture and equipment that a child could use to scale a fence or barrier or to release a lock. Block access to swimming pools and remove any materials and furniture that can be moved by children and used to climb over barriers or open gates. Pool Safely ( Pool Safety for Residential Pool and Spa Owners ) and the International Association for Certified Home Inspectors ( Safety Guidelines for Home Pools ) provide additional information about the basics of residential pool safety. Remember, nothing substitutes for constant visual supervision by an adult. However, securing every pool with a proper barrier offers a n additional layer of protection. 247 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.4809. Does having a fence affect my duty to supervise children's access to the pool? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play April 2017 No. Although a fence and locked access provides a layer of protection for a child who strays from supervision and may deter some children from entering the pool area, these do not replace the need to supervise children at all times and monitoring of safety features to protect children from unsupervised access to the pool. Technical Assistance The Centers for Disease Control -National Center for Injury Prevention and Control recommends that whenever young children are swimming, playing, or bathing in water, an adult should be watching them constantly, and should not read, play cards, talk on the tele phone, mow the lawn, or do any other distracting activity while watching children in or near a body of water. Child drowning is a silent death; splashing may not occur to alert someone that the child is in trouble. \u00a7747.4813. What are the safety requireme nts for wading pools? Subchapter V, Swimming Pools, Wading/Splashing Pools, and Sprinkler Play September 2003 (a) Wading/splashing pools (two feet of water or less) used at your child -care home must be: (1) Stored out children's reach when not in use [Medium -High] ; (2) Drained and sanitized at least daily [High] ; and (3) Stored so they cannot hold water. [High] (b) You must comply with the safety precautions specified in \u00a7747.4801 of this title (relating to What safety precautions must I follow when children in my care use a swimming pool?) when using wading/splashing pools away from your child -care home. [Medium -High] 248 Revised: 3/29/2023Technical Assistance Wading/splashing pools with no filtering system are meant to be drained, sanitized, and stored out of children's reach after each use. Water play is a great way to introduce water safety habits to young children. Talk about the dangers of water and introduce rules like \"Wait for a grown -up\" and \"Wear a life jacket\".

Technical Assistance The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants and toddlers ride in a rear - facing child safety seat for as long as possible, until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by the child safety seat manufacturer. A safety belt is properly fitted if the lap portion of the belt fits low acro ss the hips and pelvis and the shoulder portion fits across the middle shoulder and chest. Height and weight requirements for a child safety seat may vary depending on the brand of safety seat. To determine the type of safety restraint a child must use bas ed on the child's height or weight, the child -care home must consult and follow the manufacturer specifications for whichever rear -facing, convertible, or forward -facing safety seat the home uses. This information can typically be found on the car seat or by referencing the manufacturer's website. 273 Revised: 3/29/2023\u00a7747.5409. Must caregivers and/or the driver wear a safety belt?

What must the policy for protecting children from vaccine - preventable diseases include? Your operation is responsible for developing a policy that includes all areas addressed in \u00a7747.3411. How will Licensing evaluate for compliance? Licensing will review your program's policy to ensure that it covers each of the ei ght required areas. Licensing staff will ensure that your operation outlines how you will maintain either written or electronic records for each employee's compliance with your policy as well as any exemptions. We will not evaluate based on the content of each policy item. What would be an example of how licensing will evaluate my operation's compliance with the new rule? The new rule requires you to specify any vaccines that you have determined an employee must have based on the level of risk the employee presents. Licensing staff will review your policy to ensure you have specified any vaccines an employee must have. For example, if your policy outlines that all employees must only obtain a flu vaccine once every 12 months then we would only review complia nce with the employee's requirement to obtain a flu vaccine. What immunizations are recommended for adults? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) develops the recommendations and they are l isted on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult -schedule.pdf 281 Revised: 3/29/2023Do I have to require employees to obtain all immunizations recommended by the CDC? No, employees at your program will only need to obtain immunizations that are required in your policy. It is up to you to determine what immunizations will be required and which employees are required to obtain them based on their level of risk as determined by their routine and direct exposure with children. How do I determine an employee's level of risk? An employee's level of risk is determined by the policy you develop. The basis for determining an employee's level of risk must be ou tlined in your policy and must be based on the employee's routine and direct exposure to children. Items to consider when you develop policy include: What are the employee's primary duties? How closely does the employee work with children? (For example, does the employee change diapers, assist with toileting, prepare or serve food) How often does the employee work with children? (Regular contact vs. substitute basis) What are the ages of children the employee works with? Can an employee be exempt from immunizations that my program's policy requires? Yes, an employee may be exempt from one or more of your program's required immunizations for: Medical conditions identified as contraindications or precautions by the CDC; or Reasons of conscienc e, including a religious belief. What procedures must an employee follow to be exempt from having a required vaccine? Your policy must address exemption procedures an employee must follow in order for you to determine the employee's qualification of an exe mption. 282 Revised: 3/29/2023What are some examples of acceptable documentation for exemptions? For medical conditions, acceptable documentation may include a note from the employee's health care professional providing a statement that the required vaccine is medically contrai ndicated or poses a significant risk to the health and well-being of the individual. For reasons of conscience, acceptable documentation may include a signed and dated statement from the employee that states the employee is exempt for reasons of conscience , including the person's religious beliefs. What are some examples of procedures that an exempt employee must follow to protect children in care from exposure to disease? It is up to your operation to determine what and when protective procedures will be r equired. Examples of protective procedures include: Wearing gloves when handling or cleaning body fluids, such as after wiping noses, mouths, or bottoms, and tending sores; Specifying that an employee with open wounds and/or any injury that inhibits hand w ashing, such as casts, bandages, or braces, must not prepare food or have close contact with children in care; Wearing masks when the employee has respiratory symptoms to reduce the spread of droplets to surrounding areas; Wearing masks when taking care of children with respiratory symptoms; Removing gloves and washing hands immediately after each task to prevent cross - contamination to other children; Excluding the employee from direct care when the employee has signs of illness. How can I determine that an employee has complied with my operation's policy? You must specify in your policy how you will verify that an employee has complied with your policy. This must include what written and/or electronic documentation you will accept. Examples of docum entation may include: Copy of the employee's current immunization record; Receipt that includes date a required immunization was received; 283 Revised: 3/29/2023 Letter signed by a health care professional that lists the date an immunization was received; Documentation of exemption for medical reasons from a health care professional; Signed and dated statement from the employee for exemption based on a reason of conscience. Where can my employees get the recommended immunizations? Individuals should start w ith their health care provider. Other resources in your area include pharmacies, the health department, and public or community health clinics. For a list of local health departments in Texas visit the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) websi te at: http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regions/lhds.shtm Are there any other resources available for employees to receive the recommended immunizations? Yes, the Adult Safety Net program created by The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to increase access to vaccination services in Texas for uninsured adults. What is the Adult Safety Net program? The Adult Safety Net (ASN) program provides vaccine purchased with public funds to participating clinics to be used for immunizing uninsured adults. How do I find an Adult Safety Net provider in my area? Visit the ASN website at www.dshs.state.tx.us/ASN and click on the search page to locate an ASN clinic near you. (Please check with the clinic before visiting to make sure they can see you.) Who is eligible to receive vaccinations from the ASN program? Adults ages 19 years and older that do not have health insurance are eligible to rec eive ASN vaccines. Who is not eligible to receive ASN vaccines? Individuals who do not qualify for ASN vaccines include: Adults who have Medicare, Medicaid, or any other insurance, including private insurance. 284 Revised: 3/29/2023 Adults who are underinsured for adult vaccines (e.g., those who have healthcare insurance that does not cover adult vaccines). Individuals younger than 19 years of age. What vaccines are offered through the ASN program? The following is a list of vaccines currently offered through the ASN program and a description of the diseases they prevent. Hepatitis B Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection of the liver by the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, and death. Hepatitis A Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection of the li ver by the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A include lack of energy, diarrhea, fever, nausea and jaundice (yellow color to the whites of the eyes or skin). Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Combination Vaccine \u2014see above. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection from several strains of HPV, including those that cause genital warts and several types of cancer, such as cervical, anal, penile, and throat cancer. Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection from the measles virus, which can lead to rash, ear infection, brain damage, and death. Prevents infection from the mumps virus, which can cause fever, swollen glands, headache, and can lead to deafness and meningitis. Prevents infection from rub ella virus, which can cause rash, arthritis, and miscarriage in pregnant women. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PPSV23) Vaccine \u2014 prevents infection by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium, which is one of the most common causes of severe pneumonia and can lead to other types of infections, such as ear infections, sinus infections, meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord), and blood stream infections (bacteremia). Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine \u2014 prevents tetanus, which can cause muscle spasms, lockjaw, paralysis, and death. Prevents diphtheria, which can cause suffocation and heart failure. Prevents pertussis (known as \"whooping cough\"), which can cause severe coughing that can lead to rib fractures, pneum onia, and death. The CDC recommends* one dose for all pregnant women during every pregnancy and all other adults who have not yet received Tdap vaccination, especially those who come in contact with infants. Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine \u2014 similar to Tdap vaccine (see above), but protects against tetanus and diphtheria only, without the pertussis component. 285 Revised: 3/29/2023If I qualify for ASN vaccine, do I have to pay anything? ASN vaccines are supplied to participating medical providers at no cost. This means that ASN providers cannot charge a fee for the vaccine itself. However, providers are allowed to charge an administration fee of up to $25 for each vaccine that is administered. Although ASN providers may charge this administration fee, they cannot deny the vac cine because of an inability to "}
