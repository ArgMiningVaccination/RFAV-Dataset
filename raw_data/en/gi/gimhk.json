Pregnant patients need to be vaccinated to help protect them and their babies against flu and pertussis. However, many of them may be unaware of the recommendations, and others may have questions about them. As women's healthcare professionals, we are a pregnant patient's most trusted health advisor. So for National Infant Immunization Month (NIAM), I've teamed up with CDC to share [these tips to help you talk to them about vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/index.html). 1. Present vaccination as a standard part of obstetric care. When your patients come for their first visit, provide them with information about maternal vaccines and discuss the timeframe for each vaccine in terms of their pregnancy. Don't let the messaging stop with you; be sure that your team members, from nurses to front office staff, are also talking to patients about the importance of vaccinations. When using this consistent approach with a patient, you normalize vaccination as part of her pregnancy care. Discussing it with them in a casual way that links vaccination to another routine practice can help do this, such as linking the timing of the Tdap vaccine to the glucose test conducted at 28 weeks. \"Next time I see you, it'll be time for your Glucose Challenge Screening Test and whooping cough vaccine.\" 2. Provide a strong recommendation. Make your intentions clear: you want them to get vaccinated. In CDC's research, some pregnant women reported that they felt their ob-gyns or midwives weren't strongly recommending vaccines. Use language that clearly conveys your recommendation in favor of vaccination and the importance it has in protecting your patient and her baby against whooping cough and the flu. 3. SHARE additional information as needed. Some patients may choose to vaccinate with just a clear recommendation, however, others may need more information. For these patients you can use the SHARE method: Share, Highlight, Address, Remind, and Explain. \u00b7 Share specific reasons why the vaccine is right for the patient, since she is pregnant which may lead to certain risk factors. \u00b7 Highlight positive experiences with vaccines, either personally or within your practice, to reinforce her confidence in vaccines. \u00b7 Address any questions or concerns she may have about vaccines, including side effects, safety, and effectiveness, using easy-to-understand language. \u00b7 Remind your patient that vaccines protect not only her, but also her baby, family, and other loved ones from many common and serious diseases. \u00b7 Explain the potential costs of getting vaccine preventable diseases, such as serious health effects, missed work, lost time with her family, and financial costs. Remember that patients trust you to give them the best advice on how to protect their health.
