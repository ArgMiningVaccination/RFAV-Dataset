(dizziness, pins and needles/burning, heavy handedness on one side) Hi everyone, Sorry to start a new thread, but I have been reading for a couple of months now about people in the same/similar situation as myself regarding after effects of the Covid-19 vaccination. So I thought I would introduce myself and see if there's anyone out there that is suffering the same thing as me (more so with my left hand symptoms!), but most importantly - I'd like to hear if anyones symptoms have disappeared? I had the 2nd vaccine dose of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021. Following the vaccine I felt ok (just the usual sore arm/fatigue). But at the end of October I had a virus which mirrored Covid-19 symptoms of swollen glands, sore throat, cold, loss of energy and general muscle aches and fatigue. But all my lateral flow tests were negative. Immediately after this virus/illness I started feeling pins and needles sporadically in my right thumb and the upper right side of my top lip, which after a week also went around my right eye too. After about 3 weeks this then stopped but immediately I had a dizziness feeling come over me (like vertigo/imbalance) and pins and needles in my left hand start which will come and go around 30 times a day and last around 10 seconds each time. I feel like I loose all hand-eye co-ordination to my left hand and have a feeling like I'm 'drunk' and heavy handed. (Only to my left hand). I'm not able to do anything such as text with my left hand whilst this feeling comes over me). This has persisted since and within the last week I've now started getting the tingling/pins and needles feeling in my left calf/ankle/heel and sometimes in my quad and thigh. I also still have the tingling on the right hand side of my face (I know when I'm about to have an episode come over me as the tingling starts on my upper right side of my lip!) I'm finding the feeling comes over me randomly - but mostly if I'm waking or running or if I stand up from sitting down. But other than that I can't pin point exact triggers for the sensations. Prior to theses symptoms I have suffered no health issues and I'm a healthy/fit 30 year old female on no medication. I have visited my GP who wasn't able to explain or diagnose my symptoms (as expected). I've had full bloods taken and this has shown nothing so far, they have now referred me to a neurologist to investigate further. I'm just looking for some comfort from people who might have suffered similar symptoms to myself who might be able to pin point an explanation - but most importantly tell me if this awful feeling has gone away - if so, was it with medication? thanks everyone [Murray](https://vestibular.org/participant/murray/) You can get more information here: [https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/paged/893/#post-19746](https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/paged/893/#post-19746) [@sandstorm](https://vestibular.org/participant/sandstorm/) Hi, I'm really glad that I found this forum and your post. I am a 27F healthy/fit and on no medication. A few months ago I started to notice tingling and numbness on both sides of my face, and the right side of my mouth. It was hard to speak during this episode. It lasted about 5-10 minutes. It panicked me. A month later I had the symptoms in my face again, this time coupled with numbness, tingling and pins/needles in both of my legs, mainly my calves. I have had multiple episodes now of tingling/numbness in my face and multiple episodes of not being able to feel my legs. On top of this, I have begun to have extreme dizzy spells. I feel as if someone has drugged me when they happen. It throws me into a panic, and I am very prone to panic attacks, so it has brought a few attacks on as you can imagine. It feels almost as if I am underwater and I'm trying to get back to the surface. I'm extremely upset about what is happening to me. I am a female living in Alabama and I really want to talk to someone who is experiencing this. I have been to the ER and an ENT for vertigo, both confirmed that blood work/CT scan came back normal and that I do not have vertigo. They are unable to help me and I really need help as this sometimes happens when I am driving and become overwhelmed by motion. I am scared to be on the road sometimes. It is started to affect my work life too. It also seems to get worse after I have had any alcohol or any coffee. Strange, I know. If you are willing to talk about this with me, please email me at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). I would really like to talk to someone that understands. Have you found any relief at all? Hey we have an uncensored vax server up and running.. feel free to join to share ideas and helpful tips we currently have members getting positive results and improvements, 2 who have recovered fully Link to discord: [https://discord.gg/mWeeeWF6](https://discord.gg/mWeeeWF6) UPDATE: Hey All, I havent used this site for quite a while... Going on nearly 16 months post x1 pfizer. has anybody fully recovered? Ive gotten a lot better id say roughly around 80%, still have lingering symptoms and a new one which is sudden heart pain. It comes and goes throughout the day every so often sometimes never but i just think wtf is it y'know? Feels like 10 steps forward and 9 steps backwards every month. Ive reduced the level of supplements i take down to the ones i think are essential: Natto/serra Pomegrante Omega 3 Resveratrol Black seed oil Melatonin (You can check through my post history for previous supplements i used to take). Ive done intermittent fasting pretty much daily giving myself a 6 hour window to eat and supp on, was able to hold all 29 days dry fasting from sunrise to sunset in ramadan this year, last year only managed to hold 8 due to severity in symptoms. Ive been walking 10k+ steps 3/4/5 times a week and doing work around the house. Id say im somewhat more back to normal but still not recovered and in fear something may have instead has developed, nothing i hope but considering.. its good to get checked every so often nowerdays since health problems have been rising in scary numbers. Anyway, if you've been around for 1 or 2 years and still on here, please chuck an update in every so often as well to keep others updated as well, sometimes hearing progress or an update is all someone needs to hear to keep them going. Hope we heal Peace. 27M vaccination date: 6th Jan '22 Hi everyone, Sorry to start a new thread, but I have been reading for a couple of months now about people in the same/similar situation as myself regarding after effects of the Covid-19 vaccination.

I also developed visual snow but don't recall how long after. my friend developed light flashes with migraines and the migraine doc said the vaccine caused this. [@anter35](https://vestibular.org/participant/anter35/) can you tell me more about the flashes of light your friend experienced? I started getting something like this 6 weeks after I had Covid last year. I went to the optometrist, ophthalmologist and neuro-ophthalmologist and they were not able to find anything. Interested in hearing more. Thank you, twa [@teresawarren40](https://vestibular.org/participant/teresawarren40/) I had what seemed like sudden onset of like tv snow like on the old tvs when they were on no channel. It was mostly visible on a white background like a computer or a blue sky. Basically it looked like little dots moving constantly. Doctor did a complete work up and no problems with the eye. Googled it and came up with something called visual snow basically a Nero logical hallucination where the brain is overexcited and produces this. Think of it as visual tinnitus which is odd because I have tinnitus. I believe it was caused by anxiety or the COVID vaccine.Best bet is to ignore it use dark background on computer when you see it just focus on what you need to focus on and ignore it that is how you cure it. Hi, has anyone heard of someone having huge amounts of mucus on the lungs as a long term side effect of the pfizer covid jab? (its not me, asking for someone i know) A relief to see I'm not the only one who is still having some issues "}
