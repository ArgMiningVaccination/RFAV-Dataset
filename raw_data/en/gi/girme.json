Some of you will know Steph as vocalist in the early live days of St Etienne. However, Steph has now trained as a registered RTT practitioner and is still putting her beautifully hypnotic voice to good use. RTT can deliver extraordinary change from physical, emotional, and psychological pain by reframing our core beliefs, values, habits, and emotions deep in the subconscious. By rapidly rewiring the brain's neural pathways, RTT replaces our out-dated belief systems and negative behavior patterns. Combining both Binaural Oscillations and RTT Hypnotherapy, this recording takes you on that journey from Alpha through to Theta and leaves you in Delta for a sound night's sleep and lasting imprints of positive suggestion and letting go. Think big bakelite dials controlling cut off, resonance and confidence... Best listened to on headphones and at least 3 times for the RTT to really kick in. To benefit from the full subsonic frequency range download as a wav file. Stephanie is an accredited member of the ACCPH and you can book a life transforming one to one session with Steph at stephieansell@gmail.com. You will also receive a personalised recording after the session and if you are a struggling musician suffering trauma from these weird times, you may be able to get financial help from [www.helpmusicians.org.uk](https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/) BINAURAL BEAT RESEARCH Hemi-sync recordings are made up of two slightly differing frequencies, the difference of which your brain perceives as an oscillation. When listening to Hemi-sync recordings on headphones your brain will become entrained to the same frequency cycle and begin to function on the same level. For example, Alpha waves have a frequency range of between 7 - 14 Hz and by tuning the brain into the Alpha state by use of binaural beats it creates a link between the conscious and subconscious where the mind is far more responsive to information and hypnotic suggestion is far more easily absorbed. Proof: Therapeutic Qualities of Hemi-sync recordings 1) \"A Comprehensive Review of the Psychological Effects of Brainwave Entrainment\", Tina L Huang, PHD, and Christine Charyton, PHD. This binaural beat research paper nicely summarises 20 previous peer-reviewed studies into the psychological effects of Brainwave Entrainment. The overall conclusion was that brainwave entrainment is an \"effective therapeutic tool\". People suffering from cognitive functioning deficits, stress, pain, headaches & migraines, PMS and other behavioural problems all benefitted from using binaural beats. A sample quote from this paper: \"The immediate psychological effects on memory, attention, stress, pain, headaches and migraines were shown to benefit from even a single session of brainwave entrainment\". One study even found that improvements in intelligence and behaviour lasted after the binaural beats were withdrawn, and that previous users could now produce the brainwave frequencies induced by BWE on their own. This suggests that the results can be permanent, even after you stop using binaural beats. 2) Research Papers from Wilson, 1990, and Rhodes, 1993 Conclusion: Binaural Beats increase relaxation, meditation, pain management, improve sleep, and reduce stress. 3) Research Paper from Hiew, 1995 Conclusion: Binaural Beats help to increase creativity, relaxation and meditation. 4) Research from Robert Monroe, Monroe Institute Binaural Beats \"increase focus, problem solving, creativity, memory, learning, sleep induction, pain control and enhanced learning\". This study was also reported in the 1986 book Megabrain, by Michael Hutchison. Proof: Effects of Binaural Beats on the Body This binaural beat research focusses on the impact of Brain Wave Entrainment on the body (including hormone production). 1) Research by Dr Vincent Giampapa, MD, Former President of American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine Dr Giampapa suggested that binaural beats \"dramatically\" affects the production of three hormones directly related to longevity of life and overall well-being; cortisol, DHEA and melatonin: Cortisol is found in the adrenal glands and impacts learning and memory, as too much of it is bad for us and causes stress. DHEA is used as a \"source ingredient\" for virtually every \"good hormone\" the body needs, and helps our immune system. Melatonin is the chemical produced during deep, natural sleep. Having lots of DHEA and melatonin is good for us. 2) Dr Margaret Patterson & Dr Ifor Capel, Marie Curie Cancer Foundation Research Department Binaural beats which take the user into the Alpha brainwave state aids production of serotonin, a hormone which increases relaxation and eases pain. Binaural beats which take users into the theta brainwave state help boost production of catecholamines, which are vital to memory and learning. Proof: Effects of Binaural Beats on the Mind This binaural beat research looks at the impact of BWE on IQ and intelligence. 1) Research Paper by Dr Siegried Othmer In this study brain wave entrainment usage was shown to produce average IQ increases of 23%. In cases where the IQ was lower than 100 to begin with, the average IQ increase was 33 points. Dr Othmer also reported \"dramatic improvements\" in the subjects' visual retention (i.e. memory), auditory memory, reading and arithmetic. In a follow-up study after one year, Dr Othmer reported \"major\" long-term improvements in self-esteem and concentration, and \"significant\" improvements in sleep patterns, irritability, organisation... and even handwriting. Proof: Effects of Binaural Beats on Anxiety This binaural beat research is focussed on the impact brain wave entrainment can have on people who suffer from mild anxiety. 1) Alternative Therapy Health & Medicine, 2001 This study looked at the effectiveness of binaural beats for the treatment of anxiety. Subjects used them 5 times a week for four weeks. The result was that listening to binaural beats caused a \"significant reduction\" in the subjects' anxiety score. 2) Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine, Jan / Feb 2007, \"Binaural Beat Technology in Humans: A Pilot Study to Assess the Psychological and Physiological by Helane Wahbeh, Carlo Calabrese, Heather Zwickey. This binaural beat research study involved 8 healthy adults over a 60 day period. The subjects who used binaural beats reported a \"decrease in anxiety, and an increase in the quality of life\". Effects of Binaural Beats on Sleep Patterns 1) Dr Arthur Hastings, PHD, 1975, \"Tests of the Sleep Induction Technique\" Summary: Binaural Beats usage influences people to fall asleep. Binaural Beat Research into Depression 1) Research Paper by Peniston and Kulkosky, 1989 This experiment involved two groups of alcoholics; one group was sent to a regular \"12 step\" AA programme for help with their condition (control group); the other group received no counselling but were sent for 15 twenty-minute sessions of alpha and theta binaural beats usage (experimental group). Within the AA-attending control group, alcoholism relapse rates 13 months after the test were at 80%. There was no change in levels of depression (as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory). Within the Binaural Beat using experimental group, 13 months later there was only a 20% relapse, and levels of depression had reduced to that of a third, non-alcoholic control group. This is a *huge* improvement on the AA results! 2) Research Paper by Waldkoetter and Sanders, 1997 This Binaural Beat research paper also suggested that Brain Wave Entrainment decreased symptoms of depression in alcoholic test subjects. Therefore, if you're drunk and depressed (and have your Doctor's approval!), feel free to get yourself some Binaural Beats! Proof that Brain Wave Entrainment Works Here is a selection of studies and research papers that prove that Brain Wave Entrainment technology (such as binaural beats and isochronic tones) works. 1) \"Auditory Beats in the Brain\", Dr Gerald Oster, 1973, Scientific American In this first piece of Binaural Beat research, Dr Oster conclusively proved that Binaural Beats do cause Brain Wave Entrainment. This essentially means that Binaural Beat frequencies DO affect the brainwaves by entraining them. 2) \"On the Frequency Limits of Binaural Beats\", Harvard & Acoustical Society of America This study also confirmed that the brain synchronises when Binaural Beats are played. 3) Dr Lester Fehmi, Director of Princeton Behavioural Medicine & Biofeedback Clinic Dr Fehmi confirmed that Brainwave Synchronization (i.e. left brain and right brain operating in harmony) and Brainwave Entrainment can be induced by binaural beats. This was also reported in the 1986 book Megabrain, by Michael Hutchison. 4) Research Paper by Foster, 1990 Conclusion: Alpha Binaural Beats DO increase Alpha brainwaves. 5) \"EEG Disentrainment Feedback\", Dr Ochs, 1993 This paper suggests that there is no need for subjects to be consciously trying to do anything when listening to Binaural Beats to get results. Simply listening to them is enough! More recent research Children with ADD who listened to special binaural beat patterns in combination with amino acid supplementation improved much faster than those who used amino acid supplementation alone (Van Der Schaar, 2009) In 2007, at the Helfgott Research Institute, National College of Natural Medicine in Oregon, researchers documented a general improvement of mood, along with positive physiological changes in a variety of neurotransmitters and hormones.
