It's also often used as a household staple for neutralizing odors, stain removal, and cleaning appliances (you can learn more about that in [THE FULLEST Guide to House Hygiene](https://thefullest.com/2022/03/23/the-fullest-guide-to-house-hygiene/)). However, baking soda has a lot of benefits people aren't as aware of \u2014 from physical healing to its even lesser known spiritual properties. Baking soda is one of our key ingredients in both our [Inheal probiotic saffron milk bath](https://thefullest.com/product/inheal/) and our [Exheal soothing saffron salt bath](https://thefullest.com/product/exheal/). It made its way into our formulations after our founder's doctor prescribed a weekly baking soda and salt bath routine at the height of her autoimmune thyroid issues. She witnessed powerful results! Why is Baking Soda Powerful and What to Look For on the Label? For optimal results, it's best to stick to [all-natural sodium bicarbonate](https://www.thesaltbox.com.au/natural-sodium-bicarbonate-usp-1-10kg-food-grade/) that is food-grade, gluten-free, and 100% natural. If you can also find baking soda that is devoid of chemical alteration, and created from a sourcing process called solution mining, all the better. What is solution mining? It's an approach that uses hot water pumped nearly 2,000 feet underground. Once there, it dissolves the underlying naturally-occurring sodium, or nahcolite beads, found deep within the earth. What returns to the surface is rich, all-natural bicarb-saturated water. At the processing facility, pure sodium bicarbonate is extracted from that brine. Healing Benefits of Adding Baking Soda to Your Bath In particular, baking soda when used in bathing is especially potent and a safer option than topical baking soda treatments. Read on for a non-exhaustive list of the benefits of adding baking soda to your bath... Soothes Sore Muscles When your body is fatigued, it releases lactic acid into your blood that in turn makes it more acidic. Baking soda is a natural antacid. Therefore by adding some of it to your bath, you may feel some relief from muscle cramps and soothe your body after hard workout outs or whenever you're feeling physically tired. Promotes Detoxification The properties of baking soda enhance the body's natural ability to cleanse, detoxify, and purify. It has even been suggested that it can boost your immunity system, especially if combined with Epsom salt, sea salt, and essential oils such as rose or peppermint and natural ingredients such as citrus fruits. Improves Skin Conditions For conditions that cause rashes and itching such as eczema and psoriasis, baking soda may help relieve symptoms. However, it's important to note that topical application of baking soda is not recommended. Instead, it's better to add it to a bath (and also incorporate some other soothing ingredients such as oatmeal or as in our [Inheal](https://thefullest.com/product/inheal/) formulation, goat's milk powder). For example, [The National Eczema Association](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/bathing/) advises running a warm (not hot) bath and soaking for 10-15 minutes. Make sure to gently towel dry and use a clean and soothing moisturizer afterwards. Supports Your Body's Natural pH The term \"pH\" stands for \"power of hydrogen\" to make something either an acid or a base (alkaline). Baking soda is an alkaline substance and can help balance skin, gut, and vaginal pH. Removes Spiritual Blockages While it's completely normal for our mood to ebb and flow, sometimes we forget to check in and feel if the energy we are in is actually our own. Our energy body is in a constant response to the people, places, and practices that we're experiencing and although our body is always working hard to bring us back to harmony, sometimes we may need help clearing stuck or dense energies. Baking soda has long been used as an energetic clearer thanks to its mixture of bicarbonate and sodium ions. They are particularly cleansing as part of a spiritual bath ritual. As you can see, the properties of baking soda make it a natural and affordable healing agent. It's also easy to use and highly impactful \u2014 especially as part of a bath ritual. If you're looking to add baking soda baths into your weekly healing routine, take a closer look at our [Inheal probiotic saffron milk bath](https://thefullest.com/product/inheal/) and our [Exheal soothing saffron salt bath](https://thefullest.com/product/exheal/) that both use baking soda as a base ingredient but are each customized to target specific symptoms \u2014 learn "}
