So why does deception play such a prominent role in our everyday lives? In his bold new work, Rutgers University evolutionary theorist Robert Trivers unflinchingly argues that self-deception evolved in the service of deceit\u2014the better to fool others. We do it for biological reasons\u2014in order to help us survive and procreate. From viruses mimicking host behavior to humans misremembering (sometimes intentionally) the details of a quarrel, science has proven that the deceptive one can always outwit the masses. But we undertake this deception at our own peril. Tickets are first come, first served at the door.

A review of Alvin Plantinga's Where the Conflict Really Lies In this week's eSkeptic, Tim Callahan reviews Alvin Plantinga's [Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0199812098) (2011, Oxford University Press). Where the Substance Really Isn't by Tim Callahan Alvin Plantinga, O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, seems adept at talking philosophy around issues of science without ever grappling with anything concrete. Despite the length of this book I waded through its often impenetrably dense verbiage, searching in vain for much real substance. The author's basic assertion is that, while there is superficial conflict between. science and religion (particularly Christianity), there is, in fact, a deep concord between the two. At the same time, he argues, there is a superficial concord between science and naturalism, but in reality, a deep conflict between them. Naturally, the supposed conflict between science and theism centers on evolution, and Plantinga takes atheist spokesmen\u2014particularly the \"four horsemen of the new atheism,\" Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens\u2014to task for asserting that evolution is directionless and unguided: In this chapter and the one previous, we have been looking into the claim that current scientific evolutionary theory is incompatible with Christian belief. This claim, as we saw, is false. The scientific theory of evolution is not incompatible with Christian belief; what is incompatible with it is the idea that evolution, natural selection, is unguided. But that idea isn't part of evolutionary theory as such; it's instead a metaphysical or theological addition. (p. 65) While it's true that the theory of evolution per se doesn't preclude a creator deity, the fossil record, to which Plantinga never refers or alludes, would seem devoid of any teleological pattern. Consider the basic thesis of a God with whom evolution is compatible. This is the God of teleological arguments, the God who creates life and spurs it on with mutations and natural selection, who goads it forward with the eventual goal of creating beings who, like Him (or Her), are sentient and self-aware. Across the vast panorama of deep time, the creator's work stretches from the simplest life forms to the sentient apex of his grand design: namely, us. This is certainly the God I believed in when I was a theist, and, given the upward course of evolution, it did seem to me then to have a discernible pattern and a grand design. The great curse on this picture, glaringly revealed in the fossil record, is the haphazard nature of mass extinctions. If humans were God's goal, then the rise of mammals to dominance would have to be integral to that goal. By the end of the Permian Period, about 248 million years ago, the mammal-like reptiles were the dominant mega-fauna, and were poised to evolve into dominant mammals. Then the Permian-Triassic extinction wiped out up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial vertebrate species. Among those groups hard hit by this greatest of all mass extinctions were the synapsids, the mammal-like reptiles, which were almost entirely wiped out. As a result, while the few surviving synapsids did evolve into mammals, these were not the dominant mega-fauna. Rather, they were small furtive creatures that eked out a living under the feet of the dinosaurs for about 185 million years, only gaining dominance when another mass extinction annihilated those great beasts 65 million years ago. This begs the question: Why the 185 million-year detour? Were we to compare a creator who dealt thus with his creation to a gardener trimming a hedge, this gardener would have to be incompetent indeed. His hacking away with capricious mass killings would make the tree of life resemble an asymmetrical topiary shaped by a mad-man. Another seeming pattern I used to accept when I was young was that of \"orthogenesis,\" a seeming straight line of evolution, which, again, showed a striking pattern and demonstrated a goal. Orthogenesis, or \"straight line\" evolution, often less elegantly referred to as the \"hat-rack\" model, depicted the evolution of the horse as proceeding from Eohippus (now called Hyracotherium, a loss, to my way of thinking) to Equus, with only a few, quickly pruned, side branches. It was a grand triumph, a great success story, a valiant journey from little Eohippus to magnificent Equus, a great demonstration of the Creator at work. The problem with this picture is that, aside from beginning with Eohippus / Hyracotherium, and ending with Equus, nothing in this epic tale is true. Far from being a great success story, it is one of wretched bare survival. A lone genus of an entire family, out of a many-branched line, escaped extinction. Far from looking like a hat-rack, the phylogenetic tee of the Equidae, like that of life in general, resembles an ill-trimmed bush. The late Stephen Jay Gould noted another example of evolution's randomness in his popular book about the Burgess Shale fauna, [Wonderful Life](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039330700X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=039330700X). Most of the bizarre phyla dominating this Cambrian deposit went extinct, and the survival of one insignificant genus, Pikeia, probable ancestor to all vertebrates, would seem to be a matter of chance and contingency. This is not to say, of course, that natural selection doesn't impose an iron law of survival on chance mutations, or that there isn't a general upward flow of increasing complexity to be found in the fossil record, only that the creator's stamp is missing. Plantinga fails to consider this body of evidence\u2014that of mass extinctions, bare survival and random contingency\u2014upon which Richard Dawkins and others base their assertion that evolution is unguided. He fails to consider it, because, in a book that deals with the issue of whether science in general, and evolution in particular, supports a theistic view or naturalism, he fails to even mention the fossil record\u2014and with it, its implications. In the process of arguing that naturalism is irrational, Plantinga attacks evolutionary psychology. As an example of its failure and the failure of sociobiology to provide a sound basis for ethics and morality, he quotes Michael Ruse and E.O. Wilson as saying in a paper entitled \"The Evolution of Ethics\" (reprinted in the 1993 volume Religion and the Natural Sciences, edited by James Hutchinson, published by Harcourt, Brace), \"ethics is an illusion fobbed off on us by our own genes to get us to cooperate; thus morality ultimately seems to be about self-interest.\" Did Ruse and Wilson actually say that ethics is an illusion and morality is just about self-interest? Sort of. The quote is only small part of the original section from which the quote was taken. Let us restore it to its original context with Plantinga's quote in boldface. The time has come to take seriously the fact that we humans are modified monkeys, not the favored Creation of a Benevolent God on the Sixth Day. In particular, we must recognize our biological past in trying to understand our interactions with others. We must think again especially about our so-called 'ethical principles'. The question is not whether biology\u2014specifically, our evolution\u2014is connected with ethics, but how. As evolutionists, we see that no justification of the traditional kind is possible. Morality, or more strictly our belief in morality, is merely an adaptation put in place to further our reproductive ends. Hence the basis of ethics does not lie in God's will\u2014or in the metaphorical roots of evolution or any other part of the framework of the Universe. In an important sense, ethics as we understand it is an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate. It is without external grounding. Ethics is produced by evolution but is not justified by it because, like Macbeth's dagger, it serves a powerful purpose without existing in substance. ... Unlike Macbeth's dagger, ethics is a shared illusion of the human race. Ethics is illusory inasmuch as it persuades us that it has an objective reference. This is the crux of the biological position. Once it is grasped, everything falls into place. It is apparent that not only has Plantinga failed to install an ellipsis between \"ethics\" and \"is an illusion\" and that \"ethics as we understand it is an illusion,\" is a considerably less provocative statement than Plantinga's quote, but that placed in its original context it is a much different statement than it is in Plantinga's portrayal of it. The statement that morality is about self-interest would seem to be from another paragraph altogether. This is, of course, a tactic with which we skeptics are all too familiar, having seen so often dishonestly employed by creationists. It is extremely disappointing to see it thus used by someone of Dr. Plantinga's stature. What is implied by the cherry-picked quote, taken out of context, is that Ruse and Wilson, seeing ethics and morality as illusory, would also see it as something to be dispensed with. Of course, that's not at all what they are saying. Rather, they argue that ethics and morality are not God-given, but rooted biologically in our nature. In yet another attack on the rationality of naturalism and as an example of the innate agreement between science and theism, the author raises the argument of the fine-tuning of the universe. Here we see the sad spectacle of a philosopher seizing on a scientific concept he truly doesn't understand and using it to make a philosophical point. He writes: For example, if the force of gravity were even slightly stronger, all stars would be blue giants; if even slightly weaker, all would be red dwarfs; in neither case would life have developed. The same goes for the weak and strong nuclear forces; if either had been slightly different, life, at any rate life even remotely similar to the sort we have, could probably not have developed. (p. 199) A number of physicists, among them Victor Stenger, have pointed out many of the fallacies of this argument. For example, in his book [Just Six Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465036732/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0465036732) (often cited by fine-tuning advocates) Martin Rees says that the gravitational constant would have to increase by a factor of 3000 to preclude the formation of stars. This doesn't sound that fine-tuned. As to the fine-tuning of the strong force, consider the mass of the proton. Is it that fine tuned? In his article \"Rough-Tuned Universe\" ( [Skeptic vol. 16, no. 4 2011](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol16n04.html), p. 51) Christopher Sirola notes: Change something as simple as the mass of a proton, it is said, and nuclear fusion no longer works. The physicist Victor Stegner created a simple computer program to refute such charges, and on his web site one can alter a star's parameters. I tried doubling the mass of the proton\u2014fairly important since stars generate energy by turning protons into larger nuclei\u2014and while the star's lifetime was cut roughly in half, it still had hundreds of millions of years to live. The \"fundamental\" constants of the universe, it seems, aren't so fundamental after all. Take the force of gravity. The fine-tuning argument says it had to be precisely what it is in order for the universe to expand as it did after the Big Bang. Too strong and the universe would collapse back to a singularity. Too weak and the universe would expand too rapidly. This doesn't seem to depend on other parameters. So doesn't the exactness of gravity alone imply design? No. If you're going to circumvent Stenger's argument by focusing on a single value, gravity is the wrong one to pick because it didn't have to be all that exact. In Rees' book he finds that the gravitational constant would have to increase by a factor of 3000 to preclude the formation of stars. (I've never seen anyone use the same approach on another constant, so I suspect none of the others have similarly obvious independent significance.) Plantinga quotes Stephen Hawking from \"The Anisotropy of the Universe at Large Times\" (in [Confrontation Theories with Observational Data](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9027704562/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=9027704562) M.S. Longair ed. 1973): \"reduction of the rate of expansion by one part in 1012 at the time when the temperature of the Universe was 1010K would have resulted in the Universe starting to recollapse when it radius was only 1/3000 of and the temperature was still 10,000 degrees.\" But on p. 128 of [A Brief History of Time](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380168/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0553380168), Hawking says: \"The rate of expansion of the universe [in the inflationary model] would automatically become very close to the critical rate determined by the energy density of the universe. This could then explain why the rate of expansion is still so close to the critical rate, without having to assume that the initial rate of expansion of the universe was very carefully chosen.\" The final chapter of Plantinga's book is an exercise in symbolic logic. It would seem that what is first needed to decipher this chapter is a translation into English. Here's an example: That's how things stand for nonreductive naturalism: P(R/N&E&nonreductive materialism) is low. We can deal more briefly with P(R/N&E&reductive materialism), the probability of R given naturalism and evolution and reductive materialism. On reductive materialism, mental properties are complex combinations of physical properties; more briefly, taking complex combinations of physical properties to be themselves physical properties, mental properties just are physical properties. What is the probability of R on N&E and reductive materialism? (p. 343) Here is a key to the letters in the quasi-mathematical formulae above: P is probability. R is the proposition that our cognitive faculties are reliable. N is naturalism, and E is the proposition that our cognitive faculties came about through evolution. So, I guess what Plantinga is saying that P(R/N&E&nonreductive materialism) is low, is this: The probability that our cognitive faculties are reliable based on evolution, naturalism and non-reductive materialism is low. I must confess that, having read what led up to this conclusion, I really can't figure out how he came to it. However, it all seems to go back to this statement on p. 326: \"Nietzche, Nagel, Stroud, Churchland, and Darwin, nontheists all, seem to concur: (naturalistic) evolution gives one a reason to doubt that human cognitive faculties produce for the most part true beliefs.\" So, out of this doubt, which Plantinga boils down to the phrase \"Darwin's doubt,\" he manufactures the bold statement that our cognitive faculties\u2014which can be anything from a belief that movement in the tall grasses may be a lion stalking us, to the belief that lightning is being hurled at the earth by an angry god\u2014cannot be considered reliable based on naturalism. Since our cognitive faculties are, at least to some degree reliable, naturalism contradicts science. Or, am I missing something here? It also occurs to me that many fallacious ideas, such as that lighting is being hurled at the earth by an angry god, are in no way detrimental to survival in a primitive state\u2014that of hunter-gatherer, a subsistence farmer or a herdsman. These occupations being the state of most of the human race for most of its existence means that only recently has our innate non-rational nature become a problem. It's much like our cravings for sugar, salt and fats, all of which were aids to survival in the general scarcity of salt, immediate sources of energy (sugar) and long range, high energy storage foods (fats). Only recently did these cravings become detrimental. The idea that our cognitive faculties are, in the raw, reliable in the concrete and near term, yet initially (i.e. without training) unreliable in the abstract, seems to be an alternative Plantinga hasn't explored. Yet, the scientific method is an elaborate means by which to overcome the naturally subjective and essentially irrational nature of the human mind. Thus, the existence of the discipline we call science would seem to undercut Plantinga's argument that naturalism and science are in conflict.

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Harriet Hall, M.D. (a.k.a. the SkepDoc) takes a look at antioxidants. What are they? How do they work? How much is enough? What happens when we ingest more antioxidants than we need? Is the excess excreted? Does it just sit there doing nothing? Does it do something we didn't intend? And, if they're so good for us, wouldn't more of them necessarily be better? Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. Find out why. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 16, number 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol16n04.html) (2011). Antioxidants? It's a Bit More Complicated by Harriet Hall, M.D. (a.k.a. the SkepDoc) I am getting very annoyed with antioxidants. Like Pavlov's dogs, I'm becoming conditioned to flinch when I hear the word \"antioxidant\" because it is so often followed by oversimplifications, distortions, and partial truths. The hype is everywhere, in magazines, on the Internet, on the radio, in books, in stores. Antioxidants promise to prevent heart disease, cancer, cataracts, Alzheimer's, and even wrinkles; they will make you live longer and keep your mind sharp, along with making you feel young again. Well who wouldn't want that? Every day I am bombarded with recommendations for foods, supplements, and skin creams that are \"a good source of antioxidants,\" \"high in antioxidants,\" or \"anti-aging\" products. Everyone knows antioxidants are wonderful. Everyone except for skeptical scientists who realize it's a bit more complicated than that. Antioxidants prevent oxidation. Oxidation is the process whereby oxygen atoms combine with other substances. When oxygen combines with iron, we call it rust. So what is \"rusting\" in our bodies? Free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules or ions that have an unpaired electron that is desperately seeking to complete a pair. Normal metabolism creates free radicals like superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. They are necessary for life; we need them for killing bacteria, for cell signaling processes, and other functions. But since free radicals will react indiscriminately with anything, they can also cause damage, for instance by reacting with DNA to cause mutations. Oxidative stress (an excess of free radicals) has been linked to cancer, heart disease, and many other disorders; but it's not always entirely clear whether it is a cause, a result, or an innocent bystander that just came along for the ride. Some people think it is accumulated damage from free radicals that makes us grow old and die prematurely; they assume that suppressing the damage with antioxidants would increase our life span. We need a few free radicals to function properly, but an excess of them can wreak havoc. Our bodies know better than to let havoc reign unchecked. They produce neutralizing enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases to keep the free radical population under control. They make use of the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E in our food, and they produce metabolites like bilirubin and uric acid with antioxidant properties. We can do our part to maintain our bodies' defenses by insuring an adequate dietary intake of nutrients. But can we, should we, do more? How much is enough? Should we take supplements? It's seductive to think we could improve on nature and prolong our lives. If antioxidants are good, wouldn't more antioxidants necessarily be better? Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. As Ben Goldacre explains in his book [Bad Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865479186/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0865479186), Human biochemistry is a vast interlocking web. An intervention in one place can have quite unexpected consequences; there are feedback mechanisms, compensatory mechanisms. Rates of change in one localized area can be limited by quite unexpected factors that are entirely remote from what you are altering, and excesses of one thing in one place can distort the usual pathways and flows, to give counterintuitive results. Darn! Pseudoscience and marketing are so easy and straightforward and black and white; why does real science have to be so difficult? What happens when we ingest more antioxidants than we need? Is the excess excreted? Does it just sit there doing nothing? Does it do something we didn't intend? It would be nice to know. There is good evidence that people who eat more fruits and vegetables are less likely to develop cancer, heart disease, and other ailments\u2014and are likely to live longer. It's easy to assume that the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables are responsible, but that might not be true. Other components of these foods (such as flavonoids) or the mixture of components in the diet might be responsible. Or maybe people who eat less fruit and vegetables are eating more of something else that causes those diseases. If antioxidants in food do reduce the incidence of those diseases, it's only logical to think that antioxidant supplements would reduce the incidence even more. Unfortunately, controlled studies have consistently shown that they either have no effect or make things worse. It's not the first time reality has rudely intervened to spoil a great idea. Study after study has shown no benefit of antioxidants for heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or longevity. One study did show that an antioxidant combination slowed the progression of established moderate-to-severe macular degeneration, but more research is needed to confirm those results. Early observational studies suggested that vitamin E supplements reduced the risk of heart disease. I remember reading a report from a cardiologist back when the enthusiasm was at its height. He and his partners had been blithely prescribing high doses of vitamin E for their patients and taking it themselves. After they and many of their patients developed flu-like symptoms, it finally dawned on them that they were experiencing toxic effects from vitamin E overdose. They cut back on the dosage, but kept using it. Subsequently, better studies showed harm rather than benefit. Subjects taking vitamin E supplements were more likely to develop heart failure. Antioxidant supplements can cause damage. They can be toxic in high doses, can bind to minerals in the diet and prevent their absorption, and can increase the risk of lung cancer. One study was terminated early because of a 46% higher rate of lung cancer deaths in those taking beta-carotene. Post-menopausal women who took vitamin A supplements had more fractures. Some studies have shown an increase in colorectal adenomas. There are reasons to think antioxidants might interfere with some cancer treatments. An analysis of 68 trials with a total of nearly a quarter of a million subjects found that antioxidant supplements increased the mortality rate. Some experts think that antioxidant supplements have been adequately tested and found not to help; believers argue that the studies may not have tested the right substances or used the optimal doses. The \"superfood\" industry has capitalized on the antioxidant craze. The recipe is simple: Pick a fruit, preferably something exotic and tropical. Claim it is a superfood with unique benefits. Develop a concentrate, a pill, or a mixture with other special ingredients. Advertise it with claims that can sneak by FDA restrictions. Solicit testimonials; make them up if necessary. Get several of your friends to try it so you can claim it is \"clinically tested.\" Start a multilevel marketing company. Charge exorbitantly high prices. Make big bucks. Noni juice, a\u00e7a\u00ed berry, mangosteen, goji, camu camu; even the less exotic green tea, blueberries and pomegranates have generated fortunes. The superfoods concept involves a fallacy. These fruits don't offer any benefits that you can't get from components of a normal healthy diet. The fact that they contain high levels of a nutrient is meaningless, since you can get the same amount by eating more of other foods that contain lower levels. One 650mg Tylenol doesn't work any better than two 325mg pills. All kinds of antioxidant supplement mixtures are sold. Each claims unique benefits but supports those claims with testimonials rather than with real evidence. Some depend on a gimmick such as a unique proprietary manufacturing process or better absorption. They may claim a synergistic effect from a certain combination of ingredients, but these claims are never supported by published studies. How did they decide to combine those specific ingredients? Did someone in the company employ intuition or use a dartboard? One anti-aging product, Protandim, claims to act by a different approach. It \"persuades your body to increase its own production of antioxidants\" and is alleged to \"help prevent free radical damage to your cells thousands of times more effectively than any conventional antioxidant therapy... slowing down the rate of cell aging to the level of a 20 year old.\" What's in it? Milk thistle, bacopa, ashwagandha, green tea extract and turmeric. Hmm...and how exactly does this particular combination persuade your body to increase its production of antioxidants? How do they know it works? They have a grand total of one study in humans: it showed an increase in a TBARS (ThioBarbituric Acid Reactive Substances) blood test. They have one study showing that it reduced the incidence of skin cancers in mice. They have a couple of other studies in mice and in test tubes. They have zero evidence of clinical effects in humans, much less of extended life span. But they have lots of testimonials and you can sign up to become a distributor. Be wary of claims based on improvements in lab tests. There are many of these, like TBARS and ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) scores; you can even buy a home urine test to measure lipid peroxide levels. The same substance may show either pro-oxidant or anti-oxidant effects, depending on which test you choose. The human body is a more complicated environment than a test tube. None of these in vitro tests have been validated as corresponding to in vivo antioxidant effects or to any clinical benefit. Products with high TBARS levels have not been shown to improve patient outcome by any objective measurements. Vitamin E, which we know is a powerful antioxidant in the body, has a very low ORAC score. Antioxidants are important for health, but so are free radicals. We need to know a lot more before we can confidently recommend increased antioxidant intake for everyone. The American Heart Association doesn't recommend taking antioxidant supplements; they're waiting until better evidence becomes available. For now, they say what Mom said: \"Eat your vegetables.\" That's prudent advice for other health reasons too; it's a slam-dunk.

Yet as the Harvard University psychologist and New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows in this startling and engaging new work, just the opposite is true: violence has been diminishing for millennia and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. For most of history, war, slavery, infanticide, child abuse, assassinations, pogroms, gruesome punishments, deadly quarrels, and genocide were ordinary features of life. But today, Pinker shows all these forms of violence have dwindled and are widely condemned. How has this happened? This groundbreaking work continues Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature, mixing psychology and history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly nonviolent world. The key, he explains, is to understand our intrinsic motives\u2014the inner demons and the better angels\u2014and how changing circumstances have allowed our better angels to prevail.

He treats both as rather disconcerting indicators of the level of public discourse in general, and of the conflict between science and pseudoscience in particular. It is an area that is both usually neglected within the context of discussing science in the public arena and yet crucial to our understanding of how science is perceived or misperceived by the public. This excerpt appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 16, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol16n01.html) (2010). Science by Think Tank The Rise of Think Tanks and the Decline of Public Intellectuals by Massimo Pigliucci Are public intellectuals in the 21st century an endangered species or a thriving new breed? Before we can sensibly ask whether public intellectuals are on the ascent, the decline, or something entirely different, we need to agree on what exactly, or even approximately, constitutes a public intellectual. It turns out that this isn't a simple task and that the picture one gets from the literature on intellectualism depends largely on what sort of people one counts as \"public intellectuals,\" or, for that matter, what sort of activities count as intellectual to begin with. Nonetheless, some people (usually intellectuals) have actually spent a good deal of time thinking about such matters and have come up with some useful suggestions. For example, in [Public Intellectuals: An Endangered Species?](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0742542556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0742542556) Amitai Etzioni quotes the Enlightenment figure Marquis de Condorcet to the effect that intellectuals are people who devote themselves to \"the tracking down of prejudices in the hiding places where priests, the schools, the government and all long-established institutions had gathered and protected them.\" [1](#note01) Or perhaps one could go with the view of influential intellectual Edward Said, who said that intellectuals should \"question patriotic nationalism, corporate thinking, and a sense of class, racial or gender privilege.\" [2](#note02) Should one feel less romantic (even a bit cynical, perhaps) about the whole idea, one might prefer instead Paul Johnson, who said that \"a dozen people picked at random on the street are at least as likely to offer sensible views on moral and political matters as a cross-section of the intelligentsia.\" [3](#note03) Or go with David Carter, who wrote in the Australian Humanities Review that \"public intellectuals might be defined as those who see a crisis where others see an event.\" [4](#note04) Regardless of how critical one is of the very idea of public intellectualism, everyone seems to agree that there are a few people out there who embody\u2014 for better or worse\u2014what a public intellectual is supposed to be. By far the most often cited example is the controversial linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky. Indeed, his classic article \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals,\" written in 1963 for the New York Review of Books, is a must-read by anyone interested in the topic, despite its specific focus on the Vietnam War (then again, some sections could have been written during the much more recent second Iraq War, almost without changing a word). [5](#note05) For Chomsky the basic idea is relatively clear: \"Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions.... It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies.\" [6](#note06) Yet one could argue that it is the responsibility of any citizen in an open society to do just the sort of things that Chomsky says intellectuals ought to do, and indeed I doubt Chomsky would disagree. But he claims that intellectuals are in a special position to do what he suggests. How so? It is not that Chomsky is claiming that only genetically distinct subspecies of human beings possess special reasoning powers allowing them to be particularly incisive critics of social and political issues. Rather, it is that intellectuals\u2014at their best\u2014are more insightful in social criticism because they can afford to devote a lot of time to reading and discussing ideas\u2014something that most people trying to make a living simply do not have the time or energy to do. Moreover, intellectuals have a duty to be so engaged with society because often their vantage point is the result of a privileged position granted them by society, most obviously in the case of academic intellectuals (but also journalists, some artists, and assorted others), who are somewhat shielded from most direct political influence or financial constraints, and whose professional ethos requires intellectual honesty and rigor. Of course, none of this guarantees that public intellectuals always get it right, or that they always further the welfare of society. The classic counter- example, mentioned by Chomsky himself, is the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Heidegger is a controversial figure, to say the least, both academically and politically (not unlike Chomsky himself, though the similarity ends there). Some commentators consider him one of the greatest of modern philosophers; others think that his writings are full of obfuscatory language and sheer nonsense. He was the mentor of Leo Strauss\u2014who in turn inspired the modern neoconservative movement\u2014as well as the father of several movements that feature prominently in the \"culture wars,\" such as deconstructionism and postmodernism. At any rate, Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg in Germany in 1933, under the auspices of the Hitler regime. The inaugural address he delivered is in fact a good example of convoluted nonsense, and it just as clearly represents the exact antithesis of what a public intellectual should be. After having waxed poetic about spiritual missions and the \"essence\" of German universities, Heidegger went on to say that \"German students are on the march. And whom they are seeking are those leaders through whom they want to elevate their own purpose so that it becomes a grounded, knowing truth,\" a rather ominous presage of things to come for the German youth. And he kept going: \"Out of the resoluteness of the German students to stand their ground while German destiny is in its most extreme distress comes a will to the essence of the university.... The much-lauded 'academic freedom' will be expelled from the German university.\" [7](#note07) Heidegger's connection with the Nazis will forever taint his legacy, making him a permanent warning to aspiring public intellectuals about what route not to follow. Chomsky, on the other hand\u2014in a prose infinitely clearer and more compelling than Heidegger's \u2014raises the question of what the duty of an intellectual ought to be, and answers that she has to be concerned with the creation and analysis of ideologies, including those endorsed or produced by intellectuals themselves. Since the public intellectual, according to Chomsky, has to insist on truth, she also has to see things in their historical perspective, truly to learn from history rather than be bound to repeat the same mistakes over and over. Of course, the whole concept of \"truth,\" and by implication the efficacy of both science and of intellectual discourse, has been questioned by those academic heirs of Heidegger known as postmodernists. Setting that aside for a moment, however, there are in fact other ways of being skeptical of the whole idea of public intellectualism, for example in the analysis of Richard Posner, author of [Public Intellectuals: A Study in Decline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674012461/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0674012461). [8](#note08) Posner was a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and later became a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals (Seventh Circuit), to which he was nominated by President Reagan. By all accounts, Posner is considered a major and influential legal theorist. Despite being a highly regarded intellectual, his analysis of intellectuals as a breed is anything but sympathetic, although he makes several interesting points that we need to consider while attempting to put together a general picture of intellectualism and how it relates to public understanding of science. Posner, by his own account, wrote his book as a result of what he perceived as the low quality of public intellectuals' commentaries in two high-profile cases in which he was involved: the impeachment hearings of President Clinton and the antitrust case against Microsoft. Posner's thesis is that there has indeed been a decline of intellectuals in the United States, but that this isn't a matter of fewer of them being around. On the contrary, the \"market\" for intellectualism has allegedly increased dramatically in recent years, but the quality of the individuals populating such a market has decreased sharply. Posner accounts for this double trend (increase in quantity and decrease in quality) with an ingenious, if certainly debatable, analysis of some of the forces shaping both the supply of and the demand for public intellectuals. On the supply side, intellectuals are now almost exclusively an academic phenomenon. Gone are the days of Zola and (Anatole) France, when it was the independent artist or writer who was more likely to be outspoken about social matters. Instead, the rise of universities (in terms of both numbers and financial resources) after World War II has catalyzed a shift toward academic-type intellectuals. Academics are better positioned than independents to play a role in public discourse because they are more readily perceived as credentialed individuals, and they can afford to stick their neck out about controversial matters in the relative safety of a tenured position. Not that all is good and well for academics who wish to venture in the public arena. As Posner points out, there are pros and cons that need to be carefully evaluated. On the side of incentives there is the possibility of monetary reward (academic salaries aren't what they used to be), though it is fairly rare that an academic actually lands a major book contract or is in sufficient demand to command significant honoraria for speaking engagements. On the side of disincentives, there are several, some potentially career-crippling. To begin with, the more time an academic devotes to speaking and writing for the public, the less time she has to engage in scholarship and research\u2014and it is the latter that gets you tenure and promotions, which helps explain why most public academics are middle aged, post-tenure, and possibly past their intellectual prime. Moreover, the myth of the ivory tower is anything but a myth: despite occasional protestations to the contrary, most academics themselves see engaging the public as a somewhat inferior activity, sought after by people who are vain, in search of money, not particularly brilliant scholars, or all of the above. According to Amitai Etzioni, after his death astronomer and science writer Carl Sagan was referred to as a \"cunning careerist\" and a \"compulsive popularizer\"\u2014not exactly encouraging words for other scientists considering following in his footsteps. [9](#note09) Posner also turns his analysis to the other side of the coin, looking into what sort of demand there might be for public intellectuals. He suggests that there are at least three \"goods\" that public intellectuals may be \"selling,\" and that therefore influence the level of \"demand\" for intellectuals themselves. Besides the obvious one, that is, presumably authoritative opinions on current issues of general relevance, there are what Posner calls \"entertainment\" and \"solidarity\" values. There is little question that we live in a society in which entertainment, broadly defined, reigns supreme. The nightly news, not to mention the 24- hour news channels, are increasingly less about serious journalism and more about sensationalism or soft news, so much so that one can make a not entirely preposterous argument that The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is actually significantly more informative than the real news shows that it is meant to spoof. As biologist Richard Dawkins lamented, [10](#note10) we think that our kids need to have \"fun, fun, fun\" rather than, say, experience wonder or interest (they are not the same thing) when going to school or a museum. It is therefore no surprise that even intellectuals have to possess an entertainment value of sorts, although it is of course difficult to quantify it and its effect, if any, on the demand for public intellectuals. Such effect will also depend greatly on the specific media outlet: while there are plenty of TV channels and newspapers for which the entertainment value is probably close to the top of priorities, there are still serious media outlets out there (BBC radio and TV, National Public Radio, Public Television, the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Guardian, The Economist, Slate.com, and Salon.com come to mind, among many others) where the relevance and insight of what the intellectual has to say are paramount. We come next to the concept of \"solidarity value\" proposed by Posner. This is often underestimated, but I suspect it does play an increasingly important (and, unfortunately, negative) role in public discourse. The idea is that many, perhaps most, people don't actually want to be informed, and even less so challenged in their beliefs and worldview. Rather, they want to see a champion defending their preconceived view of the world, a sort of ideological knight in shining armor. Blatantly partisan outlets such as Fox News (on the right), Air America (on the left), and the countless number of Evangelical Christian radio stations are obvious examples of this phenomenon, but perhaps the most subtle and pernicious incarnations of it are all over the Internet. The characteristics of that medium are such that it is exceedingly easy to customize your access so that you will only read what people \"on your side\" are saying, never to be exposed to a single dissenting viewpoint. While blogs, for example, are indubitably a revolutionary and potentially very powerful way to expand social discourse, it is also very easy to bookmark or subscribe by feed to a subset selected in order to further entrench, rather than challenge, your opinions. All things considered, Posner's arguments point toward a level of supply and demand for public intellectuals that translates into a larger number of them than probably at any time in history. But, of course, quantity is rarely an indication of quality, which brings us to Posner's contention that the decline of the intellectual is a matter of lowered quality. There are fundamentally three reasons for this conclusion, all of which are circumstantial, as it is very hard to assess the quality of public intellectual discourse in any objective and statistically quantifiable way. We have already seen the first reason: since intellectuals are sought after at least in part for their entertainment and solidarity values, and given that neither of these is presumably related at all to the degree of insight offered by the opinions being delivered, quality is liable to suffer. The second reason advanced by Posner is the inevitable march of academia toward increased specialization of its scholars. Remember that most modern intellectuals are academics, and they are successful within academia because they specialize in incredibly narrow fields of scholarship and research\u2014 since most of the broad ones have already been covered exhaustively by their predecessors. For example, the joke used to be that philosophers are people who know nothing about everything (they are intellectual generalists), while scientists know everything about nothing (they are intellectual specialists). But in today's universities, even philosophers are converging toward the stereotype of the scientist: I know colleagues in philosophy departments who spend a lifetime publishing analyses of the work of just one (usually long-dead) philosopher, and often not a major one at that. Similarly, some of my colleagues in science think it absolutely crucial to invest many hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless graduate-student years to figure out whether an obscure species of mushroom is by any chance found also in Antarctica. This is the way it must work if one wishes to contribute something truly novel to one's field. Finally, there is the failure of the so-called marketplace of ideas, which Posner is one of the few to keenly recognize. The phrase originated with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote the dissenting opinion in the infamous Abrams v. United States case argued in 1919 in front of the Supreme Court that was a test of a law passed the year before that made criticism of the U.S. government a criminal offense. The law was upheld, and the statute not invalidated until Brandenburg v. Ohio, during the Vietnam War. Holmes wrote passionately about the safeguard for freedom of speech enshrined in the American Constitution, arguing that \"the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas\u2014that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which [men's] wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution.\" Holmes was correct in suggesting that a necessary condition for maximizing our chances to find the truth about whatever subject matter or for reaching a consensus on moral and social issues is to allow ideas to \"compete\" for people's minds and hearts. Posner's point is that this is by no means a sufficient condition. There is need of a second factor in addition to the free marketplace of ideas, and this is that for the best ideas to win the competition the judges must be, well, competent. But the judges here aren't indisputable facts that can be verified by anyone; they are the opinions of a generally badly informed and undereducated (with respect to the relevant issues) public. This is a public that has little time for the sort of in-depth analyses and research that would allow it to actually assess the contributions of intellectuals on their merit. Ironically, this is precisely why Chomsky says that it is up to intellectuals, not the public, to do the hard work of research and documentation. The problem, Posner suggests, is that the public tends to go by much less reliable proxies of quality, such as credentials (but, really, it isn't that difficult to get a Ph.D., even from a reputable university) and the rhetorical abilities of the intellectuals themselves. There is much to be commended in Posner's analysis of the decline of the modern intellectual, and yet one cannot help thinking that it is somewhat self-destructive for intellectuals such as Posner to be so critical of their own role in society. A good reality check is a positive and necessary part of public as well as academic discourse, but an exceedingly negative attitude soon breeds contempt for intellectual discourse itself and a nihilistic dismissal of it. A more positive approach to the analysis of contemporary intellectualism is perhaps provided by Frank Furedi in his Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone? which starts out not with self-criticism, but with ridiculing politicians in charge of public education, namely, the then Labour secretary of state for education in the UK, Charles Clarke. Clarke characterized the idea of education for its own sake\u2014the very foundation of the so-called liberal educational approach common in modern universities\u2014as \"dodgy,\" which can be interpreted to mean anything from dishonest and unreliable to potentially dangerous. Clarke's opinion is that the government should not support \"the medieval concept of a community of scholars seeking truth.\" [11](#note11) Along similar lines, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan infamously said during his campaign for governor of California in the late 1960s that universities should not subsidize intellectual curiosity. Of course Furedi is fully cognizant of the fact that a liberal education, just like the idea of a fearless public intellectual, is an ideal and has never corresponded to a historical reality at any point in the past. But it makes a big difference in terms of attitudes and motivations whether we consider an ideal a goal to strive for or we dismiss it as irrelevant, outdated, or even positively dangerous. While Furedi devotes some space to blaming postmodernism for the decline of intellectualism, a more intriguing observation is that intellectualism is on the retreat just at the time we keep hearing of a \"knowledge economy\" and when bookstores, book clubs, poetry readings, museums, and galleries are doing increasingly well, to the point of having a single TV show in the United States (The Oprah Winfrey Show) determining which book will become the next overnight bestseller. Yet this apparent paradox is actually explainable by the same distinction that Posner made about intellectuals themselves: quantity does not necessarily translate into quality. While bookstores are increasingly popular, there are basically only two or three major chains left in most parts of the United States (and at least one of them is rumored to be close to bankruptcy), which means that a small number of individuals wields a huge amount of decision power when it comes to which books to promote and which to relegate to the back shelves or even keep out of the store (and, largely, off the market). Winfrey, to her credit, has almost singlehandedly made the rather esoteric and somewhat snobbish idea of a book club one of the most popular activities engaged in by scores of Americans. Then again, some of her picks have been embarrassing, as in the infamous case of James Frey (author of [A Million Little Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307276902/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0307276902)), who turned out to have made up large parts of his allegedly autobiographical story (Winfrey eventually challenged him on her show, but her initial response was that he may have been telling a subjective truth\u2014a perfect postmodernist and nonsensical way of saving face). Furedi identifies another culprit in the ongoing quest for the disappearance of the public intellectual: the assault on meritocracy. Americans in particular have always had a rather bipolar attitude toward meritocracy: on the one hand, the United States was established by people whose very creed included the idea that it is merit, not birthright, that ought to determine one's fortunes. American bookstores abound with large sections of books written by successful people telling others how to become successful, and American CEOs and sports figures are lionized because of their merits, not because of their family trees. Then again, one of the reasons Al Gore lost the 2000 presidential election against George W. Bush is because Gore was seen as an \"egg-headed intellectual,\" obviously an insult, not a compliment. Furedi's take is that over the past several decades the very conception of meritocracy has shifted from a powerful incentive paving the way to a fairer society to an intrinsically anti-egalitarian and undemocratic tool of oppression. The reasons for this are many and complex, and they include the rise of new philosophies of teaching within education departments at colleges throughout the nation, as well as the recognition of the sociological fact that certain minorities tend to be at a disadvantage in our meritocratic system as presently constituted (this is not, obviously, a point in favor of biological racism, but a concession to the real difficulties in overcoming cultural conditions and in creating a true level playing field). Furedi proposes the bold thesis that the currently entrenched rejection of meritocracy is based on two mistaken ideas: first, that a large section of the population is somehow intrinsically incapable of achieving high academic standards; and second, that this failure leads to mental distress, and therefore it is appropriate to substitute \"feeling good\" for actual results. This is a recipe for disaster, because, as Furedi puts it, \"Rewarding merit implies treating people as adults, whereas magicking away the sense of failure is motivated by the desire to treat them as children.\" Think-Tankery: From Intellectualism to Spindoctorism? Think tanks are now pervasive worldwide: according to Diane Stone, as of the year 2000 there were 4,000 think tanks active in nations across the globe, [12](#note12) and that number\u2014very likely a gross underestimation\u2014 has certainly gone up since. Despite their number and prominent daily presence in the news, there aren't that many sociological studies of think tanks, and even fewer critical analyses of their role in shaping public opinion. Indeed, there is not much agreement on what, exactly, defines a think tank to begin with. For the purposes of this discussion, I will use the term \"think tank\" to refer to a specific kind of organization, namely, a private group, usually but not always privately funded, producing arguments and data aimed at influencing specific sectors of public policy. This definition, therefore, does not apply to most advisory groups established by a given government, nor to university institutes or centers, nor to groups set up to resolve specific problems within the normal operation of a corporation. Although I am generally skeptical of think tanks as a concept, and very critical of the operation of specific ones, I do not mean to imply that all think tanks are useless or pernicious, nor that the general idea cannot in principle be pursued in an honest and constructive fashion. But I am struck by how little critical evaluation of the phenomenon there seems to be, both in the literature on think tanks and more importantly by the media and politicians who are the primary direct consumers of think tanks' output. Donald Abelson gives a useful historical perspective on think tanks. [13](#note13) According to Abelson, the concept went through four relatively distinct phases since its inception about a century ago. The first generation of think tanks appeared in the early 1900s and was the product of the preoccupation of a small number of rich entrepreneurs concerned with the necessity of providing sound, rational advice to the government at a time of increasing complexity of both domestic and foreign policy problems. Thus, people like Carnegie and Rockefeller provided large permanent endowments to these groups, which made them essentially independent from government support (and, therefore, influence) as well as freed them from the necessity of continuously raising private money (again emancipating them from possible leverage by their donors). That is how groups like the Brookings Institution and the Russell Sage Foundation came about. They operated according to a model of a \"university without students,\" attracting scholars from across the political spectrum, sharing the ideal (if not necessarily the practice) that reason reaches across ideologies. The results of these efforts were significant in shaping American society during most of the 20th Century, for example, producing a national budget system as well as studies on the causes of warfare. The second phase of think tank history began after World War II, when the government realized the importance of supporting scientific research because of its obvious relevance to all things military. The National Science Foundation (not a think tank) was established then, and so were think tanks like the RAND (Research and Analysis) Corporation. This is the first worrisome development in the evolution of think-tankery, since it obviously created a direct link between the funding source (in this case the government) and the recipient of research outcomes and policy advice (also the government), thus violating the intentions of the people who established the first think tanks earlier in the century. Be that as it may, a few decades later we witness another change in concept, with the appearance in the 1970s and 1980s of what Abelson calls \"advocacy think tanks.\" These are groups like the progressive Institute for Policy Studies and the Center for American Progress, the libertarian Cato Institute, and the conservative Heritage Foundation. These think tanks tend to be significantly smaller than their predecessors, are dependent on continuous support by a large number of relatively small donors, and, more importantly, they often (though not always) blatantly blur the lines between research and advocacy. It is hard to read a \"report\" from some of these outlets and not think that their \"conclusions\" were actually the premises from which the whole exercise started, a definite departure from the model of a university\u2014with or without students. This is apparently an open secret, as the director of a major policy institute told Abelson: \"[Think tanks] are tax-exempt cowboys defying the sheriff with their political manipulations. They don't want to stimulate public dialogue, they're out to impose their own monologue.\" [14](#note14) Or as Leila Hudson put it: \"These institutions have substituted strategy for discipline, ideological litmus tests for peer review, tactics and technology for cultures and history, policy for research and pedagogy, and hypotheticals for empiricals.\" [15](#note15) Another problem intrinsic to the modus operandi of think tanks was best summarized by an anonymous official quoted in an article entitled \"On Mediators: Intellectuals and the Ideas Trade in the Knowledge Society,\" by Thomas Osborne: \"One of the dilemmas of think tankery is that you can either say something sensible, practical and useful and have six civil servants and their dog read it, or you can say something spectacularly silly and have the media cover it.\" [16](#note16) None of these quotes sounds exactly like ringing endorsements of the idea of think tanks. The last development in think tank evolution is what Abelson calls \"vanity think tanks.\" These are even smaller and more ephemeral operations, often set up by individuals in pursuit of short-term political goals, like Ross Perot's United We Stand or Newt Gingrich's Progress and Freedom Foundation. I will not examine these any further because they are only marginally relevant to science, if at all, although they have demonstrated their ability to affect the outcome of elections, and therefore\u2014 indirectly\u2014to influence science funding and education. What has this to do with science? It is think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute that have the gall to bribe scientists so that they speak critically of reports about global warming, and it is the anti-evolution Discovery Institute, a think tank out of Seattle, that is guided by a mandate founded on \"a belief in God-given reason and the permanency of human nature,\" rather than on the serious examination of scientific theories such as evolution. Alina Gildiner goes into some detail about how think-tankery concerning science dovetails into spindoctoring rather than rigorous analysis of the problem at hand. [17](#note17) Gildiner quotes Laura Jones, whose edited book on risk management has been published by a think tank, the Fraser Institute, as stating\u2014without any data to back the claim up\u2014 that \"zealous anti-risk activists have heightened our intolerance for small risks,\" such as the number of deaths resulting from wheels detaching from transport trucks that were poorly maintained (in Canada, government regulation lowered that number from 215 in 1997 to 86 in 2000, and of course the statistics do not include people who got injured, sometimes seriously, from collisions with the errant wheels). Another \"exaggerated risk\" discussed by Jones's authors is the connection between secondhand smoking and cancer. Indeed, the spindoctoring goes so far as taking a judge's decision to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency's rule that acknowledged secondhand smoke as a carcinogen\u2014 a legalistic decision based on procedural matters\u2014 as \"evidence\" that the claim is scientifically unfounded. While commenting on another book, written by authors Robert Lichter (president of the think tank Center for Media and Public Affairs and a paid consultant for Fox News) and Stanley Rothman (director of yet another think tank, the Center for the Study of Social and Political Change), Gildiner comments that one would look in vain for nuanced discussions about what should influence public policy. Rather, \"what is to be found is a rhetorical, agenda-narrowing usage of scientific language and methods.\" [18](#note18) For example, Lichter and Rothman comment with an authoritative tone on the link between cancer and air and water pollutants, despite the fact that neither one is a scientist and that their sources were almost 20 years out of date. Science progresses; ideologies tend to linger unchanged (and often unquestioned). One doesn't really need to read technical articles about think tanks to get a good idea of what many (again, not all) of them are about. Take a look at the Web site of, for example, the Cato Institute (cato.org) and examine their timeline of actions and publications; it speaks for itself. In 1992 they published [Sound and Fury: The Science and Politics of Global Warming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932790909/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0932790909), in which they state that \"there is neither theoretical nor empirical evidence for a catastrophic greenhouse effect and thus no case for what Vice President Al Gore calls a 'wrenching transformation' of the American economy.\" The following year, they produced [Eco-Scam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312109717/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0312109717) and [Apocalypse Not: Science, Economics, and Environmentalism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1882577051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1882577051). Jump to 2000 and you will find [The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1882577922/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1882577922). Is there a common thread here? Or visit the even more obviously slanted site of the [Competitive Enterprise Institute](http://www.cei.org/), which the Wall Street Journal named (without a trace of irony) \"the best environmental think tank in the country.\" One of their \"scholars,\" Robert J. Smith, proudly proposed the rather questionable concept of \"free-market environmentalism,\" and accordingly CEI was among the first organizations to criticize, back in 1990, the Clean Air Act amendments because they would \"impose a new regulatory burden that would lead to higher energy prices\" (perhaps, but would they make our air cleaner and our quality of life better?). There is more: CEI in 1992 \"advised\" the Food and Drug Administration to approve recombinant bovine somatotropin, which is a bioengineered growth hormone. Now surely such a recommendation would be accompanied by the further suggestion of labeling the resulting products so that consumer choice\u2014that ultimate driver of market forces\u2014 could be openly exercised? Think again: the CEI argued that mandatory labeling of dairy products is \"inappropriate\" because it violates the First Amendment (which includes the right to free speech\u2014of the cows?). In 1996 the CEI folks outdid themselves, launching their Communications Project \"with the aim of showing how 'values-based' communications strategies can help claim the moral high-ground for our side, by making the case that capitalism is not only efficient, but also fair and moral.\" [19](#note19) If this isn't a frank admission that the CEI isn't at all in the business of research but squarely in that of advocacy, it's hard to imagine what is. Moreover, in 1999 CEI published a monograph arguing that the dumping (not their term) of trash in low-income rural communities in Virginia is actually good for those communities' economies. One wonders how many fellows of the Competitive Enterprise Institute live in such communities. As recently as 2001 CEI helped persuade the Bush administration (which surely did not need much convincing on this issue) not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, despite the fact that the gas is universally recognized by scientists as the major contributor to the greenhouse effect. In 2002, CEI won a lawsuit against the FDA in federal court, invalidating the 1998 Pediatric Rule requiring drug companies to test some drugs on children, instead of automatically approving them for use on children if they had passed tests on adults only. To CEI's evident chagrin, Congress wrote the Pediatric Rule into law. In this age of global economies, the actions of think tanks of this sort go well beyond national boundaries: in 2003 a CEI fellow sent a letter to the Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, advising her government to \"disregard environmental alarmists and to continue allowing Filipino farmers to grow bioengineered corn.\" Arroyo followed the suggestion, with apparently no input from her electorate and with predictable financial gains by the bioengineering firms that support CEI's operations. Back on national turf, in 2004 CEI exploited the usually high-quality television program Bullshit! with Penn and Teller, normally devoted to debunking the paranormal. The target? Mandatory recycling programs. In the same year, CEI associates argued that living on a McDonald's diet is good for your cholesterol and that there really is no reason to panic if one finds high levels of lead in one's water supply (as recently happened in Washington DC). In 2005 the Competitive Enterprise Institute pushed for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, which could cause a major environmental disaster with likely little impact on the economics of oil supply, a discussion that once again took front stage during the 2008 American presidential elections. In the same year, CEI filed a challenge to the constitutionality of the 1998 multistate tobacco settlement, while the following year they patted the back of the EPA for allowing human volunteers to be used in studies on the effects of pesticides. Finally, again in a spectacular admission that this think tank is simply not interested in serious research and scholarship, the CEI defended the right of op-ed columnists to be paid by interested parties for the spin they give to their pieces: \"An opinion piece\u2014whether an individual op-ed or a column\u2014exists to promote a point of view by argument. It does not seek to establish a fact, but to win people over to a particular viewpoint or opinion.\" Indeed, but the reader usually assumes\u2014wrongly, as it turns out\u2014that it is the author's opinion that one is reading, not that of a government agency or of a private corporation that surreptitiously paid for what superficially looks to the reader like an independent assessment. Caveat emptor! While there is clear and rather disturbing evidence of an increasing shift from research to advocacy in the sociopolitical phenomenon of think-tankery, how much influence do think tanks really have, and how do they exercise it? Abelson and other researchers have repeatedly pointed out that it is difficult to measure such an elusive property as political and social influence. Attempts have been made to compare one think tank to another based on quantifiable parameters such as the number of press releases they put out that are picked up by major news outlets; the number of media appearances, especially on television, of the think tank's fellows; and even the number of cabinet-level positions filled by people associated with a given think tank. Of course this scratches only the surface, because political influence can go undetected when it manifests itself as indirectly shaping the views and policies of representatives and senators at both the state and federal levels. When social commentators such as Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly relate \"facts\" that they gleaned from thinktank press releases, millions of listeners or viewers will not know or remember the source, only the facts, which may or may not be true. How does one measure that type of think-tank influence? Obviously, much more research on and critical evaluation of the entire think-tankery phenomenon is needed; meanwhile, the public needs to be wary of the opinions proffered by allegedly unbiased \"experts\" whose affiliation to think tanks is barely acknowledged by media outlets. We have analyzed jointly the alleged decline of public intellectualism and the rise of think tanks not because the two are necessarily directly related (though to some extent they may be), but because they both affect the teaching and understanding of science in the public arena, and they both are at the very least symptoms of the kind of transformation of modern society that has had commentators from Postman to Chomsky worried for a long time. Scientists and people genuinely interested in science should be worried too. References - In Etzioni A. and A. Bowditch, eds. 2006. Public Intellectuals: an Endangered Species?

For most of history, war, slavery, infanticide, child abuse, assassinations, pogroms, gruesome punishments, deadly quarrels, and genocide were ordinary features of life. But today, Pinker shows all these forms of violence have dwindled and are widely condemned. How has this happened? Find out at the lecture!...

NEW FROM DANIEL LOXTON ON SKEPTICBLOG.ORG [The Making of Ankylosaur Attack!](http://www.skepticblog.org/2011/10/11/making-of-ankylosaur-attack-on-location/) With the release of his new dinosaur storybook, Ankylosaur Attack!, many younger scientists (especially those aged four to eight) are asking Daniel, \"How did you make these pictures look so real?\" He'll discuss that further at the Vancouver International Writers Festival next week, but gives Skepticblog readers a first glimpse behind the scenes. Interview with Jennifer Hancock This week on Skepticality, Derek sits down with Jennifer Hancock to discuss her newest book, [Jen Hancock's Handy Humanism Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463780656/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1463780656). In this work, Jen attempts to give people a quick, easy, book which describes the philosophy of Humanism and how it relates to culture and personal happiness. Did this mysterious artifact actually fall from a UFO as Bob White claimed? In this week's eSkeptic, Skeptic co-founder Pat Linse is contacted by an expert who has the expertise to solve the mystery of Bob White's UFO artifact\u2014an object which has long baffled both the public and the scientists who examined it. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 16, number 3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol16n03.html) (2011). Bob White's Great UFO Artifact Mystery\u2014Solved! (Sometimes All it Takes is Finding the Right Expert.) by Pat Linse, with Ean Harrison Apsychic was taking phone calls on a late night radio show. His next caller was clearly upset\u2014you could hear the fear in his voice. \"I think I might be possessed\" he confessed. \"When I drive at night the street lights often turn off as I approach. I'm afraid it might be a warning that something terrible is about to happen.\" The psychic tried to reassure him, \"You definitely have some kind of extraordinary power, but it's not necessarily negative. The lights that go out could mean that one phase of your life is over and you are about to enter a new one...\" As the psychic droned on about focusing on the positive and seeking out new opportunities, the phone lines lit up at the radio station. Dozens of people were trying to get through to offer an explantation for the ominous behavior of the street lights. They were all from one specific profession, but they were not scientists or psychologists. The psychic's explanation to the frightened man was suddenly cut off and a new voice came on the air. \"We would like to let our listeners know that our phone lines have been jammed by people who have a very straightforward explanation for the caller's problem. They are auto mechanics and they are all suggesting that the caller have his headlights adjusted. If headlights are aimed too high they trigger the daylight sensor on streetlights and turn them off. It's a common problem.\" Luckily for the caller, the right experts were listening to provide a solution. Those familiar with skeptical literature are aware of James Randi's tireless effort to point out that many supposed paranormal mysteries that have stumped scientists can be solved by the expertise of magicians. Now another mystery has been solved with information provided by the right expert. The solution calls to mind Michael Shermer's frequent admonition, \"Before you say something is out of this world, make sure it isn't of this world.\" Bob White's UFO Artifact The late Bob White's mysterious object (see photo above) is touted on the internet as hard evidence for the existence of UFOs: \"This isn't the smoking gun\u2014this is the bullet!!!!\" And it has been included on or near the top of UFO \"best evidence\" lists. [1](#note01), [2](#note02) In 1985, according to White's sworn deposition, he was napping as he and a companion drove west through the desolate country between Grand Junction, CO and the Utah border. After 2 or 3 in the morning White's friend woke him for a second time\u2014the odd light they'd noticed before in the sky seemed to be getting bigger. White recalled: [The light] was about the size of a full harvest moon... As we got closer, it grew larger... When we were a few hundred yards from it, I turned off the ignition and we coasted up close to it... It was huge, the size of a very big barn. I got out of the car...for a better look. For some unknown reason, Jan turned on the headlights, and this light went up in the sky as fast as my eyes could follow it... Then I saw another small light, bright orange with a tinge of yellow, white, and blue falling from it... I climbed the incline and went over to where I thought it might have hit. I found a groove in the ground about 18 inches deep and 9 inches wide. I followed the groove and there it lay... it was still glowing. [3] White stashed the object in his trunk, and fearing that the story would harm his entertainment career, said nothing about it until after he retired. From 1996 to his death in 2009, the now retired Bob White devoted himself to promoting his artifact as a piece of hard evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial engineering. His quest was not without its frustrations\u2014his artifact, if genuine, should have been one of the greatest discoveries of all time\u2014but he did manage to attract some media attention. He gave interviews, spoke at UFO conventions, wrote a book titled [UFO Hard Evidence](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193194220X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=193194220X) (Galde Press 2004), set up a small museum to house his artifact (where he is said to have offered the object for sale for ten million dollars), and was featured on a number of TV shows. Production budgets of shows like the History Channel's [UFO Hunters](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/ufo-hunters-season-1/id272143501?at=10l6ex), [Unsolved Mysteries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DRDWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B0002DRDWI), and Jane Goldman Investigates (a series produced in the UK) allowed him to present the object to scientists for testing, with mixed results. While it was easily established to be made of aluminum, it had no apparent working parts. UFO enthusiasts focused on proving its extraterrestrial origin by suggesting the composition of the metal matched nothing on earth. They compared isotope ratios in the object to those of meteors, tried to establish that it emitted unusual radioactivity, or focused on inclusions and trace elements in the metal. No one seemed to wonder why a supposedly sophisticated piece of alien technology looked like it had been unceremoniously hacked off at one end. Expertise to the Rescue Our expert Ean Harrison is a retired steel foundry quality control supervisor who worked in the Seattle area. Not only can he explain the origin of Bob White's strange object, he once owned several of them and used them as garden ornaments. Harrison writes: The object in question is made of accreted grinding residue. It forms in a manner similar to a common stalagmite when metal castings are \"cleaned\" on large stationary grinders. Rough castings need to have the parting line fins and gates smoothed to facilitate machining and reduce tool breakage. A typical stationary grinder in a foundry cleaning room used to hand clean castings up to 40 pounds may have a composite wheel 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches wide or larger. The casting is placed on a work guard just like the small grinder found in home workshops, and the piece is fed against the surface of the wheel, grinding off parting line fins, weld repairs, and gate bosses. The grinding dust is spewed downward into the wheel guard at a temperature near the melting point of the parent metal. When the metal dust and grinding wheel abrasive hit the bottom of the guard, the melted epoxy wheel binder glues the mixture together. Over time a stalagmite is slowly created from the bottom up, that fuses the parent metals into the characteristic form. Depending on the size of the machine, a stalagmite can easily grow to a length of 2 feet or more. Also, depending on the castings being ground, the composition of the stalagmite could be an exotic mix of stainless steel, manganese, mild steel, aluminum\u2014in other words, a very puzzling metallurgical mix all combined in a seemingly impossible compound. But in reality it is merely a product of the melted grinding wheel binder. eventually the stalagmite grows high enough to block the opening at the base of the grinding guard. The housing must be opened, the stalagmite broken off, thrown away, recycled, used as a yard ornament, or reported as something tossed out of a UFO. It is unfortunate so many people have been deceived into thinking an industrial waste product is concrete evidence for a UFO. But I suppose the possibility remains that an alien sailing along in a UFO was processing castings on a stationary grinder and tossed the stalagmite down at Mr. White\u2014but one would wonder why they are still using such primitive technology.

(iPhone App coming soon) About this week's feature article From the birth of the mass media to today's top news stories, the crime drama has remained popular. As far back as Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, published between 1887 and 1927, the search for physical clues to help solve the crime has been an important component of sleuthing. It has been only recently, however, that the marriage of the most advanced techniques of science with criminal investigation has been offered as drama in the entertainment business's most popular medium: prime-time television. In this week's eSkeptic, sociologist Eric Goode presents a light-hearted skeptical analysis of the C.S.I. (Crime Scene Investigation) television series in which extraordinary claims are made for the power of science to solve crimes. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 10, number 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n04.html) (2004). A Skeptic Meets C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation by Erich Goode The lead investigator began burning some residue from a human corpse \"directly over gunpowder that still covered the body.\" That left Danny Thomas, former member of the Clarke County Fire Department \"staring at his TV screen.\" Exclaimed Thomas, \"No, definitely not. Nobody plays around like that.\" Ngaire Genge, author of [The Forensic Casebook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345452038?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345452038) says that [CSI: Crime Scene Investigation](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/tv-season/csi-crime-scene-investigation/id356079717?at=10l6ex) \"normally takes some pains to get forensic details right,\" but in this case, she admits, the program simply blew it. In [The Demon-Haunted World](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b045PB), Carl Sagan argued that it is the responsibility of scientists to light \"a candle in the dark\" and combat the malefic influence of ignorance, irrationality, and superstition. One of Sagan's favorite targets was the media, which present science in a biased, inaccurate way. Paranormal beliefs and pseudoscience are given credence they do not deserve, while science is portrayed as arbitrary, repressive, or just plain wrong. It is the job of scientists, he argued, to convince media representatives to set the record straight. Sagan is half right. Film and television drama portrays all of real life imperfectly. John Nash's schizophrenia in [A Beautiful Mind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVQLQQ?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FVQLQQ) bears an extremely oblique relationship to any mental disorder known to psychiatrists; [Gladiator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gladiator/id397380075?at=10l6ex) distorted the reality of combat in the Roman Coliseum; and the archaeology depicted in [Raiders of the Lost Ark](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0014Z4OMU) is fanciful nonsense. In fact, it could not be otherwise. Dramatic truth differs from \u2014 indeed, often violently contrasts with \u2014 factual truth. The mission of the dramatist diverges from the mission of the journalist, the historian, and the social scientist. All too often, audiences find the literal facts of the matter tedious and boring. Scholars by the score have tried to correct the impressions left by media distortion, but objections to factual errors in movies and television may be beside the point. Writing about films based on history, Robert Brent Toplin, author of [Reel History: In Defense of Hollywood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700612009?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0700612009), argues that a certain measure of \"manipulation\" is \"inevitable.\" Time is compressed, life is simplified, and villains and heroes are rendered in stark, black-or-white terms. While some films seriously corrupt the reality of their subjects \u2014 Toplin singles out [Amistad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/amistad/id318112914?at=10l6ex), [Mississippi Burning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TFO?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000059TFO), and [The Hurricane](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-hurricane/id293103703?at=10l6ex) \u2014 effectively \"communicate important ideas.\" When does license become distortion? When do scholars make a legitimate point in challenging the factual basis of dramatic representations of their subjects of expertise? From the birth of the mass media to tomorrow's broadcast, the crime drama has remained popular. At least as far back as Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, published between 1887 and 1927, the search for physical clues to help solve the crime has been an important component of sleuthing. It has been only recently, however, that the marriage of the most advanced techniques of science with criminal investigation has been offered as drama in the entertainment business's most popular medium \u2014 prime-time television. [Quincy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JO3P?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005JO3P), a television series that ran between 1976 to 1983, depicted a crusty but kind-hearted medical examiner who solved crimes by using the low-tech forensic tools available at the time. Three current programs portraying today's far more sophisticated science of criminalistics have become enormously popular. During most weeks during 2003, among all television programs, Nielsen rated [C.S.I (Crime Scene Investigation)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/csi-crime-scene-investigation/id363743016?at=10l6ex) in the #1 or #2 spot in audience size, while [Crossing Jordan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013DZNAA?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013DZNAA) and [CSI: Miami](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/csi-miami-season-1/id361959276?at=10l6ex) ranked in the top 20. How well do these programs depict the science of criminal forensics? They don't, according to Tom Mauriello, who for a quarter-century has been teaching criminalistics, the science of using physical evidence to solve crimes, at the University of Maryland. He has also authored a basic textbook, [Criminal Investigation Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006QWEMK?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006QWEMK), updated yearly. A Maryland campus police officer for eight years during the 1970s, Mauriello investigated narcotic, sex, and violent crimes. \"These programs present forensic science in an unrealistic light,\" Mauriello explained. \"The general public watches them, gets a certain idea of how criminalistics works, then they get victimized [by a crime], and they feel they've been cheated. Crime investigation doesn't work the way it appears on television. The same thing with our criminal justice students. This job looks so exciting from beginning to end, and it's not. It gives them false expectations.\" Mauriello levels his most serious charge at the roles portrayed by the TV criminalist. \"The roles aren't even real,\" he argued. \"Three entirely different jobs are conflated into one. First of all, there's the evidence technician, whose job is to collect and process evidence and deliver it to the crime lab. They all used to be cops. Now some are and some aren't. Then there's the lab scientist \u2014 the chemist, the microbiologist, who provides analysis in their specialty. Then there's the field investigator who goes out and tries to solve the crime. These jobs are entirely separate and distinct. No one does all three.\" Mauriello also finds fault with the science on which TV criminal investigations are based. He cites one especially damning case of CSI's use of voice spectrometry. In one broadcast, he explains, the investigators conned a suspect into saying the same words uttered by the perpetrator, captured on tape. When the yellow and blue segments of the suspect's voice spectrum overlapped, they produced green. \"Ah ha!\" the investigators exclaimed, \"We've got our man!\" In truth, Mauriello said, \"there is no graphic representation that provides an exact match. It's not like a fingerprint. It's all fake.\" In real life, the scientists who work with voice spectrometry \"keep looking at their graphic representations of voices, trying to pick out what's unique about each individual voice. They haven't got it yet.\" Dr. William Johnston, a criminalist with the California Department of Justice for 15 years, then a forensic consultant for another 15, is less harsh in his judgment. Commenting specifically on CSI, he said, \"some of it tells it like it is. But in any drama, you have to have excitement, you have to have quick results, and you have to have conclusive results. These [CSI-type] programs don't depict the unsolved cases and the long, tedious hours, days, and weeks working in the lab with no results,\" he asserted. \"Most of what we do is wasted screen time,\" Dr. Johnston told me. Still, he had to admit, the impact of C.S.I. and related programs has been positive. Distortion aside, \"these programs bring attention to our profession. When I tell people I do criminal forensics, they know what I'm talking about.\" Arthur Conan Doyle hit upon the perfect formula when he wrote stories that blended mystery with the brilliant mind of Sherlock Holmes and the deductive power of empirical science. Today's crime scene investigation programs carry on that tradition, but their scientific toys may have become the tail wagging the dog. The informed viewer sometimes feels the program's raison d'\u00eatre is to show off the gizmos. Black lamps that reveal purple or green blobs on the floor, laser beams whose razor-thin shafts of red light criss-cross a darkened room, a machine that spits out reams of paper whose graphs pin-point the presence of drugs in the deceased's body \u2014 these are effective dramatic devices that rivet the audience's attention to the unfolding story. But do the investigative devices serve the story, or the other way around? Three homicides were featured on CSI: Miami's February 17th broadcast: the stabbing of a man through a sheetrock wall, in which the victim was in a booth in a porno parlor, having simulated sex with a prostitute; the forced drowning of a man in a toilet that was located on a houseboat; and the vehicular homicide of a woman by a man driving what was described as a $100,000 Jaguar. In each case, the investigation centered on searching for and evaluating evidence for the murders of victims who were dispatched by extremely exotic methods. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tabulates the known weapons used for all murders that take place each year in the United States. In 2001, a shade over six out of 10 of the victims \u2014 63% \u2014 were dispatched by firearms. The FBI did not indicate how many took place through a sheetrock wall, but an eighth, or 13%, were done away with by means of a knife or other cutting instrument. And a total of only 23 victims were drowned, again, no indication of how many had their heads shoved into a toilet. Vehicular homicide is common, but it is almost never intentional. Vehicular murder is so rare as to make front-page news, as the case of Clara Harris \u2014 the Texas dentist who ran over her unfaithful husband with the family's SUV \u2014 demonstrates. Not only are CSI: Miami's three murders not representative, they are extremely improbable, so rare as to be all but statistically impossible. But their investigation made for strong narrative drama, and perhaps that's the point. Would more realism translate into less popularity? Alex Epstein is the author of [Crafty Screenwriting](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805069925?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805069925), a screenwriter for Galidor, a Saturday and Sunday morning fantasy program on ABC, and co-creator of Sexual Anthropology, a television series that will begin shooting in the fall. \"Where you draw the line\" between drama and literal reality, he explained, \"is really a decision the writers make when they create the show.\" Actually, he told me, CSI \"is intended to be one of the more realistic shows.\" Some other programs, he admitted, \"play much more loose and fast with forensics.\" Increasingly, audiences have gotten \"more and more sophisticated, and they expect more realism. You can't get away with Perry Mason-style courtroom confessions.\" Still, Epstein explained, \"good drama follows the rules of good story telling: condense, condense, condense.\" Most important of the many condensations the screenwriter has to make from the tumult and complexity of real life is with what Epstein calls \"the cast of characters.\" What Mauriello, the forensics specialist, saw as a drawback, Epstein, the screenwriter, sees as a dramatic necessity. \"Real police work would involve a different specialist for every sub-genre of forensics. You'd have your blood spatter specialist and your powder burn specialist.\" The second form of condensation is with time, Epstein explained. In real life, \"you'd have an investigation that takes weeks and pores over minute clues that lead nowhere. Who wants to see that? We're telling stories,\" he emphasized. \"If you were telling the story of an investigation to a friend, you wouldn't mention the clues that led nowhere, unless there's a big red herring. You wouldn't mention the weeks. You'd tell the story in the most dramatic way possible.\" When discussing historical film drama, Robert Brent Toplin distinguishes the \"details\" from \"the big picture.\" Some films \u2014 he cites [Glory](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/glory/id263384016?at=10l6ex) as an example \u2014 are so true to the \"broader truths\" about the Civil War experiences of African Americans that their fudging of a few details is beside the point. In contrast, others so egregiously misrepresent big picture truths that they fail to work even as fiction. Mississippi Burning is a travesty of historical drama because, far from bravely helping civil rights workers in the 1960s, the FBI undermined their efforts and ignored or covered up injustices committed against them. That film pretended to narrate history, Toplin explains; instead, it whitewashed the government's role in it. Criminalists examine physical evidence to solve crimes. Prime-time TV dramas on criminal investigation must boil down the cast of characters, condense the length of time it takes to crack the case, and snare the perpetrator. Effective drama also requires expanding the range of weapons murderers use. If, night after night, week after week, the vast majority of TV murder victims were killed by a bullet to the brain or heart, forensic dramas would lose a major source of mystery. If, on the other hand, all the criminalists who work on case after case were in league with a vast conspiracy to hide the truth from the public \u2014 as was suggested by [JFK](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/jfk/id313300767?at=10l6ex) \u2014 even the barest shred of real-world veracity falls from the bones of the narrative, giving the drama a shrill, tinny, inauthentic sound. In misrepresenting the big picture, such stories so lack verisimilitude that they do not even tell emotional or dramatic truth. \"Our job as screenwriters is to tell the emotional and dramatic truth, not the literal truth,\" Epstein explained. It's possible for fiction to lie, he said, only when it presents characters who do things in real life \"that are not emotionally or dramatically true. But we don't have an obligation to tell the literal truth because that would make it impossible to tell compelling stories.\" \"Anyway,\" he told me, summing up what he sees as a workable philosophy of screenwriting, \"if the audience wants the literal truth, there are plenty of books for them to read.\" About the author Dr. Erich Goode is Professor of Sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and is the author of Collective Behavior (Harcourt Brace, 1992), Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction (Waveland Press, forthcoming), as well as a half-dozen other books on drug use and deviant behavior.

And it doesn't officially exist. Located a mere seventy-five miles outside of Las Vegas, the base has never been acknowledged by the U.S. government. Myths and hypotheses about Area 51 have long abounded, thanks to the intense secrecy enveloping it. Some claim it is home to aliens, underground tunnel systems, and nuclear facilities. Others believe that the lunar landing itself was filmed there. The prevalence of these rumors stems from the fact that no credible insider has ever divulged the truth about his time inside the base. Until now. Los Angeles Times investigative journalist Annie Jacobsen had exclusive access to 19 men who served the base proudly and secretly for decades and are now aged 75-92, and unprecedented access to 55 additional military and intelligence personnel, scientists, pilots, and engineers linked to the secret base.

ISBN 978-0-670-02295-3). This review was originally published in the Autumn issue of The American Scholar as \"Getting Better All the Time.\" About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, Donald R. Prothero reviews James L. Powell's book, [The Inquisition of Climate Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231157185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0231157185), a masterful compilation of nearly all the evidence for the reality of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The book skillfully articulates the consensus of climate scientists around the world and answers, point-by-point, the ridiculous attempts by AGW deniers to cloud and distort the evidence. Denialist Demagogues and the Threat to Science by Donald R. Prothero Shortly after Texas Governor Rick Perry announced his candidacy for President of the United States, he made additional news by not only topping the field of GOP Presidential candidates in denying climate change, but upping the ante by claiming it was all made up by a conspiracy of greedy scientists. The same position has been articulated by all the GOP candidates except Jon Huntsman. That one of these people could very well win the presidency in 2012 should worry us with not only their ignorance of science, but the even more alarming tactic of using ad hominem and \"shoot the messenger\" tactics to try to discredit the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists around the world. That consensus is well represented in James Powell's new book, [The Inquisition of Climate Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231157185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0231157185), a masterful compilation of nearly all the evidence, not only for the reality of anthropogenic global warming, but especially answering point-by-point the ridiculous attempts by climate deniers to cloud and distort the issues by raising one bogus charge after another. As many people have noted, the global warming deniers use many of the same tactics that creationists use to attack evolutionary science. These tactics include quote-mining statements out of context (the entire \"climategate\" email kerfuffle, which Powell shows was nothing more than careless use of language); and cherry-picking data and repeating discredited statements even though they've been debunked (such as the false meme about \"it's been cooling since 1998,\" perpetuated by right-wing media again and again). There are many other similarities between the tactics of evolution-deniers and climate change-deniers, many of which are documented in Powell's book in great detail. As Powell points out, the idea that climate scientists are a global left-wing conspiracy to get rich and enforce a liberal agenda is laughable on the face of it. In my own career, I have come to know hundreds of natural scientists (geologists, biologists, chemists, and physicists in many subspecialties), and if there's one thing they almost all share, it's a lack of interest in politics and economics, let alone a unified socialist-communist agenda. Many got into science specifically because they weren't interested in economics and politics, and had a gift or love for doing science instead. What they are committed to is a sincere love of the truth, and a willingness to make sacrifices of their time, money, and even comfort and personal safety to find out what is really true about nature, no matter whose agenda it might support. Only rarely do most of us think about possible political or economic implications of our research. Typically scientists try to downplay those aspects because they don't want to attract attention or controversy! If you doubt this, just look at all the negative comments that scientists heaped on Carl Sagan or Stephen Jay Gould because they were willing to be public figures and occasionally step into the political spotlight! As Powell argues persuasively, the very idea that a scientific community, which is built upon the foundation of peer review and challenging accepted ideas and always double-checking each other's work (especially if you disagree), would be able to put together a giant conspiracy about the data and cover it up\u2014and that normally conservative organizations, from the insurance companies and big corporations such as General Electric and the U.S. military (all of whom have acknowledged the reality of global warming and are planning their futures around the projections of climate scientists) would all be in on the conspiracy\u2014is ridiculous in the extreme. This shows a complete lack of understanding of science and how the scientific community really works. This is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black, because global warming denialism is entirely a PR campaign and a right-wing/energy company conspiracy, not a legitimate movement that arose from dissenting climate scientists. As Oreskes and Conway documented from memos leaked to the press and published in their book [Merchants of Doubt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608193942/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1608193942), in April 1998 the right-wing Marshall Institute, SEPP (Fred Seitz's lobby that aids tobacco companies and polluters), and ExxonMobil, met in secret at the American Petroleum Institute's headquarters in Washington, D.C. There they planned a $20 million campaign to get \"respected scientists\" to cast doubt on climate change, get major PR effort going, and lobby Congress that global warming wasn't real and was not a threat. Then there was the famously cynical 2002 memo from GOP pollster and spinmeister Frank Luntz to the Bush White House: The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science... Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate, and defer to scientists and other experts in the field. Powell also documents that the climate science community is not \"leftist\" or \"pursuing a socialist agenda.\" In my own career, I have known both conservative and liberal scientists (but no outright communists or socialists), despite the claim that we're all left-wingers. Some of the leading figures in climate research, such as Kerry Emanuel at MIT, are staunch Republicans. Again, global warming cannot be a left-wing ideology if it is accepted and acted upon by such major conservative organizations as insurance companies, major corporations, and the U.S. military. There are scientists who do have strong political opinions, but as scientists we try our best to prevent our political biases from influencing our scientific results. We're human, of course, so occasionally research with a political agenda does get published\u2014but then the rest of the scientific community will jump in and criticize it, so we don't get away with our biases for very long. Finally, the idea that scientists do this to get rich is the most absurd charge of all. Most scientists must endure a grueling 5-7 years in graduate school on miserably small stipends to earn their Ph.D. Then we must live on paltry teachers' salaries or even more tenuous \"soft-money\" grant funds to eke out a living. Most of the scientists in faculty posts don't make six-figure incomes until they are near retirement, if ever. Meanwhile, people who spend much less time in grad school, such as lawyers and MBAs and politicians, make the really big bucks. As Powell puts it (p. 189): Scientists...show no evidence of being more interested in politics or ideology than the average American. Does it make sense to believe that tens of thousands of scientists would be so deeply and secretly committed to bringing down capitalism and the American way of life that they would spend years beyond their undergraduate degrees working to receive master's and PhD degrees, then go to work in a government laboratory or university, plying the deep oceans, forbidding deserts, icy poles, and torrid jungles, all for far less money than they could have made in industry, all the while biding their time like a Russian sleeper agent in an old spy novel? Scientists tend to be independent and resist authority. That is why you are apt to find them in the laboratory or in the field, as far as possible from the prying eyes of a supervisor. Anyone who believes he could organize thousands of scientists into a conspiracy has never attended a single faculty meeting. Powell's main point is that the current right-wing attack on climate science is very similar to how the Inquisition threatened Galileo because he spoke truth to power. Ironically, Rick Perry even managed to further emphasize his ignorance of science when in a recent debate that he said [1](#note01) he admired Galileo and how he \"was outvoted for a while.\" Bad analogy, Rick! If Perry actually knew any science, he would realize that Galileo was championing an unpopular scientific idea (heliocentric solar system) that was \"outvoted\" by the conservative power of that time, the Catholic Church and the Inquisition. Eventually, scientific truth won out, not the political delusions of the conservatives. As Powell documents, the right-wing fringe has gone to extreme lengths in their hostile attitude toward legitimate science. The FBI has reported [2](#note02) a sharp increase in death threats and hate mail and intimidation against prominent climate scientists such as Michael Mann, James Hansen, and others. Australian climate scientists have also received death threats. [3](#note03) The transition from conservative climate denialist to a dangerous anti-Semitic hate group is not difficult. One white supremacist website posted Michael Mann's picture and those of other climate scientists and labeled it \"Jew\". (In fact, most climate scientists are not Jewish, but the facts don't matter to racists and anti-Semites). Another climate scientist told ABC News that he found a dead animal placed on his doorstep, and now he must travel with a bodyguard. [4](#note04) As Mann said, \"Human-caused climate change is a reality. There are clearly some who find that message inconvenient, and unfortunately they appear willing to turn to just about any tactics to try to suppress that message.\" Human-caused climate change is a reality. There are clearly some who find that message inconvenient, and unfortunately they appear willing to turn to just about any tactics to try to suppress that message. Even more frightening are the right-wing politicians and pundits who actually target prominent scientists for intimidation. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma is one of the most brazen. He listed the name of 17 prominent climate scientists [5](#note05) and claimed that they engaged in \"potentially criminal behavior\" for violating the Federal False Statements Act. This is the classic tactic of McCarthy-style witch hunting, or analogous to how conservative authorities (such as the Inquisition) threatened Galileo with torture when he dared speak scientific truth to power. It has a tremendously chilling effect on science, not to mention what it does to the personal lives of hardworking scientists and their families. Of course, it is an entirely baseless charge, since the truth lies with the scientists, and it is Inhofe who is distorting reality. Nevertheless, an anti-scientific troglodyte like Inhofe is capable of wasting a lot of scientists' time and money fighting and defending charges in court or in Congress, not to mention the fact that all these scientists could now be targets of gun-toting crazy right-wingers. Scariest of all is Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. As Powell explains in detail, even before his election in 2008, he was known to be an extreme right-winger, and now he is abusing the powers of his office to push his agenda. He is suing [6](#note06) to release all the raw data and emails collected by Michael Mann when he worked at the University of Virginia. (Mann is now at Penn State, so Cuccinelli cannot touch him there). Cuccinelli hopes to find some sort of \"smoking gun\" of conspiracy along the lines of the East Anglia \"Climategate\" scandal. This is despite the fact (as six independent commissions showed), there was nothing amiss in the emails, and no conspiracy was discovered, just careless and colloquial language quoted out of context. Given the right wing's scientific incompetence and misinterpretation of the East Anglia data, there's no reason to think that they will have any better ability to interpret Mann's data, should they release it. Instead, we can expect that they will find things that fit their preconceptions without any scientific expertise to judge the data in the first place. Cuccinelli is trying to claim that Mann committed fraud and should return all the research money he received, along with legal fees and triple damages. Cuccinelli's actions are part of a right-wing witch-hunt by an extremist politician who is using his relatively obscure position as state attorney general to further his political career. It is consistent with all the other ways he is using his office for political gain and street cred in the right-wing fringe. His crusades have ranged from the silly (trying to cover the naked breast of the crude sketch of the goddess on the Virginia state seal) to the serious. The latter include directing public universities to remove sexual orientation from their anti-discrimination policies, attacking the Environmental Protection Agency, filing a lawsuit challenging federal health care reform, and trying to reverse George Mason University's policy about concealed weapons on campus. Polls [7](#note07) show that the voters of Virginia are tired of his antics and want him to work on the job that most state attorney generals are paid to do: prosecuting criminals and corporations on the behalf of the state and enforcing state laws, not tilting at right-wing windmills. One of the more measured and non-partisan analyses came from Nobel Prize-wining economist Paul Krugman: [8](#note08) Jon Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor and ambassador to China, isn't a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination. And that's too bad, because Mr. Hunstman has been willing to say the unsayable about the G.O.P.\u2014namely, that it is becoming the \"anti-science party.\" This is an enormously important development. And it should terrify us. I could point out that Mr. Perry is buying into a truly crazy conspiracy theory, which asserts that thousands of scientists all around the world are on the take, with not one willing to break the code of silence. I could also point out that multiple investigations into charges of intellectual malpractice on the part of climate scientists have ended up exonerating the accused researchers of all accusations. But never mind: Mr. Perry and those who think like him know what they want to believe, and their response to anyone who contradicts them is to start a witch hunt. So how has Mr. Romney, the other leading contender for the G.O.P. nomination, responded to Mr. Perry's challenge? In trademark fashion: By running away. In the past, Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, has strongly endorsed the notion that man-made climate change is a real concern. But, last week, he softened that to a statement that he thinks the world is getting hotter, but \"I don't know that\" and \"I don't know if it's mostly caused by humans.\" Moral courage! Of course, we know what's motivating Mr. Romney's sudden lack of conviction. According to Public Policy Polling, only 21 percent of Republican voters in Iowa believe in global warming (and only 35 percent believe in evolution). Within the G.O.P., willful ignorance has become a litmus test for candidates, one that Mr. Romney is determined to pass at all costs. So it's now highly likely that the presidential candidate of one of our two major political parties will either be a man who believes what he wants to believe, even in the teeth of scientific evidence, or a man who pretends to believe whatever he thinks the party's base wants him to believe. And the deepening anti-intellectualism of the political right, both within and beyond the G.O.P., extends far beyond the issue of climate change. Now, we don't know who will win next year's presidential election. But the odds are that one of these years the world's greatest nation will find itself ruled by a party that is aggressively anti-science, indeed anti-knowledge. And, in a time of severe challenges \u2014 environmental, economic, and more \u2014 that's a terrifying prospect. As a counter to the GOP's inquisition of climate scientists, let us remember that in the last year or so, UC Berkeley physicist Richard Muller re-examined all the temperature data from the NOAA, East Anglia Hadley Climate Research Unit, and the Goddard Institute of Space Science sources. Even though Muller started out as a skeptic of the temperature data, and he was funded by the Koch brothers and other oil company sources, he carefully checked and re-checked the research himself. When the GOP leaders called him to testify before the House Science and Technology Committee last spring, they were expecting him to discredit the temperature data showed real change. Instead, Muller shocked his GOP sponsors by demonstrating his scientific integrity and telling truth to power: the temperature increase was real, and the scientists who had demonstrated climate was changing were right. [9](#note09) This is the essence of the scientific method at its best. There may be biases in our perceptions, and we may want to find data that fits our preconceptions about the world, but if science is done properly, we get a real answer, often one we did not expect. That's the true test of when science is giving us a reality check: when it tells us something we do not want to hear, but is inescapable if one follows the scientific method and analyzes the data honestly. Thomas Henry Huxley said it best over 150 years ago: \"Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.\" About the Author DR.

Loxton explains the media frenzy about the book being \"too hot for U.S. publishers.\" The Big Bad Wolf Chances are if you listen to MonsterTalk you probably like nature documentaries. No doubt you've seen stories about wolves and heard words to the effect that wolves are often maligned and that wolves have an undeserved reputation for being killers. Yet how does one reconcile the idea that dangerous wolves are a myth with the many myths and fairy tales which feature wolves as the villain? In this episode of MonsterTalk we take on the legend of the big, bad wolf and what we find may surprise you. This episode features an interview with author Jay M. Smith, about his book [Monsters of the G\u00e9vaudan: The Making of a Beast](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674047168/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0674047168). About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, comedian Mike Moran reviews Richard Horne's tongue-in-cheek book, [A is for Armageddon: A catalogue of disasters that may culminate in the end of the world as we know it](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062005936/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0062005936) (New York: HarperCollins, 2010). Mike Moran is a Baltimore, Maryland based comedian, writer, and musician. He performs standup comedy, improvisational acting (with the Baltimore Improv Group), writes a humor column for AOL's Patch North Baltimore, and plays bass guitar in several bands. The End is Not Nigh Enough by Mike Moran \"Our end is definitely nigh,\" so facetiously asserts writer and illustrator Richard Horne in the introduction to his visually impressive but intellectually dull doomsday index, [A is for Armageddon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062005936/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0062005936). Of course skeptics realize that Horne is poking fun at the endless stampede of \"end-times\" predictions with which the public is bombarded by the media, religious spokespersons, and drunken friends. With A is for Armageddon, I was hoping for a light-hearted, mischievous dose of cynical enjoyment. Unfortunately, this colorful coffee-table book fails to live up to its potential as a refreshing alternative to the often sterile and serious body of skeptical literature\u2014a field where, all too often, the only humor to be found is mean-spirited and condescending. Before I analyze Horne's writing, I should first note that his illustration and design skills are nearly worth the price of admission. In fact, this may be the most visually impressive coffee table book I've yet to encounter. Horne's beautifully colored pop-art combines delightful cartoon fun with the grittiness of modern street art. He seamlessly blends images that range from the adorable (like the child-faced globe mascot found throughout), to the downright horrifying (check out the sinister four horsemen on page 31\u2014why is this guy not designing heavy metal album covers?). Unfortunately the marvelous graphic design is not matched by the snarky satisfaction that I hoped the written portion of the book would provide. The biggest problem is that, as far as skepticism goes, this book has only one thing going for it: sarcasm. Horne writes from the perspective of a gullible citizen who falls for every doomsday scare he is presented with (think Stephen Colbert). Though I admire Horne's tenacity for authoring an entire \"non-fiction\" book in character, this \"wink-wink\" approach is incapable of leaving readers feeling that they have learned anything new (or even old). My distaste for this style is really saying something, coming from an armchair skeptic like myself who tends to enjoy [Junior Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/) more than the rest of the magazine. Who would have thought I would be missing cold hard facts and figures so much? Most adults who read A is for Armageddon will understand that the end of the world is pretty unlikely to come anytime soon, but will have to decide (or research) for themselves why each of Horne's tongue-in-cheek claims are absurd, and to what extent. Though I admire Horne's tenacity for authoring an entire \"non-fiction\" book in character, this \"wink-wink\" approach is incapable of leaving readers feeling that they have learned anything new (or even old). Horne's sarcastic approach to doomsday mongering is not only unenlightening, it is also often offensive, though perhaps unintentionally so. This is due to the author causally jumping between laughably implausible forecasts such as \"biblical apocalypse,\" and \"robot attack,\" and real life disasters that cause serious human suffering. Sure, we can scoff at the idea of food shortages and earthquakes deleting humanity from existence, but let's not forget that real life human populations, on a regional scale, are frequently devastated by just such events. It's a little difficult to laugh at real life tragedies. Speaking of laughter, A is for Armageddon could be forgiven for its intellectual failings if only it delivered in the bookstore section in which it would most likely be found: humor. After all, this isn't [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451529065/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0451529065), or even [Why People Believe Weird Things](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b062PB)\u2014it's a fun coffee table book (at least in theory). Sadly, Horne's comedic abilities are on par with his skeptical skills. Lame attempts at humor, such as \"(genetic) switches are the reason you don't have eyes in the back of your head, though your mother will lead you to believe she does,\" and \"if glaciers melt, then Whiteland will have to be renamed Greenland,\" fall as flat as the Earth is not. It seems we will have to continue to wait for a skeptical humorist who is both entertaining and informative. Like a film that is well produced but poorly scripted, A is for Armageddon is all style and no substance. All I wanted from it was a fun, easy read that would perhaps arm me with a few more rounds of skeptical ammo for the next time I'm trapped in a debate about why there is no reason to worry about the future of Social Security, since we won't be around anyway. Instead I got visual enjoyment, and not a whole lot else. Richard Horne is very talented, but we can't all be renaissance men. Stick to illustrating, Richard, and I predict your career will not be nigh anytime soon.

About this week's feature article For nearly 50 years, the [SETI](http://www.seti.org/) (Search for Alien Intelligence) project has searched for evidence of alien civilizations and has occasionally sent messages into space with the intention of communicating with intelligent sentient extraterrestrial beings. How likely are we to come into contact with an extraterrestrial civilization? If they do exist, their aspirations could differ markedly from our own. Could visitors from extraterrestrial civilizations pose a threat to Earth? What would motivate aliens to visit the Earth? In this week's eSkeptic, George Michael discusses these fascinating questions. Extraterrestrial Aliens: Friends, Foes, or Just Curious? by George Michael In April 2010, the esteemed British astrophysicist, Stephen Hawking, warned that searching for and attempting to communicate with intelligent, sentient extraterrestrial beings could be potentially dangerous. He based his conclusion on historical analogies on Earth, such as the conflict between Native Americans and European settlers, and reasoned that when a more technologically advanced civilization encountered a less advanced one, the results have often been catastrophic for the weaker party. Although this argument has intuitive appeal, upon closer examination, it appears misguided. Even for technologically advanced civilizations, interstellar voyages would probably be justified only for major purposes and plundering the Earth for its resources would be neither practical nor desirable. Alone in a Crowded Universe Popular culture continues to reflect our fascination with extraterrestrial aliens. For instance, in March 2011, a new film\u2014 [Battle: Los Angeles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/battle-los-angeles/id433762511?at=10l6ex)\u2014was released which depicts yet another hostile alien invasion of Earth. The purpose of the offensive is to eradicate the human population so that the aliens can harvest our planet's resources. Just a few months before in the film [Skyline](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/skyline-2010/id425299436?at=10l6ex), aliens use massive force fields to vacuum humans into their craft whereupon the space invaders' remove their victims' brains. Adding a sense of verisimilitude to the film's trailer was a clip of a television news program featuring Dan Rather who reported on a recent warning by the eminent British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking that communicating with extraterrestrial civilization could be potentially dangerous. In April 2010, the Discovery Channel broadcasted a documentary in which Hawking speculated on the existence of extraterrestrial life. In his mind, the multitude of billions of stars and galaxies suggests that life in other solar systems is almost a certainty. Hawking pondered an important question: Could visitors from extraterrestrial civilizations pose a threat to Earth? In the documentary, an armada of massive space ships roams the galaxy as interstellar nomads, who having exhausted all the resources on their home planet, search for other planets to conquer and colonize. He concluded that making contact with aliens is \"a little too risky.\" Moreover, drawing upon the experience on Earth, he mused that \"if aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.\" [1](#note01) Hawking is not the first scientist to warn of the potential hazards of alien contact. In his book, [The Third Chimpanzee](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060845503/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0060845503), the noted geographer and evolutionary theorist Jared Diamond offered an essay on the perils of attempting to contact alien civilizations, observing that whenever a more advanced civilization encountered a less advanced one, or species that have evolved from different ecosystems, came into contact with each other, the results have often been catastrophic for the weaker party, including slavery, colonialism or extinction. [2](#note02) He once described the 1974 Arecibo message, which was aimed at the globular star cluster M13 some 25,000 light years away, as suicidal folly, comparing it to the Incan emperor describing the wealth of his kingdom to the gold-crazed Spaniards. Sending out radio signals, he concluded, was \"na\u00efve, even dangerous.\" [3](#note03) Even the late cosmologist, Carl Sagan, who was generally sanguine about the prospects of interstellar comity, once counseled that a relatively young civilization such as Earth's should listen quietly, \"before shouting into an unknown jungle that we don't understand.\" [4](#note04) While this argument seems reasonable at first blush, upon further reflection I believe such fears are greatly overstated for a straightforward reason related to the physics of interstellar travel. The Methods and Feasibility of Interstellar Space Travel When considering interstellar travel, two important factors to keep in mind are the vast distances between solar systems and the enormous energy requirements that would be necessary to fuel space vessels that could traverse such distances. The closest solar system, Proxima Centauri, is about 4.2 light years away from Earth. To put that in perspective, if a vessel from Earth could somehow travel the speed of light, it would take over four years to reach that solar system. According to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, interstellar travel is seemingly impossible because no vessel could travel faster than the speed of light, thus it would take centuries or millennia to travel the distances between solar systems. For example, at the speed of the Voyager spacecraft, it would take over 70,000 years to get to Proxima Centauri. However, Einstein's General Theory of Relativity indicates that faster than speed of light travel is theoretically possible by using large amounts of energy to continuously stretch space and time. Theoretically, empty space could warp space faster than light. Inasmuch as only empty space is contracting or expanding, one could exceed the speed of light by this fashion; however, this approach would require enormous amounts of energy and would be feasible only for a very advanced civilization. [5](#note05) Carl Sagan, who was generally sanguine about the prospects of interstellar comity, once counseled that a relatively young civilization such as Earth's should listen quietly, \"before shouting into an unknown jungle that we don't understand.\" Another way to avoid the speed of light limit is through the use of a wormhole through which an extraterrestrial civilization could create a shortcut across space and time. A functioning wormhole could serve as a bridge between two different regions of the universe. One could enter the wormhole one end and emerge out of it moments later in a place thousands of light years from the starting point. [6](#note06) Carl Sagan depicted this device as a means of interstellar travel in his novel [Contact](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/contact/id279598767?at=10l6ex). [7](#note07) The Russian physicist, Sergei Krasnikov, once demonstrated that a certain class of wormholes could be created using positive mass-energy matter. [8](#note08) The energy requirements for such a system, though, would be, in a word, massive, and well beyond the scope of our capabilities. Assumedly, practical interstellar space travel could only be viable for very advanced civilizations that have learned how to harness enormous amounts of energy. Kardashev's Civilization Scale In 1964, the Russian astrophysicist and director of the Russian Space Research Institute, Nikolai Kardashev, first proposed a classification of alien civilization based on their methods of energy extraction. His scale has three categories: - A Type I civilization can harness all available energy sources on its planet. - A Type II civilization utilizes all the energy from its star. - A Type III civilization is able to harness the power not of only its own star, but other stars in its galaxy. [9](#note09)Such a civilization, as the futurist and string theorist Michio Kaku once mused, would be immortal. According to Kardashev, energy consumption is determinative of civilizational progress and could one day enable interstellar travel. He estimated that it was quite possible that there were civilizations with ages of technological development six to eight billion years longer than that of the Earth. [10](#note10) As Michio Kaku explained, Kardashev's system of classification is reasonable because it relies upon available supplies of energy. \"Any advanced civilization in space will eventually find three sources of energy at their disposal: their planet, their star, and their galaxy. There is no other choice.\" [11](#note11) How would a civilization advance on this scale? A civilization might advance to Type I status by applying fusion power or by producing antimatter to be used as an energy source. Alternatively, one might be able to harness zero-point energy. [12](#note12) To advance beyond Type I status, Freeman Dyson theorized that a hypothetical megastructure could be employed to encompass a star as a system of orbiting solar power satellites to capture most of a star's energy output. [13](#note13) Constructing such a device\u2014a Dyson sphere\u2014would be a gargantuan engineering undertaking, but theoretically possible. Dyson conjectured that an alien civilization could tear apart planets and asteroids to use as the material to build the necessary structures. [14](#note14) A Type III civilization might also be able to harness energy by building a device around a spinning black hole, which would release far more energy than a star can through nuclear fusion. By exploiting the law of conservation of angular momentum, the prodigious power of its rotation could be used to extract energy. [15](#note15) Furthermore, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization might be able to tap into the energy released from massive black holes that reside at the center of some galaxies. Dyson observed that human civilizations have a tendency to constantly increase their energy consumption. Based on this reasoning, eventually civilizations would be compelled to search for more ways to harness energy. [16](#note16) Currently, our civilization occupies a position that has not quite attained Type 1 status. In 1973, Carl Sagan computed it as 0.7 on the Kardashev scale. [17](#note17) In order for an extraterrestrial civilization to conduct interstellar travel, most probably it would have to obtain at least a Type II status. Alien Motivations Why would aliens visit the Earth? As Hawking mused, alien civilization might exhaust their home planet and search for other planets from which to extract resources. Would an alien civilization make the long trip to Earth to plunder our resources? Conceivably, one could envisage a resource war in the sense of trying to grab up all the planets in a galaxy, a recurrent theme in science fiction (the blockbuster 1996 film, [Independence Day](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/independence-day/id272967721?at=10l6ex), for example). Upon closer examination, though, this scenario seems unlikely. It stretches the bounds of credulity to believe that an advanced alien civilization would come all the way to Earth for energy products. It's a safe bet that any civilization capable of traveling such long distances either by way of spacecraft and/or wormholes would not be using oil and other pre-Type I civilization energy sources. What is more, the transportation costs to bring the energy products back to the mother planet would not be economical. Possibly, fusion reactors, or even anti-matter reactors, could be used to fuel such space vessels, in which case hydrogen, or some isotope thereof, would be required. [18](#note18) However, hydrogen is one of the most abundant chemical elements in the universe and would thus not require interstellar travel to obtain. Possibly, an alien civilization might want to extract minerals from other planets. Yet, it would not be practical to come all the way to Earth for minerals. After all, they could more than likely be found on planets in much greater quantities in their own solar system or in nearby solar systems. And it would be far more practical to conduct strip mining on planets on which they would not have to deal with restive denizens, such as earthlings. In short, the rarity of advanced life and the tremendous distances between civilizations suggest that there would be plenty of planets and stars for all those that were capable of exploiting such methods of resource extraction. Still, others point out that the way in which humans treat other animals is not reassuring. Higher-level mammals, such as dolphins and even chimpanzees, are often mistreated for commercial or experimental reasons. [19](#note19) Moreover, evolutionary biologists point out that altruism occurs with decreasing intensity as individuals grow more distantly related. [20](#note20) Perhaps, aliens would crave us as food. There is a good possibility that alien visitors would be descended from carnivores. [21](#note21) Thus some observers, such as the biologist Michael Archer, fear that aliens would more likely be predatory than benevolent. [22](#note22) The food scenario has some intuitive appeal. After all, many humans consume animal flesh. In a classic episode of the science fiction program The Twilight Zone\u2014\" [To Serve Man](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/to-serve-man/id451494573?i=452553557&ign-mpt=uo%3D4?at=10l6ex)\"\u2014seemingly magnanimous aliens called the Kanamits come to Earth and share their advanced technology, which solves the planet's greatest woes, including eradicating hunger, disease, and the need for warfare. Humans are encouraged to take trips to the Kanamits' home planet, which is supposedly a paradise. However, a female code breaker eventually deciphers that a Kanamit book ironically titled To Serve Man is actually a cookbook on how to serve humans as meals. When examined more closely, however, this scenario lacks credibility as well. Presumably a Type II or Type III civilization capable of interstellar travel would also have mastered agricultural engineering and would thus have solved problems in farming and livestock a long time ago. Even on Earth, which has not yet attained Type I civilizational status, there have been marked improvements in nutrition on a global scale. A portion of the human population still suffers from hunger, but there has been a steady reduction in that segment over the years. In fact, more people are obese today than undernourished. [23](#note23) Although it is certainly reasonable to assume that aliens would consume animal flesh, creating a wormhole just to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken seems rather far-fetched. Might aliens use humans to help biologically propagate their species? Some scientists, including the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA Francis Crick, have speculated that aliens may have actually \"seeded\" planets in the universe by sending microbe-laden probes out into space in a process called \"directed panspermia\" as a way in which to spread the building blocks of life. [24](#note24) (Interestingly, in late 2010, scientists discovered amino acids\u2014the building blocks of life\u2014in a meteorite that had landed in northern Sudan.) [25](#note25) In the film [Mars Needs Women](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/mars-needs-women/id261717868?at=10l6ex), Martians suffer a genetic deficiency that produces only male offspring. However, a civilization that could travel great distances would almost certainly have mastered bioengineering as well and could ameliorate such a deficiency. Moreover, inasmuch as alien life-forms would probably be based on entirely different DNA and protein molecules, they would probably have no interest in either eating or mating with us. [26](#note26) This scenario is humorous, but aliens would probably not be so desperate to travel light years to meet species of the opposite sex. That's an awful long way to travel to get a date. Perhaps an advanced martial extraterrestrial civilization might use Earth as a type of training ground for their warriors. This was the plot of the [Predator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/predator/id363331575?at=10l6ex) film series in which alien creatures visit various hot spots and war zones on Earth to hone their martial skills. This could be exciting for members of some alien civilizations. After all, at one time, big game hunting was the province of distinguished gentlemen in the West. The scenario has some plausibility until one considers the frivolousness of such a trip. Would aliens be willing to spend a thousand years in suspended animation for such an excursion? Would aliens create a wormhole just to go big game hunting? More seriously, territorial motives could inform interstellar colonization. Based on assumptions of terrestrial life, we would assume that life has a natural tendency to expand. Should extraterrestrial life be any different? [27](#note27) In H.G. Wells' classic novel, [The War of the Worlds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936594056/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1936594056), Martians invade Earth to take over the planet. The novel was written at the height of the British Empire when power was often measured in land. [28](#note28) Eventually, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would be forced to embark on interstellar travel if it wanted to survive insofar as its sun would have a limited life. [29](#note29) In such a scenario, an extraterrestrial civilization might want to colonize so-called Goldilocks planets, that is, those that fall within a star's habitable zone and would be roughly the size of the planet Earth so that it could have an atmosphere. Such a planet would avoid overly hot or cold temperatures so that it could retain liquid water on its surface, assumedly, a sine qua non for the emergence of life. The so-called \"Rare Earth hypothesis\" posits that the existence of such planets is extremely uncommon insofar as a number of unlikely events and conditions would be necessary in order to give rise to such planets. Thus such prime real estate, so the argument goes, would be highly coveted by aliens, not unlike the American continents were for European settlers centuries ago. The Columbus analogy, though, would probably be inapplicable for alien encounters. Judged by contemporary standards, the Spanish conquistadors were not much more technologically superior to their Native American hosts. The Spaniards coveted the gold of the latter and eventually their territory, both of which were limited commodities that could only be obtained on Earth for both cultures. Moreover, it was foreign diseases for which Native Americans had no immunity, which decimated that population rather than a systematic plan of conquest and genocide. Rather than travel to Earth and subdue humans, it would probably be more feasible for a Type III civilization to artificially create the conditions supportable of life on a much closer planet. This was the scenario of the 1990 film [Total Recall](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/total-recall/id217880942?at=10l6ex), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which an alien artifact\u2014a terra-forming machine\u2014has the ability to create an oxygen-bearing atmosphere on Mars. Conceivably, a Type III civilization might even be able to reconfigure a planetary system so that more planets orbit inside the Goldilocks zone. [30](#note30) Perhaps out of a sense of magnanimity, an alien civilization would leave our sun and solar system alone and choose to colonize other solar systems. In that sense, settling other planets would not really be imperialism in the classic sense of the term because, as Frank Tipler and John Barrow opined, the planets would just be \"dead rocks and gas.\" [31](#note31) A technologically sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization may also be accompanied with an advanced ethical development that values other life forms and decide to leave them unmolested. [32](#note32) Finally, if a Type III civilization sought more stars from which to extract energy, it could find a great abundance of more desirable and larger stars instead of our sun, which is relatively small in stature. [33](#note33) Some have argued that superior civilizations would seek out and destroy less-advanced civilizations for their own self-defense. The analogy of the Cold War is instructive, as neither superpower was principally concerned about territory, but rather feared the prospect of a preemptive nuclear strike. Preemptive galactic warfare, the cosmologist Edward Harrison argued, would be prudent insofar as a species that has overcome its own self-destructive qualities may view other species bent on galactic expansion as a sort of virus. [34](#note34) Ironically, the 1959 science fiction film [Plan 9 from Outer Space](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/plan-9-from-outer-space/id279374128?at=10l6ex)\u2014often cited as the worst movie ever made\u2014contained such a plot that logically explained hostile alien intentions. In the film, extraterrestrial beings seek to stop humans from developing a doomsday weapon that could destroy the universe. One is reminded of the first test of the atomic bomb at the Trinity site at Los Alamos in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. The Manhattan Project physicist Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers on the probability that the test would destroy either the entire state of New Mexico or wipe out all life on Earth. [35](#note35) More recently, some observers of projects such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island feared that experiments to create a miniature black hole could devour our planet. [36](#note36) Conceivably, an alien civilization might seek to cripple another civilization before it developed the capability to retaliate or wreak galactic havoc. The Manhattan Project scientist John von Neumann and the electrical engineer Ronald Bracewell conjectured that extraterrestrial civilizations might send self-replicating robotic probes to explore other solar systems. Some scientists feared that such artificially-intelligent automatons might be programmed to destroy other civilizations. [37](#note37) However, as Gerald O'Neil pointed out, the fact that Earth has yet to be attacked suggests that nobody out there is hostile to us. [38](#note38) Furthermore, optimists contend that the vast distances between solar systems insulate our planet. Historical analogies, Carl Sagan once argued, were probably inapplicable to alien and human contact as he found it unlikely that we would face \"colonial barbarity\" from a technologically more advanced alien civilization. Quarrelsome extraterrestrials, he reasoned, would probably not last long in interstellar space because they would be eliminated by a more powerful species. According to this line of reasoning, those civilizations that lived long enough to perform significant colonization of the Galaxy would be those least likely to engage in aggressive galactic imperialism. [39](#note39) Moreover, extraterrestrials visiting Earth would assuredly be far more technologically advanced than we, so that the former would have nothing to fear from us. And Earth would not likely have anything that they would need. [40](#note40) At our current technological development, we would not be a threat to a Type II or Type III civilization. Moreover, even a military invasion could be problematical for an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. If interstellar travel is exceedingly difficult, then interstellar invasion would even be more challenging. [41](#note41) Keep in mind that Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion at Normandy in World War II\u2014a mere 100 miles across the English Channel\u2014required considerable planning and was not launched until the Allies had already attained near complete superiority in the air and in the sea. Fermi's Paradox: Where Are They? In 1950, while having lunch with his colleagues at Los Alamos, New Mexico, after a brief discussion about the prospects of extraterrestrial life, Enrico Fermi blurted out, \"Where is everybody?\" As he reasoned, if technologically advanced civilizations were common in the universe, and assuming many of them had preceded Earth by many tens of thousands of years, then it follows that we should have been visited by now. [42](#note42) This is called the Fermi Paradox, for which there are at least 50 different answers. [43](#note43) Theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku points out that the transition from a Type 0 to Type I civilization carries a strong risk of self-destruction. Such civilizations may face a Malthusian catastrophe that precludes transition to a higher type. Thus, a short-lived civilization would be unlikely to establish contact. Yet, despite the eons necessary for a civilization to attain Type III status, when measured by the estimated life of the galaxy, the time necessary for colonization would be relatively short. [44](#note44) According to some estimates, it would take anywhere from 5 million to 60 million years for an advanced extraterrestrial civilization to colonize a galaxy. [45](#note45) Alas, so far, the SETI project has not yielded any tangible evidence of alien civilizations. [46](#note46) SETI uses scientific methods to scan the galaxy for electromagnetic transmissions from civilizations on other planets. Supposedly, a Type II or Type III civilization would leave a detectable footprint in the galaxy, such as radio transmissions or infrared emissions. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, an advanced civilization would generate large quantities of waste heat could be detected by our instruments. [47](#note47) Almost certainly a device such as a Dyson sphere would dramatically alter the light spectrum of the enclosed star, and in doing so create a noticeable infrared glow that could be identified by peering astronomers, even on the far side of the galaxy. [48](#note48) Nevertheless, no telltale signs have yet to be detected. Kardashev countered that alien civilizations have not been found because they have not been properly searched for. [49](#note49) Although we have not detected aliens, they may have detected us. Why then don't they make an effort to communicate? Perhaps they are not interested in us. Michio Kaku uses the analogy of human contact with ants. When we come upon an anthill, he explains, we do not request to see their leader or bring trinkets to them and offer unparalleled prosperity through the fruits of our technology. [50](#note50) Because of astronomical time scales, a civilization capable of visiting Earth could be many millions of years ahead of us and thus might find us uninteresting. Moreover, it would be unlikely that any such advanced civilization would find any resources on Earth that could not be found in numerous other star systems closer to their civilization. As Kaku points out, the main danger ants would face is not that humans want to invade them or eradicate them. Rather, we might simply \"pave them over because they are in the way.\" [51](#note51) In this scenario, the danger would be if Earth got in the way of the aliens' highway. Others, however, are more sanguine. An advanced civilization would probably be interested in encountering another civilization. Kardashev speculated that alien civilizations might find it advantageous to unite with others in order to reduce the time delay for communications and other types of activities. [52](#note52) The SETI astronomer Jill Tarter speculated that \"rather than exploiting us, they might value and support the natural biodiversity of the galaxy.\" [53](#note53) A Type III civilization might also be able to harness energy by building a device around a spinning black hole, which would release far more energy than a star can through nuclear fusion. By exploiting the law of conservation of angular momentum, the prodigious power of its rotation could be used to extract energy. Why would aliens visit us? In a word, curiosity. As Frank Drake opined, \"Many human societies developed science independently through a combination of curiosity and trying to create a better life, and I think those same motivations would exist in other [alien] creatures.\" [54](#note54) Presumably, members of an extraterrestrial civilization capable of reaching Earth would be highly curious\u2014a quality that would be necessary to practice the science that led to their advanced technological development. [55](#note55) After all, curiosity is a sine qua non of science. On Earth, human scientists are intensely interested in lower life forms, such as insects; it would logically seem to follow that aliens would be interested in other life forms as well. [56](#note56) Certainly, an alien civilization traveling to Earth would have knowledge of physics that far exceeded our own. Therefore, the aliens might be more interested in areas such as ethics, religion, and art. [57](#note57) One reason they might visit Earth is to practice cosmological anthropology. [58](#note58) If extraterrestrial civilizations do exist, their aspirations could differ markedly from our own. Nevertheless, as Robert Forward pointed out, even for technologically advanced civilizations, interstellar voyages would probably be justified only for major purposes. [59](#note592) From the perspective of representatives of alien civilization, plundering the Earth for its resources would be neither practical nor desirable. To prepare for the eventuality of alien contact, we must consider alien motives. To that end, the former chairman of the Transmissions from Earth Working Group, Michael Michaud, recommended that the Committee on SETI be broadened beyond astronomers to include philosophers, historians, theologians, etc. [60](#note60) New hopes of life in the cosmos emerged last October, when astronomers discovered an exoplanet in the star system Gliese 581, a mere 20 light years away that is believed to be of similar size to Earth and that may reside in a habitable zone in its solar system. [61](#note61) Contact with intelligent sentient beings would be of monumental significance and could have numerous scientific, political, and theological implications. [62](#note62) Understandably, based on certain episodes of human history, some people view this proposition with trepidation. Despite the potential dangers, however, more than likely we need not worry. About the Author George Michael received his Ph.D. from George Mason University's School of Public Policy.

This Sunday marks the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center Buildings. 9/11 conspiracists such as Richard Gage (a member of the American Institute of Architects and founder of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth) [continue to assert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZEvA8BCoBw) that WTC7 was brought down by controlled demolition. In this week's eSkeptic, we present Chris Mohr's thorough analysis of the controlled demolition theory, based on his debate with Richard Gage earlier this year. 9/11 and the Science of Controlled Demolitions by Chris Mohr With the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks upon us, a group of 9/11 conspiracists are working hard to publicize their claims of scientific validity to the conjecture that the World Trade Center buildings were destroyed through controlled demolition. The architect Richard Gage is the founder of the nonprofit organization Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, which focuses on the controlled demolition theory. So outraged was I by the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq based on faulty WMD intelligence information that I initially thought that Gage might be on to something, until I examined his science carefully and engaged him in [a spirited debate](http://ae911truth.org/en/news-section/41-articles/471-face-off.html) on March 6, 2011 in front of 250 people in Boulder, Colorado. ( [Listen to the debate audio](http://noliesradio.org/archives/GageVMohrDebate2011-0306_web.mp3).) The video of that debate is not being released (his own website admitted that twice as many people changed their minds in my direction as his during the debate), so I created 20 short videos on YouTube that present detailed rebuttals of each of Gage's claims. 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDD5BD81A636031A5&feature=viewall): Building 7 (duration 1:35:48) What follows is a brief summary of Gage's points and my rebuttals to them. 1 EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE CAREFULLY AND SECRETLY PLANTED IN THE WTC BUILDINGS. You cannot secretly prepare a controlled demolition of the two World Trade Center buildings containing 50,000 workers, plus extensive security systems and guards, working round the clock, without anyone noticing anything unusual. Instead, we should accept at face value what we all witnessed: two massive jets that slammed into the buildings, damaging the structures and setting off raging fires and igniting more than 40,000 square feet of office space per floor in a matter of seconds, igniting furniture, carpeting, desks, paper, etc. You cannot control the area around such a raging fire to start a demolition. [1](#note01) 2 NO TALL STEEL FRAME BUILDING EVER COLLAPSED BEFORE 9/11 DUE TO FIRE. Though it is true that no tall steel frame buildings ever collapsed due to fire alone prior to 9/11, since then, other tall steel framed buildings have. On May 13, 2008, a large part of the tall concrete-reinforced steel architecture tower at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands caught fire and thereafter had a very fast, nearly straight-down collapse mostly into its own footprint. Gravity increases the force of a falling object by a factor of 30 for a single collapsing floor, and collapsing buildings have nowhere to go but straight down. Other types of steel frame structures have collapsed due to fire. [2](#note02) 3 WHAT ABOUT THE ALMOST FREE-FALL COLLAPSE OF THE TWIN TOWERS? The key is the \"almost\" modifier. If I told you I was making almost $100,000 and you found out I was making only $67,000, you'd say I was exaggerating. So stop exaggerating the collapse speed of the WTC Towers! The 80,000 tons of structural steel slowed down the collapses of the Twin Towers to about (two-thirds) of free-fall. [3](#note03) And the core collapsed at about 40% of free-fall speed, coming down last. [4](#note04) According to Richard Gage: \"To bring a building symmetrically down, what we have to do is remove the core columns.\" But on 9/11 the stronger core columns came down last, which violates this supposed most fundamental rule of controlled demolition. 4 WHAT ABOUT THOSE EXPLOSIVE SQUIBS TWENTY STORIES BELOW THE COLLAPSE POINT, AND THOSE HEAVY METAL OBJECTS FLYING HUNDREDS OF FEET THROUGH THE AIR? During the collapse, one half million cubic feet of air per floor was pushed outwards at the rate of twelve floors per second, creating a \"hurricane wind\" in the building as reported by survivors, and blowing out windows, and with them the smoke from the fires and other objects. [5](#note05) 5 WHAT ABOUT THOSE BILLIONS OF IRON MICROSPHERES THAT R.J. LEE FOUND IN A DUST ANALYSIS THAT PROVES THE THEORY THAT THE IRON IN THE BUILDINGS WAS MELTED BY THERMITE? Thermite would leave tons of formerly melted iron blobs, not just microspheres. But in the 1970s, while workers welded thousands of steel beams together, hot microspheres were splattered everywhere. Concrete has fly ash in it, and I have a photo of iron-rich spheres in Tolk fly ash in my YouTube video response. Even if the microspheres were created in the fires on 9/11, the R.J. Lee dust study said, \"Considering the high temperatures reached during the destruction of the WTC ... Iron-rich spheres ... would be expected to be present in the Dust.\" [6](#note06) 6 WHAT ABOUT THE SULFIDIZED STEEL THAT MELTED AND THAT FEMA FOUND BUT WHICH NIST IGNORED IN THEIR REPORT? NIST didn't ignore it. Jonathan Barnett at FEMA [studied two pieces of sulfidized steel](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf), which is not enough to explain the collapse. NIST determined that neither piece came from a supporting column in the collapse zone so it couldn't have contributed to the collapse. [7](#note07) Sulfidized steel melts at temperatures 1000\u00b0 lower than regular steel so it could have \"melted\" in a regular office fire. And the \"intergranular melting\" FEMA discovered is not like melting as we know it anyway; it's more like corrosion on an almost microscopic scale occurring along the boundaries between the crystals or grains of a metal. The technical description for what happened is \"intergranular melting, high temperature corrosion via sulphidation, oxidation, and decarburisation leading to a liquid Iron Oxide Suflur mix from grain boundary melting.\" And while Jonathan Barnett would like to see more research on this, he does not support the controlled demolition theory. 7 WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE UNIGNITED NANOTHERMITES THEY FOUND IN THE DUST SAMPLES IN THAT EXPERIMENT? Niels Harritt, Steven Jones and other 9/11 controlled demolition theorists claim to have found nanothermite particles in dust samples from the World Trade Center. They made sure the dust samples were untainted, and used advanced instruments to measure what happened when these tiny red-grey chips were heated up. Thermites reach temperatures of around 4500\u00b0 and have their own oxygen supply when they burn, so they can burn underwater. Harritt, Jones, et. al. therefore should have heated up the chips in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere to eliminate the possibility that regular hydrocarbons were burning. They also failed to take the carbon-based products out of the mix, so what we may well be seeing is some kind of carbon-based product burning in oxygen. They compared the sudden energy spike of their burning chips with the spikes of known nanothermites, and found that their chips ignited at around 150\u00b0 C. lower than the known nanothermites, and the energy release was off between their chips and the nanothermites by a factor of at least two. Yet they called this a match for nanothermite! Attempts to independently replicate this experiment have been dismal. Mark Basile, who appeared in the acknowledgments of the original study, burned the chips in air, replicating the error of the original experiment and not even measuring the energy released. A chemist named Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henry-Couannier got another dust sample from the original experimenters and wrote, \"Eventually the presence of nanothermite could not be confirmed.\" The R.J. Lee Company did [a 2003 study on the dust](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/53110995/Damage-Assessment-130-Liberty-Street-Property) and didn't find thermitic material. 8 WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BIG FIRES IN TALL BUILDINGS THAT DON'T CAUSE COLLAPSE, AND THE LITTLE FIRES IN BUILDING 7? Richard Gage and other 9/11 controlled demolition conspiracists like to show an NYPD photograph of small fires on the north face of Building 7. That's not the side where tons of flaming debris from the towers smashed into the south face, creating huge gashes and fires on multiple floors. In our debate Gage claimed that the videos I played showed smoke but no fire. When the fires first started on the southwest corner of Building 7, the dust was blocking the view. NIST reported that many fires burned themselves out in 20-40 minutes and then moved on. The fires left behind not only burned out areas, but structurally weakened areas as the beams and columns expanded, sagged, and contracted again. Then the fires started moving to the interior of the building. Is he suggesting that all that smoke wasn't evidence of fire, or that burned out areas went back to full structural strength? 9 WHAT ABOUT JANE STANDLEY, THAT BBC REPORTER WHO ANNOUNCED THAT BUILDING 7 HAD ALREADY FALLEN WHEN IT WAS STILL STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER? This one is irritating to a guy like me who's been in radio for over 30 years. Reporters make mistakes! What possible value could there be in letting the BBC in on the \"conspiracy\"? Here's what probably happened: Deputy Chief Peter Hayden of the New York Fire Department recalled: \"We had our special operations people set up surveying instruments to monitor, and see if there was any movement of [WTC 7]. We were concerned of the possibility of collapse of the building... One particular engineer there, we asked him, if we allowed it to burn could we anticipate a collapse, and if so, how soon?... And it turned out that he was pretty much right on the money, that he said, 'In its current state, you have about five hours.'\" Other errors in reporting show the chaos of the day, not a well-oiled conspiratorial machine at work. To wit: CNN Reported at 11:07 am that Building 7 had collapsed at 10:45, or 15 minutes after the second tower collapse at around 10:30. CNN got their misinformation from the respected news agency Reuters, which picked up an incorrect report. They have issued this statement: \"On 11 September 2001 Reuters incorrectly reported that one of the buildings at the New York World Trade Center, 7WTC, had collapsed before it actually did. The report was picked up from a local news story and was withdrawn as soon as it emerged that the building had not fallen.\" On 9/11, reporters also said that Camp David had been hit by a plane. Forbes magazine reported that \"A car bomb exploded outside the State Department, according to State Department sources.\" CBS News reported that as many as eight planes have been hijacked and only four have been accounted for. It is not hard to imagine how such mistakes could be made, especially when there is no time to sift through and analyze fast-moving information. As NIST reported, \"The large dust clouds generated by the collapse of WTC 1 hid the lower portions of WTC 7 from view for over 20 min following the collapse.\" So firefighters on the ground saw only dust where Building 7 was until around 10:50 am and may have thought it had come down. 10 WHAT CAUSED BUILDING 7 TO COLLAPSE? Many firefighters reported seeing structural deformations of Building 7 hours before its collapse, including the top FDNY fire [Chief Daniel Nigro, who stated](https://sites.google.com/site/911guide/danielnigro), \"I feared a collapse of Building 7 (as did many on my staff). The collapse of WTC 1 damaged portions of the lower floors of 7. Building 7 was built on a small number of large columns providing an open Atrium on the lower levels. Fires on many floors of WTC 7 burned without sufficient water supply to attack them. For these reasons I made the decision (without consulting the owner, the mayor or anyone else\u2014as ranking fire officer, that decision was my responsibility) to clear a collapse zone surrounding the building and to stop all activity within that zone. Approximately three hours after ... WTC 7 collapsed. Conspiracy theories abound and I believe firmly that all of them are without merit.\" In a [World Trade Centre Task Force Interview](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110462.PDF), FDNY Lieutenant Rudolph Weindler said: \"So we left 7 World Trade Center... and Captain Varriale told Chief Coloe and myself that 7 World Trade Center was badly damaged on the south side and definitely in danger of collapse. Chief Coloe said we were going to evacuate the collapse zone around 7 World Trade Center, which we did.\" And [Deputy Chief Peter Hayden said](http://www.911oz.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2015): \"We saw a bulge in the southwest corner between floors 10 and 13, and we had put a transit on that, and we were pretty sure she was going to collapse.\" Another Building 7 eyewitness was Michael Hess, Mayor Giuliani's chief lawyer. He and fellow city worker Barry Jennings got caught in Building 7 and barely escaped with their lives. Michael Hess said that he heard and felt the building shake like an earthquake for 5-10 seconds prior to the collapse of either tower. But in 2007, he too changed his story, claiming [in a BBC interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/10/caught_up_in_a_conspiracy_theo.html) that he got his timing wrong and that the 10-second-long earthquake sound was most likely caused by tower debris hitting the building later in the morning. \"There were no explosions. That was caused by the north half of #1 falling onto the southern half of our building.\" He compared what he heard to a loud rumbling earthquake, not the staccato blasts of explosions. 11 WHAT ABOUT THOSE ACCOUNTS OF EXPLOSIONS IN THE TWIN TOWERS? I read 50 randomly selected accounts out of some [118 or so accounts from firefighters](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/met_WTC_histories_full_01.html) of explosions from the New York Times. None were of explosions before the actual collapse. Those accounts Gage found concentrated around the core and the basement where explosions from the jet fuel traveling down the elevator shafts caused several explosions and fireballs. Out of 5000 former and current FDNY 9/11 employees, only ten have come out and said they believe bombs were placed in these buildings. Further, firefighters have personally told me that explosions in office fires are not uncommon. Here is a list of a few things that explode in an office fire: - HVAC equipment including condensers and compressors - Cleaning supplies - CRT type TV's and computer monitors. - Large motors that have an oil reservoir for lube. (Elevator lift motors) - Hydraulic pistons found in office chairs. - Tires in vehicles - Steam explosions when water hits a hot fire or molten aluminum - Propane tanks If bombs were going off to create a precise controlled demolition, then there would be a pattern. Eyewitness accounts of explosions were random: fireballs, mere flashes of light, ground shaking with no other apparent effect. This is consistent with the kinds of random effects of fires spreading through buildings and down the elevator shaft. Eyewitness Philip Morell talked of explosive sounds like bombs in a 9/11 Mysteries video clip, but I went back to the complete original interview. The director cut out the part where he then explained that he ran over to the noise and discovered that the explosive sounds were actually from a crashing freight elevator, which did indeed create a tremendous crashing thud felt throughout the basement. 12 WHAT ABOUT THE FREE-FALL COLLAPSE OF BUILDING 7? That is the silver bullet that proves controlled demolition! NIST studied the collapse of one face of the 47-story Building 7 and found that indeed, on that one face, it collapsed \"at gravitational acceleration\" for eight stories over 2.25 seconds. The rest of that collapse was at considerably less than free-fall. After the internal supports collapsed, the perimeter walls were pulled inward. Every time a column snapped like a stick, it shifted its load at the speed of sound to other columns, and the collapse \"gradually\" accelerated over about two seconds. In phase two, the building was indeed collapsing at free-fall acceleration. Free-fall collapse speed does not mean no resistance, it means no net resistance. Those collapsing beams still clinging to the walls functioned as levers. So there were three forces at work on Building 7 during its collapse, and the sum of these three forces varied with time: the constant downward force of gravity, the variable upward force of residual structural resistance, and variable leveraged downward forces due to connections to other parts of the building. The leveraging forces may have briefly accelerated parts of Building 7 at greater than 1G, and in fact the NIST Report shows very slightly faster than free-fall for a second or so, though that could just be the margin of error. \"What about\" vs. \"If... then\" The 9/11 controlled demolition theorists seem to like the \"what about...\" challenge. They know that even the most intelligent layperson can't answer all their questions, and even if you can answer five \"what about\" questions in a row, then they'll give you a real zinger, like this one from Richard Gage: \"What about the EPA's Erik Swartz who said they found 1,3-diphenylpropane at levels 'that dwarfed all others. We've never observed it in any sampling we've ever done.\" Unless you've checked, you won't know that Gage edited out the next sentence of the Times Union article where that first appeared, which continues, \"He also said it was most likely produced by the plastic of tens of thousands of burning computers.\" Gage thinks 1,3-diphenylpropane was used for the sol-gel solution for safe storage of nanothermites. [The patent](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2011/0136888.html) lists pharmacological uses such as treating complications associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemias, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypertension, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative pathologies, Alzheimers, or cancers but never mentions thermites or even plastic computer parts. Instead of the \"What about\" game these conspiracy theorists play, I prefer the \"if ... then\" approach: - If 4500 degree nanothermites were used to pulverize almost every inch of every concrete floor, then how could there have been millions of sheets of paper with an ignition temperature of only 451\u00b0 raining down on the sidewalks? - If 4500 degree nanothermites were used extensively even at the top to cause a supposed upward explosion, then why were first responders able to walk over the wreckage less than an hour after the Tower collapses? - If there were 2800 degree rivers of molten steel in the debris, then why do NASA thermal images show maximum temperatures in the rubble of only 1400\u00b0? - If the debris pile had 2800 degree temperatures, then why were firefighters able to pour millions of gallons of water all over it and not trigger the deadly thermal explosions that are caused when water comes in contact with molten steel or iron? - If nanothermites pulverized everything, then why did the debris pile include a 13-story high facade? - If classic controlled demolitions create minimal damage to adjacent structures, then why did the Verizon Building suffer $1.4 billion in damages? - If the lateral ejection of beams were caused by explosive nanothermites, then there would have been deafening 140 db sounds that can't be muffled by more than a few db or you lose the explosive force of the shock wave itself. - If the South Tower tilted 22\u00b0 at first, then controlled demolition experts could not have righted it mid-collapse. - If nanothermites were used, then they would have spontaneously detonated at well under 1000\u00b0 F. and would not have been controllable; no signal receiving device could have survived the fires and continued to receive the destruct command. - If there had been large explosions prior to the collapse, then they would have been a part of the seismic record, and they were not. You get the idea. My YouTube videos offer [235 reasons for natural collapse](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDD5BD81A636031A5&feature=viewall) just like these, along with abundant videos and photos. Investigate a little deeper and you'll find that the science just doesn't support the views of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth. The truth is out there and we know what it is.

I want to add them to my own [course syllabus on Skepticism 101](https://www.skeptic.com/downloads/Skepticism101-How-to-Think-Like-a-Scientist.pdf), and create an online Skeptical Studies Program at Skeptic.com for teachers and professors everywhere to go to in a creative commons/open source system so that we can build a new academic field going forward with skepticism into academia. I know that such courses are being taught around the world because for the past two decades of publishing Skeptic magazine and writing skeptical books, I receive a lot of mail from teachers and professors seeking permission to use our materials. What I would like to do is to create academic departments of Skeptical Studies, as the next step in the skeptical movement. (See, for example, Phil Zuckerman's program of [Secular Studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/us/08secular.html?_r=3&ref=todayspaper) he is implementing this year at Pitzer College in Claremont, where I teach a graduate course in the spring. We have magazines and journals, trade books and conferences. The next step is a more organized penetration into academia via courses, textbooks, departments, and the like. I want to create a clearing house, an open-source site for people to access materials that will be made available to create your own course in Skeptical Studies, such as Skepticism 101: syllabuses, books, articles, assignments, videos, demonstrations, experiments, research projects, and the like. I am envisioning something along the lines of how psychology became an academic field a century ago. To start the process off I share with you [my own course syllabus for Skepticism 101](https://www.skeptic.com/downloads/Skepticism101-How-to-Think-Like-a-Scientist.pdf), which I am teaching this semester starting this week at Chapman University on Tuesdays from 4-7pm with 36 freshman, the future of the skeptical movement!

About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, we present a transcript of a classic lecture on skepticism delivered by James Randi at the inaugural session of the [Skeptics Society's Distinguished Lecture Series at Caltech](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/about/) on March 22, 1992. With wit and wonderfully illustrative examples, Randi teaches us several lessons on the scientific investigation of unusual claims. (This transcript appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 1, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/1.1/), Spring 1992) Read the lecture transcript, listen to audio recording, or watch the video below: A Report from the Paranormal Trenches by James \"The Amazing\" Randi I am in a very peculiar business. I appear on stages around the world as a conjurer. Now the American term for it is magician. It's not a good expression because if you look in the dictionary the strict definition of a magician is one who uses magic. And magic, at least by the definition I prefer from a leading dictionary, is the attempt to control nature by means of spells and incantations. Now, ladies and gentlemen, in my time, as you might have guessed, I have tried spells and incantations. No good. You can spell and incant all you want; the lady will still be on the couch, waiting patiently to float into the air or will be imprisoned in the box with the saw blade descending upon her unprotected midriff, and in some danger of being severely scratched, if not worse! Spells and incantations don't work. You have to use skulduggery. And let me make it very clear what the magical trade\u2014the conjuring trade\u2014is with a precise definition: it is the approximation of the effect of a true magician using means of subterfuge and trickery. The magician, in the American usage, is an actor playing the part of a wizard. We are entertainers. I don't think that there are many folks\u2014but there are some out there by David Copperfield's own admission to me\u2014who still believe that they really can do the things they purport to do. After a magical performance we've all undergone the same experience, all of us in the trade; you get people coming to you afterwards and saying: \"I really enjoyed what you did; thank you so much for coming.\" And you say, \"Well, it's great to be here. I'm happy that you were pleased with it.\" Then they say, \"You know, the business with the bottles that multiplied. Obviously, that's a trick. And the one where you did the thing with the rings and the ropes. That's a trick too. But the one where you told the lady what word she'd chosen out of the newspaper\u2014that, of course, can't be a trick.\" I'd say, \"Yes, that's a trick, too, but it's disguised as a miracle of a semi-religious nature.\" And they wink at you and they say, \"Sure.\" Then they walk away and tell their friends afterwards, \"Well, he won't admit it, but we all know.\" There is a hunger, a very strong hunger, within us all to believe there is something more than what the laws of nature permit. I'm not just saying audiences that watch the magician. I mean within us all. We'd like to have a certain amount of fantasy in our lives, but it's a very dangerous sort of temptation to immediately assume that it must be supernatural or occult or paranormal if we don't have an explanation for it. I can tell you that in my life I've spent a great deal of time investigating and observing and carefully noting and making use of psychology. I am not a psychologist; I have no academic credentials whatsoever, so I come to you today absolutely unencumbered by any responsibilities of that nature. There is no dean who will call me on the carpet tomorrow morning and say, \"You shouldn't have said that.\" You see, I'm in the business of giving opinions from an uninformed point of view, except from the point of view of a skeptical person who knows how people's minds work and often don't work. It was mentioned in the introduction to this talk that at the current rate of scientific growth, in a certain number of years scientists will consist of every human being on earth, as well as all the animals\u2014the donkeys, the burros, the whole thing. Well, my friend David Alexander remarked to me, in a cruel aside, that even today certain parts of certain horses have become scientists. And that is quite true; I have met many of them and though they have Ph.D.s, you'd hardly know it. I've just come back from a project that's ongoing at the moment and I've seen that principle at work. I must share with you another thing in passing. I have a theory; this is only a theory, and it is at present unproven. But observations so far tend to support its possible validity, with my advance apologies to Ph.D.s in the room. I have a theory about Ph.D.s and the granting of the degree itself. I am outside the field, not an academic, so as a curious observer I have many times seen films of, and in a couple of cases actually attended ceremonies where Ph.D.s are created. They are created, you know. The Ph.D. itself is earned, of course, but then the person who has passed all the tests and done all the right things in the right way and has been approved doesn't become a Ph.D. until one significant moment where a roll of paper, usually with a red or a blue ribbon around it, is pressed into his or her hand. At that moment that person becomes a very special class of being known as Ph.D. There is a hunger, a very strong hunger, within us all to believe there is something more than what the laws of nature permit. I'm not just saying audiences that watch the magician. I mean within us all. Now, I have noted at those ceremonies, and perhaps you have observed it as well that the man who gives out those rolls of paper wears gloves. Why? Why would he want to wear gloves? Is the paper dirty? I don't think so. Is there something about that roll of paper, or perhaps the ribbon, that he doesn't want to contaminate him, and he doesn't want to touch his skin? I'm going to postulate\u2014just an idea\u2014that perhaps there is a secret chemical that has been genetically engineered which is on the surface of that paper so that when the Ph.D. candidate receives that roll of paper this chemical is absorbed by the skin, goes into the bloodstream and is conducted directly to the brain. This is a very carefully engineered chemical which goes directly\u2014please don't laugh; this is science\u2014goes directly to the speech center of the brain and paralyzes the brain in such a way that two sentences from then on, in any given language, are no longer possible to be pronounced by that person. Those two sentences are, \"I don't know\" and \"I was wrong\". I honestly don't know about that; however, my observations of the situation are that I have never heard any Ph.D. utter either one of those sentences. I have never heard them say, \"I'd like to marry a lobster\" either, but that doesn't mean they can't say it. But those two sentences never seem to pass their lips. I am being exceedingly facetious, of course. I have every respect not only for science, but for those who pursue the various disciplines of science. It takes a great deal of courage, application, study, sacrifice (and in many cases, some outrageous attacks on your integrity and your ability) in order to maintain a point of view in science which may or may not be popular. I have been with many prominent scientists who have, from time to time, had to stick their professional necks out, and sometimes their necks get pretty badly beaten up in the process. It's not an easy thing to speak against what is generally accepted. What then is generally accepted? I'm afraid, due to the media impact on our civilization, that a great number of things are easily swallowed because they are repeated so often. They are endlessly presented to the public, and eventually make their way to the academic community as well. Any number of times I have spoken to scientists who, when I ask them a critical question about some belief in some sort of parapsychological, supernatural or occult claim, has said, \"You know, I hear a good deal about it and Professor so-and-so did make a statement about it. Perhaps, Professor so-and-so, based upon the small amount of data which he has presently gathered, compared to what should be gathered, in order to establish a satisfactory statistical picture, an amount of data on which conclusions could be drawn by one of the various statistical pictures available to him, has come upon conclusions which are prematurely expressed. Therefore, furthermore, and moreover, on further examination....\" That's the academic's reply. When they ask me, I simply say, \"In my layman's non-academic opinion, I think that Professor so-and-so is not rowing with both oars in the water.\" It's simple, direct, and an honest expression of my opinion. I am presently faced with a situation, again unnamed, where I am going to have to show a number of dedicated, honest, hard-working people that they have made a colossal error of judgment. I have to do this in a resounding manner, simply because to not do so could result in a great deal of personal damage, grief, and considerable heartbreak and discomfort to a great number of people who are already laboring under certain disadvantages and burdens that they did not bring upon themselves. I hate to be so mysterious about it, but it is an ongoing work of investigation. I am not often involved in that serious a situation. Usually my circumstances are more open\u2014I am looking into an astrologer's claims or into some sort of pseudoscientific thing. But I always have to remember an experience that occurred to me. It is easy, when faced with an apparently supernatural phenomena, to say \"I guess it's a ghost\" or \"It must be paranormal,\" or \"It could be poltergeists,\" and we walk away from it because we can't or won't, look a little further into it. Some years ago, when I lived in New Jersey my house was a sort of a wayside stop for itinerant magicians, conjurers, mountebanks\u2014various characters of ill repute who would come by to visit for awhile. One time I came home after a couple of days away, very tired, and came in on my foster son, Alexis, who was in the kitchen helping a couple of magicians drink up the beer. I walked in and said, \"Guys, I'm very, very tired; I'm going to bed. I'll see you in the morning.\" I guess they carried on until late that night. I fell asleep, woke up the next morning, came staggering into the kitchen in time to see them eating up more of my groceries in the form of breakfast at this time. I sat down, got a half cup of coffee into me and straightened up the table. Alexis looked at me and said, \"What's with you?\" I said, \"I think last night I might have actually had a classic example of the O.B.E.\" That's the out-of-body experience. It means that somehow you find yourself out of your body and looking down on it or from a distance. Alexis looked at me and said, \"Sure. You?\" I said, \"Yes, I have to be honest. It appears to me as if I did undergo such an experience.\" \"OK, give us a description,\" they replied. The two magicians at the table leaned closer over their bacon and eggs and wanted to hear what I had to say. \"Well, I remember waking up in the middle of the night\u2014I couldn't get to sleep at first because I was so tired, so I turned on the television. The program went on and on and I eventually fell asleep. I remember waking up in the middle of the night, and I felt that I was spread-eagled against the ceiling of my bedroom, looking down at the bed. Alice, my black cat, was curled up in a ball in the exact center of the bed so that I had to be way over to one side. And I was, of course, trying not to disturb the cat! As I was up against the ceiling I noticed that the room was lit in sort of a grayish light. I looked down toward the television set and saw nothing but static on the screen and heard nothing but white noise. What I saw was startling. I saw myself, in bed, scrunched over to one side, a chartreuse bedspread on it, with Alice the cat in the middle. I noted that as she opened her eyes they were green. It almost looked like two holes punched through her head. She looked at me and went, 'hmmph' and went right back to sleep.\" Now that was a very strong experience for me. I really believed, from the evidence presented to me, that I had an out-of-body experience that matches the description that we've all heard about so many times. But, fortunately for me, I'm not really dead-set against having my belief structure disturbed or having new facts come in that would disturb my previous convictions. And, fortunately, I am able to tell you what actually happened. Alexis looked at me and said, \"I've got two things to show you.\" He went to the foot of the stairs and came up with a big, transparent laundry bag. He had taken it half way down to the laundry room. He brought it all the way up the stairs, and inside noted sheets, pillowcases, and the chartreuse bedspread. He said, \"That's been there since yesterday.\" The bedspread hadn't been on the bed last night! I dashed to the bedroom door, looked in, and the spread I used when the other one was in the laundry lay on the bed. They looked nothing alike. Alexis then called my attention to the patio, noting that he had put Alice outside yesterday afternoon because one of the magician guests was highly allergic to cats. She had remained outside, very unhappily, through the night and into this morning. She could not have been curled up in the middle of the bed last night. It was a dream\u2014a hallucination, if you will. I had two very good pieces of evidence that it could not have happened. That's important in that if I did not have one or both of those pieces of evidence, I would now have to say to you that, to the best of my knowledge, I had an out-of-body experience. But, all the other out-of-body experiences we hear of, we have to wonder. Those folks are not quite as skeptical about the subject as I am, in most cases. If they don't have some convincing evidence to the contrary, what's to stop them from saying, \"I'm absolutely certain I've had an out-of-body experience?\" There is no other explanation for it except the possible and rather parsimonious conclusion that they were either dreaming or had a hallucination. It might have been a bad pork chop, for all we know. Please consider that carefully, and don't forget it, because it's a good example of how even the arch-skeptic could possibly have been taken in. I have had a number of small experiences like that, including the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu type experiences that so many people have had. (I love the line from the fellow who says, \"I keep having the same d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, over and over again.\") But I have resisted the temptation to merely say, \"Well, at last I've got proof of it.\" I'm highly skeptical, but what is that skepticism based on? If you're skeptical as well, have you asked yourself, \"Upon what do I base my skepticism?\" Are you just plain ornery? Do you just not want to go along with the status quo? Do you know some people who believe in it who are really pretty dense and you don't want to join their group? You must have a reason, I think, for yourself and for others as to why you are skeptical. These things are not likely to be true; therefore, you need proof of them. We're not required to prove a negative; we can't do that. I can't prove telepathy doesn't exist. I remember getting a question years ago. A lady stood up in the audience and said, \"Can you prove to me that ESP doesn't exist?\" I said, \"No, I can't.\" She sat down with her arms folded and replied \"Ah ha.\" That was a victory for her. I went on to explain that I can't prove a negative. My question is, \"Do you believe in it?\" She said, \"Absolutely.\" I asked if she could prove that it is so. She said, \"Well, I'm quite convinced of it.\" \"That's not my question,\" I responded. \"Can you prove that it is so? You're the one making the claim.\" We skeptics, as Michael Shermer clearly pointed out, are not in the business of debunking. If I were in the business of debunking, and I've often had that label pinned on me and I've always resented it and denied it\u2014it means I would go into an investigation convinced that \"this ain't so and I'm going to show you that it isn't.\" I'm not a lawyer; I don't have an advocacy position to take. I go into a situation as an investigator. To be perfectly fair, I can't prove a negative, but I go into this thing prepared to be shown. Am I prejudiced against it? Oh, yes! I have to admit that. But if you've been sitting by a chimney for 63 years on the evening of December 24 and a fat man in a red suit has never bounced down that chimney, you can say, \"One hundred percent of my evidence shows me that this claim is not necessarily so. I cannot prove that it isn't, but it's not very likely to be true, based on what we know.\" The Santa Claus example may seem trivial and a little inappropriate, but it is actually a good metaphor for so many paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. Another is flying reindeer. This one we can actually test. (Please don't tell the SPCA about this.) I don't really want to do the experiment, but let's walk through it as if I were doing it. It's a thought experiment. Let's select, by some randomizing process, a thousand reindeer. We'll number them and get them all together in a reindeer truck (I don't know what you put reindeer in) and take them to the top of the World Trade Center in New York. We are going to test whether or not reindeer can fly. You have your reindeer all lined up, a video-camera operator standing by, lots of pads of paper and pens at work. The time is now ten past ten in the morning. OK, first experiment. Number one reindeer, please, up to the edge. Camera going? Good. Push. Uhh, write down \"no\". Really NO! Number two. Push. I don't know what the result of the experiment will be; I suspect strongly what it will be, based upon my meagre knowledge of the aerodynamics of the average reindeer, though I'm not an expert on it. But based upon previous accounts of what reindeer can and cannot do, I think we are going to end up with a pile of very unhappy and broken reindeer at the foot of the World Trade Center. And probably a couple of policemen will be standing by a squad car saying, \"I don't know, but here comes another one.\" What have we proven with this experiment? Have we proven that reindeer cannot fly? No, of course not. We have only shown that on this occasion, under these conditions of atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation, at this position geographically, at this season, that these 1000 reindeer either could not or chose not to fly. (If the second is the case, then we certainly know something of the intelligence of the average reindeer.) However, we have not, and can not, prove the negative that reindeer cannot fly, technically, rationally, and philosophically speaking. People will often look at this example and say, \"Well, how many reindeer would you have to test?\" I'm not going to get into the statistics of the argument; I will only tell you that you cannot prove a negative. The other folks who claim that something is so are required to prove it. It is what we call the burden of proof. In this case, if it's so it's very easy to prove. Just show me one flying reindeer. Then they rationalize, saying, \"Oh, no. It's only the eight tiny reindeer that live at the North Pole who can, and will, on the evening of December 24, fly to do that specific job.\" In that case you have to throw up your hands and say, \"Well, I don't think your hypothesis is very testable.\" Don't spin your wheels! Thought experiments like this one only go so far. As an example of a real experiment testing unusual claims, I just came back from Hungary where I was invited to Budapest by the Academy of Sciences. They are very concerned about the fact that now that many of these countries are freed from the burdensome and onerous yoke of Communism and have the freedom to receive all kinds of scientific information in the form of journals and lectures, nonsense comes in as well. The astrologers, the faith healers, the ESP artists, the people with the pendulums, the water dowsers\u2014they're lined up and pouring across the border because they see a new market. The scientists of Hungary were concerned about this. A well-known member of parliament who is also a well-respected brain scientist of international repute, said to me, \"Mr. Randi, have you seen any of the publicity on the magnetic ladies?\" I had. In case you're not familiar with the magnetic ladies of Hungary, I will relieve you of that ignorance immediately. You may have seen a picture that made all the wire services in this country last year, of the magnetic man from (then) Leningrad. There was a picture of a middle-aged man standing like this, naked from the belt up, with a flatiron stuck here, a hammer there, nails, razor blades\u2014all kinds of metal clinging to his body. The caption said that he attracted these things. They just jumped, willy nilly, onto his body. He was somehow magnetic. I'll bet his wristwatch was a mess! Don't bring him near your computers! I can just imagine him going through a steel door. Bam! Right into it! Well, I took that with the proverbial grain of salt about the size of a basketball, and just put it in the scrapbook and forgot about it. But the professor asked me about the magnetic ladies of Hungary, and he said, \"Their reputation is such that objects, not necessarily metallic ones, cling to their bodies with such tenacity that a strong man cannot tear them loose.\" Now, wait a minute! Suppose you have some instant glue, and we take a tennis ball and stick it on the lady's neck, on the side. If a strong man can't tear it off, he's going to tear her skin off\u2014or her head! Something has to give! My scientist friend and sponsor of this trip looked at me and said, \"How can they make claims like this?\" I said, \"Well, show me the magnetic ladies.\" He said that the following day, after the press conference, they were scheduled to arrive. I could hardly wait. One of the parapsychologists had suggested that he could bring me some instrumentation for detection of their magnetism. He promised that we'd take the two ladies down to the laboratory, (hand in hand, clinging to one another, no doubt). I declined to go to the laboratory because the laymen reading the report in the newspaper wouldn't understand \"laboratory\". What are you going to do? Put a cyclotron on her ear? No. I equipped myself with a scientific device and I went along. The device was called a compass. It's a scientific instrument and an easy way to perform the test. If a woman is magnetic, the compass is going to point right at her. The two ladies showed up. I told my friend in advance that he must understand that the claim is one thing; the event itself will often be something totally different. It won't be half as entertaining or amusing, or true, as the actual demonstration. One lady literally did this: she took her wristwatch off her wrist and did this. [Randi put his watch on his forehead and it stays there without falling.] \"How do you explain that?,\" she said. I looked at both ladies, who were wearing very greasy, high gloss makeup. It was obviously sticky, mixed with a little perspiration. She said, \"We have no explanation for it.\" I said I didn't find it terribly difficult to explain. The second lady had an even better demonstration. She took a small ceramic saucer from her purse, stuck it on her forehead, where it remained. \"And how do you explain that?\" she parroted the other woman. I pulled it off her forehead, and stuck it on the foreheads of the first four people standing on my right. It stuck very effectively to the foreheads of all of them! Then we tested under controlled conditions. (By the way, the compass test failed miserably; it pointed to North, obstinately refusing to point at them.) I asked for soap and water and, through the interpreter, asked the first lady if I could wash her forehead to remove the makeup and any perspiration that might be there. She informed me that if she washed her forehead it wouldn't work because water is absorbed into the skin and water and electricity, or magnetism, don't mix. She denied that that would be a satisfactory test, as did the second lady, and they left. \"You've learned your first lesson in the scientific investigation of unusual claims,\" I told the Professor. \"Don't start to give theories on how it might work until you've seen whether it meets the claims of the newspaper account, or is really something much less impressive. To be fair to these women, I can see how that account might have ended up in a newspaper. I'm sure those ladies didn't say to the newspaper reporters, \"A strong man can't pull it away from me.\" But a reporter is a human being and maybe his story doesn't look all that great when he writes that things cling to their bodies. Then perhaps he thinks: \"Um, how about 'with such tenacity that a strong man can't pull them loose'\"? Now, he has a story! What I'm saying is that the media are as much to blame for the spread of nonsense and pseudoscience as the claimants themselves. For example, a few years ago the New York Daily News, on page three where they put the \"heavy news\" and sensational stuff, announced that a student at Duke University had successfully in great detail described not only an aircraft accident 24 hours in advance of the event, he even gave the number of people who would be killed. He was short by only two. He even described the location of the crash in the Canary Islands. That was picked up by news services and was featured on television programs; it was on every newscast for quite some time. It was received by the press as a genuine example of prophecy, and the director of the program in which this was involved at Duke University actually made a statement that he had a sealed envelope 24 hours before in his safe that was not touched by this gentlemen until after the episode had taken place. It was allegedly torn open at that time and it contained the prediction. To explain this phenomena I will take you into a different world, for just a moment, so you will understand something. Magicians know how this young man could very easily have done this trick. I won't go into all the details; you can imagine some of them yourself. But the effect is exactly as described\u2014a sealed signed envelope, put into a safe, later carefully opened. Inside you either find a tape cassette or a sealed letter with all kinds of security on it, signed, maybe genuinely notarized, as of the day before. It contains the prediction. A miracle of a semi-religious nature? No, it's a trick. It can be done by any good magician. Now, let us return to the article in the Daily News, first edition. It came out in the afternoon. It had the story on page 3, and a box in the middle of it describing the mechanics of how it had been locked up in a safe and it had a final paragraph which quoted the student at Duke University who made the prediction with this disclaimer: \"It's all part of the publicity for my magic show, which is happening tomorrow night. Don't take it seriously.\" The second and third editions of the Daily News had everything except that one sentence. Another example of how the media distorts claims comes from a young fellow who lived a few doors down from me when I was living in Rumson, New Jersey. He was one of the local characters who did adventurous things like going out on rafts and sailboats. I thought he was a nice kid. One day on the front page of the New York Times there was a little box showing a map of the Bermuda Triangle with a Maltese Cross on it. The headline read: \"Rumson boy lost at sea in Bermuda Triangle.\" I read the short article, continued on another page, which said he had taken off in his one-man sailboat, sailed into the Triangle carrying a radio transmitter, and hadn't been heard from since. The Coast Guard was searching for him. No sooner had I finished reading this and had called some friends in New York to tell them about it, I went out to pick up the mail and to my shock there was this kid waving hello to me. He was perfectly all right! I said to him, \"You're in the Times this morning.\" He said, \"Yeah, they picked me up late last night and they brought me in. They want me to be observed in the hospital, but I feel perfectly all right. We had a bit of a storm; I lost the radio overboard and they finally picked me up very, very early, around 2:30 this morning and they flew me in.\" Though the first story made a big splash, the followup never appeared in the New York Times or any other paper of which I know. It's still part of the mythology about the Bermuda Triangle. So far as we know, from reading accounts that were published in newspapers, that kid is still someplace out in a sailboat in the Bermuda Triangle or perhaps taken off to Mars. You've got to learn that newspaper editors and reporters are subject to the same kinds of pressures that we all are. We all want something successful. Often the choice is between a story and a non-story. We have to realize that we cannot depend on the media to always to represent the facts as they actually are. That's not a great deal of news to you, but you must bear it in mind at all times. Be careful about accepting what appears in print; don't let them say to you, \"They put it in the paper; it must be so,\" or \"Someone wrote a book on it. It must be so.\" Furthermore, books are often published which, before they actually reach the stands and are on sale, have been completely refuted because they are based on false information. Do they immediately withdraw them? No. I'll give you a good example. There's a book called [Learning to Use Extrasensory Perception](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059519401X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=059519401X). Its published by Charles Tart, a respected psychologist at University of California, Davis. I heard Dr. Tart give a talk in Casper, Wyoming. I'm going to tell you exactly what he said and see if your reaction is the same as mine. I recorded it on tape so I know exactly the words he said; this is not a case of interpretation or faulty recollection. He said, in speaking to the audience: There was a time, years ago, when I was highly skeptical of any paranormal claims of any kind. One of the things that convinced me that there must be something to this is a strange experience that I personally went through. It was wartime. I was at Berkeley, California, and everybody was working overtime. We worked until very late hours of the night and the young lady who was my assistant at the time worked with me until very late this one night. She finally went home; I went home. Then the very next day she came in, all excited. She reported this event. It was wartime; they did work overtime. They often were very, very tired when they went home. It was understandable they would fall into a deep sleep and get as much sleep as they possibly could during the night. She reported that during this night she had suddenly sat bolt upright in her bed, convinced that something terrible had happened. \"I had a terrible sense of foreboding,\" she said, but she did not know what had happened. \"I immediately swung out of bed and went over to the window and looked outside to see if I could see anything that might have happened like an accident. I was just turning away from the window and suddenly the window shook violently. I couldn't understand that. I went back to bed, woke up the next morning and listened to the radio.\" A munitions ship at Port Chicago had exploded. It literally took Port Chicago off the map. It levelled the entire town and over 300 people were killed. Whether it was an accident or sabotage, no one ever found out. She said she had sensed the moment when all these people were snuffed out in this mighty explosion. How would she have suddenly become terrified, jumped out of bed, gone to the window, and then\u2014from 35 miles away, the shock wave had reached Berkeley and shook the window? Indeed, she remembered looking at the clock to see what time it was\u2014right to the minute. Well, when I heard this, I said to myself, \"There's something wrong here.\" I see a couple of smiles around the audience; maybe you've spotted the same thing I did. I had a geologist friend sitting three or four seats away; I handed him a note. He winked, smiled, got up and left the room. He came back in, handed it to me, and it just said on it, \"8 seconds.\" What question did I ask him? [Answer from audience: What is the difference in time of propagation over a distance of 35 miles of a shock wave through the air, compared to a shock wave through the ground? The difference is 8 seconds.] So 8 seconds before that window shook, she had been startled by the room itself shaking, not by the airwave, but by the groundwave. My theory is this: the groundwave which shook the bed startled her, she swung out of bed, went over to the window, looked outside, didn't see anything, went to turn away from the window and suddenly the pane shook in front of her. The next morning I went to Professor Tart where he was having breakfast by himself. I had known him through correspondence and phone conversations but had never met him personally. I went over, introduced myself, sat down for a moment and gave him this bit of theory. I said there would be 8 seconds difference in the time. He didn't look up from his scrambled eggs for the longest time. Finally, when he did, he smiled and said, \"Mr. Randi, that may be the explanation that you prefer.\" I think he had just decided that he wasn't going to entertain that idea very solidly. But I don't know that he ever made that statement subsequent to that, so maybe he did come to the conclusion that what I offered as an explanation was more likely to be true. But it is so typical of the field! Again, I'm involved in some stuff that I can't tell you about, and I apologize for that, where I have a number of prominent scientists who are absolutely ignoring, refusing to look at very good evidence in this case that I'm investigating. They can come up with rationalizations for it that you wouldn't believe, unless you've been through this process before. It is incredible how they can ignore good evidence to show that there is a prosaic, rational, and very probable explanation for what they are observing. I want to close this presentation with some parallel examples of scientific claims that turned out to be so much nonsense. Let's go back to 1903 in France. You may have heard of this, if not it really is something you should look up. A prominent scientist\u2014a physicist named Rene Blondlot\u2014startled the world of science with his announcement of the discovery of N-rays. A very well respected man who had won many prizes in science and justifiably so, he was doing experiments by today's standards that were very simple\u2014such as finding the speed of electricity in a conductor. It sounds easy today, but in those days it was a very sophisticated experiment and not all that easily done. Blondlot was in his 70s at the time when he discovered N-rays, named after the town of Nancy, where he was head of the Department of Physics at the University of Nancy. What were N-rays? N-rays were allegedly radiation exhibiting impossible properties emitted by all substances with the exception of green wood (wood not dried out) and anesthetized metal. (Metal that had been dipped in ether or chloroform did not give out N-rays!) Within a matter of six to eight months of the announced discovery of N-rays, 30 papers had come in from all over Europe confirming the existence of N-rays. Reports were published in journals despite the fact that there were many laboratories reporting failure after failure in replicating the results. Such acceptance was understandable considering that X-rays, which also exhibited unsuspected properties, were by then firmly established. What Blondlot had was a basic spectroscope with a prism (not glass, but aluminum) on the inside, and a thread. The narrow stream of N-rays was refracted through the prism and coming out produced a spectrum on a field. The N-rays were reported to be invisible, except when viewed when they hit a treated thread (for example, treated with calcium sulfide). They moved the thread across the gap where the N-rays came through and when it was illuminated that was reported as the detection of the N- rays. Before long N-rays were established as factual. Nature magazine was skeptical of the N-rays since laboratories in England and Germany were unable to find them. (Germany had just discovered X-rays the decade before and the French were annoyed that they didn't have a ray.) Nature sent an American physicist named Robert W. Wood from Johns Hopkins University to investigate. Now, I've been accused of skulduggery in my time, but what Wood did was brilliant. When no one was looking he removed the prism from the N-ray detection device and put it in his pocket. Without the prism the machine could not possibly work because it was dependent on the refraction of N-rays by the aluminium-treated prism. Yet, when the assistant conducted the next experiment he found N-rays! He swore they were there. When the experiment was over Wood knew it was really over. He was prepared to make his report, and when he went to replace the prism back in the machine, one of the other assistants saw him do this and thought he was actually removing it, and he decided to show Wood up. Thinking Wood had removed the prism (when he had actually put it back), he set up the experiment, could find no lines, and opened the box to show that the prism was not there and to his dismay, there it was! The whole incident blew up. Papers were withdrawn, those that were in the mail were retracted, and N-rays disappeared from the scene. How did this happen? How did over 30 papers get published? Not because the scientists who wrote the papers were stupid. Not because they were lying. But because they were deceiving themselves. Irving Klotz made this observation in Scientific American: According to Blondlot and his disciples, then, it was the sensitivity of the observer rather than the validity of the phenomena that was called into question by criticisms such as Wood's, a point of view that will not be unfamiliar to those who have followed more recent controversies concerning extrasensory perception. By 1905, when only French scientists remained in the N-ray camp, the argument began to acquire a somewhat chauvinistic aspect. Some proponents of N-rays maintained that only the Latin races possessed the sensitivities (intellectual as well as sensory) necessary to detect manifestations of the rays. It was alleged that Anglo-Saxon powers of perception were dulled by continual exposure to fog and Teutonic ones blunted by constant ingestion of beer. Yet science does not always learn from these mistakes. Visiting Nancy recently and speaking on the subject of pseudoscience, I discussed this example and though I was in the city that gave the name to N-rays, no one in the audience had ever heard of them, or of Blondlot, not even the professors from the University of Nancy! Now let's go to modern Germany, after the fall of Communism, and compare N-rays to the newly discovered \"E-rays.\" They are actually called Erdestrallen, or \"Earth-rays,\" but I've gotten the media all over the world to call them E-rays, a sort of parallel to N-rays. E-rays are even sillier than N-rays. What are they? First of all they cannot be detected by any known means, except by water dousers. They cause cancer. They supposedly come from the center of the Earth. The West German government spent over 400,000 marks, or about $200,000, to pay dowsers to go around to hospitals that were federally funded and federal office buildings to move beds and desks that were in the way of these deadly E- rays. I offered to go over for nothing and conduct a very simple two-part test: 1. Can one dowser find the same spot twice? and 2. Can two dowsers find the same spot once? I told them about this and their response was,\"We don't need to do the experiment because we know dowsing works. It's been around since the Middle Ages and the historical tradition validates its truthfulness.\" I challenge all the dowsers in a similar way. Since 94 percent of the Earth's surface has water within drillable distance my challenge is to find a dry spot! They don't want to do it. Why? Because they only have a six percent chance of success. Dowsing is an idiomotor reaction that is very deceptive. It is an unconscious motion that you cannot detect and it looks for all the world like some mysterious force. In a similar fashion, a few years ago I was in France investigating the results of experiments done by Jacques Benveniste on water with memory. He managed to get his article published in Nature, who put a disclaimer in the middle of the paper that perhaps \"vigilant members of the scientific community with a flair for picking holes in other people's work may be able to suggest further tests of the validity of the conclusions.\" Nature sent a team of investigators over to his laboratory, of which I was a part. [The other two were John Maddox and Walter W. Stewart.] We showed that there were serious problems with the protocol, as well as the fudging of data. When controls were tightened, the experimenter could not replicate the results. Then there is the theory of homeopathy born approximately 220 years ago, the brainchild of one Samuel Hahnemann. Medicine was in its infancy. Poor people could not afford doctors and recovered more often than the aristocracy who received all sorts of substances, which often killed them. Samuel Hahnemann gave sick, poor people water, which was suppose to contain a curative agent. Since these people did not go to doctors, they tended to survive, and this supported his belief in the curative power of his special water. The first principle of homeopathy is that an extract of some substance in water will help cure you. The second principle is that an attenuated, or diluted solution will work even better. How diluted were these? If you take a solution and dilute it with 10 parts of water for every one part of itself, you've got what is called a \"one solution.\" If you take one part of that and put it in 10 parts of water, now one part in 100, it's called a \"two solution.\" If you have a \"five solution,\" you have one part in 100,000. When you get to \"Avogadro's limit\" there is a chance of there being one molecule in the solution. One more dilution and you have one chance in 10 of there being one molecule in the solution. Well, the homeopathy people start off with a solution of 10 to the power of 50 (a one followed by 50 zeros)! Since there are 10 to the power of 23 stars in the known universe, that's what I call dilute. But that's nothing. They go all the way to 10 to the power of 1500!!! That is so diluted that I could not conceive of what 10 to the 1500 really means, so I called Martin Gardner and asked for an example with which to illustrate it. He called me back and said that an equivalent is to take one grain of rice, crush it up in a teaspoon and dissolve that powder in a sphere of water the size of the solar system, then repeat that process two billion times!! (The technical problems of mixing such a solution are obvious!) The critical point of homeopathy\u2014the point of all this diluting\u2014is that every molecule of water that comes into contact with the homeopathy water retains the memory of that special water! Thus a little substance can go a long way. I have a simple question from a layman's perspective. Since water has been around for \"billions and billions of years,\" in this process it must have come into contact with every organic and inorganic molecule on Earth. That being the case, why not just give the patient ordinary tap water? In fact, these homeopathic waters are so diluted that the homeopathy doctors and scientists can't even tell the difference between the water with iron and the water with gold. Come on folks, let's get real. There is no evidence that this stuff works, yet people go right on believing anyway. Here's a typical response, this from a letter written by Boaz Robinzon of the Faculty of Agriculture: \"I want you to know that no matter what the Nature investigating committee has written, I am still confident that the phenomenon observed is a real and reproducible one and it is only a matter of time until we shall be proven right.\" That's a classic example of someone who does not wish to face reality. I've been going around the world telling people to get real for years. That's the peculiar business that I'm in. I shouldn't have to be in that business but someone has to do it. Will it ever end? Probably not, but perhaps with the efforts of the skeptics and scientists we can \"dilute\" it a little! Thank you.

By Any Other Name by Tim Callahan It is widely understood that the gospels designated Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were not written by the various disciples and apostles bearing those names. Instead, these names were rather arbitrarily assigned to the four canonical gospels. It is less widely known that the epistles 1 and 2 Peter were almost certainly not written by that famous disciple of Jesus. Likewise, Jude, supposedly a brother of Jesus, did not write the short epistle bearing his name; and, in all probability, whatever \"John\" may have written the three epistles and gospel now bearing his name, it was not the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" (see the Gospel of John 13:23-25; 19:26; 21:7, 20, 24). Jude can be reliably dated to the 2nd century, past the time any brother of Jesus could have been alive. One reason the disciples Peter and John probably didn't write the epistles 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John and the Gospel of John, is that\u2014assuming them to be historical\u2014they were, in all probability, as the biblical scholar Bart Ehrman notes in his new book [Forged](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062012614/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0062012614), illiterate. With illiteracy rates in ancient times estimated to be 90% of the population or more, it is highly unlikely that fishermen were among those who could read or write. Of course, Paul, as a learned Pharisee and official would have been literate, and a number of the letters bearing his name were, in all probability, written by him. Ehrman notes (p. 93) that at least seven of the Pauline letters are genuinely from his hand. These are Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon. What most of the lay public doesn't know is that many letters attributed to him, even purporting in their texts to be written by him, were not. These include what are referred to as the Pastoral Letters, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. Additionally, Colossians, Ephesians and 2 Thessalonians were probably not written by Paul, though they, along with the pastoral letters purport to be by him. Thus, of the 13 canonical letters claiming to be written by Paul, nearly half\u2014often referred to as \"Deutero-Pauline\"\u2014were not, and are, in fact, forgeries. In Forged, Bart Ehrman deals not only with the evidence that many influential canonical and non-canonical works were forgeries, but also with the inability of many Christian apologists to deal with this embarrassing fact. Rationalizations abound for why 1 and 2 Peter; 1, 2 and 3 John; Jude; and the six Deutero-Pauline letters really weren't forgeries, even though they were, and really are still inspired, despite the dishonesty of falsely claiming apostolic authorship. Ehrman rather effortlessly tears these rationalizations to pieces, pointing out that most of them are unsupported by even a shred of evidence. Among the rationalizations are the following: It was acceptable in ancient times to write under the name of one's mentor. The letters were often written by secretaries, who were allowed to add their own words and phrases. It was acceptable in ancient times to write in the name of another, well known author. As to the last of these, Ehrman points out that both forgery and plagiarism, though not illegal in Roman times, were considered reprehensible. Often, the forgers even put forward a theology in opposition to that held by the apostle whose name they were using. In the case of Paul, both canonical and non-canonical letters and books forged in his name ran the gamut of theological positions, from the intrusive passage inserted into 1 Corinthians telling women to shut up in church (1 Cor. 14:34, 35), followed by 1 Timothy going to great lengths to establish a male dominated hierarchy (1 Tim. 2:11-15) to the non-canonical Acts of Paul and Thecla, in which a female companion of Paul's named Thecla has great authority and power. The content and teaching of many of the Deutero-Pauline letters, particularly the Pastoral Letters directly contradicts what Paul says 1 Corinthians about marriage. In 1 Cor. 7:25-40, while Paul grudgingly concedes that it isn't a sin to marry, he sees it as an impediment. Married people are more concerned with pleasing their spouses than having concern for God. Paul also says that, if possible married couples should try to be celibate (1 Cor. 7:29): \"I mean, brethren, that the appointed time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none.\" Written by Paul ca. CE 60, 1 Corinthians echoes the view held by the Christians of that time that their generation would be the last before Jesus returned and the world ended, hence Paul's obsession with celibacy and renunciation. Yet, 1 Timothy is very concerned about family life and says, despite their many faults, there is a way for them to be saved (1 Tim. 2:15, emphasis added): \"Yet woman will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with modesty.\" Ehrman notes that this is in stark contrast to Paul's bare toleration of marriage and his admonition in 1 Corinthians that the end of the world was nigh. Just as whole books were forged, sections of books not themselves forged also bear forged sections. These include not only the intrusive passage in 1 Corinthians, mentioned above, but as well a longer ending to the Gospel of Mark, in which there are post resurrection appearances by the risen Christ. Another such intrusion is the much beloved tale in the Gospel of John of the woman taken in adultery. Remove this story from the text and the material before and after it flows smoothly. The story is also missing from the earliest manuscripts of the Gospel of John. Forgery continues to plague believers to this day through the codification of the New Testament canon. In the final chapter of Forged, Ehrmen deals with a number of popular 19th and 20th century fabrications. Among these is [The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463688636/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1463688636) (1894) in which the author, Russian war correspondent Nicholas Notovitch, claimed to have found proof in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery that when Jesus was 13 he joined a caravan to India, studied under Brahmins for six years, learning their holy books, the Vedas, but found himself appalled by the caste system. In order to save himself from being murdered by the Brahmins, Jesus fled to a community of Buddhists and learned Theravada Buddhism. At age 29 he returned to Palestine, armed with the sacred knowledge of the mysterious east. The book and the claims of Notovitch that he found records of the life of the young Jesus in Tibet were a complete hoax. Although it was exposed as such, it nevertheless generated a whole mythos of Jesus visiting India and Tibet and getting his theology from Buddhist monks. Other modern fabrications include [The Long-Lost Second Book of Acts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008C9WIG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B0008C9WIG), in which Mary the mother of Jesus, teaches the disciples a secret doctrine of reincarnation, [The Confession of Pontius Pilate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787307769/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0787307769), in which Mary Magdalene presents Roman emperor Tiberius with an Easter egg dyed red, and The Gospel of the Twelve, in which Jesus espouses strict vegetarianism. One of the strongest points Ehrman makes in this book is that Christian apologists, forced to defend the Bible as divinely inspired, tend to give the canonical forgeries a free pass, avoiding the issue of forgery\u2014meaning lying\u2014through their many rationalizations. As with Ehrman's earlier books, such as [Misquoting Jesus](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b129PB) and [God's Problem](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FOR5CG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B001FOR5CG), Forged is readily accessible to the lay public and clear in presenting the ways in which we know how the Bible was written and who wrote it.

About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, Michael Dahlen examines Dinesh D'Souza's Immanuel Kant-inspired philosophy that \"reality as a whole is, in principle, inaccessible to human beings\" and that \"it is in no way unreasonable to believe things on faith that simply cannot be adjudicated by reason.\" Michael Dahlen is a managed accounts administrator for SEI Investments (SEIC: NASDAQ) and a freelance writer who has had articles published in The Objective Standard and Liberty. He holds an MS in finance and economics from Walsh College. [SUBSCRIBE to Skeptic magazine](https://www.skeptic.com/subscribe) for more great articles like this one. What's So Great About Kant? A Critique of Dinesh D'Souza's Attack on Reason by Michael Dahlen Dinesh D'Souza, a prominent conservative intellectual and a former White House policy analyst during the Reagan administration, has ambitiously defended Christianity in recent years. He wrote a New York Times best-selling book, [What's So Great About Christianity](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1414326017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1414326017), and he has had articles published in the Wall Street Journal and the Christian Science Monitor. He has also publicly debated prominent atheists including Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennet, and Michael Shermer. For the most part, D'Souza has attempted to argue on the atheists' own terms, that is, on the terms of reason, science, and evidence. He has tried to demonstrate that one need not accept Christianity on blind faith; one can accept it based on the facts. This characterization, however, of D'Souza's position requires one major caveat. For the die-hard proponents of reason who are not convinced that the evidence supports the alleged truths of religion, D'Souza has a secret weapon up his sleeve: he resorts to brazenly attacking reason. Lacking all subtlety, he asserts openly, explicitly, \"Human reason can never grasp reality itself.\" [1](#note01) In arguing against the validity of reason, D'Souza relies on the ideas of arguably the most influential philosopher in modern history, none other than Immanuel Kant. \"Kant's accomplishment,\" D'Souza boasts, \"was to unmask the intellectual pretension of the Enlightenment: that reason and science are the only routes to reality and truth.\" [2](#note02) Basically, Kant argued that the reality we perceive with our senses is not true reality; it is simply the reality \"appearing\" to us. True reality, the reality beneath the so-called appearances, is allegedly unknowable. \"Perhaps the best way,\" D'Souza states, \"to understand this is to see Kant as positing two kinds of reality: the material reality that we experience and reality itself.\" [3](#note03) The world of appearances (material reality) Kant calls the \"phenomenal world\" whereas real reality (\"reality-in-itself\") Kant calls the \"noumenal world.\" According to Kant, we do not perceive reality as it is. Our senses and our minds provide us only with a distorted picture of reality, not reality itself. Echoing Kant, D'Souza argues that humans \"see things in a limited and distorted way.\" [4](#note04) \"Reality does not come directly to us but is 'filtered' through a lens that we ourselves provide.\" [5](#note05) As such, D'Souza continues, \"our human minds have a built-in disposition toward illusion: the illusion that reality must be exactly the way we experience it.\" [6](#note06) Furthermore, when \"we presume that our experience corresponds to reality, we are making an unjustified leap. We have absolutely no way to know this.\" [7](#note07) All of our knowledge, therefore, is allegedly just knowledge of \"appearances,\" that is, of a world the human mind subjectively creates. As Kant himself states, \"all objects of any experience possible to us, are nothing but appearances, that is, mere representations, which...have no independent existence outside our thoughts.\" [8](#note08) \"Kant's argument,\" D'Souza points out, \"is that we have no basis to assume that our perception of reality ever resembles reality itself. Our experience of things can never penetrate to things as they really are. That reality remains permanently hidden to us.\" [9](#note09) Consequently, D'Souza concludes, \"reason can never grasp reality itself.\" [10](#note10) Despite D'Souza's blatant attack on reason and on our ability to perceive reality, he still wants to have things both ways. Amazingly, he says that he and Kant are not actually arguing against them. Kant isn't arguing against the validity of perception or science or reason. He is simply showing their significant limits. These limits cannot be erased by the passage of time or by further investigation and experimentation. Rather, the limits on reason are intrinsic to the kind of beings that humans are, and to the kind of apparatus that we possess for perceiving reality. The implication of Kant's argument is that reality as a whole is, in principle, inaccessible to human beings. Put another way, there is a great deal that human beings simply will never know. [11] If the \"implication of Kant's argument\" is that reality is \"inaccessible to human beings\"\u2014and that certainly is the implication\u2014then he most emphatically is arguing \"against the validity of perception or science or reason.\" These are quite abstract ideas. Before we analyze their merits\u2014or lack thereof\u2014let us concretize them; let us see what it would actually mean, in practice, if it was true that \"reality remains permanently hidden to us.\" If a professional baseball player saw \"things in a limited and distorted way,\" that is, if his perception of the movement and location of a baseball was something other than what it actually is, then he would not be able to consistently hit ninety-five mile per hour fastballs. If a cardiac surgeon's mind had \"a built-in disposition toward illusion,\" then he would not be able to successfully perform a coronary artery bypass surgery. If a pilot's knowledge of his airplane, its controls, and its location in the sky did not correspond to reality, then he would not be able to lift his airplane off the ground, fly it across a continent, and safely land it at his targeted destination. If science could \"never penetrate to things as they really are,\" then the great innovators of our time would not have been able to create all the marvels of modern technology. For that matter, if reality is \"inaccessible to human beings\" and if our perception of reality did not at the very least \"resemble reality itself,\" then we would not be able to perform even the simplest of activities such as eating, walking, reading, or brushing our teeth. That our experience, observations, or more precisely, our sensory perceptions provide us with direct awareness of reality is not \"an unjustified leap\" as D'Souza asserts. It is an axiom, an irreducible, self-evident fact. D'Souza and Kant, however, are right about one thing: reality and our perception of reality are two distinct things; they are not identical. The erroneous idea that perception and reality are one and the same is a theory of perception known as \"na\u00efve realism.\" In this view, human consciousness, allegedly possessing no nature of its own, does not have identity; it is nothing but a passive medium or a transparent mirror, simply reflecting reality \"unfiltered.\" According to this theory, sensory qualities such as color, odor, and taste exist in objects independent of humans. That is false, but that does not mean they are subjective qualities, existing in our mind independent of objects. A comparison will help to clarify this point. Sensory qualities are similar to the concept of weight. [12](#note12) Weight is not a quality existing in objects; it is a relation between objects caused by gravity (the attractive force between two objects possessing mass). An object weighs more on earth than on the moon because the earth has more mass, causing a greater gravitational pull. Just as weight, therefore, is a relational quality, not a subjective one, sensory qualities are relational, not subjective, as well. Such qualities are the result of external objects coming into contact with our senses. They are neither in the object alone nor in the mind alone; they are \"object-as-perceived.\" [13](#note13) Does this mean that our senses distort our perception and that reason is incapable of grasping reality? No. But D'Souza and Kant think otherwise. Although they are right that na\u00efve realism is false, where they go wrong is in their tacit assumption that the only way we can directly perceive and grasp reality is if na\u00efve realism were true. Because it is not true, because our consciousness is not a passive medium, because our consciousness has identity, perceiving reality by definite means, those means\u2014the sensory organs\u2014allegedly get in the way, acting as agents of distortion, preventing us from grasping reality. [14](#note14) In essence, the only way we could directly perceive and grasp reality, in D'Souza's and Kant's view, is if we perceived reality unmediated by any causal process, that is, if we perceived reality magically, without any means. That a causal process, however, mediates our perception of reality does not mean that we perceive reality indirectly. To argue that it does is to conflate the physiological with the cognitive. Physiologically, a causal process (which includes the sensory organs, neurological system, and brain) makes it possible, cognitively, for us to directly perceive reality. How we perceive is a separate issue from what we perceive. Nothing discovered about how we perceive can change the self-evident fact that our perception of reality is direct. We do not directly perceive the causal process involved (the how); we directly perceive reality (the what), which would be impossible without a causal process. Our senses, therefore, are not agents of distortion. They are our form of apprehending or grasping reality, our means of awareness. [15](#note15) And we are fully capable of distinguishing the formal aspects of our perception from the characteristics of objects existing independently of our form of perceiving them. For example, on the one hand, the taste of an orange is the result of certain chemicals in the orange coming into contact with the taste receptors on our tongue. That oranges contain Vitamin C, on the other hand, is a fact of oranges independent of our means of perceiving them. Imagine an intelligent being with radically different sensory organs from our own. Such a being would perceive reality in a different way than we do, but it would not reach different scientific conclusions\u2014as long as it was reasoning correctly. [16](#note16) The things that would differ would be only its starting point\u2014given its different sensory apparatus\u2014and the specific steps of its reasoning. Such a being would perceive oranges differently than we do, but it would not come to different scientific conclusions about the nature of oranges. It too would discover that oranges contain Vitamin C. In addition to arguing that our perception of reality is distorted, D'Souza also argues that our knowledge is limited only to our alleged distorted perceptions. Consider a tape recorder. It captures only one mode of reality, namely sound. Thus all aspects of reality that cannot be captured in sound are beyond its reach. The same, Kant would argue, is true of human beings. The only way we apprehend empirical reality is through our five senses. But why should we believe, Kant asked, that this five-mode instrument is sufficient? What makes us think that there is no reality that lies beyond sensory perception? [17] There are aspects of reality lying beyond our sensory perception insofar as there are numerous facts we cannot directly perceive, but that certainly does not mean that we cannot discover such facts. D'Souza says we cannot \"perceive reality through sonar in the way that a bat does. Our senses place absolute limits on what reality is available to us.\" [18](#note18) No, we do not have a sensory organ detecting sonar, but this fact does not support D'Souza's argument; it undermines it. We are still capable of discovering what sonar is and that bats can directly perceive it. Similarly, we also do not have sensory organs enabling us to directly perceive radiation, magnetism, or sub-atomic particles. Yet this has not prohibited us from discovering and acquiring knowledge of such phenomena. Most scientific knowledge consists of facts not directly observable or perceivable, but such knowledge is valid because it is rooted in a chain of reasoning ultimately derived from sensory perceptions. On top of the problems with D'Souza's argument discussed thus far, it also suffers from one fatal flaw. How does he know? How does D'Souza know we \"see things in a limited and distorted way,\" that our \"minds have a built-in disposition toward illusion\"? How does he know \"our experience of things can never penetrate to things as they really are,\" that \"reason can never grasp reality itself\"? How does he know \"reality as a whole is, in principle, inaccessible to human beings,\" that it \"remains permanently hidden to us\"? By what means does he know these things? Experience and reason? If not, then his conclusions are groundless. D'Souza, however, maintains that such conclusions are based on experience and reason. \"It is Kant,\" D'Souza states, \"who starts with experience and then proceeds from it by steps that reason can justify. ...Kant has arrived at [his conclusions] on the basis of reason alone.\" [19](#note19) One cannot rely on reason to demonstrate that reason is invalid because doing so presumes that reason is valid. Essentially, D'Souza argues that experience and reason cannot grasp reality, yet he also argues that Kant has established this conclusion by means of experience and reason. This argument is clearly self-refuting: its content contradicts the very method it purports to be relying on. One cannot rely on reason to demonstrate that reason is invalid because doing so presumes that reason is valid. If one is going to argue that the senses and reason are invalid and incapable of grasping reality, then what is the arguer relying on? Arguments are composed of concepts, which in turn are derived from the senses. If the senses are invalid, then all concepts are invalid\u2014including the ones used to argue against the senses. Furthermore, an argument by definition is a process of reasoning. If reason is invalid, then so are all arguments\u2014including the argument that reason is invalid. Any argument, therefore, attacking the validity of the senses or of reason is inherently self-contradictory. What is D'Souza after in his case against reason? \"Notice that Kant's argument is entirely secular: it does not employ any religious vocabulary, nor does it rely on any kind of faith. But in showing the limits of reason, Kant's philosophy 'opens the door to faith,' as the philosopher himself noted.\" [20](#note20) Opening the door to faith, therein lies D'Souza's motive. \"We learn from Kant that within the domain of experience, human reason is sovereign, but it is in no way unreasonable to believe things on faith that simply cannot be adjudicated by reason.\" [21](#note21) But what exactly does \"unreasonable\" mean if not believing something that \"cannot be adjudicated by reason\"? Observe the double standard. As we already saw, D'Souza regards as an \"unjustified leap,\" as an act of faith, the axiom that our sensory perceptions provide direct awareness of reality. Yet he also says \"it is in no way unreasonable to believe things on faith.\" (By this he means religious ideas such as the immortality of the soul or the afterlife.) So on the one hand, D'Souza regards the acceptance of a self-evident fact as an unjustified leap of faith. On the other hand, he regards having faith in completely groundless religious ideas as \"in no way unreasonable.\" In attacking reason, all D'Souza seeks is to plant the seed of doubt. One who doubts the validity of reason\u2014and thus one's own ability to grasp reality\u2014will probably end up believing things on faith. But those who fall prey to D'Souza's sophistry should know that he still has not made a valid case for faith. The argument \"because reason is limited, it is therefore okay to have faith\" is a non sequitur. It is just as absurd as saying, \"because I do not have enough food, it is therefore okay to eat poisonous mushrooms.\" Even if D'Souza had, by some inconceivable means, proved the impotence of reason, that in and of itself does not justify believing in ideas without any evidence to support them.
