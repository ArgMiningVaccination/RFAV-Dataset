Meditating right when you wake up can help focus your mind and give your body a chance get the memo it's time for action. Instead of wandering sleepily from coffee pot to couch, try diffusing invigorating essential oils and beginning with just 5-10 minutes of meditation. To begin your morning meditation, start diffusing essential oils that help perk you up. The recipe below includes peppermint and lime essential oils to give you a zing of vitality that gets your morning on track. Once you have your diffuser going, find a place to sit comfortably that is not your bed, or the couch. These are fine places to meditate, but if you have a hard time waking up in general, physical separation can help you mentally separate \"meditation time\" from \"sleep time.\" Leaving a cushion or pillow on the floor near your diffuser before bedtime sets you up for easy meditation in the morning. You can also set out the essential oils you plan on diffusing so you just get out of the bed and go straight to meditation.

You can absolutely meditate in the shower, but it's not what you think. Shower meditation is NOT just zoning out under the water\u2014 we would never suggest wasting precious water and energy. Shower meditation is about disciplining yourself to practice mindfulness as you go through the process of this simple daily task. In a target=\"_blank\"n article for the [New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/well/mind/how-to-be-mindful-while-taking-a-shower.html)online, mindfulness expert Nancy O'Hara is quoted as saying \"the shower is an ideal place to start\" when you want to deepen your mindfulness practice. It's also a great place to start your mindfulness practice when you think you're too busy to meditate. After all everyone needs to shower. To turn your daily shower into meditation time, leave your music and other distractions behind. Methodically complete the cleansing process taking time to be mindful of each action and how your body feels. Allow yourself to fully experience each moment. Diffusing essential oils that promote mental clarity in the shower can help you focus your mind on the routine and the experience. How to Diffuse Essential Oils in the Shower Step 1: Fold a washcloth or small hand towel into a little pad or roll. Step 2: Drop 15-20 drops of essential oils on the cloth. Step 3: Place on the shower floor, shower bar, or bathtub edge where water mists, but doesn't fully hit the cloth. The steam and warm water of your shower diffuses the essential oils into vapor for inhalation.

According to a poll by the [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/media-center/press-release/annual-sleep-america-poll-exploring-connections-communications-technology-use-), you're not alone. 95% of Americans who use technology right before bed, but it turns out exposure to [smartphone screens before bed is bad for sleep](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165331). Instead of wasting 15-20 minutes setting yourself up for an unrestful night, try swapping out that time for meditation. Meditation can help quiet a racing mind and prepare you mentally and a better night's rest. Science also shows that [meditation influences sleep patterns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328970/) physically. In fact, a [recent clinical trial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2110998) showed that mindful meditation not only helped the study group sleep better, but feel better during the day too. Using essential oils for sleep meditation is a no brainer when you consider the well-known [soothing effects of lavender](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/) essential oil. Research specifically regarding [lavender aromatherapy and sleep quality](http://mcjbums.com/en/articles/61602.html) also concluded that participants' sleep quality was improved with inhalation of lavender essential oils. Diffusing lavender with other essential oils that encourage mental clarity and focus in the evening sets a mood for mindfulness that helps relax the body and mind. When diffusing essential oils specifically for meditation before bed we recommend rosemary to avoid over-stimulating your senses. Calm & Collected Bedtime Blend 3 drops lavender essential oils 4 drops rosemary essential oils Best Essential Oils for Meditation The best essential oils to use for meditation are ones that encourage mental clarity and focus. We recommend starting any blend for meditation with one of four essential oils: eucalyptus, pine needle, rosemary or peppermint. Any one of these by themselves, or any combination, will all help you get in the mindset for meditation. Depending on your mental, emotional and physical needs, adding different essential oils to your meditation blend can help you focus your meditation intentions. For example, essential oils that inspire vitality are awesome in the morning, but not necessarily what you would want before bed. If you are very upset or grieving, adding frankincense or other essential oils that balance emotions can be helpful.
