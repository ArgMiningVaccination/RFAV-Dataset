[Inner Traditions/Bear & Company](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/361356815/Inner-Traditions-Bear-Company) Reviews for Radical Medicine 1 rating0 reviews Book preview Radical Medicine - Louisa L. Williams AN INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL MEDICINE Radical: 'ra-di-kl (Latin: radix), going to the root or origin; pertaining to what is fundamental, far-reaching, and thorough Radical medicine is a form of holistic medicine that is committed to curing disease, not simply suppressing or palliating symptoms. It has two central tenets. The first is that only through getting to the roots or underlying cause of the problem can true healing occur. For example, many holistic physicians give natural thyroid medication to their patients when blood test results indicate hypothyroidism. However, if these physicians fail to diagnose and treat an underlying common cause of hypothyroidism\u2014 mercury intoxication from amalgam fillings\u2014they ultimately do their patients a great disservice. physician/practitioner: The term physician refers to all licensed doctors (N.D.s, M.D.s, D.C.s, D.O.s, and D.D.S.s). The term practitioner refers to licensed doctors as well as other holistic specialists such as acupuncturists, nutritionists, and physical therapists. See appendix 1, Description of Holistic Practitioners, for more information. The second tenet of radical medicine is that although drinking pure water, exercising regularly, and eating organic foods are all important\u2014even essential\u2014 these general health guidelines are no longer sufficient to ensure the preservation of good health for most individuals. Unfortunately, in these modern toxic times, our immune systems have been subjected to poisons unparalleled in previous centuries and unimaginable by our earlier ancestors. The pervasive petrochemicals polluting our homes and environment, the injection of DNA-damaging childhood vaccinations, the placement of toxic mercury amalgam fillings in our mouths, and the excessive use of antibiotics and other prescription drugs are just a sample of the modern traumas that have rendered many individuals chronically ill\u2014and perhaps, in some cases, essentially incapable of ever truly getting well. Until these and other obstacles to cure are adequately addressed, general guidelines\u2014although important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle\u2014are simply no longer adequate to fend off degenerative disease and help individuals regain their birthright of optimal health.\u00b9 Indeed, in our current toxic environment, much more radical measures are required. A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS FOR MODERN MEDICINE Many health-minded individuals have gone to great lengths to feel better. They purchase water filters, shop at health food stores, take nutritional supplements, and try to exercise regularly. Some have gone even further and avoid their primary food allergy, purchase herbal and homeopathic remedies when they get sick, and do ongoing personal growth work. And yet, for the majority of even these highly motivated individuals, the abundant energy, vitality, and feeling of well-being that define optimum health are rarely realized. Furthermore, many live in fear\u2014often unconsciously\u2014of succumbing later in life to cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, or any of the other devastating illnesses that have become so epidemic in our modern world. And sadly, the long-awaited cures that doctors, numerous charities and associations, and various telethons have been promising us for decades are just around the corner continue to remain elusive. Cardiovascular Disease\u2014Reputedly Our Number One Killer In 1900, the number of deaths resulting from heart disease was 27,427; in 2002 it was 696,947.\u00b2 These figures themselves dramatically depict the obvious failure of modern medicine to find an adequate treatment for heart disease. However, when another figure is added to the equation\u2014the $3.2 billion (and counting) spent by the American Heart Association since 1949 to increase knowledge about the disease\u2014this failure is all the more conspicuous.\u00b3 In fact, cardiovascular disease\u2014a more recently utilized category that encompasses all forms of heart disease including heart attack, congestive heart failure, and stroke\u2014is considered to be the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. MORE U.S. DEATHS FROM HEART DISEASE OR CANCER? Although it was recently reported that cancer had eclipsed heart disease as the number one disease killer, this statistic did not include Americans over the age of eighty-five. Furthermore, it accounted for only heart disease\u2014myocardial infarction (heart attack) and angina pectoris (chest pain)\u2014and excluded other heart ailments that make up the broader category of cardiovascular disease. However, when all ailments of the heart and circulatory system are included within this broader category, deaths from cardiovascular disease far outweigh deaths from cancer. Cancer\u2014We're Not Winning the War In 1900, 3 percent of Americans were diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. In less than four decades, between 1907 and 1936, cancer rates rose by an astounding 90 percent. Finally, in 1971, President Nixon declared a War on Cancer and Congress passed the National Cancer Act to try and quell this epidemic disease. Based on numerous media reports over the next several decades, it did appear that allopathic medicine was making progress in treating this devastating disease with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. However, the National Cancer Institute recently reported that these previously optimistic reports on the decline of several types of cancer were actually false and simply reflected significant delays in the reporting of cancer cases. In fact, in 2002 the institute revealed that many cancer rates had, in reality, been on the rise, including breast and lung cancer rates in women and prostate cancer rates in men. And although often-touted statistics point out that the incidence of lung cancer has declined in men, this has nothing to do with new medical treatments or advances in science but correlates directly with the decline in smoking that began with the Surgeon General's emphasis on quitting in 1964, and the subsequent widespread advertising and educational efforts launched to propagate the hazards inherent in this dangerous habit. U.S. SMOKING RATES The incidence of smoking in men began to decline in 1964 after the Surgeon General's warning on the dangers of tobacco first became public. However, the number of female smokers continued to grow for another twenty years. Overall, though, the percentage of Americans of both sexes who smoke fell from 42 percent in 1965 to 22 percent in 2000. And due to this reduction, women's lung cancer rates are predicted to also decline.\u00b9 Despite this reduction in lung cancer rates due to a reduced incidence of smoking, cancer is reported to be our number two killer and was responsible for 557,271 deaths in 2002.\u00b9\u00b9 Indeed, overall cancer rates have risen, from the previous rate of affecting approximately one in three individuals (as reported in 1997) to the present percentages estimated by the American Cancer Society of striking approximately 50 percent of all men and 40 percent of all women.\u00b9\u00b2 And, as with cardiovascular disease, although for the last thirty years the medical establishment has been given over $40 billion in donations to find a cure, we are actually no closer to winning the war on cancer than we were a century ago.\u00b9\u00b3 In fact, the United Nations' cancer research agency recently postulated that by 2030 cancer will kill more than 13.2 million people a year\u2014almost double the number who died from the disease in 2008.\u00b9 Allopathic Medical Treatment\u2014 At Least the Third Leading Killer In the summer of 2000, the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA) reported that the annual death rate from iatrogenic causes\u2014that is, deaths caused by doctors through the adverse effects of prescription drugs and surgery, errors in medical judgment, and nosocomial (hospital-induced) infections\u2014was estimated at 225,000 annually, rendering it at least the third-leading cause of death in the United States, just behind cardiovascular disease and cancer.\u00b9 This statistic would be shocking in and of itself if it weren't for the fact that this 225,000 figure included only deaths occurring in hospitals, and therefore excluded outpatient iatrogenic deaths, estimated to be 190,000 annually. Additionally, the author of this JAMA article, Barbara Starfield, a physician and researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, further disclosed that this estimate of 225,000 was much lower than the figures arrived at by an Institute of Medicine (IOM) study the previous year, in which iatrogenic deaths were estimated to range from 230,000 to 284,000 annually. allopathic: The term allopathic means other than, or against, disease. It refers to the treatment of disease utilizing prescription drugs that are antagonistic to and suppressive of disease symptoms (e.g., antihistamines, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories) and the surgical removal (-ectomy) of diseased tissue (e.g., appendectomy, hysterectomy, and tonsillectomy). Medical as well as osteopathic physicians are taught allopathic principles and practices in their respective medical colleges. iatrogenic: The term iatrogenic, from the Greek iatros (physician) and gennan (to produce), refers to any adverse state or condition produced by a doctor due to poor treatment. nosocomial: The term nosocomial derives from the Greek roots nosos (disease) and komeion (to take care of). It refers to any disease originating in a medical institution or hospital. THE 225,000 IATROGENIC DEATHS REPORTED ANNUALLY This figure of 225,000 is only the mortality, or death, rate. It does not include the effect of allopathic care on morbidity\u2014that is, chronic illness or disability as a result of adverse reactions to prescription drugs, errors in medical judgment, or nosocomial infections. The breakdown of each category within this estimated iatrogenic death rate of 225,000 is: 12,000 deaths per year from unnecessary surgery 7,000 deaths per year from medication errors in hospitals 20,000 deaths per year from other errors in hospitals 80,000 deaths per year from nosocomial infections 106,000 deaths per year from non-error, adverse effects of medications\u00b9 It is also essential to keep in mind one other crucial fact: typically, iatrogenic deaths are grossly under-reported due to physicians' natural reluctance to admit fault. What percentage of doctors are going to risk losing their license and livelihood by admitting fault through honestly reporting deaths caused from extremely toxic chemotherapy (and other) drugs, excessive doses of radiation, unwise surgery in an already weakened patient, and so forth, in this highly litigious society? Further complicating the issue, many patients die nowadays while taking two, seven, or even more medications at the same time. This typical protocol of polypharmacy can baffle even the most knowledgeable toxicologist seeking the actual cause of death. And the possibility of funding by the allopathic medical-pharmaceutical industry to have more autopsies performed to shed light on this matter is not very likely. In this same JAMA article, Dr. Starfield disclosed that most deaths resulting from these underlying [iatrogenic] causes are likely to be recorded according to the immediate cause of death (such as organ failure).* Thus, most deaths that result primarily from the adverse effects of drugs, surgery, or nosocomial infections typically receive a diagnostic code of the secondary cause of death, such as heart failure or kidney failure. Taking these three factors in mind\u2014the exclusion of outpatient iatrogenic deaths (estimated at 190,000), JAMA's conservative estimate of iatrogenic deaths as compared to the IOM's the year before (225,000 versus 230,000 to 284,000), and the natural inclination of physicians not to admit fault by recording deaths according to the immediate cause of mortality rather than the primary iatrogenic factor\u2014leads to the even more startling possibility that this infamous doctor-induced third place in mortality may be dangerously conservative. That is, if all doctors\u2014those practicing in hospitals, large clinics, and smaller offices\u2014began to properly and completely code and report the real cause of their patients' death honestly, this iatrogenic death rate could very possibly eclipse our number two killer, cancer, and might even surpass the number one killer itself, cardiovascular disease. These appalling statistics are such a frank indictment of the hazards of modern allopathic medicine that they are almost too unimaginable for the mind to comprehend. However, these figures emanate not from an angry counterculture publication that could be viewed with suspicion but from the highest bastions of medicine itself\u2014Johns Hopkins University and the Journal of the American Medical Association. Death by Medicine\u2014Actually the Number One Killer In 2004, Gary Null, Ph.D., a nutritionist and leader in the field of holistic medicine, decided to remedy the omission in Dr. Starfield's research and include outpatient deaths. He and a group of Ph.D., M.D., and N.D. researchers subsequently began to tabulate all the annual deaths in the United States caused by allopathic medicine\u2014both inpatient and outpatient. What they discovered was nothing less than shocking. Null and his team found that conventional medicine had actually eclipsed both heart disease and cancer, achieving the ignominious position of number one in U.S. mortality rates.\u00b9 Thus, the healthcare system that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to in this country is not only not delivering effective therapeutic intervention but actually causing more death than any disease it has ever purported to treat. Readers who want to read more about this astounding new study should google Death by Medicine. Not a New Phenomenon It is important to point out that these iatrogenic deaths are not a new phenomenon\u2014that is, they are not simply secondary to a recent spate of newly approved toxic drugs or current imprudent hospital procedures. As reported in a 1998 JAMA article, an extensive meta-analysis of the electronic databases of hospitals from 1966 to 1996 revealed that the incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by prescription medications alone has remained quite stable over the last thirty years. In fact, the authors of this longitudinal study even chose to exclude deaths caused by errors in drug administration to show that there are a large number of serious ADRs even when the drugs are properly prescribed and administered. However, even when these researchers excluded medical errors, unnecessary surgeries, and nosocomial infections, ADRs alone were still estimated to be between the fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death in the United States for the last three decades.\u00b9II 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE ANNUALLY HARMED BY ERRORS IN DRUG ADMINISTRATION A July 2006 study found that 1.5 million people are harmed every year by medication errors, and that at least 7,000 of these individuals are killed annually by these iatrogenic mistakes. This study further revealed that hospitalized patients, on average, are subjected to one medication error every single day.\u00b9 Americans Spend the Most for the Worst Health Care When another alarming statistic is factored in\u2014that although the United States spends billions on health care, out of thirteen countries it ranks an average of twelfth in regard to sixteen health indicators (e.g., neonatal mortality, life expectancy, and so forth)\u2014defending America's current system of health care becomes even more untenable.\u00b2 COUNTRIES RANKED ACCORDING TO QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE The thirteen countries, in order of their average ranking (with first being the best), were Japan, Sweden, Canada, France, Australia, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, the United States, and Germany. In May 2006, stunning new research revealed that even though the United States spends twice as much as England on health care for its citizens, Americans still have higher rates of diabetes, stroke, lung disease, and cancer. Even when the researchers crunched numbers to remove the influence of lifestyle factors such as obesity, Americans were still found to be approximately twice as unhealthy as their British counterparts.\u00b2\u00b9 (And England's healthcare system is considered to be generally inferior to that of its neighbors.) Dr. Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist and coauthor of the study, found that even economic status was not a factor. In fact, the richest third of Americans were shockingly found to be in worse health than the poorest third of the English.\u00b2\u00b2 However, no researchers speculated on the most likely culprit of our spectacularly high morbidity and mortality rates: the United States' strong financial commitment to the allopathic medical and pharmaceutical industry, and this industry's very real and fatal side effects. Thus, prescription drugs and surgery, the primary tools that modern medicine uses to purportedly heal disease, have actually reached the infamous position of being among its top killers\u2014rendering the cure often worse than the disease. M.D.s\u2014 Bought and Paid For The initiation of real change and reform in this seriously flawed state of medical practice has a rather pessimistic prognosis due to the viselike grip pharmaceutical companies maintain over the majority of doctors. For example, in the January 26, 2006, edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), it was reported that the pharmaceutical industry spends approximately 90 percent of its $21 billion annual marketing budget on promotions for doctors (approximately $13,000 per practicing physician annually) in an effort to influence their prescribing behavior.\u00b2\u00b3 And in a related study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004, the authors revealed that the pharmaceutical industry funds the majority of allopathic physicians' continuing medical education programs, accounting for $900 million of the $1 billion spent on this mandatory ongoing training.\u00b2 Additionally, as reported in another JAMA study published in 2005, the pervasive influence pharmaceutical companies wield begins not simply when physicians receive their licenses to practice but in medical school, where drug companies spend an estimated $12 billion annually on weekly promotions and teaching materials. In fact, these researchers found that by their third year, medical students either receive a gift from or go to an event sponsored by a drug company approximately once a week, resulting in an environment with progressively fewer boundaries between medicine and the pharmaceutical industry.\u00b2 And perhaps even more disturbing, when the American Medical Association attempted in 2002 to educate physicians about the ethical guidelines governing gifts from drug companies, $645,000 of their $695,000 education budget was funded by none other than the drug companies themselves.\u00b2 Thus, not only has our present bought and paid for medical system failed to provide the promised cures for serious disease, but it has increasingly come under the pervasive influence of profit-motivated pharmaceutical drug companies.\u00b2 And since prescription drug sales are the fastest-growing portion of healthcare costs\u2014increasing at a rate of approximately 12 percent per year\u2014the number of iatrogenic deaths can only be expected to rise.\u00b2III It should be noted that there are many allopathic physicians and scientists who are truly caring, dedicated, and working hard to find real answers behind this modern epidemic of chronic and degenerative disease. But it is time\u2014in fact, it is past time\u2014for these physicians and scientists, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, government agencies, and the general public, to stop and take a hard and unbiased look at these frightening statistics that reveal the very serious level of dysfunction in the United States' current healthcare practices. HOLISTIC MEDICINE\u2014 PRESENTLY INSUFFICIENT Clearly, allopathic Western medicine is an ailing system, and in light of its alarming iatrogenic statistics and dangerous treatments, it is hard to imagine how it could ever be a viable solution to our current healthcare crisis. But many may ask if holistic medicine is truly the answer, and if it is a viable alternative in the treatment of serious disease. It certainly seemed to be in former times. From the 1700s through the early 1900s, famous natural healers, such as Vincenz Priessnitz and Sebastian Kneipp of Europe and Benedict Lust and Henry Lindlahr in America, claimed seemingly miraculous cures for asthma, rheumatism, tuberculosis, and even smallpox and syphilis.\u00b2 Perhaps even more astonishing is how these men facilitated these cures purely through natural methods, such as hot and cold hydrotherapy (water treatments), heliotherapy (sunbathing), herbs, fresh air, rest, and simple whole foods.\u00b3 These nature cures sound quite remarkable\u2014and even highly improbable\u2014today. And, in actuality, the doubt that arises in most readers' minds is not only understandable but, for the most part, quite valid in regard to this issue. In the majority of cases, these natural measures truly are no longer effective enough to treat modern-day diseases or dysfunction. So what has changed? No one would argue against the fact that the world certainly has, but few are aware of the major effect modern toxins have wrought on our bodies. Although the modern industrialized world has afforded us good sanitation and freedom from much of the drudgery of the past, it has also brought with it air and water pollution, chemical preservatives in our foods, and toxic metals that poison the earth as well as our bodies. In addition to these external stressors, we suffer the liability of inherited genetic weakness that these pollutants caused in our forefathers and foremothers. Put simply, we're just no longer the sturdy stock that most of our grandparents (or great-grandparents, depending on your age) were. We currently suffer from the double violation of both a weakened genetic inheritance from our twentieth-century-born parents and the toxic medical, dental, and environmental assaults we are subjected to during our formative immune-system-building years. Ask any older chiropractor who used to heal a child's ear infection with only one cervical (neck) adjustment or any retired naturopath who remembers curing menstrual cramps through a few hydrotherapy sessions: patients simply do not respond as they used to. Because of this modern-day double whammy of nature (genetic weakness) and nurture (environmental toxicity), general holistic health guidelines are simply no longer efficacious. Add to this the fact that too many patients present to the holistic physician's doorstep only after their immune systems have been ravaged by medications with two pages of side effects written in fine print, chemotherapy, radiation, or aggressive surgeries and the prognosis becomes exceptionally grave. Clearly, stronger intervention is needed. RADICAL MEDICINE'S ANSWER In addition to the natural therapies of diet, exercise, and rest that have been generally prescribed for the sick, both currently and in previous centuries, it is essential to further facilitate healing in modern-day patients, who typically present with complex issues and multiple toxic insults. To do this you must first be a good detective. In order to truly effect a cure, it is imperative that the holistic practitioner initially ascertains a correct diagnosis, and through that understanding then prescribes an appropriate therapy. That is, just as in quality psychological work, only when you know where you've been can you see a clear direction of where you need to go. It is the same way in medicine. The true cause of a patient's disease or dysfunction is always paramount, and when it is revealed through a thorough history, exam, and necessary laboratory work, this well-considered diagnosis both signals and shapes the appropriate treatment, or treatments, needed. Thus, a practitioner must always endeavor to go to the root of the problem to fully utilize the knowledge and master the methods of treatment that are conveyed in Radical Medicine. In fact, as described earlier, the term radical for this field of holistic medicine was chosen not for its common connotation of unorthodox or extreme but for its original denotation as that which goes to the root or origin and that which is \"fundamental, far-reaching, and thorough.\"\u00b3\u00b9 Holistic Diagnoses: Getting to the True Roots of Disease The term diagnosis derives from a Greek word that literally means to see through in order to arrive at a superior level of knowledge or understanding.\u00b3\u00b2 Thus, a true diagnosis, according to the earliest Greek origins of the word, requires that the physician see through patients' various signs and symptoms to arrive at such a masterful level of understanding that the actual cause of the disease or dysfunction is clearly evident. For example, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\u2014alternating constipation and diarrhea with intermittent pain\u2014is not a valid diagnosis as Hippocrates and the early Greeks first defined it. However, irritable bowel syndrome secondary to a gluten allergy and an appendix scar interference fieldIV is, in that it sees through the patient's overt bowel symptoms to the underlying deeper causative factors. Furthermore, this more descriptive and holistic diagnosis is much more clarifying and thus often relieving to patients, who in most cases have only received the standard allopathic approach to IBS\u2014that is, stress reduction and suppressive prescription drugs. However, when the true cause of their chronic pain and suffering is known, this knowledge helps transform patients' despair into hope, and also into very real and tangible action to initiate healing. Thus, the more descriptive diagnosis sees through the overt symptoms to guide both the patient and the physician toward the most effective therapies, as well as the possibility of a real cure through treating the cause and not just the effects of disease. DANGEROUS DIAGNOSES Karl Menninger, M.D., the innovative and brilliant psychiatrist who cofounded the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, for the treatment of mental illness, noted that the very word cancer is enough to kill some patients who would not have succumbed (as rapidly) to the malignancy from which they suffer.\u00b3\u00b3 Effective Treatments In many cases, a holistic diagnosis has the additional benefit of clearly indicating a specific treatment, consisting of simply the removal of what the founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, referred to as the obstacles to cure. In Hahnemann's day, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, these obstacles included the excessive use of opium, blood-letting in torrents, and the widespread use of mercury-containing calomel powder.\u00b3 Sadly, two centuries later, this highly toxic metal is still in widespread use by conventional dentists, and it is even approved by the primary dental trade union, the American Dental Association (ADA). Thus, our modern-day obstacles still include mercury; the mercury amalgam fillings in our mouths must be replaced with less toxic alternatives. Another common obstacle to healing is the slow poisoning of our bodies by the toxic chemicals that are unfortunately so pervasive in every aspect of our lives. However, by simply removing these toxic personal care and cleaning products from our homes and workplaces and replacing them with nontoxic alternatives, this chemical load can be considerably lightened. Additionally, chronic dental focal infections such as failed root canals, abscessed teeth, and impacted or incorrectly extracted wisdom teeth can be a major block to healing and frequently the instigator of serious disease. Often these teeth must be sacrificed and removed through appropriate cavitation surgery methods to fully restore health. Other efficacious treatments described in Radical Medicine originated in Europe and are still so esoteric that only a small minority of knowledgeable and holistically oriented practitioners utilize them in their practice. However, their long-lasting and curative effects are so significant that the use of these remedies and techniques in holistic medicine is truly indispensable. These include gemmotherapy remedies from Italy (developed in Belgium in the 1950s) to gently and effectively drain accumulated toxins from organs and tissues, as well as neural therapy from Germany and auriculotherapy from France to treat chronic foci (scar interference fields and dental, sinus, tonsil, and genital focal infections). Another essential therapy that originated from Europe, called constitutional homeopathy, is included in this book because it is the single most effective healing modality that specifically addresses a patient's miasmic, or inherited, susceptibility to disease. Recently updated by the revolutionary contributions of Indian physician Rajan Sankaran and his Mumbai colleagues, constitutional homeopathy is an essential component to every patient's healing protocol. Other important treatments detailed in Radical Medicine include the use of nutritional supplements and homeopathic nosodes (remedies made from diseased tissue that stimulate the body to mobilize its immune defenses against that disease) in the treatment of vaccinosis (disease and dysfunction caused by immunization); functional appliances prescribed by orthopedically oriented dentists in treating temporomandibular (jaw joint) dysfunction (TMD) and malocclusions (bad bites); and quality psychospiritual work to address the self-sabotaging mental and emotional issues inherent in many individuals' early childhood development that can most insidiously generate and continue to maintain chronic illness. These radical treatments not only are of major importance in the cure of many degenerative diseases but also are essential for those individuals who aren't satisfied living with even the minor stress of chronic symptoms. Furthermore, these mild aches and pains, intermittent constipation or diarrhea, too frequent colds and bouts of flu, moderate fatigue, and other relatively functional (versus seriously pathological) health issues always signal some form of underlying disturbance that\u2014without effective intervention\u2014will only continue to escalate as you age. Radical Medicine is therefore written not just for the seriously ill but also for those who consider optimal health and freedom from chronic pain and dysfunction their birthright. It is also written for those who have done everything that each new bestselling diet book and every weekly magazine inserted in the Sunday paper recommends, but who still continue to suffer from chronic and sometimes debilitating symptoms, or even simply an overall lack of well-being. Radical Medicine is also written to educate holistic practitioners so that they can more effectively serve the growing number of patients dissatisfied with conventional allopathic medical care. It is especially targeted toward the doctors and practitioners with integrity and a caring attitude who have been less than satisfied with their treatment results. Through providing the underlying reasons as to why such a great percentage of patients nowadays are so therapy resistant and difficult to heal, I hope that this book will resolve a great deal of confusion for many frustrated healthcare practitioners. Furthermore, Radical Medicine's numerous scientific references should satisfy even the most skeptical physicians and, it is hoped, rekindle the original passion that first influenced their decision to study (holistic or allopathic) medicine. Finally, it is important to point out that addressing and healing all the various chemical, physical, and emotional insults our bodies have suffered in these modern times may not be a quick process; in fact, based on the amount of toxins most of us have been subjected to, it rarely is. For example, the estimated naturopathic time frame for getting well is based on the general formula that it takes one month of treatment for every year an individual has felt unwell. Thus, for a thirty-five-year-old with a mouthful of amalgam fillings who has been tired ever since her first pregnancy at age twenty, it may take around one and a half years after beginning effective treatment to feel consistently energetic every day. For a fifty-year-old who for years was prescribed antibiotics for childhood acne, it may take up to two years to completely clear the resulting intestinal dysbiosis (overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and fungus), repopulate the gut (intestines) with healthy flora, and restore normal immune system functioning. A Journey of Greater Self-Understanding There are benefits, however, to this more lengthy journey of real cure versus the often-advertised quick fixes. This journey can be best understood through the spiritual principle that we are here to learn and evolve, which is just as true for our physical bodies as it is for our souls. This truth was best expressed by the Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran in his masterpiece, The Prophet, as Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.\u00b3 Thus, examining and clearing these physical obstacles that act as both blocks and passageways to our self-understanding and spiritual growth is an important (and some would argue even essential) aspect in our psychospiritual development. Furthermore, the wisdom and strength gained from suffering, as well as the experience of feeling the demonstrable changes that effective treatment makes in our bodies, can instill a profound level of sensitivity and awareness rarely appreciated by those seemingly lucky few who have always enjoyed robust health. In fact, in holistic medicine there is a rather well-known but unwritten law that patients who undergo this physical metamorphosis are much more motivated to seek out advanced emotional and spiritual growth work as their healing progresses. And, fortunately, in contrast to the very numerous aforementioned drawbacks of our modern toxic age, one of the major benefits of living now is that psychological and spiritual healing is more accepted today and much more readily accessible than it was for our parents (or grandparents, depending on your age). Furthermore, these effective psychological therapies and spiritual paths are not just helpful but essential for those evolved individuals who have healed their physical bodies sufficiently enough to clearly feel the pull and attraction of the truly ultimate healing of self-understanding and divine love. And that, of course, is always the most radical medicine of all. self: The word self here refers to the realization of one's divine nature or true self, in contrast to the separate ego. This was expressed in the ancient Indian scriptures called the Upanishads (circa 3000 BCE) as the Atman: There are two selves, the separate ego And the indivisible Atman. When One rises above I and me and mine, The Atman is revealed as one's real Self.\u00b3 NOTES 1. S. Hahnemann, Organon of the Medical Art, ed. W.

PART ONE UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PATTERNS AND INITIATING TREATMENT The four miasms, which detail the four levels of disease individuals can succumb to, are described in the first chapter of this book because they are a valuable aid in both diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostically, understanding these four levels helps practitioners determine the severity of dysfunction their patient is experiencing, which helps them estimate the length of treatment that may be needed in each case. Knowledge of the four miasms additionally helps practitioners more accurately prescribe the remedies that most specifically match the symptoms and the level of dysfunction of the patient's particular illness. Incorporating this information into their practice helps practitioners determine an individual's therapeutic progress\u2014or lack of it. Thus, the four-miasm theory serves as an excellent indicator of whether patients are truly getting well and moving in the direction of optimal health, or whether they are making no significant progress\u2014or worse, regressing and exhibiting more serious signs of illness. This centuries-old miasmic knowledge is particularly valuable in exposing symptom suppression (e.g., through prescription drugs) versus true healing and cure (through nonsuppressive natural medicines). Readers of Radical Medicine will benefit from keeping this paradigm in mind, as it will be referenced throughout the book. For example, when individuals are seriously poisoned by mercury amalgam fillings, as described in chapter 3, they can manifest symptoms of the fourth and most debilitating miasm (known as the luetic), ranging from severe insomnia to multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, individuals who have mild to moderate dairy or wheat allergies, as described in chapter 6, often experience symptoms from the second miasmic level (known as the sycotic). However, through simply avoiding this particular food group and taking supportive nutritional and herbal supplementation, this sycotic group can typically fully recover from the effects of this immune system weakness relatively rapidly. Chapter 2 describes how essential it is to effectively excrete toxins from the body, which can be achieved through the European healing system of drainage\u2014 often the first step in many treatment plans. The recommended drainage remedies, termed gemmotherapy, are made from embryonic plant parts, typically young buds, rootlets, and seeds. The advantage of using fresh, embryonic plant parts to make herbal remedies full of detoxifying and regenerative phytochemicals (antimicrobials, essential oils, hormones, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids, and so on) is intuitively obvious. It is even more apparently obvious when you compare these remedies to the typical herbal remedies that are derived from mature, older plants that may have absorbed significant amounts of toxic metals and chemicals during their lifetime and contain older, less vital, and less bioavailable phytoconstituents. In contrast, the use of young embryonic plants bursting with nutrients, growth hormones, and vital energy is clearly superior, and an ideal way to both detoxify and regenerate overburdened and weakened tissues and organs in the body. The basic understanding of miasmic disease tendencies and the practice of drainage provided in part 1 lays the groundwork for the more specific detoxification needs that are discussed in part 2. 1 THE FOUR MIASMIC DISEASE TENDENCIES Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, established the term miasm in homeopathic language in 1828, after twelve years of intensively searching for the underlying cause of chronic disease.\u00b9 In his seminal text, Organon of the Medical Arts, Hahnemann stated: It will help the physician to bring about a cure if he can determine the most probable exciting cause in an acute disease and the most significant phases in the evolution of a chronic, long-lasting disease, enabling him to discover its underlying cause, usually a chronic miasm.\u00b2 MIASM, DIATHESIS, AND REACTION MODE\u2014ALL SYNONYMS Miasm derives from the Greek word miasma, meaning defilement, pollution, or emanations from swampy grounds.\u00b3 Since the term miasm carried with it these obviously negative connotations, other more acceptable terms were later adopted. For example, diathesis, a Greek word meaning arrangement or disposition (referring to an individual's particular constitution), was originated by Jacques Menetrier and is often used by European homeopaths in lieu of the term miasm. Diathesis is also used in modern orthodox medical terminology, but in a slightly different context. Dorland's Medical Dictionary (twenty-sixth edition) defines the word diathesis as a constitution or condition of the body which makes the tissues react in special ways to certain extrinsic stimuli and thus tends to make the person more than usually susceptible to certain diseases. Although this definition clearly shows diathesis to be synonymous with miasm, the term diathesis has become more diluted in everyday medical practice\u2014for example, a spasmodic diathesis (tendency to have muscle spasms), a cystic diathesis (tendency to form cysts), a bilious diathesis (tendency to gallbladder dysfunction), and similar terms are commonly used. Medical dictionaries do not reference the four primary miasms, established in the 1800s, that actually encompass all these various tendencies. Therefore, few medical doctors are aware of this term's specific origins in homeopathic medicine. Another common term employed by European homeopaths is reaction mode, which refers more specifically to how an individual responds to stress based on his or her particular disease susceptibility. Whichever term you find more preferable, however, miasm, diathesis, and reaction mode all denote both the inner predisposition to chronic disease and the susceptibility to succumbing to that disease when under stress. This susceptibility can be inherited from your family or acquired during your lifetime.I It should be noted that the term constitution is not an exact synonym to these three terms because it has both negative and positive connotations. For example, an individual who enjoys good health may be described as having an excellent constitution. In contrast, miasm, reaction mode, and diathesis refer only to the negative predisposition toward illness, dysfunction, and disease. MIASMIC THEORY Hahnemann observed that there were three primary miasms to which his patients could succumb\u2014the psoric, sycotic, and luetic.II These three miasms seemed to relate to diseases that were quite prevalent in Hahnemann's time. The psoric miasm was linked to the skin disease scabies (caused by the scabies itch mite, and characterized by intense itching and eczema), the sycotic miasm was linked to the sexually transmitted disease (STD) gonorrhea, and the luetic miasm diseases\u2014scabies, gonorrhea, and syphilis\u2014were all quite prevalent in the 1800s, which initially inspired Hahnemann to formulate his theory. Although these diseases are rarer nowadays, their influence in our genetic memory is not. That is, even if a man of the early 1800s eliminated his syphilitic chancre (infected sore) with the allopathic treatment of the day, such as a caustic ointment, his treatment did not deeply purge the disease from his system but simply suppressed the obvious visible signs of it on his skin. Even a century later, his great-grandchildren can still harbor a latent syphilitic tendency, or the luetic miasm, in their system. As a result, his weakened progeny can experience luetic-like symptoms, from mild to major insomnia or anxiety or even cancer. It is important to point out that when an individual suffers from these and other symptoms of a particular miasm, he or she will not necessarily have directly inherited or acquired the actual causative microorganism of the disease. For example, the great-grandchildren of the preceding example will not necessarily have inherited or acquired the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which is the causative microorganism in syphilis. The individual simply has a genetic tendency that predisposes him or her to the panoply of disorders that are common to the miasm.III That is, this individual reacts to life's inevitable stressors\u2014be they structural (e.g., a car accident), chemical (e.g., refined sugar), or psychological (e.g., a painful divorce)\u2014with symptoms reflecting his or her particular miasmic tendency. Acquiring Miasms Although each miasm or reaction mode can be inherited genetically from your parents, it can also be acquired during your life. The most common environmental causes of miasms are intoxication (e.g., the injection of toxic metals and pathogenic microbes from a vaccine) and suppression through the action of pharmaceutical drugs (e.g., excessive antibiotics). Additionally, if you are directly exposed to syphilis or gonorrhea through a sexual partner, you can succumb to the effects of the particular miasm and may then, in the absence of appropriate holistic intervention, begin to manifest luetic-like or sycotic-like symptoms for the rest of your life. Furthermore, many homeopaths believe that any of the miasms can be transferred over time between sexual partners, even without any direct evidence of infection through the related causative microorganism. Other Factors Over time, miasmic theory has been added to and amended by other homeopaths, which has led to a broader and more descriptive paradigm. Thus, today, miasms have come to be used to describe a general category of inherited or acquired flaws or weaknesses in a person's constitution that can lead to symptoms similar to, but not always duplicating, the disease pattern upon which Hahnemann originally based his classification system. For example, the miasm of sycosis later came to be associated with symptoms not only due to exposure to gonorrhea but also secondary to the adverse effects of vaccinations. NEBEL IDENTIFIES A FOURTH MAJOR MIASM In 1902 Antoine Nebel, the Swiss physician who originated the concept of drainage (which will be discussed in chapter 2), further chiseled a place for himself in homeopathic history by adding a fourth miasm to Hahnemann's original three-miasm paradigm. Nebel discovered over years of clinical observation that the symptoms of tuberculosis reflected not only the disease state itself but also a specific flaw in a person's constitution causing a range of symptoms he termed tuberculinism. This renowned Lausanne doctor felt that the existing three miasms described by Hahnemann did not encompass the unique aspects embodied in a tuberculinic constitution, and that this particular presentation of disease and dysfunction therefore required a separate diathesis. Over a century later, this fourth miasm is still quite valid in that it appropriately characterizes the profound exhaustion of individuals with depleted immune systems, as exemplified by the pandemic cases of AIDS, chronic fatigue, and autoimmune syndromes worldwide. The tuberculinic miasm has therefore withstood the test of time and is considered by many modern homeopaths as a valid and distinct reaction mode in its own right. With Nebel's final contribution, the four-miasm theory has become the most typical paradigm used to categorize medicines such as homeopathics and drainage remedies, as well as to assess patients' treatment progress over time. HOW MANY MIASMS ARE THERE? In homeopathic circles, whether there are really only three, four, or a multitude of miasms presently existing today is still a hotly debated question. One renowned homeopathic Mumbai school, led by Dr. Rajan Sankaran, teaches that there are at least ten major miasmic disease categories to which a patient may succumb (as described in Dr. Sankaran's An Insight into Plants, volumes 1 and 2). Other homeopathic practitioners argue that new miasms resulting from chronic exposure to and the resulting debilitating effects of X-rays, plutonium, the AIDS virus, excessive antibiotics, and other modern-day toxins should be recognized. However, a twenty- or thirty-miasm classification system makes for an unwieldy and difficult-to-interpret paradigm. Furthermore, the symptoms from these more modern toxins can still fit into the original broad and wide-ranging four-miasm paradigm, thus rendering the demand for a multitude of new categories relatively unnecessary. For example, the symptoms of AIDS correlate quite well with those of the tuberculinic miasm. Therefore, for the purposes of this book, as well as for the ease of tracking patients' progress\u2014or lack of it\u2014in treatment, the four-miasm paradigm is appropriate and quite functional. However, if you are a homeopathic practitioner planning on studying with Dr. Sankaran or one of his colleagues, you will come to realize very soon in his classes that the ten-miasm system is indispensable in this brilliant body of work, and quite essential in ascertaining a patient's correct remedy. (To learn more about the Sankaran system, visit the website of the California Center for Homeopathic Education at www.cchomeopathic.com or the Marin Naturopathic Medicine clinic at www.marinnaturopathicmedicine.com and click on homeopathy.) THE SUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS OF ALLOPATHIC DRUGS AND THE MANIFESTATION OF MIASMS One of the major factors that trigger miasms\u2014these latent flaws and weaknesses in our genetic code\u2014is allopathic suppression, that is, the excessive use of drugs and surgery in conventional medicine to suppress the symptoms of illness or disease. The prescription of numerous toxic and synthetic medications, unnecessary surgery, invasive tests, and other iatrogenic procedures greatly weaken the body's defense mechanisms and can awaken or increase the potency of an individual's inherited miasmic traits. In fact, many homeopaths believe that the injection of live or attenuated (deadened) viruses in vaccinations may be strong enough to actually engraft upon the organism [patient] an acquired miasmic susceptibility that was not even previously part of his or her genetic potential. (See chapter 15 for more about vaccinations.) Suppression is causative in both the formation of environmentally caused miasmic weakness and the triggering of latent inherited miasms. However, it is also important to point out that inherited miasmic weaknesses and their resulting symptoms may never manifest if a person is blessed with a relatively stress-free life. This idyllic state is quite rare, though, especially in these modern times, when prescription drug use has come to be regarded as normal\u2014over 50 percent of Americans are taking at least one medication\u2014and organic foods and natural medicine have been relegated to the secondary status of alternative.\u00b9 Therefore, it is the relatively exceptional and robust human being nowadays who is not significantly affected by the suppressive effects of past or present drug use and other hazards of modern civilization. In fact, the expression of miasmic weakness and disease is currently so widespread that it is quite unusual to meet an adult who is not significantly affected by signs and symptoms of chronic dysfunction (e.g., acne, constipation, headaches, joint pain, frequent colds and bouts of flu, or fatigue) or more debilitating illnesses (e.g., chronic depression or anxiety, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's). Acute Illnesses Are Often Nature's Safety Valve When the use of allopathic drugs suppresses the external expression of disease, natural drainage of the emunctories, or excretory organs, is blocked and the pathology is driven deeper. Although acute skin rashes, diarrhea, fever, coughing, sneezing, or nasal congestion may be mitigated, this short-term gain in symptom relief creates more serious dysfunction down the road, as toxins are internalized and sequestered more profoundly in the body. Thus, many of the external manifestations of illness are actually relief processes and considered by holistic physicians to be nature's provisional safety valve\u2014as much a biological law and necessary process as the elimination of sweat and urine is a physiological process.\u00b9\u00b9 The temporary relief gained from the plethora of anti-type pharmaceutical drugs\u2014antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, and so forth\u2014unfortunately comes at the expense of our more weakened immune systems. Furthermore, these suppressive drugs have caused a great many individuals not only to manifest latent psoric or sycotic dysfunction but also to deteriorate to the level of the two most pathological reaction modes: tuberculinic and luetic. This is especially true when the real cause of the chronic symptoms\u2014for example, mercury toxicity (chapter 3), a dairy allergy (chapters 5 and 6), a tonsil focus (chapter 12), or suppressed grief (chapter 18)\u2014is never diagnosed and therefore never appropriately treated. acute: An acute condition or disease is usually brief in duration and self-limiting, such as a cold, tonsillitis, flu, or bladder infection that comes on suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. GERM THEORY The Curse of Louis Pasteur This title, from the compelling book written by holistic nutritionist Nancy Appleton, dramatically states the pernicious effect that this often-lauded nineteenth-century French physician had on the course of modern medicine. Like the first holistic physician Hippocrates' emphasis on the individual's terrain, miasmic theory asserts that it is the individual's degree of resistance or susceptibility that determines whether he or she will become sick, as well as what type of specific illness uniquely manifests. This is in contradistinction to Pasteur's belief that human blood is pure and sterile but can be contaminated by airborne microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, that precipitate illness.\u00b9\u00b2 This germ theory of disease\u2014a theory very dear to the hearts of pharmaceutical company executives\u2014became the prevalent belief system in medicine primarily due to Pasteur's widespread influence. The germ theory has flourished for three major reasons: it is simple to understand, it frees individuals from having to take responsibility for their health, and it boosted pharmaceutical companies into the multibillion-dollar industry they enjoy today. Dr. Appleton describes the ramifications of this theory in her book: Pasteur's influence with the germ theory was vast. There seemed to be no turning back, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century. Even today, the path seems Pasteurian. We continue to look for magic pills and potions rather than to the individual's lifestyle. From the germ theory came pasteurization (killing the germs, along with many valuable enzymes), and now ultra-pasteurization (which kills all of the enzymes), antibiotics, antiseptics, and vaccines. These scientific advancements are all in pursuit of killing the germ or discovering the right cure for the common cold and other diseases.\u00b9\u00b3 terrain: One's biological terrain, also referred to as soil or earth, is made up of connective tissue cells (fibroblasts), white blood cells (leukocytes), nerve endings, blood vessels, and colloidal substance (the extracellular matrix or ground substance). This matrix or connective tissue mesh or sea is a gel-like substance that surrounds every cell in the body and is the medium in which the external environment communicates with the cells in the body. The ubiquitous matrix system is considered by many holistic physicians to be the body's primary terrain, which reacts to external stimuli, communicates to the cells, and has the ability to adapt and change. (See chapter 9 for more information on the matrix connective tissue.) In contrast to Pasteur's germ theory, two of Pasteur's colleagues, Claude Bernard and Antoine B\u00e9champ, agreed with Hippocrates' original assertion that it is our bodies' internal milieu or terrain that is primarily responsible for the manifestation of chronic disease versus optimal health. Along with the famous American physiologist Walter Cannon, who coined the term homeostasis in the mid-1920s, these holistic pioneers were in agreement that the true initiators of disease were a toxic internal environment resulting from a person's lifestyle and inherited predisposition to disease (miasms)\u2014and not invasive germs.\u00b9 Unfortunately, due in part to Pasteur's tireless self-promotion, ambition and genius for business, and even documented deception, plagiarism, and scientific misconduct in his laboratory research methods and reporting, the more simple-to-grasp presumption of the invading microbe became the prevailing popular theory.\u00b9 Historical medical writer Alan Cantwell summarizes the profound effect that the germ theory of disease has had on the course of modern medicine: My study of B\u00e9champ had shattered the icon of Pasteur. The chemist [Pasteur] made germs respectable and he was a genius at popularizing microbes as a cause of human disease. . . . [H]e also put science on the wrong track. Pasteur's dogma transformed the art and science of medicine into a multibillion dollar biotechnical business in search of a perfect pill and a perfect vaccine to cure man of all his ills. In the process the physicians were blinded.\u00b9 homeostasis: Homeostasis is defined by Dorland's Medical Dictionary (twenty-sixth edition) as a tendency to stability in the normal body states (internal environment) of the organism, achieved by a system of control mechanisms of the nervous, hormonal, metabolic, and other bodily systems. Thus, homeostasis is the state of healthy functioning that occurs when normal maintenance and regulation of the body is properly maintained. It must be stated that germ theory is not completely invalid. If someone sneezes on you, microbes can spread into your system. However, if you have a healthy constitution, you either will not succumb to illness or will have a short-lived cold or flu. But if your immune resistance is lowered and latent miasmic tendencies have become active, then the cold or flu may linger and can even develop into a more serious disease. Thus, holistic practitioners understand that although the microbe and the individual's miasmic susceptibility are both factors in the initiation of disease processes, it is the individual's miasmic susceptibility that has the greater influence. Even Pasteur humbly acknowledged this on his deathbed, admitting, Claude Bernard was right . . . the microbe is nothing, the terrain is everything.\u00b9 The health of your internal terrain can be assessed through a thorough history that should include any significant illness in your parents, grandparents, and other relatives; a review of your present symptoms; a physical examination; and relevant laboratory tests. This data can be used to initially determine your primary active miasm (or miasms) and help your health practitioner choose the appropriate drainage remedies (as well as other treatment) based on that miasmic level (or levels). Your individual and family history may indicate other dormant inherited miasms, but these should not be treated until they become active. For example, you may inherit various miasmic tendencies\u2014some of which the public is well aware of, such as a family predisposition toward breast cancer\u2014but these latent miasms may never manifest in your lifetime. If you have the good fortune not to experience any major life stressors that trigger these dormant tendencies, as well as a strong body as a result of good genes and a healthy lifestyle, then miasmic weaknesses may never become a significant factor in your life. THE CORRELATION OF MIASMS TO THE STAGES OF DISEASE Because of the widespread influence of Pasteur's germ theory, most individuals and even many holistic practitioners have never heard of miasms, diatheses, or reaction modes. The primary reason is that the theory of miasms is not only not espoused by modern orthodox medicine but even considered incorrect and pass\u00e9. This present-day thinking is exemplified by the current definition of miasm in Dorland's cause of diseases . . . before the true cause became known.\u00b9 (The true cause being a germ or microbe.) However, despite the overwhelming influence of germ theory in modern-day medicine, the four-level miasmic paradigm has held up for three centuries in homeopathic circles because it is consistent with the truth\u2014that is, how disease actually develops over time. The four miasms mirror the reality of how illness commonly manifests\u2014from dysfunctional conditions to degenerative disease\u2014in an individual's life. The typical stages in the pathology of disease\u2014that is, the signs and symptoms that arise as chronic illness progresses\u2014were brilliantly outlined in 1952 by Dr. Hans-Heinrich Reckeweg of Germany.\u00b9 His observations and research clearly established that chronic disease was caused by homotoxins\u2014endogenous (produced within the body) or exogenous (externally derived) poisons that impregnate the cells of the connective tissues, organs and brain, as well as the lymphatic and nervous system, causing them to function abnormally and degenerate. Dr. Reckeweg coined the term homotoxicology to describe this gradual poisoning process underlying the development of serious disease. And by careful observation in his clinical practice as well as through laboratory research testing that challenged different tissues with various toxic insults, he found that disease was simply a process that fell into six distinct and progressively more serious stages:\u00b2 All those processes that we call diseases are an expression of biologically appropriate defense mechanisms against exogenous or endogenous homotoxins (excretion, reaction, and deposition phases) or of the attempt on the part of the body to compensate for the homotoxic damage sustained (impregnation, degeneration, and neoplastic phases) so as to stay alive as long as possible.\u00b2\u00b9 endogenous: Endogenous, from the Greek, means to produce or grow from within. Thus, endogenous toxins originate from within the body due to faulty metabolism, incomplete digestion, or long-term inflammation or chronic focal infections. exogenous: Exogenous derives from the Greek word exogennan, meaning to develop or originate outside the organism. Thus, exogenous refers to toxins such as mercury fillings, petroleum chemicals, microbes, and even excess cold, wind, or damp (Chinese medical terms) that affect and infect the body externally. The degree of these exogenous toxins' effects on the system is directly contingent on the particular miasmic level in which the individual is operating. Thus, according to Reckeweg's clinical and laboratory research, the first three stages of disease, known as excretion, reaction, and deposition, are involved with defending against toxins; these stages are quite analogous to the first two reaction modes, in which the body attempts to throw off toxins (psoric) and then attempts to wall them off in deeper tissues (sycotic). Furthermore, Reckeweg's impregnation, degeneration, and neoplastic stages, in which the body valiantly tries to compensate for the noxious effects of the damaged and degenerated tissue, are quite parallel to the adaptive defense mechanisms seen in the "}
