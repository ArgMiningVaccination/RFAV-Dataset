Sencer, MD* and Kara M. Kelly, MD w Key Words: complementary and alternative medicine, children, cancer (J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2006;28:186-189) Over the past decade, we pediatric oncologists, along with most practitioners trained in the Western medical tradition, have struggled with the fact that our patients are using complementary and alternative medi-cine (CAM) at increasing rates. Studies have shown that31% to 84% of children with cancer 1-14and approxi- mately 30% of adults with cancer15will utilize some form of CAM during their treatment regimen. The use of CAMas a social phenomenon has been well documented16and was initially consumer driven, often with physicians as an oppositional force. Increasingly, however, conventionallytrained medical scientists have been designing and conducting research studies evaluating the safety and ecacy of CAM modalities. Pediatric research studies areparticularly important as results from studies in adults cannot always be extrapolated to a pediatric population because of children's unique developmental, social, andmetabolic aspects. This report, and the others in the seriesto follow, will attempt to dene the scope of CAM use in the pediatric oncology population and the issues which ensue from its use, and outline several intriguing researchavenues. The term CAM has become a convenient acronym to describe a broad domain of healing resources thatrefers to those therapies generally falling outside the mainstream of conventional medicine. ''Complementary'' has referred to those methods that augment conventionaltherapies, and ''alternative'' has referred to methods usedinstead of mainstream treatments. CAM therapies for cancer encompass a wide variety of approaches, including touch therapies such as massage, mind-body medicinetechniques such as hypnosis, energy healing, acupuncture, and nutritional and pharmacologic therapies such as herbs and other dietary supplements. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicinedenes CAM therapies in 5 main domains (Table 1, Ref17). The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not always clearly dened, because the list of practices considered CAM changes continually asthose therapies that are proven safe and eective through research, and become accepted as mainstream. The newer term ''integrative oncology'' implies an evolving evidence-based specialty that uses complementary therapies in concert with medical treatment to enhance ecacy, improve symptom control, alleviate patient distress andreduce suering. 18For the purposes of these reports, we will employ the less comprehensive but more commonly used term CAM. The treatment of children with cancer is one of the great medical success stories of the latter half of the 20thcentury. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemiahas gone from a certain death sentence to a disease withan almost 80% cure rate in some subgroups. More thanthree-quarters of all children diagnosed with cancer willnow be cured. 19This is in contradistinction to many adults in whom cancers are now being treated almost as chronic conditions, rather than as curable diseases. Theseremarkable gains have all been through careful, cumula-tive research, primarily under the umbrella of cooperativetrial groups, sponsored by cooperative groups throughoutthe world. The rationale has been that the number ofchildren with cancer is relatively low, and that few singleinstitutions will have sucient numbers to answerimportant questions. A similar approach is important aswe seek to answer questions about CAM use in children.For example, a Complementary Therapies Task Forcewas initiated at the April 1998 Children's Cancer Group(CCG) meeting under the auspices of the Epidemiologyand Cancer Control Strategy Group. The task force wascharged with evaluating the potential role of CCG inconducting research and providing information in therapidly growing eld of complementary medicine. With the merger of CCG and the Pediatric Oncology Group into the Children's Oncology Group (COG), the taskforce has evolved into the Complementary and Alter-native Medicine (CAM) Subcommittee of the CancerControl Committee. The long-term goals of the Commit- tee are to promote scientic investigation of complemen-tary therapies as they relate to childhood cancer and to Copyright r2006 by Lippincott Williams & WilkinsReceived for publication January 27, 2006; accepted January 27, 2006.

The CAM Subcom-mittee's primary goal, however, is to design and execute intervention-based clinical trials to evaluate the ecacy of specic complementary therapies in use by children withcancer. Most of the initial research on CAM in pediatric cancer relied upon surveys to determine prevalence ofCAM use. In 1977, Faw et al 1found that 7.7% of the patients surveyed were using CAM; more recent studies have found much higher gures, between 31% and84%.20Most parents surveyed chose to use CAM for their children to combat side eects of the cancer or the cancer therapy; CAM is rarely used as the primary means to treat the cancer. The most common therapies usedwere prayer and spiritual healing, nutritional supple- ments, vitamins, massage, and mind-body thera- pies.6,7,9,21The inclusion of prayer in CAM surveys is controversial and is felt by some researchers to unfairly inflate estimates of CAM use. Factors associated with CAM use are poor prognosis, prior CAM use by theparent, higher parental education, older age, and religi- osity.7,8,13Of great concern to pediatric oncologists is the fact that only half of the respondents disclose theiruse of CAM to their providers,4,6,9,13and that many children enrolled on cooperative group trials were also using CAM, adding yet another potentially confounding factor to already complicated trial designs.9 Surveys such as the ones referred to above help to identify areas for further research. The current emphasis of the CAM subcommittee in COG is to move awayfrom descriptive studies and toward interventional studies. The majority of studies to date investigating CAM in children with cancer have focused on CAM assupportive care agents and have been limited institutionprojects, with plans to move promising agents or moda- lities to group-wide trials. This is not without its diculties. We have discovered several barriers to mounting large-scale research studies of complementary therapies through COG. There are many dierent types of CAM therapiesin use by children with cancer and very few have been evaluated for safety and ecacy. There is often littlepreexisting literature even in adults with cancer to guide the prioritization of research studies. In addition, rmly held preconceptions by physicians, patients, and com-plementary/alternative medical practitioners about indi- vidual therapies have made the design and execution of studies dicult. Institutional review boards at individualinstitutions have been reluctant to ''take on'' potentially controversial complementary modalities. As CAM has become more accepted throughout the medical commu-nity, these issues have become less problematic. Manyacademic institutions, for instance, now have departments of integrative medicine. 22Nonetheless, the obstacles to designing and implementing CAM studies on a large scaleare instructive. At the end of 2005 there were 2 open COG group- wide CAM trials. ACCL0331 , A Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial to Assess the Ecacy of Traumeel S (IND No. 66649) for the Prevention and Treatment of Mucositis in ChildrenUndergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, opened in April 2004 and is nearing completion. This study was based upon an Israeli pilot study that showedthat the homeopathic medication Traumeel S signicantlyreduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy- induced mucositis in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation. 23The ''gold standard'' of the rando- mized, double blind, placebo controlled study design was a positive factor in the study's acceptance group- wide, but the complex nature of the homeopathic remedy,which contains highly diluted extracts from 14 plants and minerals, was not familiar to most COG members or their institutional review boards. ACCL04C2 , A Randomized Study of Electroacu- puncture Treatment for Delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients with Pediatric Solid Tumors opened in December 2005. This study hadoriginally opened at the National Cancer Institute in 2002, but accrual was slow so COG was asked to participate. There are few studies to date involvingTABLE 1.

Acu- puncture studies are also dicult because they generally involve the use of ''sham'' points, because the mere act ofmanipulation of needles or simply provider attention mayhave therapeutic impact. However, as prolonged delayed nausea is still a clinical challenge, this study has real potential to identify a useful adjunctive agent. Several other studies are in various stages of design throughout the COG structure. The CAM subcommittee is collaborating with other Cancer Control Subcommit-tees such as Nursing and Nutrition to design high-impact studies addressing pressing issues such as fatigue and obesity. The goal is also to work with disease committeesto ask questions that can be included in therapeutic trials as an upfront question, such as the use of milk thistle as a hepatoprotectant in children undergoing treatment foracute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, the possibility ofdeveloping botanical agents with direct anticancer pro- perties such as curcumin is a particularly intriguing area for further research. Many important questions remain to be studied. In particular, the high rate of self-administered use of biologically active adjuvant therapies such as antioxi-dants demands that we design studies that will examine the potential interaction between these agents and commonly used chemotherapy drugs. Certain chemother-apy agents, such as anthracyclines, and radiation bothwork in part by oxidative damage and the use of high doses of antioxidants may work to counteract these eects. On the other hand, antioxidants may have avaluable role in treating certain acute toxicities of conventional therapy. Immunomodulators are another broad category of CAM therapies that purportedly aectthe immune system and include Asian mushrooms and mistletoe. These agents generally increase either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer cells, or increaseendogenous production of cytokines. Whether these actions have in vivo ecacy to ght cancer is not well dened at the current time, but must be further studied.No denitive answer has been found to these vexingquestions, and therefore children on therapy should be discouraged from combining chemotherapy and radiation with high doses of antioxidants, and those with leukemiaor lymphoma or those who have had stem cell transplant should be discouraged from taking immunomodulators. Adverse events have been reported with CAM therapies, especially from contamination of herbal products. Despite these caveats, however, no actual herb-drug interactions resulting in adverse outcomes havebeen reported in humans undergoing cancer treatment.Nonetheless, caution should be employed in recommend- ing biologically active agents. Tremendous strides have been made in the care of children with cancer, and weshould not allow potentially life-saving therapies to be shortchanged in an eort to provide a less toxic, or more ''natural''therapy.Existing research demonstrates benecial roles for some CAM therapies. Mind-body medicine and bioeld therapies may be particularly useful, especially for themanagement of symptoms for which conventional ther- apy is often ineective. Hypnosis and imagery reduced anticipatory nausea and vomiting and pain in childrenwith cancer. 24-27Music therapy may aect a child's emotional state28and immune function.29Body-based therapies such as massage are associated with improve- ments in mood and anxiety.30 Over the year, the Journal of Pediatric Hematology/ Oncology will publish several more reports related to the use of CAM in children with cancer. In particular, CAMuse in children raises unique legal and ethical issues. Michael Cohen will address the legal issues applicable to pediatric oncologists integrating CAM therapies intoclinical care, including licensure of CAM practitioners and malpractice risk. The ecacy of some CAM therapies (and some conventional therapies) cannot be easilyevaluated in the context of randomized double blindplacebo controlled clinical trials. Lillian Sung and Brian Feldman will discuss some novel therapeutic designs that can be used to overcome some of the methodologicdiculties encountered in designing trials of CAM. The major concern among pediatric oncologists is the potential for interactions among biologically basedtherapies and conventional treatments, especially che- motherapy and radiation therapy. The observation that the concomitant use of irinotecan with St John's Wortresults in low levels of irinotecan through induction ofcytochrome P450 CYP3A4 warrants further attention to this issue. 31Although there are many theoretical concerns about the potential pharmacokinetic interactions ofdietary supplements and chemotherapy, limited data exists, especially in children. Sylvain Baruchel will address the risks of dietary supplement interactions. Some CAMtherapies have potential anticancer activity. Steven Melnick will outline new developmental therapeutic avenues with a focus on those agents that may be activein childhood cancer, with specic examples from the Ayurvedic tradition. Many CAM therapies have the potential of improving quality of life. CAM therapies may beconsidered in the management of symptoms of cancer and conventional treatment and for psychologic support associated with the diagnosis of cancer. CAM therapiesmay also be useful for end of life care. Several programs integrate CAM therapies into the conventional care of a child with cancer. Janice Post-White and Elena Ladas willexplore in depth the use of CAM as supportive care modalities. They will also provide educational resources about CAM to guide the clinician as well as parents andpatients. International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) recently published guidelines that called for the health care team to be attentive to complementary therapiesthat may be physically or psychologically harmful to children and their parents but also indicated that the health care team should not automatically andSencer and Kelly J Pediatr Hematol Oncol /C15Volume 28, March 2006 188 Wilkinsdismissively discourage the use of nonharmful comple- mentary therapies.32 Many health care providers working with children with cancer have expressed the need for reputable information resources to help guide discussions on CAM with the patients and families. The goal of thisseries is to serve as a starting point for information on theissues surrounding CAM that will be useful for all those that care for children with cancer.
