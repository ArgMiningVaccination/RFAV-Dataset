It was rewarded in the May 2009 Federal Budget, which allocated the Corporation an additional $165 million over three years, the single largest funding increase since the ABC was incorporated in 1983. The 2009-12 triennial funding agreement is critical to the Corporation's growth and renewal not just over the next three years, but throughout the decade ahead. By 2012, when the agreement concludes, the ABC will be in its 80th year. Board directors were active in communicating the ABC's case to Parliamentary representatives and the ABC's varied constituencies throughout the year. The Government has acknowledged the role played by both the Australia 2020 Summit and the many public submissions made to the discussion paper ABC and SBS: Towards a Digital Future in shaping funding decisions. The ABC is indebted to all those Australians\u2014 audience members, artists, actors and creative industry groups\u2014whose support for the ABC contributed to the historic funding increase. In recognising both the gravity of the economic conditions in which the Budget was framed, and the many competing priorities for Government spending, the Board would like to place on record its appreciation for this significant increase in ABC funding. While the Budget clearly aspired to secure Australia's economic prosperity, the investment of funds in the ABC ensures Australia's civic and cultural prosperity will also be protected. The ABC is ideally positioned to continue its present work and to deliver new benefits to the Australian public as opportunities emerge, and its long contribution to nation-building will continue.Mr Skala was Chairman of Film Australia Limited until its recent merger into Screen Australia, is the immediate past Chairman of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, and was a Director of the Channel 10 Group of Companies and The King Island Company Limited. Between 1985 and 2004, he was a partner of Arnold Bloch Leibler, Solicitors and head of its corporate and commercial practice. Keith Windschuttle Appointed a Director for a five-year term from 14 June 2006. Mr Keith Windschuttle is an historian, author, editor and publisher. He is the editor of Quadrant magazine and the publisher of Macleay Press. He began his career as a journalist and remains a frequent contributor to major Australian and international newspapers, international journals and academic publications. He has written eight books on Australian history, journalism and the media. For 20 years he was a lecturer in Australian history, journalism and social policy at a number of Australian universities. He has also been a visiting and guest lecturer at a number of universities in the United States.Board of Directors continuedCORPORATE REPORT 15SECTION1 A New Television Landscape Television has now been shaping our appreciation of the Australian experience for over 50 years. Without Australian content on television, Australia's unique culture would have been slow to develop, and the culture itself less distinctive than it is today. The ABC has long provided quality Australian television programming that helped reflect and shape Australia's sense of cultural identity. Through ABC2, it has successfully positioned itself in the digital television environment, offering a diversity of content to an increasingly diverse audience. One of the catalytic effects of the additional funding provided in the 2009-12 triennial funding agreement is the ability for the ABC to continue this culturally-significant work by investing further in both drama and children's content. The planned children's channel ABC3, scheduled to launch by December 2009, will help shape a strong sense of Australian identity for the next generation. Dedicated to Australian school-age children, ABC3 will be accessible beyond television, through a range of digital technologies, and will feature social interactivity, games, video and user-generated content online. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (\"ABC Act\") demands that \"the Corporation shall take account of the broadcasting and television services provided by the commercial and public sectors of the Australian broadcasting and television system.\" Due to high production costs, investment in Australian drama is increasingly a challenge for Australia's commercial television services. It represents a greater risk than other forms of content, such as reality television, which is able to deliver similar size audiences at lower cost. In such a market and in these economic times, it increasingly falls to the ABC to ensure that a choice of free, quality Australian content remains open to all Australians.While the range of channels available through digital television will increase, the growth of internet television (IPTV) channels, along with the proposed National Broadband Network, will also see broadband become more widely used to bring television into the home. The ABC is already preparing for the fundamental transformation that will result. Its pioneering iView service, launched in July 2008, is already demonstra- ting the potential of IPTV for Australian audiences. Increased Opportunities for Regional Australia The first stages of the rollout of the National Broadband Network will commence in Tasmania in 2009, with services expected to be available in 2010. Meanwhile, the growing use of broadband continues to bring a new dimension to Australian citizenship and community life. As the ability to contribute content becomes easier and faster, the nature and extent of the ABC's collaboration with its audiences will inevitably increase. Over the past year, the ABC has responded to this growing public interest in creating and sharing content, gradually evolving beyond the public broadcasting model to become a more open public access media organisation. This emerging pattern of media use has effectively established the ABC as a \"town square\", where anyone can participate in the Australian conversation, and where the notion of community is not restricted to where you live. The sense of participation and connection that the ABC has successfully developed with its audiences for many years is being given new life through new technology. $15.3 million of the new funding will be applied to developing Regional Multimedia Centres based on existing ABC regional radio sites. These centres will deliver more locally-focused information, feature more content from audiences and provide online tutorials and tools for staff and the community that will make it easier for audiences to contribute and participate.Statement16 CORPORATE REPORTSafeguarding Trust: Review of ABC Self-Regulation Framework The Corporation has also strived to ensure that the values that have helped build its reputation and brand over the course of three-quarters of a century of Australian life have been safeguarded and preserved. With so many sources of news now available, with varying degrees of reliability, the ability to trust the information provided by the ABC is even more critical. Australians prize the ABC for being a reliable, impartial and honest voice\u2014and their trust is the basis of the Corporation's present and future relevance. The Board is committed to serving that trust and maintaining the integrity of the ABC. In that spirit, the Chairman, Maurice Newman, and Director of Editorial Policies, Paul Chadwick, undertook a review of the ABC's self-regulatory processes. During the course of the review the Director of Editorial Policies consulted widely, both within and outside the ABC. The review was completed by 30 June, with implementation which includes intensive training expected during 2009-10. It will be a valuable contribution to the continuous improvement of the ABC's editorial standards and the ways in which it handles any lapse in those standards. Under the ABC Act, the Board is responsible for ensuring that the Corporation's news and information is accurate and impartial according to recognised standards of objective journalism. To this end, quality assurance projects assessing ABC editorial content were conducted through- out the year. The projects were designed after consultation with academic specialists, similar public media organisations and corporate bodies. In the interests of full transparency, all results were published on the ABC Editorial Policies website.Further, to ensure these projects were as effective as possible, independent reviews of three pilot quality assurance projects were commissioned. The reviews were conducted by Ms Kerry Blackburn, an experienced journalist and Editorial Adviser to the BBC Trust, and by one of Australia's leading media scholars, Professor Rod Tiffin of the Department of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney. Each review revealed potential for improving the methodology, design and execution of the projects and for refinements of the ABC's Editorial Policies . These are also published on the ABC Editorial Policies site. Continually Improving Efficiency The Corporation's argument for additional funding for the next triennium was made more effective by demonstrating that existing funds were being efficiently used to provide the maximum possible benefit to the Australian people. The Production Review, commenced in 2007, generated savings which were used to begin production of News Breakfast , a new three-hour live program on ABC2, in November 2008. In a further initiative aimed at improving efficiency, the Board approved the creation of a new television presentation system, in partnership with WIN TV. The new system will allow the ABC to offer state-specific versions of all of its television services and provide breaking news and emergency coverage into any region around the clock. The new distribution system will generate savings for investment in future ABC television production. The Board also approved the acquisition of a new site to house the ABC's Brisbane operations and staff. The purpose-built accommodation will be in the hub of the city's arts and cultural centre at the South Bank. An environmentally-responsible and sustainable building is scheduled for completion in late 2011.Board Directors' Statement continued \"The ABC is ideally positioned to continue its present work and to deliver new benefits to the Australian public as opportunities CORPORATE REPORT 17SECTION1 Welcome to new Board Members The Board welcomes new Directors Michael Lynch CBE AM and Dr Julianne Schultz AM who were appointed on the recommendation of the Government's new Nominations Panel.

International Broadcasting and International Relations Throughout the year, the ABC continued to represent Australia to the world through the diversity of content on Radio Australia and Australia Network and through the nation-building work commissioned by International Projects. By helping to develop a better understanding of Australia internationally, they have continued to play a strategically-important public diplomacy role throughout the year. Despite increasing fragmentation of international television audiences, Australia Network has grown its audience in key markets such as India. Radio Australia has developed further partnership and rebroadcasting arrangements to ensure its services become even more widely available. Through the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS), ABC International Projects continued to extend its range of grassroots level projects in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and other areas of the Pacific. The creation in November 2008 of the 24-hour Asia Pacific News Centre in Melbourne, which combined the editorial expertise of Radio Australia, Australia Network and their online services, was a significant milestone in strengthening and improving the ABC's international services in an increasingly competitive environment. In October 2008, the ABC celebrated the 35th anniversary of its Beijing bureau. As the only media organisation to have broadcast from China for that length of time, the ABC has been privileged to report the epic changes that have taken place in Chinese society, economy and government over that period. Emergency Services Broadcasting During the year, as the nation's emergency services broadcaster, the ABC was often called upon to provide up-to-the-minute, reliable and sometimes life-saving information. The Board would like to express its gratitude and pay particular tribute to ABC staff for their outstanding work during the Victorian bushfires in February and March 2009. Because the stakes had never been higher, and to get the job done, staff suspended their routines, rearranged their home lives and worked around the clock\u2014the impact of which was then also felt by partners, spouses and children. The Board also therefore thanks those people who stood behind ABC staff. Much was asked, and much was given, and the work was intensely demanding, both physically and emotionally. This was difficult, unprecedented work, from which lessons were learned that will help the ABC continue to improve this vital service, and better fulfil its responsibility as the nation's emergency services broadcaster. The Board has throughout the year maintained an active oversight role across ABC operations and accountabilities, to ensure the ABC performs efficiently and with maximum benefit to the people of Australia as required under Section 8 of the ABC Act.emerge, and its long contribution to nation building will continue.\"18 CORPORATE REPORTThe ABC Board appoints the 12 members of the Council for a period of up to four years.

The major funding increase granted in the 2009 Budget and the accompanying policy statement, Strengthening our National Broadcasters , demonstrates that there is significant support for the ABC as it navigates the challenges of the digital present. The ABC's first task in the coming year will be to deliver to its audiences the new programs and services for which it received additional funding. In December 2009, it will launch ABC3, a dedicated digital television channel and website for older children, with a target of 50% Australian content. It will commission new and diverse drama content to ensure that the number of hours of high-quality, first-release Australian drama on ABC1 increases significantly in each year of the triennium. The Corporation will enhance the multimedia capabilities of its regional radio centres to transform them into broadband hubs delivering rich content created for and with regional and rural communities. The ABC's Continuous News Centre will enable the ABC to expand on its already significant contribution to the diversity of news and current affairs in Australia. The project involves building a dedicated, 24-hour video news capability for online and broadcast delivery. To better meet the needs and expectations of growing online audiences, the Corporation will continue to refine and enhance abc.net.au, including improved way-finding and search tools to create a more responsive site. The Corporation will continue to look for operational efficiencies, including the technological changes flowing from the Production Review. Reflecting the ABC's long history of engagement with Asia and the Pacific, Radio Australia will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its first international broadcasts in December 2009.Having committed to developing a values-based organisational culture in March 2009, the ABC will embed the new ABC Values\u2014Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation\u2014in its policies, strategies and performance frameworks, beginning with its senior management. These values will also be reflected in the ABC's new Corporate Plan, which will be prepared by the ABC Board and Management over the course of the year for introduction on 1 July 2010. The ABC will engage with government on a series of major digital policy milestones and decisions in 2009-10 to ensure that the needs of national broadcasters are adequately taken into account. These include: the launch of digital radio services in the mainland capital cities; the cessation of analog television broadcasts in Mildura and the beginning of the countdown to full digital switch- over; the determination of the size and nature of the \"digital dividend\" that will be realised from the spectrum vacated in that process, a decision that may limit the scope of future broadcasting services; and the regulatory and company arrangements for the National Broadband Network, which will eventually deliver universally- available high-speed broadband. Throughout, the ABC's focus will remain steadfastly on the needs and interests of the Australian community that it serves. Charged with encouraging a sense of national identity and informing the Australian people, the ABC has acquired the status of the \"town square\" in which the national conversation takes place. As both catalyst and host of this conversation, the Corporation will continue to use digital platforms and fast networks to redefine ideas about the nature of community.2010MAGAZINE 25Redefining the town square.\"A remarkable change is taking place at the ABC, as we've been rethinking the idea of the town square. Through digital media, the public broadcaster has been able to revitalise the public space, Australia's town square. Where more and more Australians exchange ideas, listen and learn from one another, and share in the wider experience of Australian life.\" Mark Scott , ABC Managing DirectorFor more than 75 years, the ABC has been bringing Australians together.

Towns with - out a transmitter have held sausage sizzles just to raise the cash to buy one so that they can tune in.

One Night Stand \u2014the free, all-ages concert that visits one lucky regional town each year\u2014is another way triple j helps young people in the far flung corners of Australia feel like they belong. When the One Night Stand circus rolls into town, triple j turns on the full arsenal of its cross-platform media\u2014radio, television and online\u2014to shed light on life there and give locals a voice. triple j presenters hit the road and broadcast live from the town, while report - ers immerse themselves in the local community, filing stories, photographs and weblogs online. Young people learn what is different\u2014and the same\u2014about growing up in regional Australia. \"It is a great thing for staff to go out to regional areas because they come face to face with listeners,\" said Linda Bracken, the then Manager of triple j . \"Presenters like Robbie Buck are from regional towns, they remember what it was like when triple j came to their town. I remem - ber when it came to Newcastle. The connection we have with these kids is really something quite special.\" In 2009, Gippsland hosted One Night Stand and more than 15 000 locals saw some of Australia's top bands. But many more were a part of the action through the radio, television or triple j website.

The site is a vigorous, lively and uninhibited space that brings people together to debate topics as disparate as the latest political hot potato, climate change, religion, fad diets or celebrity misdemeanours. Unleashed was launched just before the 2007 Federal Election. Since then it has become the place where con - sidered opinions on almost any topic are published by leading commentators and debated by the public.

DottyWot and SpottyWot34 MAGAZINETHE ABC'S VAST network of stations meant it was able to deliver essential information directly to those in peril. By switching between metropolitan and regional broadcasting on a number of frequencies, the ABC could address local needs. And because its staff in regional Australia live alongside its listeners, they knew the roads and paddocks, schools and halls they were discussing on air. During both the Queensland floods and the Victorian fires, usual schedules were abandoned when needed as Local Radio provided round-the-clock coverage of the latest news and official advice. ABC NewsRadio took the stories to the nation and to the world through online streaming and our staff on the ground reported for radio, television and online. 774 ABC Melbourne reporter and producer Mary- Jane Fenech was just one of many ABC staff who worked around the clock to provide vital information to listeners during that period. \"There was an urgency in the studios that I had never witnessed in all my time working in radio,\" she said. \"The phones were ringing constantly and mostly from terrified listeners. Some calls that I answered that afternoon I will never forget. They could see smoke. They could see flames.\" Later, she watched as 774 ABC Melbourne Mornings host Jon Faine spoke on-air. He had a map of Victoria covering his desk and beside him an Incident Controller from the Country Fire Authority who used a red pen to mark exactly where the fires were. \"I recall him asking the Incident Controller, with astonishment, 'so the fire that started in Kilmore East, is now in Marysville?'\" On the Tuesday after Black Saturday, Fenech was still reading out urgent warnings. It wasn't until she had to inform listeners that, for a particular road in Churchill, \"it was too late to leave,\" that the emotion of the past four days began to sink in. During the Victorian firestorm, the ABC Bushfire Community website (abc.net.au/emergency/bushfire) provided vital details to those in harm's way\u2014from urgent emergency phone numbers, Country Fire Authority safety messages and fire maps to road clo - sures, the location of emergency relief centres, power outages, community meetings and counselling services. The website soon became a rallying point. In IN THE PAST 12 months the ABC delivered on its role as the nation's emergency broadcaster on a number of fronts across the country. In Victoria and New South Wales, fires peaked on Black Saturday, 7 February, while almost simultaneously much of Queensland was covered in floods. At such times people turn to the ABC for help. It's where Australians come together\u2014to show support and to receive it. Broadcasting through dark times \"mY colleagues were com Passionate , dedicated , ProFessional and committed ,\" she said . \"it was a team eFFort FulFilling the resPonsibilit Y as the emergenc Y serVices broadcaster , that i am so Proud to be a Part oF.\"Support supportMAGAZINE 35commitment to the job IN 2009 , ONE man with a hose stood between the ABC's FM transmitter in Mt Tassie, Victoria and the fire front. Battling burns, smoke inhalation and fall-ing embers, Clem Jarvis kept the facility standing. Later, other dedicated employees from Broadcast Australia\u2014the ABC's transmission service pro - vider\u2014went back in to shore up the site. Ultimately, with no power\u201423km of power lines up the mountain were gone and the Mt Tassie site's emergency generator destroyed\u2014the transmitter had to be shut down. But without Clem and his hose, the damage could have been much worse, and the ABC off-air for months. As it was, Local Radio serv - ice to the area was restored within days. Mark Spurway, Head of Transmission Services, said the ABC's vast network of transmission infra - structure was vulnerable to natural disasters and bad weather, requiring much preparation before, and protection during, an emergency. \"Because of the nature of what they have to do, transmitter facilities are often either surrounded by forests or on top of mountains and hills. They are sometimes hard to access and often in the path of the storm or fire,\" he said. He said the ABC works with emergency agencies to keep track of cyclone and bushfire threats to transmission infrastructure and our transmission service provider Broadcast Australia works with us to prepare these facilities as much as possible in times of natural disaster. The ABC's transmitters are positioned so that most of Australia's populated areas are covered by overlapping signals. So when power is lost or equip - ment damaged and the ABC is off-air, many regions can take the ABC Radio or Television signals from an alternative transmitter site. addition to continuing news updates, ABC Bushfire Community was a place to send messages of condo - lence, for fire victims to blog their experience and for people in these shattered communities to come together. It was a meeting place, in areas where most physical evidence of community was in short supply. The ABC's audience took advantage of a suite of new communication tools, with users posting updates and requests for information via Twitter, and others communicating further warnings via SMS. The \"@774melbourne\" Twitter account was a valuable source of information for both people on the ground and those outside the fire affected regions. This account grew from approximately 250 followers to 1 200 in the space of two days and was in the top three re-tweeted accounts in the world over this time. User-generated content showed the extent of the crisis in full colour, with ABC contributors posting photographs and videos, from the heart-rending \"View out our kitchen window,\" to the helpful\u2014showing roads cut off by flames or smoke. The online coverage was also important in helping Australians who were far from home to keep in touch. They listened to ABC broadcasts online and watched events unfold on the internet, telling us how important it was to stay connected: \"Listening hard on ABC from the UK.

On ABC1, the program achieved a five-city average audience of one million viewers 32, while on ABC Online, in the week of broadcast, there were 122 000 views of the episode on ABC iView 33, a then record high for a program. Audience response to ABC news and current affairs online continues to be strong. In the first six months of 2009, 2.4 million ABC News and Current Affairs programs were downloaded with AM, PM and The World Today among the most popular.34 In 2008-09, ABC news and current affairs online, achieved an average monthly reach of 1.1 million, up by 6% on the previous year. Reach peaked at 1.4 million in the month of February 2009.35 On ABC1, the five-city average for the 7pm News decreased compared to 2007-08 on both weeknights and weekends. The weeknight 7pm News was down by 5%, with an average audience of 1 million, Saturday 7pm News was down by 9% at 902 000, and Sunday 7pm News was down by 8% at 978 000.Consistent performers among the flagship current affairs programs were: Lateline Business , with an average audience of 156 000 (up 20% on the previous year); Insiders , with an average audience of 199 000 (up 9%); Australian Story , with an average audience of 932 000 (up 3%); and The 7.30 Report with an average audience of 860 000 (up 1%). Compared to 2007-08, audiences for Four Corners were down slightly, by 2%, to an average of 817 000 and for Foreign Correspondent were down 3% to 522 000. Since moving to its new 8 pm timeslot, Foreign Correspondent 's audience is averaging 674 000, up 42% compared to its average audience in the 9.30 pm slot (474 000). 36 ABC Radio continued to attract and retain substantial audiences for news and current affairs programs. The 7.45 am News on ABC Local Radio achieved a five-city average weekly reach of 1.1 million listeners (up 8% on the previous year). The combined weekly reach for Early AM on ABC Local Radio and AM on ABC Radio National and ABC Local Radio was 1.41 million listeners, up 9% on the previous year. 37 32 OzTAM data May 2009. 33 WebTrends, OnDemand, May 2009. 34 WebTrends Analytics, downloads of MP3 files, from January - June 2009. 35 Nielsen Online, Home and Work Panel, ABC Custom Reports 2008\u201409. 36 OzTAM data, 2007-08 and 2008-09, five-city metro. 37 Nielsen, five metropolitan cities, 2007-08 and 2008-09.46 OVERVIEWRadio The majority of Australians continue to describe the quality of programming on ABC Radio as \"good\" with year-on-year results up from 65% in 2008 to 69% in 2009. In terms of the amount of programming people like to listen to, again the majority, 62%, believe that ABC Radio does a \"good job\" on this dimension. In terms of this dimension, overall, there has been no change in community attitude compared to 2008. The improvement in community perceptions about the quality of ABC Radio has been driven largely by the segment of audience classified as Appreciation Survey In June 2009, the ABC commissioned Newspoll to conduct the 10th annual ABC Appreciation Survey. These surveys provide an overview of community attitudes towards the ABC. They allow the Corporation to assess the value placed on its services by the Australian public and the delivery of its Charter obligations. Newspoll conducted similar surveys in 1998 and 1999, and annually from 2002. The 2009 research was conducted by telephone and derived from a national sample of 1 900 people aged 14 years and over. Overall, the 2009 survey results show the community's view of the ABC has remained consistent over time. Nine-in-ten (89%) Australians continue to believe the ABC provides a valuable service to the community and half (50%) believe it provides a \"very valuable\" service. A generally positive view about the ABC is shared by men and women, all age groups and both city and country/regional residents. In terms of year-on-year changes in perception, there was a small increase in the proportion of females believing the ABC does not provide a valuable service, up from 4% to 7%. There was an increase in the proportion of 25-34 year olds believing that the ABC is very valuable, up from 48% to 59%. Over the longer time frame of the past two years, the proportion of 18-24 year olds who regard the ABC and its services as very valuable has been lower than in the previous two years.ABC Audiences continued 100 89 88 90 90 47 4789 50 50 50% 80 6040 20 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Valuable Very ValuableOverall V alue of the ABC Based on the total sample aged 14 years and over . \"Don't Know\" and \"Not Valuable\" responses are not ABC Appreciation Survey 2009.63 63 64 6558 5653 54 8 7 7 8 30 32 31 3322 22 22 21 13 14 11 12 2 2 269 921 2 1 13 13 13 1353 3312 12 604020020406080100ABC Radio Commercial Radio 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Good Very GoodTotal P oor Very Poor Statistically significant changeBased on the total sample aged 14 years and over . \"Don't Know\" responses are not displayed.

Radio-Quality of ProgrammingGood%Poor OVERVIEW 47SECTION2 non-listeners.38 This implies that the improved perceptions relate to some occasional usage of ABC Radio, or something positive these people have seen or heard about ABC Radio. Analysis by geography reveals that the improvement was most pronounced in Victoria and Queensland. Newspoll posits that these improved perceptions may relate to positive reports about ABC Radio's role in covering this year's fire and flood disasters in these states and/or, increased listening during a particular period because of these same events. 38 While the non ABC Radio listeners segment includes those who never listen to ABC Radio, it would also include some people who do listen, but comparatively infrequently.Paul Petran, Presenter of Radio National's Music Deli, wraps up the \"Under an Eastern Moon\" concert produced by the ABC with Multicultural Arts Victoria in June 2009; The audience joins in at the ABC Community Concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne; Lal Skipworth and Lil Baker at the Esperance Museum, WA, play and yodel their \"Skylab song\" at a special Outside Broadcast marking the 30th anniversary of Skylab.48 OVERVIEWOver a longer period of time, improvements in community perceptions about the quality of ABC Radio were recorded among those aged 18-24 up from 58% in 2007 to 70% in 2009. On this same dimension, perceptions about ABC Radio improved among those living in the five major mainland capital cities and those living in country and regional Australia. The proportion of capital city dwellers believing ABC Radio does a good job in terms of the quality of programming rose from 60% in 2006 to 66% in 2009, while over the same period the proportion of country and regional residents with this view rose from 66% to 73%. Generally, perceptions about ABC Radio and commercial radio are more similar than perceptions about ABC Television and commercial television. This similarity is borne of the more diverse and fragmented radio market. On the measures of quality and amount of programming people like to listen to, commercial radio attracts a higher level of negative sentiment than ABC Radio.Television Consistent with previous surveys, the majority of Australians (82%) believe that ABC Television provides quality programming and 70% believe it does a \"good job\" in terms of the number of programs it provides that they personally like to watch. These attitudes remain far more favourable for the ABC than for commercial television. Compared to the previous year there have been no overall changes in attitudes towards ABC Television. Perceptions about the quality of ABC Television continue to be fairly uniform across demographic groups and year-on-year there were no changes in attitudes in any segment. Over a longer timeframe the overall level of positive sentiment among the 25-34 year old age group (85%) is up compared with 2006 (77%), while the small proportion of those aged 50 and over who regard ABC Television as providing poor quality programming was up slightly from 6% in 2006 to 11% in 2009. In terms of the number of programs people like to watch, 70% believe ABC Television does a good job compared with only 48% for commercial television. For ABC Television, year-on-year, there was an increase in the proportion of women who believe that it does a \"very good job\" at providing shows they like to watch, along with an increase in the number of 35-49 year olds who feel it does a \"poor job\" on this dimension, up from 14% to 20%.

Since 2007 there has been a decline in the proportion of \"light\" users.39 ABC viewers who believe ABC Television does a \"good job\" on this dimension is down from 72% in 2007 to 66% in 2009. The survey includes a measure of perceptions about Australian-made television shows. Perceptions on this dimension improved for both the ABC and commercial television, with the view that the ABC is doing a \"good job\" up from 75% in 2008 to 79% in 2009, and commercial television up year-on-year from 62% to 69%. The 2009 survey revealed some other year-on-year improvements in community perceptions about commercial television. For example the proportion of the community believing commercial television provides quality programming rose from 37% to 42%, while the number believing it provides shows they like to watch rose from 44% to 48%. Analysing these results in conjunction with results on perceptions about Australian-made television shows indicates that the improved perceptions about commercial television are likely to be driven by the popularity of a range of new Australian programs on commercial television. 39 To explore attitudes according to people's usage of ABC services, Newspoll segment the sample into heavy, light and non ABC users. The segments are based on respondents' self assessment. A heavy ABC user consumes six or more hours a week of ABC Television (and/or ABC Radio); a light user less than six hours a week; and a non user consumes no ABC Television (or ABC Radio) in a given week.0 500 000 1 000 000 1 500 000 2 000 000 2 500 000 3 000 000Jun-09May-09Apr-09Mar-09Feb-09Jan-09Dec-08Nov-08Oct-08Sep-08Aug-08Jul-08Jun-09May-09Apr-09Mar-09Feb-09Jan-09Dec-08Nov-08Oct-08Sep-08Aug-08Jul-08Jun-09May-09Apr-09Mar-09Feb-09Jan-09Dec-08Nov-08Oct-08Sep-08Aug-08Jul-08Jun-09May-09Apr-09Mar-09Feb-09Jan-09Dec-08Nov-08Oct-08Sep-08Aug-08Jul-08ABC Online Monthly Audience Reach 2008-09, Major Websites Source: Nielsen Online, AU-Monthly-Home and W ork P anelABC Online ABC News & Current Affairs W ebsites ABC T elevision Websites ABC Radio Online 50 OVERVIEW02 000 0004 000 0006 000 0008 000 00010 000 000 Jun May Apr Mar Feb Jan Dec Nov Oct Sep Aug Jul05 000 00010 000 00015 000 00020 000 00025 000 Visitors and Visits Audiences continuedOVERVIEW 51SECTION2 survey results show that the website contributes to the consumption of other ABC content and that the site extends the life of ABC content in a variety of ways. There was strong growth in the usage of video content, with the proportion of users stating they had used video in the past three months up from 41% last year to 48% this year and the number downloading ABC Television programs up from 10% last year to 18%. Listening to ABC Radio remained popular, with 39% of ABC Online users having listened in the past three months. Other activities engaging audiences on ABC Online included usage of the following in the past three months: playing games either by themselves or with others (21%); participating in a forum or posting comments (8%); and a small number had uploaded photos, video or music to ABC Online (1%). Coverage of Country News and Information Community perceptions about coverage of country news and information continue to be far more favourable for the ABC than for commercial media. This remains apparent among people in the capital cities and people living in country and regional areas. The vast majority of Australians (83%, up from 80% last year) believe the ABC does a \"good job\" covering country and regional issues, compared with 48% for commercial media.Online The proportion of the community \"ever using\" ABC Online increased this year to 31% compared to 25% in 2008. The growth reflects increased use of the site among occasional users. Year-on-year there was no change in the proportion who use the site more regularly (at least once a week), though over a longer time frame, there has been gradual growth in the number of regular users. Consistent with previous results nine-in-ten (89%) believe the quality of content on ABC Online is \"good\" while the same proportion say the website does a \"good job\" in terms of the amount of content it provides on things they use it for.

Compared with the 2008 results, there were several small positive shifts of two to three percentage points in a number of areas. In a few cases these represent statistically significant improvements on the 2008 results, specifically: broadcasting programs that are different from commercial media, up from 89% to 92%; having a good balance between broadcasting programs of wide appeal, and broadcasting programs that appeal to people with special interests, up from 83% to 86%; and broadcasting programs that reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community, up from 80% to 83%. Compared with the 2007 results, there were two areas where statistically significant improvements were recorded: being balanced and even-handed when reporting news and current affairs, up from 79% to 83%; and broadcasting programs of an educational nature, up from 85% to 88%. 40 ABC users, for this analysis, are defined as those who say they use ABC Television, ABC Radio or ABC Online as a source of news and current affairs at least once a fortnight.ABC Audiences continuedOVERVIEW 53SECTION2 ABC Online and Other Platforms ABC Online, providing nearly five million pages including content available via streaming, podcasting, vodcasting, video-on-demand and content uniquely-designed for broadband delivery.

Tokyo Beijing AucklandBangkok Jakarta Port Moresby WashingtonNew York 56 OVERVIEWFOR OVER 75 YEARS, the ABC has been part of local communities across Australia. As the national public broadcaster, not bound by a need for profitability, the ABC is able to deliver dedicated services to all areas. The presence of the ABC in 51 regional and nine metropolitan centres gives the ABC the unique ability to engage with local communities, not only through content and programming, but through ABC staff who live and work in those communities. ABC broadcasting, online and mobile services are unique in their extensive reach to both communities of interest and to geographic communities, throughout Australia and internationally.Emergency Broadcasting Floods, fires, cyclones and storms directly affected a significant number of Australians in 2008-09 and the devastating impacts were seen and felt by many more. The ABC worked closely with emergency services to provide essential information and support to local communities during the Victorian bushfires, which killed 173 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Rolling coverage and emergency broadcasts were mounted by Local Radio stations in Horsham, Bendigo, Wodonga, Sale and Melbourne. The ABC presented a free, family- focused concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on 1 March 2009 to reflect on and celebrate the resilience and remarkable spirit of the Victorian community and to recognise the efforts of emergency service providers and volunteers. In South Australia, program teams in Adelaide, Port Pirie and Port Lincoln provided comprehensive coverage of a major bushfire at Port Lincoln which destroyed a number of commercial buildings and threatened homes over a 15-hour period. ABC Townsville broadcast extended emergency coverage including overnight warnings and local afternoon updates during and following Tropical Cyclone Charlotte, giving out vital information on local flooding and road closures. ABC Cairns also covered Charlotte with hourly weather updates and special extended programming for the Far North, Mt Isa and the rest of the state. ABC in the Community The ABC serves as a \"town square\" for Australians, providing reliable information to encourage a meaningful, national conversation, and creating a forum in which everyone\u2014not just those in public life\u2014can be heard. Playing an important role in the lives of all Australians is a fundamental part of the ABC's mission.OVERVIEW 572SECTION 105.7 ABC Darwin provided vital information to listeners as the first cyclone of the season threatened communities there and in Western Australia and worked closely with Local Radio in Western Australia to ensure warnings for Cyclone Billy reached listeners in Wadeye and communities across East Kimberley. The station also covered flooding in the Barkly region, providing vital updates on the state of the highway connecting Queensland and the Northern Territory which was cut for two-and-a-half weeks. Local Radio stations held Bushfire Awareness Days in November in conjunction with local fire and emergency services organisations to help listeners prepare for the fire season with programs and online features drawing attention to risk minimisation and preventative measures in the lead up to summer. Similarly, Cyclone Emergency Awareness days were held in northern Queensland to help communities prepare for a major event and explore ways to protect themselves in an emergency. ABC Far North radio and online focused on cyclone preparedness with ABC Townsville hosting its inaugural ABC Emergency Expo and ABC Cairns launching Big Picture Day, with Breakfast and Rural programs broadcasting from the Cairns Esplanade with Emergency Management Queensland. ABC Local Radio is partnering the Red Cross by promoting the \"Red Cross Rediplan\" project which encourages people to prepare a written emergency plan. ABC Local Radio is broadcasting information about the initiative and programs are interviewing the Red Cross about this initiative to keep Australians safe. It remains a priority in 2009-10 to continue to develop the ABC's role as emergency broadcaster, taking into account lessons learned and new opportunities identified to improve and make more effective the service provided by the ABC. Connecting with Australian Communities The Corporation supports and participates in local community events, on both a large and small scale. World Youth Day events and surrounding stories were covered across a number of radio networks and ABC News. 702 ABC Sydney Weekends broadcast live from the destination of the pilgrims' walk and evening vigil in Sydney, and shared a field reporter with ABC NewsRadio for the duration of the Pope's visit. Radio National Breakfast covered feature stories and the network's specialist religion programs, The Religion Report and The Spirit of Things , covered a range of events and related issues. triple j 's news and information program, Hack presented a week long \"Belief\" feature looking at the role of faith in the lives of young people.

In July 2008, the inaugural 2008 Marvellous Regional Museum Awards were presented by ABC Radio National in partnership with Museums Australia. The Awards recognise the vital role played by regional museums in the cultural lives of their communities. The 2008 overall prize winner, and winner of the Small Museum category, was the Kodja Place Visitor and Interpretive Centre in Kojonup, Western Australia. In July 2008,1233 ABC Newcastle's Aaron Kearney travelled to Papua New Guinea as part of the Camp Quality Kokoda Challenge 2008 , and walked the gruelling 96 kilometres over seven days, sharing his experiences with listeners via daily live crosses and a series of radio and online packages following the walkers. In August 2008, the South Australian and Victorian Country Hour teams combined to present a major radio and online Outside Broadcast to highlight the crisis facing the lower lakes of the Murray River system. The program was broadcast from Meningie on the shore of the dying Lake Albert and included crosses into Local Radio in Melbourne and stations in Mildura, Bendigo, Shepparton and Wodonga to outline the implications of severe water restrictions and drought for communities along the Murray River. Video, audio, text and images were posted online as the special 90 minute broadcast was aired. In October 2008, 783 ABC Alice Springs supported the Masters Games in Alice Springs, holding a series of Outside Broadcasts from various events. During March 2009, the 720 ABC Perth Breakfast program broadcast from five towns in five days in regional Western Australia. The program met and interviewed dozens of people from all walks of life, showing the incredible diversity of Western Australia. The listeners nominated places to go and people the Breakfast team should meet. The stories captured were broadcast on air from 6 am through to 6 pm across all programs. It was a cross-media event with content on air, online and blogs. In May 2009, marking the famous Ord Valley Muster in Kununurra, the Kimberley Morning team travelled across the top of Western Australia to meet the characters along the way and broadcast live from all of the festivities. A range of innovative broadcasts were conducted by ABC Rural, including a week-long \"surf and turf\" tour between the Great Sandy Desert and the Indian Ocean in Western Australia; a series of outside broadcasts along the Slim Dusty Way in New South Wales; stories looking at medical improvements in remote communities west of ABC in the Community continued Richard Aedy interviewing Margaret Robertson and Robert Sexton at an Outside Broadcast of Life Matters at The Kodja Place Museum, Kojonup, WA; Radio Australia's Adelaine Ng broadcasting from the Phnom Penh Water Festival; Australia Network's Tania Nugent in Vanuatu interviewing 26 Roots, the winners of Radio Australia's Pacific Break music competition; Australia Network launched its new on-air look in Kuala Lumpur in April 2009 by wrapping a local bus in the network's colours, featuring the theme: From our world to yours .127% OVERVIEW 59SECTION2 Katherine; a remote pearl farm in the Northern Territory; and from flooded highways between Queensland and the Northern Territory border. The ABC's presence at a number of community events was highlighted by the attendance of the ABC Exhibition Trailer. The Trailer crossed the continent and attended 18 events including the Alice Springs and Darwin Shows, the Mt Isa Rodeo, Gardening Australia Expos, Adelaide, Perth and Sydney Royal Shows and regional community ABC Events. International communities Through Australia Network and Radio Australia, the ABC is also connecting with the international community in Asia and the Pacific. In July 2008, ABC International's Director, Murray Green led a team from both networks to Pacific Island countries. In the capitals of Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and Samoa, community leaders' briefings were held with local representatives from government, business and Non-Government Organisations. Audience feedback forums were also held in each capital, and Papua New Guinea's second city of Lae. Radio Australia and Australia Network gained invaluable insights into the interests and needs of their Pacific audiences. In November 2008, Radio Australia broadcast from the pan-Pacific music festival, Fest'Napuan, in Vanuatu. The winners of Radio Australia's Pacific Break competition\u2014open to unsigned musicians from across the Pacific Islands\u2014played for the crowd and Radio Australia's listeners across the Pacific. Reggae band 26 Roots (pronounced Two Six Roots), from the remote island of Santo, were already a well-known story in their small community. Eight unemployed youths, using a collection of rough instruments, including a drum kit made from plastic containers and tin-cans, began to forge a rich, home-grown sound. Their community raised funds to help buy the band \"modern\" instruments. 26 Roots won the Pacific Break competition with their original song \"Broken Promises\". In the same month, Radio Australia was broadcasting live on stage over two days from the annual Water Festival in Phnom Penh, on the banks of the Tonle Sap and Mekong River. The Cambodian crowd were treated to a bilingual mix of music, interviews and a karaoke competition hosted by Seda Douglas from the Khmer service and Adelaine Ng from the English service's Breakfast program. Australia Network launched its new on-air look in Kuala Lumpur in April 2009 by wrapping a local bus in the network's colours, featuring the theme: From our world to yours . To mark the bus sponsorship, Australia Network hosted members of the Malaysian media to an Anzac Day Australian Rules Football carnival, organised by the Australian High Commission. Among the activities was an \"Auskick\" Australian Rules football clinic for children. The highlight of the day was the Aussie Rules football competition between the Malaysian Warriors, Singapore Wombats and the Australian Army.0 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 0002008-092007-082006-072005-062004-052003-042002-032001-022000-011999-00 4 2008-09 THE TOTAL number of full-time equivalent staff increased marginally to 4 535 (from 4 499 in 2007-08). The composition of the workforce remained virtually unchanged with a gender balance of 51% men and 49% women, 10.8% of employees from non- English speaking backgrounds, Indigenous employees making up 1.2% and people with a disability representing 8.9% of staff.ABC Values In March 2009, the Corporation introduced a new set of ABC Values that capture what it means to work in the ABC. They act as a filter through which organisational behaviour including behaviour towards other employees and towards the Corporation, and decision-making, is interpreted. The new values were developed after an extensive staff consultation process. A total of 532 staff participated in 55 Focus Groups around Australia. A further 47 wiki entries were recorded. The ABC Values are expressed in the Values Statement above. Information about ABC Values is available on the ABC Values intranet site, which also provides staff with an opportunity to directly email the People and Learning Division with questions or feedback.The ABC is an independent media organisation for all Australians. Our values are the foundation of our work. Integrity We act with trustworthiness, honesty and fairness. We deliver on our commitments and are accountable Respect We treat our audiences and each other with consideration and dignity. We embrace diversity Collegiality We work together willingly. We cooperate and share in the ABC's challenges and successes Innovation We foster creativity and distinctiveness. We encourage new thinking and strive to achieve quality in all that we do.ABC People The ABC relies on the experience, skill and dedication of its workforce in order to make and deliver content to ABC audiences in Australia and overseas.

The purpose of this work is to identify and establish a \"preferred\" workplace culture, which will be visibly represented at all levels of leadership and management. By embedding ABC Values, and promoting constructive leadership behaviours aligned to those values, the ABC aims to build a strong and positive workplace culture in which all staff can do their best. The project is underpinned by a suite of tools and consultancy support from an external provider which specialises in strengthening individual and organisational effectiveness. In May 2009, briefings began for the Organisational Cultural Inventory rollout. The inventory is designed to take a sample of the ABC's leadership culture, overall and divisionally, with a view to redressing any barriers to a more constructive and enabling culture.Building and developing talent In 2008-09, the ABC continued to introduce training and development programs for its staff, focusing on talent management and succession planning. In January 2009, the ABC completed a nine- month, nation-wide process of identifying mission- critical leadership roles, identifying potential successors and building a talent pool to develop the next generation of ABC leaders. People and Learning are working closely with divisions to develop personal development plans for those individuals. The 2009 ABC Managers program is a national, cross-divisional program designed to provide employees with the skills needed to make the transition from working with a team, to managing a team. The six-month program is designed to assist those in their first management role or to provide greater development for existing managers who have not had the opportunity of formal management training. A Diploma of Management is awarded on successful completion through the ABC Registered Training Organisation. For those who occupy, or have the high potential to occupy, a role critical to the ABC's future, a new program was launched in 2008-09. In August 2008, 15 senior ABC managers commenced a two-year Accelerated Leadership Program, conducted by the Accelerated Learning The Annual ABC Leaders Conference is an opportunity for the Managing Director and his senior management to discuss the ABC's strategic priorities.Business Services 7.9% Television 8.1% Technology and Distribution 8.3% ABC Resources 19.9%News 20.1%Radio 21.2%Distribution of ABC Staff by Division 2008-09 * Includes Managing Director's Office, ABC Secretariat, Communications, Corporate Strategy and Marketing, Editorial Policies, Legal and the Office of the Chief Operating Officer .Innovation 1.4% People and Learning 1.5% Corporate Management* 2.6% ABC International 3.2% ABC Commercial 5.7% Distribution of ABC Staff By Region 2008-09 Overseas 0.8% NT 2.9% 47.6% 62 OVERVIEWLaboratory at the University of New South Wales.

The program focuses on personal performance and assists participants develop the skills and flexibility needed to provide effective leadership and management. The ABC is gaining a reputation internationally as a leader in the field of trauma and resilience training. The value of the trauma-awareness program the News Division developed became evident in supporting staff during and after the Victorian bushfires. More than 600 staff from across the ABC have attended awareness sessions and 38 have been trained as peer supporters. The total number of hours of training and development undertaken by ABC staff increased by 40.8%, to 99 484 hours (previously 70 658 hours for 2007-08). This included nationally recognised training through the ABC Registered Training Organisation, which issued 75 full qualifications and 13 statements of attainment, totalling 749 national competencies. Providing opportunities The ABC continued to successfully search for and develop new talent. In 2008-09, the Technology and Distribution Division took on three electronics apprentices in Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart. Three Graduate Technologists commenced work and training activities in Sydney, before undertaking placements ABC People continuedOVERVIEW 63SECTION2 employees, employed by the ABC between 1 January 1994 and 31 July 2007 have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The final report will be presented to the ABC in August 2009. Workplace Giving In June 2009, the ABC Workplace Giving program was launched. ABC Workplace Giving is an opportunity for staff to give to selected charities from their pre-tax salary each fortnight. It effectively replaces a staff-initiative called the \"Care Club\", which operated for 26 years, predominantly in Sydney and with the majority of money going to Sydney-based charities. The Managing Director, senior executives and staff all recognised that there were many benefits in expanding the Care Club to a Workplace Giving Program, to be inclusive of staff in all States and Territories and for charities in local communities to benefit from the generosity of ABC staff. ABC Workplace Giving is a simple and effective way for employees in every State and Territory to further assist and connect with their local communities through giving monetary donations and through offering support of various kinds to registered charities.in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin. Four Women in Engineering (WIE) Scholarships were awarded in the last 12 months. The News Division appointed nine cadets, including one sports news cadet. In 2008, the ABC partnered with IBM and the Reserve Bank of Australia to deliver in-house \"Springboard\" programs for women in Sydney and Melbourne between September and November. These career and personal development programs for women in non-managerial positions were attended by 24 ABC employees. The Andrew Olle Scholarship for 2008-09 was awarded to Oscar McLaren, a bi-media journalist in the ABC's Sydney newsroom. The scholarship, founded by the ABC in 1996 to commemorate the life and work of esteemed journalist and broadcaster, Andrew Olle, provides the opportunity for talented young journalists to develop their skills under the guidance of experienced journalists who are leaders in their field. In March 2009, the Donald McDonald ABC Scholarship to the Reuters Institute of Oxford was awarded to Eleanor Hall, presenter of The World Today on ABC Radio. The Reuters Institute program gives experienced journalists from around the world an opportunity to develop their skills further. Epidemiological Study In 2008-09, the Cancer Council New South Wales concluded its investigation into the incidence of breast cancer in ABC staff and former staff across Australia. The study examined whether ABC Producer Albert Koomen, camera operator Stephen Cavenagh and sound recordist Andrew Boys take a break during a Sunday Arts shoot in Darwin; ABC sound recordist Daniel O'Connor and producer/cameraman Neale Maude in the Arctic circle for Four Corners , \"The Tipping Point\"; The Producers of ABC News Breakfast .214% 64 OVERVIEWIndigenous Culture in the ABC The ABC's Corporate Plan 2007-10 includes a commitment to achieving a target of 2% Indigenous employment. A number of initiatives were under- taken during 2008-09 in pursuit of that target. In July 2008, the People and Learning Division conducted an Indigenous Employment Forum in Ultimo, New South Wales. The forum focused on current Indigenous recruitment and retention models which could be used to increase the ABC's performance in this area. Following the forum, a number of divisions agreed to target Indigenous employment opportunities in their areas. Indigenous Employment Reference Groups have begun to be established in all divisions to identify and act on employment opportunities for current and potential Indigenous employees. In late 2008, the ABC entered into a partnership with the New South Wales Department of Education to provide support for Indigenous secondary-school students in New South Wales to complete their final two years of schooling while undertaking work placements with the ABC. The scheme provides an incentive for young people to complete their schooling, and is also an avenue for students, and their families and communities, to have links with the ABC and foster future employment with the Corporation. The ABC has continued to work towards the development of a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) under the Reconciliation Australia official framework. A RAP is a tool to assist organisations to build positive relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. The ABC is in a consultation phase with divisions, States and Territories and with the Bonner Committee to prepare its RAP , which will be launched in October 2009 at the annual Indigenous Staff Conference. Health and Safety The ABC continues to improve in the management of occupational health and safety (OHS). There was a significant improvement in injury prevention and management in 2008-09, which was reflected in a workers' compensation premium rebate for 2008-09 and a significant decrease in the calculation rate of premiums for 2009-10. 2009 also saw the creation of the OHS Department within the People and Learning Division, and the appointment of an OHS Manager and Injury Prevention and Management Adviser. With a focus on prevention of workplace injury and illness the OHS department has developed a strategic OHS plan to be implemented across the ABC (see also Appendix 12, page 199).ABC People continued Alan Dowler at the viewfinder during Advanced Camera Training for Indigenous camera operators in Darwin; Jonathon Lee capturing sound for ABC News during the Victorian bushfires.OVERVIEW 652SECTION Progress and Achievements Overall, the ABC reduced its gross greenhouse gas emissions by 0.9% from 2007-08 levels. The net effect of the ABC's greenhouse gas emmissions is 49 451 tonnes (using the Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting (OSCAR) conversion methodology).41 The ABC improved its \"green\" performance in a number of areas: Overall energy intensity of all ABC Australian buildings was 858 megajoules per square metre per annum in 2008 and remained at this level in 2009 Overall fleet fuel intensity for the ABC fleet was reduced by 6.5% from 3.75 megajoules per kilometre per annum in 2008 to 3.51 megajoules per kilometre per annum in 2009 Electricity consumption decreased by 2.1% in 2008-09.42 Some of the significant initiatives undertaken in 2008-09 to reduce the ABC's greenhouse emissions and its impact on the environment included: Energy Fluorescent lights were converted from T8 tubes to the more efficient T5 fluorescent tubes at Ultimo, Southbank, Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. Light switches were installed in offices to enable switching that is separate from general office THE ABC HAS pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emmissions to 60% of 1997 levels by 2020 and to 40% of 1997 levels by 2050. The ABC's \"Green Futures\" program commenced in 2006 and involves all staff Australia-wide. Each State has a \"green committee\" that is overseen by a national steering committee. In October 2008, the project employed its first full-time staff member to focus solely on the greening of the Corporation. Initiatives over 2008-09 have focused on building design, maintenance, and encouraging staff to recycle and turn off their computers and lights. The ABC tracks and publishes its progress through the Green At Work website and encourages other businesses to follow suit (abc.net.au/greenatwork/). The site provides tools and information for other organisations and individuals to reduce their own impact on the environment and shares lessons from the ABC's successes and failures in this area. 41 2008 reported emissions of 43 758 tonnes was based on the Energy Data Gathering and Reporting (EDGAR) conversion methodology. 42 Based on 97.5% actual billed consumption and 2.5% forecast consumption pending account receipt.Commitment to a Greener Future The ABC takes its environmental responsibilities seriously and aims to substantially lower its carbon footprint over the coming years. New facilities at ABC Ultimo make commuting easier and safer for bike riders.66 OVERVIEWlighting in Ultimo. Movement sensors have been used to automatically switch off lights in other sites. Similarly, timer switches were installed on office equipment in Ultimo to turn them off overnight and save power. Timers were also installed on televisions and boiling water units to regulate their usage. Variable speed drives were installed on the main refrigeration chillers in the air-conditioning system in Ultimo to reduce electricity demand by up to 70%. The first stage of a project to replace the air-conditioning chiller plant at Southbank with high-efficiency chillers was completed. Recycling The introduction of a co-mingled recycling system in Ultimo resulted in a reduction of waste going to landfill of 30%. Co-mingled recycling is also in place in Southbank, Canberra and Perth. Recycling for media such as CDs, DVDs, VHS, floppy disks and batteries is now in place in Ultimo. The ABC recycled 4 153 items of print consumables (mostly printer cartridges) in 2008-09 saving 3.76 tonnes of waste going to landfill. Travel and transport The ABC reduced the total number of kilometres flown by its staff for work purposes by 18% from 33.9 million kms in 2007-08 to 28.4 million kms in 2008-09. This in part reflects the installation of video conferencing facilities in all capital cities. The number of video conferencing facilities at both Ultimo and Southbank has doubled. Further, video conferencing over the internet has also been introduced on individual computers to facilitate face-to-face meetings between staff in different locations.Substantial improvements have been made across the ABC fleet including the purchasing of hybrid vehicles and carbon offsets for fleet emissions. The fleet itself decreased by 75 vehicles. In May 2009, bicycle facilities in Ultimo were upgraded to provide better facilities and security for bicycle riders. Two bicycle cages were installed as well as an air-pump, work-bench and drying- rack. Bicycle storage facilities in Sale, Victoria have also been upgraded for both security and safety. Facility upgrades in other areas are being explored. The ABC runs a Ride Share site on its intranet. Staff can use the site to organise a car-pool or to find a \"bike buddy\". Deliveries by suppliers of office products to ABC Sydney and Melbourne sites have been changed from daily to twice-weekly to reduce carbon emissions. Paper use On average, 40% of the paper used by the ABC over the last 12 months was recycled paper. Most of this paper is 80-100% recycled from post- consumer waste. Double-sided printing has been set as the default print on all ABC printers. The ABC is automating a significant number of its processes, resulting in a reduction in the amount of paper being used. Staff Australia-wide now have the option of switching from paper payslips to email payslips. Paper payslips will be phased out in 2010. A move to paperless forms for employment-related activities should be completed in 2010. An average of 3 600 Remittance Advices and 1 500 Purchase Orders are now being emailed to vendors every month instead of being faxed. 92% of Travel Allowance forms are now approved electronically and processed by email, saving nearly 2 000 pieces of paper each month. Commitment to a Greener Future continued Green initiatives introduced by the ABC include reducing fleet size, installing solar panels, separate switches for office lights, duplex printing and shower monitors.2 OVERVIEW 67SECTION Water Water-efficient shower heads have been fitted at various sites Australia-wide. Twelve rainwater harvesting tanks have been installed around the country with a total collection capacity of 152 kl. Other initiatives In conjunction with the Edible Gardening project, community garden projects have been started at all capital-city sites. Environmentally-friendly products are used in the wardrobe and make-up department at Ultimo to clean clothes, props, make-up and stage set-up including paints and cleaners. The ABC participated in a number of events, including Earth Hour on 28 March 2009 and the 37th annual World Environment Day on 5 June 2009. Green at Work Website The Green at Work website (abc.net.au/ greenatwork/) details the actions, successes and failures of the ABC's own \"greening\" process and helps other organisations to green their workplaces by providing advice, tools and support online. Green at Work is a publicly-available website for everyone, including small businesses and corporations. It is designed to be an informative and a straight-talking guide to going green at work. The site offers a range of educational material about steps that can be taken to reduce the carbon footprint of local workplaces. It also carries substantial information on the energy and water usage of individual ABC sites over the past three years and tracks the ABC's progress in meeting its established targets.Future Steps The ABC's Green Futures program is ongoing and aims to keep improving the ABC's environmental performance. The program is supported nationally and State and Territory-based \"green committees\" operate to encourage staff to change their attitudes and behaviour that will lead to improved environmental performance and to enable all staff to contribute to energy savings and improve environmental performance. Work continues in relation to other opportunities including: Continued efforts to identify and implement \"property-based\" green initiatives Building a five-star green building at the ABC's new Brisbane headquarters Use of hybrid vehicles or vehicles with a Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating of greater than 10.5 Working with suppliers to increase the use of environmentally-friendly products and services A continued effort to reduce both domestic and international air travel Encouraging staff to consider the environmental effects of their work choices Reaching out to regional ABC centres to include all levels of the ABC in its greening efforts.68 OVERVIEWTHROUGHOUT 2008-09, the ABC gave particular attention to editorial quality assurance, self-regulation and establishing a set of corporate values as the basis for the transition to a values-based organisational culture (see ABC People, page 60). ABC corporate objectives, strategies, policies and activities derive from the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (\"ABC Act\"). In particular, Section 6 of the Act\u2014the ABC Charter\u2014outlines the functions of the Corporation; and Section 8 lays out the duties of the Board (see page 251). The Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability.Strategy Setting The Australian media are in a state of transition from a linear broadcasting world with few channels on scarce spectrum to a complex, multi-channel, multi-platform, digital world offering audiences a nearly limitless array of content. The ABC thus finds itself operating across two worlds: delivering traditional radio and television broadcasts to continuing strong audiences, while at the same time allocating resources to developing new services that meet the needs and expectations of the growing numbers of Australians who are using digital platforms and services. Faced with these challenges, the Corporation has adopted a strategy for meeting its Charter obligations over the next five-to-ten years and maximising the public benefits it delivers to the Australian people that consists of: Fully embracing digital platforms More channels for diverse Australian content Creating a platform for Australian creativity Being the \"town square\" that hosts the national conversation Delivering the best possible news and information across all platforms Providing a voice in and for regional Australia and Engaging with Asia and the Pacific with relevant and authoritative content. This strategy extends the long-term vision for public broadcasting articulated by the Corporation in the paper The ABC in the Digital Age\u2014Towards 2020 , which was prepared for the April 2008 Australia 2020 Summit. It also informed the Corporation's Triennial Funding Submission 2009-12 , which was presented to the Government in October 2008. The submission sought support for a range of initiatives consistent with the ABC's strategic directions. The Corporation received additional funding for several of these initiatives in the May 2009 Federal Budget. On 15-16 June 2009, the ABC Board and Management held an off-site planning event to consider the Budget outcome and set the Corporation's directions for the coming year and the 2009-12 triennium. The event was highly successful and will now be held annually.Corporate Governance The ABC Board and management apply a corporate governance framework that aims to balance the ABC's performance as a creative media organisation, on the one hand, and its need to comply with the formal obligations of a statutory corporation on the other. 2 OVERVIEW 69SECTION Board Governance The ABC Board held seven meetings during 2008-09. Throughout much of the reporting period, the Corporation awaited the replacement of two Directors who completed their terms in the first half of 2008. This did not impede the Board's ability to perform its governance functions. The remaining six Directors, including the Managing Director, tended to deal with specific matters as a full Board rather than delegate them to committees. As a consequence, Board committees met less frequently. In March 2009, Mr Michael Lynch CBE AM and Dr Julianne Schultz AM were appointed to the Board for five-year terms. The Audit and Risk Committee met on five occasions. The Editorial Policies Committee and the Human Resources Committee did not meet during 2008-09, as all pertinent matters were dealt with by the full Board. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendices 4 and 5 (page 192). Management Processes The Managing Director chairs a monthly meeting of the Executive Leadership Group, comprising divisional Directors and the Directors of specialist support units reporting to him. This group also convenes briefly each Monday morning. The Content Leadership Group meets monthly to focus on content development issues, including cross-platform opportunities, audience trends and branding. The Chief Operating Officer chairs the third monthly forum, the Operations Support Group, made up of operations support divisions such as ABC Resources, Technology and Distribution, Business Services, People and Learning and Corporate Strategy and Marketing.Planning and Performance Reporting Part IVA of the ABC Act requires the Board to prepare corporate plans. The ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 sets out Objectives and Key Directions for the Corporation. Performance reporting against the Corporate Plan occurs at three levels: Overall effectiveness of the Corporation in delivering public benefit to the Australian community\u2014measured through the results of the annual Newspoll community appreciation survey (see page 46) Key Result Areas in relation to each of the four high-level corporate objectives laid out in the Plan\u2014specific performance measures intended to highlight the most relevant factors of success (see page 121) Actions and Targets\u2014the achievement or non- achievement of specific initiatives intended to improve the ABC's performance (see page 127). During 2009-10, the Board will prepare a Corporate Plan for the period 2010-13. Production Review In 2007, the ABC engaged the Boston Consulting Group to review its production activities and advise on the most efficient and effective production model and the appropriate balance between internal and external production. The consultants' final report proposed a number of initiatives to improve the efficiency of television production. In March 2008, following detailed evaluation of these proposals, the Managing Director announced the first three of a series of initiatives that the ABC intended to pursue. In 2008-09, the Corporation continued to implement initiatives arising from the Production Review, including: the formation of a new division, ABC Resources, from the previous Production Resources and Resource Hire areas; a transfer pricing system to allow transparent assessment of the costs of internal production; the nationwide replacement of ageing television news studio technology with a more efficient, automated studio system; desktop editing of television news stories by journalists and the centralisation of graphics production for television news programs.70 OVERVIEWThe implementation of the Production Review program is overseen by a Steering Committee chaired by the Managing Director and comprising representatives of relevant divisions. Work on the initiatives by divisional project teams is coordinated by Corporate Strategy and Marketing. Risk Management The ABC's Business Continuity program operates within the Corporation's broader governance and risk management framework to enhance emergency coordination, crisis management and business continuity planning and processes. During 2008-09, business-specific recovery and continuity plans and processes were developed across all ABC metropolitan sites and key broadcasting operations were targeted to ensure consistent readiness, response and recovery activities in the event of a major business interruption. As a result, the Corporation is confident of its capacity to manage potential impacts on its outputs and the key resources that support them, including its people, facilities and critical technical infrastructure. The ABC also continued to implement recommendations from an external risk management benchmarking review. Key milestones included the revision of the ABC's corporate risk profile and identification of top risks. Additionally, work began on divisional risk profiles to enable all ABC divisions to identify the risks and opportunities associated with achieving their objectives and the processes and systems they have implemented in response, as well as to assess the effectiveness of established processes and systems. The Comcover 2009 risk management benchmarking survey of 126 government agencies rated the Corporation's risk management practices as \"advanced,\" with a benchmarking score representing marked improvement on the 2008 survey. The ABC's 2008-09 workers' compensation premium rate was reduced from 0.77% of the Corporation's 2008-09 payroll to 0.63%. This represents a significant return to the Corporation. It reflects a reduction in ABC claim costs, attributed to decreased numbers of workers' compensation claims and effective injury management and return-to-work strategies for injured workers.For 2009-10, the workers' compensation premium rate is 0.59% of the 2009-10 ABC payroll. This represents a 44% decrease in workers' compensation premium costs. Compliance Reporting In June 2008, the Department of Finance and Deregulation issued Finance Circular No. 2008/5 relating to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (CAC Act) bodies in the general government sector. The Circular requires the ABC Board to report on compliance with the CAC Act, CAC Orders 2008 and CAC Regulations 1997 and the Corporation's financial sustainability to the Minister of Finance and Deregulation and the ABC's responsible Minister by 15 October each year. To meet these requirements, the ABC has established an internal compliance reporting framework. The Board signed and submitted the Compliance Report relating to the 2007-08 reporting period before the due date in October 2008. Internal Audit Group Audit provides an independent and objective audit, review and advisory service to: provide assurance to the Board that the Corporation's financial and operational controls, designed to manage the organisation's risks and support the achievement of the Corporation's objectives, are operating in an efficient and effective manner; and assist management in improving the Corporation's business performance. In 2008-09, Group Audit completed scheduled audits which included comprehensive, compliance, information technology, project assurance and follow-up audits. Group Audit also performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to use technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. As in previous years, Group Audit used a combination of in-house staff and external companies to provide the most appropriate expertise and industry experience. Group Audit also provided advice and guidance to ABC management and staff on good governance, Corporate Governance continued2 OVERVIEW 71SECTION policies, risk management and controls, as well as advice on a number of projects and initiatives of the Corporation. Further information is provided in Appendix 5, Audit and Risk Committee (page 192). Fraud Control In 2008-09, the ABC continued to implement its Fraud Control Plan 2008-10 to ensure the Corporation meets the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. The Managing Director is satisfied that the ABC has in place appropriate procedures and processes relating to fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection, and that these comply with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. Annual Report Awards The ABC Annual Report 2007-08 received a gold award in the Australasian Reporting Awards for the quality of its content and presentation. This was the sixth successive ABC Annual Report to win gold.Election Coverage Review Committee When an election is called in any Australian jurisdiction, the ABC convenes an Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) to administer the free-time election broadcasts system under which the ABC broadcasts announcements by eligible political parties and to monitor coverage to ensure adherence to standards. The ECRC is chaired by the Director of Editorial Policies. The Committee monitors the amount of coverage across ABC platforms given to candidates and party officials (share-of-voice data). The data is used as a management tool to assist in ensuring that coverage meets requirements. Share-of-voice data is not, and is not intended to be, a definitive measure of impartiality. In 2008-09, elections were held in the Northern Territory in August 2008, Western Australia in September 2008, the Australian Capital Territory in October 2008 and Queensland in March 2009.

Complaints about issues such as factual inaccuracy, lack of balance, bias or inappropriate content are referred to the ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. Audience and Consumer Affairs is independent of ABC program areas and investigates all written complaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC's Editorial Policies, Code of Practice or legislative Charter. The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programming and policy enquiries. In 2008-09, the ABC logged 196 635 audience contacts\u2014a 3% increase on the previous year. This total included 56 173 letters and emails (a 4% decrease on the previous year) and 140 462 calls to switchboards in State and Territory capitals and particular ABC programs and services (a 6% increase). 42 Key concerns reflected in the audience contacts this year included 4 995 written and phone complaints about The Chaser's War On Everything . Of these, 4 286 were in relation to an item known as the \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch, which the ABC acknowledged had caused significant distress and offence to many people in the community. The sketch was found to have been in breach of the ABC's Editorial Policies and the ABC withdrew it from the repeats of the episode in which it occurred on ABC2 and from ABC online sites. Members of The Chaser team apologised. The Corporation suspended the program for two weeks and made changes to management responsibilities in ABC Television. Changes to the ABC Radio National broadcast schedule entailing the cessation of various programs, including the Religion Report , generated 1 379 complaints. Of the 32 130 complaints received, 3 196 were claims of party political or other bias, 368 alleged lack of balance and 1 738 were claims of factual inaccuracy. These complaints related to a broad range of ABC programs and services.Timeliness As outlined in the ABC Editorial Policies , the ABC endeavours to respond to all audience contacts within 28 days. Between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs responded directly to 19 396 audience contacts. Of these, 16 337 (84%) received responses within 28 days. During 2008-09, 17 646 written complaints were finalised by Audience and Consumer Affairs. The unit provided a personal response to 10 197 of these complaints (comprising 12 479 issues), of which 8 190 (80%) received responses within 28 days. 4 528 complaint contacts were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response, 50 complaint contacts were handled by the Complaints Review Executive and no substantive response was required for 2 871 complaint contacts. Upheld complaints Audience and Consumer Affairs plays two distinct roles in responding to audience complaints. Where a written complaint suggests that the ABC may have breached its Editorial Policies or Code of Practice, the unit investigates the complaint and determines whether ABC editorial standards have been maintained. In cases where this has not occurred, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). At the same time, Audience and Consumer Affairs provides an audience liaison service for complaints about matters of personal taste and preference, such as scheduling matters or preferences for different presenters. While Audience and Consumer Affairs responds to these complaints, they are not capable of being upheld. The 10 197 responses to complaints sent by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year includes both categories of complaint. During 2008-09, 8 851 complaint issues were investigated of which 4 654 (53%) were upheld. Of these upheld complaint issues, 4 004 were in relation to The Chaser's War On Everything \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch. In the reporting period, 2 002 complaints about this segment were each upheld on two counts. Excluding these complaints, 4 847 issues were investigated, of which 650 (13%) were upheld. 42 Combined audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs, News and the Reception Advice Line (phone, letter and email).Corporate Governance continued2 OVERVIEW 73SECTION All upheld complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2008-09, actions taken in response to upheld complaints included written apologies to complainants; on-air corrections and apologies; counselling or reprimanding of staff; removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. In 2008-09, the ABC improved the transparency and accountability of its complaints process by publishing summaries of upheld complaints and reviews conducted by the Complaints Review Executive as individual complaints are finalised. Previously, the Corporation had released this data on a quarterly basis in the form of a Public Report on Audience Comments and Complaints . The new approach provides members of the public with more timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC continues to publish a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its web site. Independent Complaints Review Panel For persons not satisfied with the ABC's response to a written complaint, the ABC Board has established an Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) to undertake independent review of complaints at no cost to the complainant. The ICRP can review complaints that raise allegations of serious cases of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment. Its members are all external to the ABC. Two of the three members were nominated by independent bodies external to the ABC (the Communications Law Centre and the St James Ethics Centre). The Convenor is nominated separately by the ABC Board. During the year, the term of one panellist, Ms Jane Singleton, expired. The Panel currently comprises the Convenor, the Hon Michael Foster QC and panellist, Ms Susan Brooks. In the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, the Panel received 17 requests to review complaints, of which nine were accepted for review. Five requests not accepted for review either did not, in the Panel's judgement, allege a sufficiently serious case of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment to merit review, or involved matters outside of the ICRP's area of responsibility. As the reporting year ended, the Panel were actively considering three complaints and had not yet decided whether to accept these matters for review. Eight cases finalised by the Panel were published on the ABC's website during the reporting year, two of which were upheld and six of which were not upheld (see Appendix 17, page 208). A further two reviews had been completed by the Panel but had not yet been published on the ABC's website, pending confirmation from the complainants that they had received the Panel's report. These matters will be detailed in next year's annual report. At the end of the reporting year, three reviews were in process. Australian Communications and Media Authority Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response or the outcome of an ICRP review may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2008-09, ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 14 such matters (the same number as in 2007-08). In each of these cases, ACMA found no breach of the ABC Code of Practice . Commonwealth Ombudsman The Ombudsman's office did not commence or finalise any investigations in relation to the ABC during the current reporting period. Complaints Review Executive The Complaints Review Executive (CRE) provides an additional level of internal review for complainants who express dissatisfaction with Audience and Consumer Affairs' response to their complaint. This does not preclude the complainant seeking external review via the Independent Complaints Review Panel or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Independent of both Audience and Consumer Affairs and all program units, the CRE has broad scope to review the content and the manner in which the complaint was originally handled, and to determine whether the ABC acted appropriately. All CRE determinations are reported to the ABC Board.74 OVERVIEWDuring 2008-09, 50 complaints were referred to the CRE, of which 49 were accepted for review. Two complaints were upheld. The CRE also adjudicated between ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and ABC program units on six responses to complainants, leading to four upheld complaints. One was assessed as a request rather than a complaint and another was not upheld. Summaries of CRE reviews are published on the ABC's website. Transmission Failures As the national broadcaster, the ABC is expected to provide uninterrupted radio and television services. To deliver these services, the ABC is dependent on Broadcast Australia to maintain the infrastructure and facilities at each transmission site. Power supply issues at some remote transmission sites affect the Corporation's ability to deliver uninterrupted services. In 2008-09, the ABC and Broadcast Australia continued to develop initiatives to assess and improve reliability of mains power and emergency power plants in regional and remote areas. As part of its emergency broadcasting role, the ABC owns portable FM \"flyaway\" transmitter units that can be deployed quickly to supplement ABC Local Radio coverage of natural disasters in regions that require specific emergency information and to ensure continuity of ABC Local Radio in the event of a major failure of existing transmission facilities. In 2008-09, the ABC acquired a third unit to service the southern states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. This complements existing flyaway transmitters in cyclone-prone areas in Queensland and Western Australia. Each unit is fully self-contained, with audio-mixing and transmission equipment. The ABC works closely with the various State and Territory emergency services authorities to ensure effective use of these transmitters. In February 2009, flyaway units were deployed to Kinglake and Healesville following the Victorian bushfire disaster to enable hyper-local coverage and to supplement Melbourne Local Radio coverage. As a result of heavy flooding in February 2009, a unit was also deployed to Ingham, North Queensland, for a two-week period.Sustainability snapshot The ABC's performance in the areas of economic, social and environmental responsibility are reported by a range of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments.

The CRI was developed and is maintained by the United Kingdom organisation, Business in the Community, and run in Australia through the St James Ethics Centre in Sydney. The CRI assesses the extent to which corporate strategy is integrated into responsible business practice throughout an organisation and is a tool to evaluate management practices in key environmental and social impact areas. Performance is benchmarked against the organisation's own stated strategies and objectives as well as against other participating Australian and global organisations. Participating organisations had their responses and documentation audited on site by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The ABC was one of 38 organisations from Australia and New Zealand participating in the CRI. In 2008, the ABC received an index score of 89.63% (up from 61% in 2007). The ABC's achievement was recognised with the Best Progress award at the annual CRI Awards.Overall the CRI demonstrated that the ABC has a well-developed approach to two-way consultation with a broad number of stakeholders in relation to its corporate responsibility activities. It was recognised that, as a result of the ABC's unique position in the Australian community, the Corporation has the opportunity for significant penetration of its activities to influence the broader community. The ABC improved its results from 2007 in all areas other than workplace management. The decrease in the workplace management section from 100% in 2007 to 90% in 2008 can be partly attributed to changed index parameters in this area that led to a decrease in the Australian and New Zealand average score. A number of opportunities for improvement were identified, including: working more closely with program content suppliers to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions associated with production; continuing the implementation of the ABC Environmental Management System; and seeking independent ISO14001 certification over areas identified as higher risk. The ABC is developing processes to improve its corporate social responsibility and will continue to use the CRI to benchmark improvements in performance.76 OVERVIEWFinancial Outcome 2008-09 As in previous years, the ABC operated within its total sources of funds and revenue from Government for the 2008-09 financial year. Sources of Funds 2008-09 The ABC was allocated $869.7 million in the May 2008 Federal Budget. The ABC also received $225.6 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial. The chart \"ABC Source of Funds\" depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2008-09 and its budgeted sources for 2009-10. Application of Funds The chart \"Split Actual Expenditure 2008-09\" broadly represents the ABC's application of funds by function for the 2008-09 financial year.The Year Ahead Revenue from Government In October 2008, the ABC submitted its Triennial Funding Submission 2009-12 (the Submission) to the Australian Government. The Submission outlined proposals for: boosting Australian drama content on television; a new dedicated digital children's television channel; a new digital public affairs television channel; enhanced international broadcasting; enhanced online delivery and additional content, including archival information for education; improved services for regional Australia; additional digital radio content; and ensuring the adequacy of the Corporation's funding for operational and capital expenditures. The Submission was supplemented by the ABC Cost and Performance Report 2008 . The May 2009 Federal Budget maintained the ABC's funding base and provided additional funding for a dedicated digital children's television channel, more Australian television drama, establishment of regional broadband hubs throughout Australia, and funding for 2009-10 only to assist in the maintenance of the ABC's asset base. The ABC's funding for the 2009-10 financial year is: $m Total revenue from Government per Outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4, and including equity injection 929.9 Less Analog Transmission funds -92.7 Less Digital Transmission funds -84.2 Less Digital Radio Transmission funds -4.4 Total Revenue from Government 748.6 The chart \"ABC Revenue from Government by Output 2009-10\" broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by output for the 2009-10 financial year. Budget Strategy Although additional funding was announced in the Federal Budget, this funding is tied to specific initiatives and is not available to address the continual cost pressure arising from the ABC's existing cost base. The Global Financial Crisis and its resulting impact on the ABC's foreign currency purchases also brings additional pressure to tight financial conditions within the Corporation.Financial Summary On 30 July 2009, the Audit and Risk Committee endorsed the signing of the 2008-09 Financial Statements and the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) issued an unqualified audit opinion.Digital Radio Transmission 1% New Media 2% Digital T elevision Transmission 9% Analog Transmission 10% Radio 27%Television 51%ABC Revenue from Government by Output 2009-100 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800Other RevenueABC Commercial RevenueAustralia Network Government Including Capital Indexed at 2008-09 levels (December 2008 six months CPI Index) 26.1% reduction from 1985-86 to 2009-10ABC Split Actual Expenditure 2008-09 Innovation 1.0% Australia Network 2.4% Acquisitions (Including ABC2) 6.3% Support Services 9.6% Other 12.7% Radio Broadcast (including News and current affairs) 19.4%Transmission 21.5%Television programs produced (including News and current affairs and Captioning) 27.1%2 OVERVIEW 77SECTION78 OVERVIEWFive-Year Analysis Recast 2005 2009 2008 ABC Operating $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 of Services 535 1 041 391 976 459 929 236 891 298 926 161 Operating Revenue 244 002 219 641 185 206 187 015 166 430 201 712 Net Cost of Services (a) 844 533 821 750 791 253 742 221 724 868 724 449 Revenue from Government 858 411 833 963 809 532 774 254 757 532 757 532 Recast 2005 2009 2008 2007 2006 (AEIFRS)* 2005 Financial Position $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Current Assets 248 309 209 682 209 683 Non-Current Assets 948 727 795 930 815 269 816 191 Total Assets 1 224 681 1 255 160 1 046 240 1 044 239 1 024 951 1 025 874 Current Liabilities 230 403 174 080 150 428 147 567 134 452 115 635 Non-Current Liabilities 48 187 114 002 136 059 154 518 174 095 194 712 Total Liabilities 278 590 288 082 286 487 302 085 308 547 310 347 Total Equity 946 091 967 078 759 753 742 154 716 404 715 527 Ratios Current Ratio (b) 1.20 1.59 1.63 1.68 1.56 1.81 Equity (c) 77% 77% 73% 71% 70% 70% * Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards. (a) Net cost of services is cost of services less operating revenue. (b) Current assets divided by current liabilities. (c) Equity as a percentage of total assets. The 2009-10 Budget Strategy seeks to address this pressure and maintain ABC output activities and levels, so as to ensure ABC recurrent activities remain funded from recurrent sources. It also seeks to ensure resource allocations are consistent with the ABC's strategic objectives and that a careful balance remains between funding vital future projects for the ABC, for example, a proposed dedicated 24-hour News service and ensuring existing content, facilities and operations are maintained at sustainable levels. The Corporation is in the process of implementing recommendations of a review of its television production activities. This process has already delivered operational savings, which are being applied to sustainability as well as new strategic initiatives and is also expected to deliver further operational efficiencies over the next few years. Funding to assist with the maintenance of the ABC's asset base announced in the May 2009 Federal Budget, is for 2009-10 only. The Corporation will continue to liaise with Government in relation to its funding requirements for asset replacement, in the context of the findings of the second stage of the ABC's Integrated Capital Strategy. Comparative Revenue from Government The 2009-10 operational revenue from Government of $748.6 million represents a decrease in real funding of $264.4 million or 26.1% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart \"ABC Operational Revenue from Government\".Financial Summary continued2 OVERVIEW 79SECTION Chief Staff BrownleeExecutive Adviser , Managing Director's Office Dean Director Radio Kate DundasDirector Television Kim Dalton State/T erritory Directors SA and State and T erritory Directors' Rep - Sandra W inter-Dewhirst ACT - Elizabeth McGrath NSW - Mike McCluskey NT - Mark Bowling Qld - Mike McGowan Tas - Rob Batten Vic - Randal Mathieson WA - Geoff DuncanDirector News Kate Tomey Director ABC International Murray GreenDirector ABC Commercial Lynley MarshallDirector Communications Michael MillettDirector Legal Rob Simpson Director People and Learning Ursula GrovesDirector Innovation Ian Carroll Chief Operating Officer David P endleton Director T echnology and Distribution Margaret Cassidy (a)Director Business Services Brian JacksonDirector ABC Resources David Cruttenden Members of the AB C Executive Leadership Group Structure as at 30 June 2009ICS2 Project Director Vacant Head Group Audit Alison HamillDirector Corporate Strategy and Marketing Michael EbeidHead ABC Secretariat Gary LinnaneManaging Director Mark ScottABC Advisory CouncilABC Board Director Divisional Structure80 ABC DIVISIONSIN 2008-09, ABC Radio's primary focus was the introduction of digital radio in Australia in the five mainland capital cities and the development of ABC Digital Radio services to commence on air from 1 July 2009. ABC Digital Radio will initially comprise simulcasts of its existing analog services\u2014ABC Radio National, ABC Classic FM, ABC NewsRadio, triple j and the relevant Local Radio metropolitan station\u2014along with new music services, ABC Dig Music, ABC Jazz and ABC Country, each complemented by media-rich websites (abc.net.au/ radio/digital). In 2008, ABC Radio achieved record audience results for a second consecutive year: a record market share of 21.2% and a record reach of 3.82 million listeners a week in the five major cities (or 33% of that population). Each of the radio networks recorded year-on-year growth in reach (see page 39). Not all feedback to ABC Radio was positive. In October 2008, decisions to change Radio National's 2009 program schedule generated significant adverse reaction from loyal listeners, many of whom incorrectly perceived the changes would deliver increased online content at the expense of radio programs. In 2009, the response to new radio programs has generally been positive. Communities in Crises The unique role played by ABC Local Radio in times of emergency was never more evident than with the Victorian bushfires and the floods in Queensland and northern New South Wales. In Victoria, rolling coverage and emergency broadcasts were mounted by local stations in Horsham, Bendigo, Wodonga, Sale and Melbourne. All warnings were delivered within a minute of being received, no inaccurate warnings were issued and no talkback callers went to air with inaccurate advice. Portable transmitters were erected and temporary radio services established in the towns of Warburton and Kinglake. 94.5 FM ABC Kinglake Ranges and its online service provided key weekday programs including State News and AM, with the local community mounting their own content with support and technical advice from the ABC. The service was extended to mid-July 2009.Kate Dundas Director of Radio Kate Dundas was appointed Director of Radio in March 2009 after 18 months as Director of People and Learning. Prior to this, Kate was Head of ABC Radio's National Networks. In addition to her ABC career, Kate has worked in public and communications policy areas in both state and federal governments and held two senior management roles in the New South Wales Premier's Department. Kate has a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from Charles Sturt University focused on radio and television.ABC DivisionsSection 3 RadioSECTION ABC DIVISIONS 813 ABC Local Radio programs mounted Outside Broadcasts from many fire-affected regions focusing on community recovery and rebuilding. In April, ABC Radio Sport provided commentary from the football match celebrating the return of the game to the Kinglake football ground. Debriefing sessions and specialist support services were made available to all staff involved throughout the stressful period and they have been buoyed by the response and support from their communities and the general public. ABC Radio participated in cross-ABC and external debriefs and reviews, including the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. Beijing Olympics and Paralympics In August 2008, ABC Radio continued the unbroken tradition of Olympic Games radio coverage begun in 1936, with over 170 hours of the Beijing Olympic Games broadcast on ABC Local Radio around Australia, with the exception of 702 ABC Sydney where Rights were not available. This was followed by coverage of the Paralympic Games. ABC Radio celebrated the Northern Territory Grandstand 's Charlie King becoming the first Indigenous broadcaster to cover an Olympic Games. Section 3 ABC DivisionsNational ABC Radio networks and ABC Television helped to guide affected communities in Victoria to coverage and essential information on ABC Local Radio and online. ABC Local Radio and ABC News established a single bushfires site (abc.net.au/emergency/bushfire/) with links to emergency agencies. A similar site was established for the floods in Queensland and New South Wales. In Queensland, Local Radio broadcast from a temporary station at the Civic Centre in Ingham for almost two weeks when the community was completely isolated by floodwater. Recovery and Rebuilding The ABC presented a free, family-focused concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on 1 March to reflect on and celebrate the resilience and remarkable spirit of the Victorian community and to recognise the emergency service providers and volunteers. In March 2009, triple j joined with Australian concert promoters and sections of the media to support the Sound Relief fundraiser events held simultaneously at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground. On 30 March 2009, the Attorney-General presented ABC Local Radio Victoria with a certificate in recognition of the outstanding contribution, commitment, professionalism and dedication in covering the Victorian bushfire tragedy.

Sport ABC Radio Sport continued to deliver coverage of regional, national and international sports through Grandstand on ABC Local Radio and ABC Grandstand Online. In 2008-09 coverage included Test, One Day and 20/20 cricket, the Women's cricket World Cup, football of all codes, the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, Australian Open tennis, netball, men's and women's basketball, and national coverage of the Tour Down Under cycling event in Adelaide. ABC Radio Sport acquired the first-ever Australian digital radio Rights, in addition to AM and FM Radio Rights, to the Ashes Cricket in England in July 2009. The Radio Rights (Australia only) were also acquired for the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. ABC NewsRadio introduced the new Aussie Rules Preview on Friday nights in March 2009, hosted by sports journalist Chris Glassock ahead of the evening's game-for-broadcast. The network also mounted a special series, A Month of Saturdays , featuring legendary sports journalist Max Presnell in October 2008 to mark the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival. ABC NewsRadio's iconic sports presenter David Lord interviewed Australian sporting legends in a special series called Green and Gold Greats , broadcast on ABC NewsRadio on Saturday mornings. Legends include Sam Loxton, Betty Cuthbert, Ken Rosewall, Peter Thomsen, Margaret Court, John Landy and John Konrads. The series was made available as a podcast via Grandstand . Australian Content triplejunearthed.com celebrated its second anniversary in August 2008 providing unique opportunities for unsigned bands to play at key festivals in Australia. In 2008-09, the site attracted 434 291 unique visitors and 3 371 956 unique page views. 43 Since inception, 23 464 artists have uploaded music, more than 140 000 users have registered, 2.8 million tracks have been down- loaded and eight million tracks streamed. 44 The second Unearthed High was launched in May 2009 on radio and online, urging students to start a band and enter their songs in the competition. The winning band will be flown to Sydney to record their song professionally, have it played on triple j and win a triple j concert at their school. A four-part documentary series, Wide Open Road , was broadcast on triple j , Radio National and Local Radio and was covered online during Ausmusic month in November 2008. It looked at the sound of Australian music and how the landscape has Radio continued3 ABC DIVISIONS 83SECTION helped shape that sound. The series included interviews with The Saints, The Presets, Midnight Oil, Hilltop Hoods, The Go-Betweens, John Butler, Magic Dirt, Sarah Blasko, Silverchair, The Waifs, and The Pigram Brothers among others. Northern Territory Local Radio launched a new comedy series, Tough at the Top , featuring 12 video comedy sketches written and performed by Territorians, Anne Edmonds and Anna Daniels. The series attracted over 6 000 hits on both ABC Local and YouTube in its first four weeks. ABC Local Radio and ABC Local online featured the national finals of the Australian Poetry Slam 2008 from the Sydney Opera House. For the first time, poets competed for a wild card entry to the National Grand Slam via Local Radio's Online Poetry Slam Competition. Eighteen finalists competed for the national title and $5 000 prize money before a live audience at the Grand Slam hosted by 702 ABC Sydney's Andrew Daddo and Miles Merrill. In November, ABC Classic FM launched classic/amp , a new website capturing Australia's classical and experimental music heritage drawn from the ABC's vast archive of music recordings. In April, the network also presented the premiere broadcasts of four Australian works: Richard Mills' Passion According to St Mark ; Damien Ricketson's Porphyrius' Shuffle, circle for piano ; the world premiere broadcast for Stuart Greenbaum's Chamber Concerto for Flute and Percussion ; and Nigel Butterley's Beni Avshalom . The J Awards were announced in December 2008 at the Oxford Arts Factory in Sydney coinciding with a live-to-air broadcast on triple j .

The Presets were awarded Australian Album of the Year, The John Steel Singers received the Unearthed J Award and Mike Daly, director of The Herd's 20/20 clip received the award for Australian Music Video of the Year. Indigenous Content ABC Radio partnered with Umeewarra Aboriginal Media Association in Port Augusta in two cross-media projects. Port Augusta Reimagines was made by Umeewarra radio producers for broadcast on ABC Radio and online on the new ABC Indigenous portal. Coverage of the inaugural Yarnballa Indigenous Culture Festival in October was featured on ABC North West and Radio National and 5UMA 89.1 FM community radio station. Four young Indigenous radio producers were mentored through the process of making video and radio content for ABC North West and contributing to a documentary for ABC Radio National's AWAYE! Local Radio Northern Territory provided radio and online coverage of the Tiwi Island Grand Final and in partnership with the Top End Aboriginal and Bush Broadcasting Association ensured people in remote Aboriginal communities across the Top End could listen in to the ABC's coverage of the Northern Territory Football League through their local community radio station. Audience Interaction and Social Media ABC Radio embraced new forms of social and interactive media. In August, ABC Radio National launched Pool (pool.org.au) an online \"town square\" for Australians where people can upload and publish content in a variety of forms, remix and reuse content made available under Creative Commons licence by others including ABC archival material, and discuss creative works with the Pool community and ABC producers (see page 28).

Catchment Detox came as an external idea to ABC Radio and culminated in a joint initiative with Innovation and a number of external partners. It was launched in August 2008 as part of National Science Week and comprised an online game, competition and radio series to build audience engagement on the dilemma of how to sustainably manage land, soil and water (see page 97). ABC Radio increased its presence on social networking sites with many networks now on Twitter and Facebook. ABC Radio podcasts continued to perform strongly. In June 2009,45 Radio National and triple j topped the ABC podcasts list achieving 7.9 million and 3.8 million downloads respectively out of a total 18.9 million ABC downloads. Four triple j podcasts were in the iTunes top 25 podcasts across October and November, including The Race Race hosted by The Chaser 's Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel. The daily program covering the United States election over two weeks was the most downloaded iTunes podcast in Australia while on air. Throughout the year, Radio National made podcasts available of individual stories from Breakfast, Life Matters and Late Night Live in addition to the entire programs. ABC Rural Radio is now podcasting all programs, a total of 208 separate podcasts. Community and Broadcast Highlights The 2008 Boyer Lectures, \"A Golden Age of Freedom,\" were delivered by Rupert Murdoch. Launched on 2 November, the first of the six lectures was delivered at the Sydney Opera House, broadcast on ABC Radio National and televised on ABC1.

On 7 May, ABC Local Radio hosted a special forum to address Australia's readiness to deal with a national health crisis with the outbreak of A/H1N1 (swine flu). Hosted by AM presenter Tony Eastley, accompanied by co-host bio-ethicist and writer Dr Leslie Cannold, the forum was broadcast nationally across ABC Local Radio networks and streamed online with regular crosses to ABC reporters throughout Australia. triple j 's 2009 One Night Stand was held in Sale, Victoria on 30 May, attracting approximately 15 000 people. In the lead up, Breakfast team Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor joined band Hilltop Hoods for a road trip from Melbourne to Sale stopping at Monash University, Warragul and Traralgon. The road trip was filmed for broadcast by triple jtv . Australia All Over 's 2009 Say G'Day Tour launched in May with the first leg commencing in Victoria where Ian \"Macca\" McNamara visited the bushfire affected towns of Boolarra, Churchill, Marysville and Kinglake. The Victorian leg of the tour culminated in an Outside Broadcast at Kinglake (abc.net.au/australiaallover/). ABC Radio National's 2009 Regional Museums Award focused this year on the smallest centres run by volunteers. The project looks at how museums tell the stories they have in their collections, their contribution to tourism and regional development and has fostered a valuable partnership with Museums Australia. The Future A new three-year strategy for ABC Radio is in development. It places audiences at the centre of the division's activities and concentrates on values and characteristics that are essential to the long-term performance, sustainability and social contribution of ABC Radio. 45 Podcasts figures only reflect 2009 calendar year to date due to new measurement process.Radio continued3 ABC DIVISIONS 85SECTION ABC TELEVISION DELIVERS two commercial-free, free-to-air national television channels. ABC1 continues to provide comprehensive broadcasting services to a national audience. ABC2, the ABC's free-to-air digital-only channel, is an alternative destination for innovative and challenging programming with a focus on music, culture, comedy and entertainment. In the 2009-10 Federal Budget, $67 million was allocated to a dedicated children's channel, ABC3, expected to launch pre-Christmas 2009. On 18 June 2009, the ABC launched MeOn3, a nationwide competition to scout for new talent to host ABC3. In 2008-09, ABC2 experienced a significant improvement in average weekly reach. Audience reach measures the percentage of the total population who watched the ABC within a specific time frame. For the week ending 20 June 2009, ABC2 achieved its highest ever five-city average weekly reach of 2.1 million (or 14.5% of the five-city population). ABC2's average weekly reach in June 2008 was 700 000, growing to 1.4 million by the end of 2008, and by late May 2009 it soared to more than 2 million. In accordance with legislation, ABC Television broadcast 8 405 hours of high definition material in 2008-09, including 1 462 hours in prime time. Freeview and the switch to digital television On 24 November 2008, Freeview\u2014a not-for-profit consortium of all Australian free-to-air television broadcasters including the ABC\u2014was launched to help drive take-up of the free-to-air digital television platform in Australia. The ABC's Director of Television, Kim Dalton, is Chair of the organisation. Freeview will work closely with all relevant areas of Government to ensure consistent messaging in the lead-up to the switch-over to digital television broadcasting in Australia. Content highlights ABC Television helps build a national shared experience and sense of identity through contemporary, relevant and diverse local content. Several new Australian comedies were broadcast on ABC in 2008-09. The Hollowmen premiered on 9 July 2008 attracting 1.185 million viewers with a 27.1% audience share, winning its timeslot nationally and in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

In April 2009, a major launch was held for The WotsWots , a pre-school children's animation created by Academy Award-winning animation studio Weta Workshops. The ABC is a leader in children's programming, and in its Monday to Friday 10 am - 4.30 pm children's timeslot, ABC2 achieves higher audiences among children 0-12 than all dedicated subscription television children's channels. The diversity of content offered as part of the ABC's children's program offerings also continued to grow, with ABC Television's first reality show for kids, Escape from Scorpion Island , launched at the beginning of November 2008. Escape from Scorpion Island garnered good audience figures, with ratings particularly strong among the target 8-12 demographic. Other innovative Australian children's programs, including Dance Academy and My Place , have been commissioned and are currently in production. Multiplatform Content iView Since iView was launched on 23 July 2008, its content offering has grown to approximately 400 full episodes of content.

In June 2009, iView averaged 631 000 visits, an increase of over 150% on the average number of visits in September 2008 (251 000). Websites ABC Television's range of multi-platform services continues to expand, with content available online and other online services catering increasingly for consumers seeking on-demand content and engagement with media. The new websites launched in 2008-09 include the ABC's unique Indigenous portal, the children's portal Playground, Escape from Scorpion Island, Storm Hawks kids website and Lawrence Leung . A new, full-featured flash website for The Chaser's War on Everything was launched to coincide with the broadcast of the final series, featuring the most popular Chaser skits from previous series, a virtual tour of the set and a \"viral video creator\". Vodcasts The total number of vodcast downloads in the six months to June 2009 was four million. The most downloaded vodcasts in 2008 included At The Movies, triple jtv (including jtv), Catalyst, Enough Rope, The Cook and the Chef and Gardening Australia . Another new initiative in 2008-09 was the February launch of triple jtv \"Vodbytes\"\u2014short segments of jtv that can be downloaded daily to a computer or portable media device, consisting of both material unique to this platform and television content. In recognition of the new manner in which younger audiences consume television, ABC Television is aiming to create content that is easily forwarded to online friends and communities. The Chaser's War on Everything Following The Chaser 's \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" skit in June 2009, the ABC's Managing Director and Director of Television made the decision to withdraw the program from the television schedule for two weeks. The Chaser is a satirical program aimed at provoking debate and providing social commentary on topical issues, current affairs and public life in general. Allowing the skit to go to air was a significant misjudgment by ABC Television and this was confirmed by the significant level of negative audience reaction. In immediate response to the public's concerns, ABC Television edited the segment out of the repeat screening of the program on ABC2 and online. The suspension of the program also gave ABC Television an opportunity to complete a review of its editorial approval processes.

This funding has been used to commission independently-produced programs, helping to increase the level and diversity of Australian programs broadcast. ABC Television has fully committed the additional $30 million over the three-year period of funding and commissioned a slate of independently- produced programs with production budgets totaling $110 million. This represents a gearing ratio of over three-to-one for each dollar of the Government funding to the ABC. The ABC has commissioned 156 hours of production, comprising 67 hours of documentaries, 50 hours of children's programs and 39 hours of Australian drama. The programs that have been broadcast in the last two years have all performed strongly in both regional and metropolitan markets. In particular, Australian dramas such as Bed of Roses, Rain Shadow and 3 Acts of Murder performed well. Documentaries such as Ten Pound Poms, Gallipoli Submarine, Miracle on Everest and Humpbacks: From Fire To Ice all performed well nationally. The Future The future for ABC Television involves new channels, new platforms and new content. Higher levels of Australian content, particularly in the area of adult drama and children's television are clear priorities for the Division. As Australia moves towards a future of an expanded free-to- air platform, with increased numbers of digital channels available to all, ABC Television will provide clear choices for viewers by offering relevant, informative and entertaining content at the most appropriate times. Launching ABC3 as the home for primary school children, and formalising ABC For Kids on ABC2 as the home for preschoolers is the first step in the division's plans for maximising channels to best advantage.Television continued3 ABC DIVISIONS 91SECTION Programs and staff 2008-09 HAS BEEN a period of change for the News Division, with a revolution in the way the ABC produces television content, the expansion of international news programming and continuous news across platforms, new programs and a range of appointments to senior positions. This has happened while existing programs have continued to perform strongly. The change in the way television programs are produced is a result of an ABC-wide review of production. It has involved installing automated studio equipment, centralising the production of graphics and introducing desktop editing. The desktop editing technology allows journalists to browse and edit video at their desks and take direct creative control of their stories. It also ensures journalists and producers are equipped for what is becoming standard practice in the industry. Desktop editing was already being used by journalists in the Australia Network newsroom and in the Continuous News Centre (CNC). The production changes have meant extensive work- practice change, efficiencies, new technology and training for hundreds of staff across the country. ABC News Breakfast began on ABC2 in early November 2008. The three-hour program is hosted from Melbourne by Virginia Trioli and Joe O'Brien. Within six months of its launch, the program was watched by close to 200 000 viewers a week in the five capital cities. The program is also broadcast across the Asia-Pacific region on Australia Network. News Breakfast expands and enhances Australia's most comprehensive broadcast news service, which now extends across radio and television networks, and is complemented by a wealth of news and current affairs content online through video, audio and text. The Asia Pacific News Centre (APNC) was launched in November 2008, merging the news resources of Radio Australia and Australia Network. The APNC has 60 journalists dedicated to 24-hour cross-platform coverage of Asia and the Pacific. One of the Centre's first priorities was a merged website where audiences can explore a full range of multimedia news content. With the departure of the former Director of News, John Cameron, and the appointment of Kate Torney Director of News Kate Torney was appointed Director of News in April 2009. Before that, Kate was Head, Asia Pacific News, leading the ABC's newsgathering operation for international audiences. In 2008, she coordinated the merger of the Australia Network and Radio Australia newsrooms. Kate has worked as a radio and television reporter and producer, bureau chief, executive producer and news editor. During her 14 years at the ABC she has worked in local radio, news, current affairs, politics and international broadcasting. In 2001, she teamed with Barrie Cassidy to launch Insiders , the ABC's flagship weekly national affairs program. She was also involved in establishing Offsiders, Inside Business, Newshour (for Australia Network) and ABC News Breakfast . Kate has a Bachelor of Arts (Media Studies) from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.News92 ABC DIVISIONSNews continued Kate Torney to the position, there has been some realignment of the News Executive to reflect strategic priorities, notably with the appointment of a Head of Continuous News and an acting Head of International Operations. There have also been appointments to key program positions, including new correspondents in Washington, the Middle East, New Delhi, Tokyo and Papua New Guinea; senior producer positions for Online News, Online Sport, Radio News, Television News, Foreign Correspondent, Four Corners and News Breakfast ; new presenters on television news in Queensland and Stateline in Victoria and Queensland; and a new Political Editor for The 7.30 Report . News appointed nine cadets, including one sports news cadet, and has introduced a pilot program to recruit two Indigenous journalism students to paid internships. News dedicated considerable resources to coverage of major incidents and events, including the Global Financial Crisis, the Beijing Olympics, the United States Presidential election and the inauguration of Barack Obama, elections in the ACT and Western Australia, and the devastating bushfires in Victoria. Much of this coverage included special and extended programs, including a television documentary about the bushfires, After the Firestorm . News also developed dedicated websites to aggregate coverage of these major stories. News has made changes to its News Online operations, improving the range and depth of text by using more journalists to do original reporting as well as sourcing more stories from national television programs such as Four Corners, The 7.30 Report and Foreign Correspondent . The websites of the radio current affairs programs have been redesigned. The new sites for AM, PM and The World Today greatly increase the speed in getting the content from the radio programs online and providing more content for the News front page. The CNC has enhanced the video news service it provides online, branded as News in 90 seconds and featuring longer segments more regularly on a greater range of topics. These include separate programs on international news, sport, business and entertainment. News, Innovation, Radio and Television worked together to develop a new website to bring all sports content under the Grandstand banner. Previously the material had been sitting under separate sites. The new site was launched on 8 July 2008, the same day as the opening day in the Ashes Test series in England. The one-hour news special After the Firestorm presented by Barry Cassidy included discussions with local community members about their experiences, as well as debate about the main issues affecting them; The ABC's Washington Correspondent, Lisa Millar, reported on the Presidential elections in November 2008; ABC Washington cameraman, Dan Sweetapple, being congratulated by President Obama in March 2009 for winning the 2009 White House News Photographers Association \"The Eyes of History\" award; Peter Cave, the ABC's Foreign Affairs Editor, working in Lebanon; ABC reporter Megan Pailthorpe in the flooded town of Ingham, Qld; Fran Kelly interviewing former Prime Minister the Hon. John Howard for The Howard Years .3SECTION ABC DIVISIONS 93The radio current affairs program PM and the children's television program Behind the News celebrated 40 years of broadcasting. Landline also celebrated its 1 000th program in September 2008. In April 2009, the ABC's Pacific Correspondent, Sean Dorney, was expelled from Fiji after the military-led government objected to his stories on the media crackdown in the country. Initiatives The ABC is gaining a reputation internationally as a leader in the field of trauma and resilience training. The value of the trauma awareness program the News Division developed became evident in supporting staff during and after the Victorian bushfires. So far more than 600 staff from across the ABC have attended awareness sessions and 38 have been trained as peer supporters. News is working with other areas of the ABC to review international operations. The review's main aims include ensuring sustainability and meeting the increasingly diverse output requirements foreign correspondents are asked to file for. It will also look at other issues, including compliance with local employment and tax laws. News has introduced a website that aggregates clarifications and corrections, as well as the findings of complaints review bodies. The focus of the site is on correcting and clarifying significant errors across all programs and platforms. In July 2008, the ABC's then South Asia correspondent, Peter Lloyd, was jailed in Singapore for drug-related offences. He was on leave at the time of his arrest, receiving treatment in a Singapore hospital for an eye infection. He has since been released from jail. The Howard Years , a four-part television series examining the government of John Howard, went to air late in 2008 in the Four Corners timeslot on ABC1. The program attracted extensive media interest and significant audiences for each episode. Foreign Correspondent has been moved to the new timeslot of 8 pm on Tuesday on ABC1. Since the timeslot changed, the average five-city audience has increased by approximately 250 000 (more than 50%) compared with its 9.30 pm broadcast. Behind the News worked with Message Stick to present a special program on ABC1 to mark the first anniversary of the Federal Government's apology to the Stolen Generations. A Four Corners program on rugby league, \"Code of Silence,\" attracted significant media attention and a five-city television audience of more than a million, the highest for 2009 and the highest New South Wales audience since 2001. The program was also largely responsible for tripling the number of visitors to the ABC's iView site the week it was shown. 94 ABC DIVISIONSTelevision News and Current Affairs Program Hours 7 pm News (all States and Territories) 1 465 News Updates 161 News Special 46 Summer Late Edition News 6 Australian Story 17 News Breakfast (ABC2)* 518 Four Corners 30 Foreign Correspondent 21 Inside Business 22 Insiders 43 Landline 54 Lateline 135 Lateline Business 76 Offsiders 22 The 7.30 Report 107 The 7.30 Report: Encore (Highlights) 6 Stateline 153 The Midday Report 240 The Midday Report Special: Victorian Bushfires 1 Behind the News 15 BtN Daily 17 BtN Specials 3 State Election coverage 15 National Press Club 92 Order in the House 19 Parliamentary Question Time 141 Australia Network News 1 735 Asia Pacific Focus 17 The Howard Years 4 After the Firestorm 1 Budget Specials 2 Total 5 184Radio News Outlet Hours ABC Local Radio, ABC Radio National and ABC Classic FM 7 864 Regionals 3 356 triple j 253 Radio Australia 949 Total 12 422 Radio Current Affairs Program Hours Early AM (ABC Local Radio) 42 AM (ABC Radio National) 85 AM (ABC Local Radio) 154 AM/PM special election coverage 5 The World Today 210 PM (ABC Radio National) 192 PM (ABC Local Radio) 210 Saturday AM (ABC Local Radio and ABC Radio National) 40 Correspondents' Report 19 Finance Market Report PM 18 Summer Specials 6 Radio Australia: Connect Asia 216 Asia Pacific 108 Pacific Beat 195 Correspondents' Notebook 4 Asia Pacific Business 13 Total 1 517Working with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the University of Technology, Sydney, News co-hosted a conference called \"Reporting Wars: Challenges and Responsibilities\" at Ultimo in May 2009.

The division has a broad brief to provide editorial and technical leadership across ABC Online (abc.net.au) and maintain the Corporation's web infrastructure whilst also identifying and exploring emerging trends in online and digital media. Innovation has met this challenging brief and, in collaboration with other divisions, has ensured the ABC remains connected and relevant to Australian audiences. During the last year, Innovation led two major new initiatives that enabled the distribution of ABC content on new platforms: ABC iView and ABC Mobile. In addition, Innovation continued to respond to changing audience needs by streamlining and strengthening its existing web presence. Over the past year, Innovation has collaborated with other divisions to improve policy and guidelines for web design and development across ABC Online. It continued to manage the Web Content Management System (WCMS) replacement project and to provide thought leadership for web development and online strategy. Innovation also produced a number of acclaimed ground-breaking projects, which explored the possibilities of the digital media environment. Pioneering new platforms Innovation's second full year of operation began with the launch of iView, Australia's first high- quality, full-screen online video service. iView was designed and developed in-house by Innovation and provides yet another example of the ABC's leadership within the digital media landscape. iView allows audiences to access a wide range of video programs and removes the limitations of scheduled programming. Its creation represents a significant step by the ABC into the broadband future. ABC Television is now responsible for maintaining the content and delivery of iView and has continued to expand the number of channels and programs offered. The Innovation Division also delivered the ABC's first comprehensive suite of mobile phone services under the banner of ABC Mobile. Although the ABC has developed content for the mobile phone platform in the past\u2014releasing niche mobile applications for music, sports and election Ian Carroll Director of Innovation Ian Carroll has been Director of Innovation since the division was established in 2007. Prior to this appointment he was Chief Executive of ABC International's Australia Network. He also established two channels for ABC Digital Television and led many successful news and current affairs programs for both the ABC and commercial networks. Ian holds a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University and a Graduate Diploma of Media Management from Macquarie University.Innovation96 ABC DIVISIONSInnovation also scoped and assessed a number of other initiatives to streamline ABC Online and improve the audience's online experience. A number of key online portals\u2014including several digital radio sites, Radio National and the Grandstand Sport gateway\u2014were in redesign and developed in accordance with these new guidelines. Innovation will continue to collaborate with other divisions as they look to develop new sites and redesign existing ones. Updating web infrastructure Each month an average of 2.6 million Australians visit ABC Online for up-to-date news, information and entertainment. Approximately 700 ABC staff create, edit and upload digital content that attracts and retains that audience. Since its arrival in 1997, ABC Online has grown to nearly five million pages, all of which are managed and delivered through Wallace, the original and current WCMS. Wallace was developed in-house and launched over a decade ago. It provided a sound solution to establish a significant and popular ABC website, however, the technology and software that Wallace uses are at the end of their life-cycle. Rapid changes in online audience expectations and web technology means the system is no longer able to effectively meet current and future needs. The replacement of the WCMS is essential to the future of the ABC and its ability to play a central role in Australia's digital future. In 2008, after an assessment of options by the Innovation Division, the ABC Board approved the search for an external partner with expertise in WCMS development to create a new system for ABC Online content management. Innovation conducted a global search and tendering process for an \"off-the-shelf\" solution which could then be tailored to meet the Corporation's tight specifications. Two vendors were then invited to demonstrate the strength of their system during a six week in-house trial at the ABC. During the rigorous trials the vendor systems were tested on performance, availability, scalability, supportability and disaster recovery. In addition, the vendors were rated against functional content creation, functional content management, functional content delivery and results\u2014ABC Mobile represents an ongoing and holistic mobile presence for the Corporation. The mobile website m.abc.net.au is accessible from any handset connected to the web and was designed to be fast loading and easy to read on a mobile phone. Two applications were also released as part of ABC Mobile: one for the iPhone and the other for handsets using the Android operating system. The iPhone application has been particularly successful, with over 140 000 downloads in its first four months. Streamlining ABC Online The Innovation Division led the development of a number of policies and guidelines concerned with streamlining ABC Online. Innovation made a significant contribution towards the amendment to Section 9 of the ABC Editorial Policies , which relates to user-generated content, and the development of a \"Compliance checklist for ABC interactive services\". In February 2009, Innovation published the first set of User Interface Guidelines for ABC Online. The guidelines will introduce standards and make recommendations across ABC Online that will improve the overall coherence, usability and audience experience of all ABC websites. The guidelines are a \"living document\" that is being developed in collaboration with all divisions and will respond to feedback and suggestion as ABC Online continues to evolve. Innovation remains the central point of contact for help with implementation of the guidelines during changes to existing sites and the design and development of new ones.Innovation continued ABC Mobile includes a custom built application for use on iPhones.3 ABC DIVISIONS 97SECTION overall performance. At the close of this process one vendor, yet to be announced, was selected to deliver the replacement WCMS for the ABC. Innovation will lead the set-up of an Executive Review Group and provide project governance, to identify and engage key internal stakeholders and ensure the smooth planning and deployment of the new infrastructure. Exploratory projects Innovation also produced a number of acclaimed projects exploring the capabilities of broadband. In August 2008, ABC Science collaborated with several partners, including ABC Local Radio, to produce the national project for National Science Week. Catchment Detox (catchmentdetox.net.au) is an online simulation game that allows players to manage a virtual water catchment by balancing three basic factors: the health of the environment, the economy and population growth. Designed to increase public understanding of the dilemmas involved in managing a typical Australian river system, the simulation format was chosen to allow players to experiment with different approaches to the one problem, therefore coming to understand the complex underlying principles of water management. The site received the Best Science, Health or Environment Award from the Australian Interactive Media Industry Association (AIMIA), the Australian digital media industry's peak association. Sydney Sidetracks (abc.net.au/sidetracks), produced by Innovation in collaboration with a number of external institutions, is a unique multimodal experience that utilises mapping technologies to allow audiences to explore the hidden past of some of Sydney's oldest inner-city suburbs. Sydney Sidetracks offers a rich range of historic audio, video, text and images via an interactive map of Sydney. The map includes moments of national interest such as Australia's first television broadcast in 1956 and the Hon. Paul Keating's Redfern speech in 1992. The map can also be loaded onto a mobile phone handset, and individual media files can be downloaded to a portable media device, so the material can be accessed on the street at the actual scene of the story. This gives a real-world experience to historical and archived content.Innovation also launched a groundbreaking, interactive 3D website Gallipoli: The First Day (abc.net.au/gallipoli). The site accurately recreates the first 24 hours of the 1915 ANZAC landing at Gallipoli in rich, interactive detail. The basis of the site is a sophisticated 3D map of Anzac Cove, which was built using topographical data from 1916. Visitors to the site can move through the landscape, creating the feeling of actually being at the battle itself as the day unfolds. The site offers an hour-by-hour timeline of the key events of the landing. Several narrated sequences, voiced by actor Lucy Bell, carry audience members through the story of the day and detailed 3D dioramas provide dramatic visualisations of what the experience might have been like for both the ANZAC and Turkish soldiers. The site was built almost entirely in-house by Innovation; only the soundscapes and 3D models underlying the soldiers and military equipment were completed by independent production companies. Each key event contains a wealth of supplementary media, including diary extracts and letters voiced by Hugo Weaving, video interviews with survivors from Gallipoli and photographs from behind the trenches. The site also offers background material about the broader Gallipoli campaign, including expert opinion by renowned historian Harvey Broadbent, information about the weaponry and transport used by ANZAC and Ottoman soldiers, and short biographies of each soldier highlighted in the project. These projects have taken advantage of the latest technologies to offer new and exciting ways for audiences to experience and engage with ABC content. In the year ahead, Innovation will continue to experiment with new forms of content and will also ensure that the reach of all ABC content is maximised by improving the technologies and interfaces across ABC Online, and distributing ABC content across new and emerging platforms.98 ABC DIVISIONSABC INTERNATIONAL INCLUDES Australia Network, Radio Australia, International Projects and International Relations. In 2008-09, the division continued to grow audiences and build partnerships across the Asia Pacific region. A major structural change occurred in November 2008 with the creation of the Asia Pacific News Centre (APNC) based in Melbourne. The APNC is a 24-hour multimedia news operation focused on coverage of Asia and the Pacific for international audiences. Managed by ABC News, it combines the news and current affairs resources of Australia Network and Radio Australia to create a centre of excellence for regional reporting with some 60 editorial staff (see News Division report, page 91). A further restructure in March 2009 resulted in the Corporate Strategy and Governance unit becoming part of the Corporate Strategy and Marketing Division (see page 114). Australia Network Australia Network is Australia's international television and online service and is currently available in 22 million homes in more than 40 countries across Asia, the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent and in more than 200 000 hotel rooms. The television service is accessed via three time-shifted satellite signals: Intelsat 5 (Pacific), Intelsat 8 (North and South East Asia) and Intelsat 10 (South Asia). These satellites also carry Radio Australia signals, and closer links have been developed between Australia Network and Radio Australia to coordinate transmission and distribution. Australia Network distinguishes itself among international television competitors as a multi- genre provider that offers the best of Australian children's educational content, English-language learning, lifestyle, drama, documentary and news and current affairs. The aim has been to establish a programming line-up which clearly reflects the quality, credibility and integrity of a brand that carries the name \"Australia\". Australia Network draws on the extensive inventory of programming available from the ABC and Australian commercial television networks, as well as reputable international independent production houses. Murray Green Director of ABC International Murray Green leads ABC International and has responsibility for the State and Territory Directors. The activities of State and Territory Directors are reported separately on page 116. Prior to a corporate restructure in March 2009, Murray was also Director of Corporate Strategy and Governance. He earlier served as State Director Victoria and the ABC's Complaints Review Executive, dealing with the review of complaints about accuracy and bias. He is a graduate of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, has an honours degree in Asian and Pacific History, and is a lawyer.ABC International3 ABC DIVISIONS 99SECTION Cambodia Vanuatu Singapore East Timor Papua New Guinea Fiji Kiriba ti Cook Islands Solomon Islands Australia Network Satellite distribution/ footprint Radio Australia l Countries with one FM frequency l Countries with two FM frequencies l Countries with digital radio subscription Language ServicesTonga Samoa Over the past year, Australia Network underwent a major re-fresh resulting in an updated brand and on-air look, new station identifications, website and promotional material and a revised tagline From our world to yours that better reflects the channel's vision. The network schedule was also revamped with the addition of new reality, lifestyle and travel programs to give the channel a more dynamic and engaging look that better reflects the strength of the brand. A series of programs, This Australian Life, was commissioned to showcase the experiences of Asian students attending Australian educational institutions. At the height of the Indian student crisis in Australia, Australia Network played a valuable public diplomacy role by broadcasting news specials and extended coverage that provided fair, balanced and comprehensive coverage of the issues to the region. The Synovate PAX cable and satellite survey is the only ongoing audience research available in Asia. For the period ending 2008, it indicated the The channel is also the only international broadcasting service to provide English-language learning programming for intermediate and advanced students, backed up by a comprehensive interactive website allowing the development of skills and strategies for those seeking admission to overseas universities and educational institutions. Australia Network demonstrated its commitment to significantly increase coverage of the Pacific with the launch of a new weekly magazine program, Pacific Pulse . The program focuses on stories outside the daily news agenda and seeks out voices that are rarely heard, from community leaders to villagers, with a focus on aspiration and achievement. The program is presented by two experienced producers who share a Pacific Island heritage\u2014Tania Nugent, who grew up in Papua New Guinea, and Clement Paligaru, who is from Fiji. Audience research in Pacific urban centres indicates that on average about 50% of viewers had watched an Australia Network program in the past week.100 ABC DIVISIONSviewership of Australia Network had grown 6% on the previous year in what is an increasingly fragmented marketplace. Large increases were recorded in Hong Kong, India (Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore in particular) and Bangkok, with modest increases in Manila and Jakarta. Based on these results, Australia Network reaches over 1.1 million viewers per month excluding India. Taking account of the audience measured in India by TAM India's people meter service, the monthly viewing base exceeds two million. Australia Network is largely funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but the ABC maintains editorial independence over the service, which is charged with providing a credible, reliable and independent voice in the region. Radio Australia Radio Australia is a multilingual radio and online service providing content in seven languages: English, Indonesian, Mandarin, Pidgin, Vietnamese, Khmer and French. At the end of 2009 Radio Australia will celebrate 70 years of international broadcasting. Radio Australia was drawn into the centre of the Fiji political crisis in early 2009 with the military government ordering the shutdown of Radio Australia's FM transmission sites in Suva and Nadi. There is still no indication as to when the order will be rescinded enabling transmission in Fiji to be restored. Radio Australia continues to reach audiences in Fiji through shortwave broadcasts, online and satellite services. Notwithstanding the transmission shutdown, Radio Australia has been granted interviews with leading political figures in Fiji and some ABC journalists have been permitted entry into Fiji to report on the latest political events there. Radio Australia undertook its biggest cross- media and cross-platform marketing and content project with the Pacific Break initiative. Inspired by triple j's Unearthed, Pacific Break called on unsigned Pacific musicians to submit their original recordings with the best entry earning the right to perform at Vanuatu's Pacific-wide music festival, Fest'Napuan, culminating in a live broadcast from the festival site. Radio Australia is following up with another Pacific Break in 2009 and hopes it will become a fixture in the Pacific music calendar. Audience research conducted across the Pacific region showed that, on average, one in three urban radio listeners tuned in weekly to a Radio Australia program. This weekly figure peaked in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands with 58% and 57% of urban audiences respectively tuning in to Radio Australia. The increase in listenership in Fiji was most encouraging, with urban audiences measured at less than 1% per week in 2004, growing to 23% at the end of 2008 (before the FM transmission shutdown). Radio Australia now has eleven 24-hour FM outlets in the Pacific and five in South East Asia (see Appendix 24, page 237). In 2009, new 24-hour FM services were opened in Sihanoukville in Cambodia and Vientiane in Laos. Radio Australia's FM 96 is the only English-language FM service in Laos and after eight months of operation registers an estimated 20 000 weekly listeners. New services are anticipated in 2009 in Luang Prabang in Laos and the Northern Pacific including the Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas and Federated States of Micronesia. Radio Australia continues to maintain shortwave services for audiences outside the range of local FM transmitters. It uses the same satellites as Australia Network for program distribution and direct-to- home use. Continuing a mix of local marketing initiatives and strategic rebroadcast arrangements, Radio Australia's Khmer language audience continues to grow. The Khmer service reached 6% of the Cambodian radio market weekly in 2008, up from 2.5% in 2006 and 1% in 2002. To build on this success, the Khmer and English services broadcast live from Phnom Penh's Water Festival in November 2008. Radio Australia's Vietnamese service reaches its audiences via the internet (www.bayvut.com.au). A relaunch of its website has sharpened its focus on providing Vietnamese audiences with free English lessons and information about the lives of Vietnamese students in Australia, Australian society and attitudes, as well as stories on health, environment, good governance and regional news and current affairs. Re-broadcasting by partner radio stations remains a key focus in Indonesia and in July 2008 Radio Australia hosted a workshop with key radio partners in Jakarta. From this emerged numerous new partner opportunities in broadcasting and education. ABC International continued3SECTION ABC DIVISIONS 101International Projects ABC International Projects works to support the development of robust media institutions in the Asia Pacific region that operate in the public interest. It is a growing self-funding enterprise with some 20 staff (including locally engaged staff) located in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and a support team in Australia. International Projects offers assistance in the form of strategic advice, training and mentoring, technical support and secondments. The core goal of these activities is to increase demand for good governance in partner countries, leading to better development outcomes. This goal is in line with the strategic direction of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the principal source of funding for the activities of International Projects. In 2008-09, International Projects continued major programs with Papua New Guinea's National Broadcasting Corporation, the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation, media organisations in the Solomon Islands and Cambodia's state broadcaster, Radio National Kampuchea. The Cambodia project has been extended until 2011 having attracted funding from the World Bank as well as AusAID. International Projects also managed a number of smaller projects including a program of support to broadcasters across 14 Pacific countries. The unit also scoped a program of support for Vietnam Television which will begin in 2009-10. International Relations International Relations is the first point of contact and coordination for international visitors to the ABC and the Corporation's involvement with public broadcasters and broadcasting associations around the world. These include the: Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU); Asia- Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD); British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC); Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC); Commonwealth Broadcasting Association (CBA); European Broadcasting Union (EBU); International Radiocommunications Advisory Committee (IRAC), International Telecommunications Union (ITU); Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK); Pacific Islands News Association (PINA); Radio New Zealand (RNZ); Television Hong Kong (RTHK); and the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). During 2008-09, the ABC benefited from an exchange of ideas and debate by welcoming to its premises in Australia delegations from China, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Korea, Sudan, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, Canada, Vietnam, East Timor and the United States. Australia Network's Tania Nugent is welcomed home to Butibam village in Lae, Papua New Guinea; Clement Paligaru and camera operator Steve Ritchie on location in Fiji; A wood carver in Tonga being filmed for Australia Network.102 ABC DIVISIONSABC COMMERCIAL PROVIDES a revenue stream through its commercial activities to assist the ABC fulfill its Charter obligations as the national public broadcaster. Established in February 2007, the Division assumed the revenue-generating activities of the former ABC Enterprises and responsibility for developing new revenue streams for the Corporation, including the potential afforded by digital technology. Since the formation of the division, screen rights and the ABC's Resource Hire business revenues are no longer part of ABC Commercial. Financial Performance ABC Commercial recorded a net profit for the year of $18.8 million, an increase of $2.54 million from 2007-08, adjusting for Resource Hire income. In 2008-09, ABC Commercial entered into two new commercial partnerships\u2014a publishing and distribution partnership with HarperCollins Publishers Australia (HCP) for ABC Books and a licensing agreement with Pascal Press for ABC Reading Eggs . The revenues generated from those agreements will be returned to the Corporation via ABC Commercial as currently occurs with other commercial partnerships that have been operated by ABC Commercial for many years. The Division also executed a number of key contracts including those which support the development of Australian talent in the industry. The marketing campaigns, which complemented a strong product catalogue and competitive pricing model, enabled ABC Commercial to continue to perform strongly, particularly in the distribution and retail sectors. During the year, ABC Commercial continued to develop its digital capability resulting in the delivery of new revenue from digital business initiatives. The redevelopment of the ABC Shop Online resulted in record sales for the Christmas period. Further technical capabilities were developed for the delivery of digital downloads while digital content sales for online and mobile distribution continued to grow. In addition, ABC Commercial extended the ABC's presence on social network sites such as Facebook and MySpace. Content distribution businesses performed well with DVD, Music and Program Sales Worldwide reporting strong growth in net profits.

The Group provides expertise and a range of vital services and support functions across the Corporation. The Group comprises the Technology and Distribution, ABC Resources and Business Services Divisions; the Capital Works and Business Affairs and Development Units; and, for administrative purposes, Group Audit. Emergency Broadcast Support As the official emergency broadcaster, Australian communities turn to the ABC in times of crisis to stay informed. The ABC's comprehensive coverage of the Victorian bushfire disaster in February 2009 was maintained by Operations Group staff from across the country. In responding to the emergency, the Corporation mobilised resources from across the country. ABC Resources provided coverage of the Bushfire Memorial Service and supplied a studio and crew to support production of the \"Australia Unites\" Bushfire Appeal Telethon on the Nine Network. The Corporation owns three portable FM \"flyaway\" transmitter units that are able to supplement ABC Local Radio coverage of natural disasters in regions that require specific emergency information. They also ensure continuity of ABC Local Radio in the event of a major failure of existing transmission facilities. Following the devastation wrought by the Victorian bushfires, one flyaway transmitter unit was dispatched to the Kinglake area to broadcast localised information and relay Local Radio programs from 774 Melbourne. A second unit was dispatched to Healesville to relay ABC Local Radio programming from Melbourne. In North Queensland, a flyaway transmitter unit was also set up at the Ingham Civic Centre for two weeks in February 2009 following heavy flooding in the region. The unit enabled hyper-local coverage to supplement Townsville Local Radio services. Contribution to Output ABC Resources manages the facilities and labour for the ABC to meet its Charter obligations to bring content of relevance to the Australian public. In 2008-09, ABC Resources supplied 1.158 million skilled-labour hours for television production. This Operations Group David Pendleton Chief Operating Officer David Pendleton joined the ABC as the General Manager of Group Audit in 1996. He went on to become General Manager of Financial Operations and Accounting, and later Head of Finance. In 2002, he was appointed to the position of Director of Finance and Support Services, which was re-named Director of Business Services in 2003. In 2004, he became the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer. Before joining the ABC, David held senior management positions in the public sector at the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority and State Super Investment and Management Corporation. David holds a Bachelor of Business (Accounting), a Graduate Diploma from the Securities Institute of Australia and is a fellow of CPA Australia.3 ABC DIVISIONS 107SECTION Improving Content Presentation and Distribution New technology and changing audience behaviour mean the ABC must respond to an environment characterised by digitisation of traditional broadcasting platforms, the emergence of multi- platforms, and the corresponding fragmentation of audiences. The ABC is committed to evaluating its production systems and processes to respond to these challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Over the past 12 months, a range of initiatives and projects were undertaken to enhance production and service provision to ABC audiences. As part of the transition to file-based production, studio automation was completed for News in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. Studio automation capitalises on current technologies, embracing file-based capture, distributed editing capabilities, browse-level desktop capabilities and complete Newsroom automation integration. This work will continue in 2009-10. Work commenced on the implementation of digital links that carry ABC radio distribution services to Local Radio and Radio National transmitter sites from studios across Australia. The ABC will also replace its audio links to a number of Outside Broadcast (OB) sites, including sports grounds and performance venues. One-third of all links had been cut over to the digital network by 30 June 2009. When complete, some 200 sites will be connected Australia-wide. Moving the ABC's radio distribution and contribution services to a digital platform provides more reliable and higher-quality radio services. A further benefit is enhanced monitoring of audio content as it arrives at the transmitter. The ABC also commenced replacement of its OB video links with digital link equipment. This change will not only improve the quality of content provided from OB venues, but greatly expand the scope of content produced. The new link equipment extends support of both Standard Definition and High Definition digital video. The links are also capable of carrying surround sound and may be configured to transport multiple video streams across a single link. At the conclusion of the deployment, the ABC will have a completely digitised program chain for OB events that will meet the Corporation's requirements for production of high-quality content.is a decrease from 1.212 million hours in 2007- 08, reflecting improved efficiency in production methodology and increased training within the Division. ABC Resources continued to provide wide-ranging production services for all television production. This now includes ABC News Breakfast following its successful launch on ABC2. It was a busy year in polling booths around Australia, with support provided for local election coverage in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. Over the past 12 months, the Division supported coverage for issues and events as diverse as: Anzac Day, including delivery of services from Gallipoli and France; the Tiwi Island Football final; the Hopman Cup; and the Federal Budget, with a week's production of News, Press Club coverage, The 7.30 Report, Lateline and Q&A in Canberra. ABC Resources also worked to provide web streaming for Local Radio events, including the 702 ABC Sydney Knit In, the Australian Poetry Slam from the Sydney Opera House and Canberra's National Folk Festival. ABC Resources and Capital Works staff provided crucial support for the Corporation's coverage of the Beijing Paralympics across all platforms, including the launch of the ABC High Definition service during the Games. Other major projects for the Operations Group included delivery of the production centre for the Continuous News Centre in Sydney; the creation of a fully integrated and automated News Breakfast studio facility in Melbourne; implementation of the ABC Online portal designed for mobile phone access, m.abc.net.au; and the refit of Regional Radio stations in Dubbo, Tamworth, Muswellbrook, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Kalgoorlie. In addition to ABC production, the Corporation's labour and facilities were contracted to make Newstopia (for SBS), Good News Week, Rove and Talkin 'bout your Generation (for Network Ten), and Project Runway (for Foxtel), significantly contributing to the net profit returns to the ABC through resource hire activities.108 ABC DIVISIONS Total No. of ABC Distribution Broadcast Australia Total Network \"On-Air\" Transmitters Network Transmission Network Availability Availability (See Note 1) (See Note 2) (See Note 3) (See Note 4) 2008-09 2007-08 Target 2008-09 2007-08 2008-09 2007-08 2008-09 2007-08 ABC Service % % % % % % % % % ABC Classic FM 99.85 99.94 99.68 99.80 Notes: 1. ABC Distribution Network: The ABC distribution network ensures that programs are delivered from the studio to local transmitters around Australia. It includes outsourced satellite and terrestrial broadcast distribution services from telecommunications carriers such as Optus and Telstra. This measure has been designed to be consistent with contracted transmission targets and represents the aggregated performance of the many agreements the ABC has in place to distribute programs. With the exception of digital television and Local Radio, the network's overall performance in 2008-09 was well above expectations and performance in the previous year. Digital television program distribution performance declined due to a major Telstra Digital Video Network (DVN) fault of over 24-hours duration that affected all states except New South Wales and Queensland. Local Radio services in remote and regional Australia were affected by a number of factors, including: an increase in reported line failures to remote sites relying on non-redundant Telstra broadcast lines, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland; distribution failures in NSW, particularly the ABC's own microwave link in Wollongong; and failures on the Telstra Apollo digital distribution service, which operates over the ageing Telstra copper broadcast line network. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Services Provider): The transmission network performance, as reported by Broadcast Australia, was above the targets for 2009, but declined marginally relative to 2007-08. The largest contributing factor to delivery performance below specified minimum levels were higher-than-expected levels of main and standby power failures during the year, an increase on the previous year. New digital television services performed above targets, unchanged from 2007-08. Some Broadcast Australia services were subject to interference issues that were not anticipated during planning and construction. 3. Total Network Availability: These figures show the impact of all outages on the overall network. They reflect the delivered service availability to the audience, regardless of the source of fault or interruption. In practice, during the majority of reported outages, a reduced level of service continued to be provided, accounting for the difference between the contracted and overall network performance. Overall, the delivery of services to ABC analog network audiences improved in 2008-09 compared with 2007-08. New South Wales, Victorian and Tasmanian services and Local Radio performed below expectations. Victorian performance was adversely affected by bushfires in February 2009, which caused the total loss of two digital transmission services. Overall, digital television services' performance improved marginally compared to the previous year, but remained below expectations. Broadcast Australia, with the ABC's permission, operated a number of services below minimum performance levels for sustained periods throughout the year; this is only partially reflected in the data. Additionally, major long-term technical deficiencies have been identified on a number of the large AM radio broadcast sites around the country that are not reflected as faults in performance reports and hence not reflected in the data presented here. The ABC continues to investigate the extent and impact of the identified deficiencies. 4. Total \"On-Air\" Availability: These figures show the direct impact of all outages experienced by the audience, where at least some level of service continued to be provided throughout faults and maintenance. Broadcast Australia reported similar overall performance in 2008-09 to 2007-08. Victoria was adversely impacted by bushfires. The Northern Territory was affected by the loss of one inland High Frequency (HF) Vertical Incidence Local Radio service due to the impact of ongoing day-night switching faults at the new transmission facility; the affected service improved in 2008-09 relative to 2007-08, but remained well below expectations.Operations Group continued ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2008-09 Performance as Reported by Broadcast Australia3SECTION ABC DIVISIONS 109In April 2009, region specific triple j services became available in Western Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory and South Australia on the Remote Area Broadcasting Services (RABS) platform. RABS provides Australians in remote areas with television and radio services. Services are broadcast on the Optus Aurora satellite platform. Prior to the change, listeners across the country could only access the ABC's south-east triple j service. Industry Engagement Technology and Distribution works closely with broadcast industry partners and stakeholders to share expertise and ensure delivery of high-quality services. The Group has worked in partnership with other free-to-air networks to develop standards to support development of the Freeview receiver standard and Electronic Program Guide (EPG). Technology and Distribution was also involved in technical planning for Digital Radio through participation in two Standards Australia drafting groups for the Digital Audio Broadcasting Plus (DAB+) transmission standard and a DAB+ receiver standard. The Division evaluated and purchased suitable audio processing units and advised on sub-channel data rates and other multiplex configuration issues. All transmitters were installed in preparation for the 1 July 2009 \"switch-on\" of the ABC's Digital Radio service in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth using the DAB+ advanced encoding standard. The ABC continued to work with the Government and its transmission service provider, Broadcast Australia (BA), to deliver digital television (DTV) services across Australia. By 30 June 2009, the ABC had 324 of the 440 planned DTV services in operation, including eight in test mode, with a potential population reach of 97.7%. Succession Planning Several ABC staff completed a two-year, mentor- based training program to multi-skill, cross-skill or up-skill into operational roles. The program was initiated within ABC Resources in 2006. A number of participants attained a Certificate IV in Screen or Certificate III in Media. The pilot intended to test a relatively cost-neutral approach to skills training with a mentor-based training model used in real operational environments. To ensure provision of skilled staff for future development and implementation of technology strategies, the Technology and Distribution Division conducts a range of succession planning initiatives. In 2008-09, the Division hosted three electronics apprentices in Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart. Three Graduate Technologists commenced work and training activities in Sydney, before undertaking placements in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin. Four Women in Engineering (WIE) Scholarships were also awarded in the last 12 months. The Scholarships are part of the ABC's strategy to promote the education, training and practice of engineering among women in the broadcast and technology fields. Studio automation in action.110 ABC DIVISIONSTHE PEOPLE AND LEARNING Division is a specialised and strategic area responsible for people and performance with particular focus on leadership and cultural development, reward, organisational development and performance, industrial relations, learning, and succession and talent management. It is responsible for managing occupational health and safety (OHS) issues throughout the Corporation. 2008-09 was the first full financial year of operation under a new structure and new service delivery model for the People and Learning Division. Under that model, People and Learning Business Partners and People Development Advisers work with assigned Divisions to provide people and learning solutions. In August 2008, the Human Resources Operations unit, including Payroll and administration systems, formally moved across to the Business Services Division as part of the restructure. In 2008-09, People and Learning were instrumental in introducing a more modern values- based culture at the ABC. A People and Learning team researched and developed a draft set of values from existing value-sets and other cultural markers from within the Corporation. The team undertook an extensive staff consultation process prior to gaining the agreement of the Executive Leadership Group regarding the ABC Values: Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation. The values were launched at the annual Leaders' Conference in March 2009, after which People and Learning began embedding the values into the broader organisation through education programs and policy and system redevelopment. In 2008, the Business Partner teams contributed to the implementation of Production Review initiatives by assisting with planning, communications to staff, occupational health and safety (OHS) advice and the implementation of skills development programs. This was in addition to the industrial relations and change management advice and support given to the Steering Committee. The availability of State and Territory People and Learning managers and staff around the country was also integral to the achievement of Corporate and divisional objectives throughout the year. Ursula Groves Director of People and Learning Ursula Groves joined the ABC in July 2008 as Head of People Development and was appointed Director of People and Learning in May 2009. Ursula has extensive experience in senior Human Resource and Organisational Development roles in the manufacturing and public education sectors. Ursula has a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University, a Diploma of Education from the University of Melbourne and a Graduate Diploma of Organisation Behaviour from Swinburne University.People and Learning3 ABC DIVISIONS 111SECTION The People and Learning management structure was strengthened with two key appointments to new roles in the second half of the financial year. The role of Manager Digital Skills Development is to develop and manage strategies and programs to develop digital media skills and media industry knowledge across the ABC, in consultation with the divisions and the team of People Development Advisers. The Manager of OHS will lead the OHS unit in the development of strategies, programs and services to continue the work of improving the occupational health and safety of staff, contractors and visitors across the ABC. The People and Learning Division recently developed a three-year Business Plan identifying the following six priorities: Embed the ABC Values into the broader organisation Partner with leaders and staff to implement change Develop and implement talent management and workforce planning strategies Provide employees with industry knowledge and digital media skills Initiate flexible forms of employment Ensure all People and Learning-led processes and frameworks are business enablers. People and Learning increased its focus on Indigenous employment targets across all divisions through a number of strategic initiatives. In 2008-09, Indigenous staff represented 1.2% of the ABC workforce, the same level of representation as the previous year. The division ran an Indigenous Employment Forum in July 2008 which brought together external government and employment agencies, and 50 key ABC managers and staff. The workshop focused on current Indigenous recruitment and retention models which could be used to increase the ABC's performance in this area. Indigenous Employment Reference Groups were established in a number of divisions to identify and action employment opportunities for current and potential Indigenous employees. Following the delivery in 2008 of cross-cultural Indigenous training for all employees based in Darwin, an educational package, entitled Indigenous Culture in the ABC , is currently being developed for national roll-out over the 2009-10 and 2010-11 financial years. Following a review and redesign of development programs for managers, including New Managers and Advanced Managers Programs, the inaugural learning module for the Accelerated Leadership Program was conducted in August 2008. Fifteen senior ABC managers attended the workshop at the Accelerated Learning Laboratory at the University of New South Wales. This program is part of a broader talent- development and succession-planning initiative being undertaken across the Corporation. A nine-month process of identifying mission-critical leadership roles, assessing incumbent capability and building a talent pool to develop the next generation of ABC leaders, including succession planning for the Executive Leadership Group, was completed with presentations by Directors of their divisional talent management plans to the ABC Executive Leadership Group. This is the first time that both mission-critical leadership roles and upcoming leadership talent have been identified, with support from People and Learning Business Partners, as part of a wider talent-management process. To combat escalating labour market pressures and in response to feedback from ABC managers, People and Learning worked on key strategic initiatives to fast track its recruitment processes and to more effectively target and engage quality candidates. Funding was approved for the purchase and implementation of an e-recruitment system. The system will transform the ABC's recruitment processes from manual to web-based, streamline recruitment processing administration, improve candidate management, increase reporting capability and provide access to a talent pool database. The e-recruitment system will allow development and promotion of the ABC employment brand through an enhanced ABC careers website. 112 ABC DIVISIONSThe ABC reached an agreement with the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) and the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) to extend the current ABC Employment Agreement 2006-09 beyond its nominal expiry date of 31 March 2009 to 30 June 2010. This extension was approved by the Workplace Authority and has provided more time to undertake a measured and detailed review of the Employment Agreement including forms of employment, work level standards and performance management. The ABC achieved significant improvements in OHS management during the year. Key to these improvements was a focus on preventative strategies. Part of the preventative focus was the delivery of specific concentrated OHS training to divisional risk areas, including the roll-out of fatigue management training for News, ABC Resources, Television and Radio Divisions. Through the effective management of OHS and injured worker rehabilitation and return to work, a significant decrease in the workers' compensation premium rate has been achieved, representing a significantly better than average performance when compared to other Comcare insured organisations for the 2008-09 period. This workers' compensation premium rate represents a considerable saving for the ABC (see Appendix 12, page 199). People and Learning continued Michael Millett Director of Communications Michael Millett has been Director of Communications since February 2009. His shift to the national broadcaster came after a long career in print journalism. For the previous two years he was deputy editor of The Sydney Morning Herald . In his 20-year stint with The Sydney Morning Herald , Michael also served as a political correspondent, Canberra bureau chief, North Asia correspondent based in Tokyo, senior writer and news editor. Before that, he worked in Canberra and Melbourne with the now defunct afternoon newspaper the Melbourne Herald .Corporate Communications3SECTION ABC DIVISIONS 113Government and Parliamentary Relations The Government and Parliamentary Unit liaises with parliamentarians, government and parliamentary committees, government agencies and industry groups on policy matters. The unit is the first point of contact for the Minister's office, the ABC's portfolio agency (the Department of Communications, Broadband and the Digital Economy) and other government agencies, as well as parliamentarians requesting information about the ABC. Communications played a key role in co-ordinating lobbying efforts by the ABC and some stakeholders in preparation for the 2009-10 Federal Budget. As Mark Scott noted, the outcome was a tribute to \"a true team effort and reflected collegiality at its best\". Government and Parliamentary Relations continued to expand its role as a conduit between the ABC and parliamentarians for other key ABC activities, such as the annual Heywire project for youth in regional and rural areas. In March 2009, the ABC hosted its second reception at Parliament House, inviting all Members and Senators. The Manager of Government and Parliamentary Relations coordinates the preparation and lodgment of answers to Questions on Notice from Senate Estimates Committee hearings. During the year, the ABC appeared before the Senate Estimates Committee twice and provided answers to 63 Questions on Notice. The ABC also provided submissions to a number of enquiries.Corporate Communications THE CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS unit manages the ABC's media relations and all corporate communications matters. This includes the ABC intranet, the ABC Corporate website About the ABC and all major policy announcements. The unit also produces two electronic publications: Access ABC , a monthly newsletter for external distribution, taking readers behind the scenes of the public broadcaster, and ABCYou , a fortnightly internal staff newsletter. The unit is currently managing a project to replace the ABC intranet with a new platform designed to foster collaboration across the Corporation and improve staff communication. The new site will be enabled with web 2.0 tools, including blogs, forums and wikis, and allow for features including online training. The site is due to go live at the end of 2009. Major ABC statements and news events handled by the Corporate Communications unit during 2008-09 included the triennial funding outcome for 2009-12, issues management regarding the ABC Production Review, information and news for ABC staff in Brisbane concerning the shift to a new accommodation site in the South Bank cultural precinct and the announcement of the ABC's new mobile web service, m.abc.net.au, in March 2009. Senator the Hon. Steven Conroy is joined by B1 and B2 at an ABC reception at Parliament House.114 ABC DIVISIONSIN MARCH 2009, the Corporate Strategy and Marketing Division was formed when the role of the former Corporate Development Division was expanded to include corporate governance, audience research and corporate marketing. The division is responsible for implementing the Corporation's strategic agenda through major cross-divisional projects, providing advice on strategic and governance issues, ensuring a holistic ABC response to strategic and regulatory matters, analysing ABC audiences, managing the ABC's brand, and corporate marketing. It plays a central role in shaping decision-making around critical issues within the ABC, including the evaluation of expenditure priorities, investment in technology and infrastructure and the development of funding proposals for government and other partners. Corporate Strategy and Marketing also provides a coordination role to enable effective policy formulation around strategic issues affecting multiple ABC divisions. This includes leading internal discussions to promote shared understanding and approaches to issues, as well as assisting in the identification of critical factors affecting decisions and providing supporting market and financial analysis. The division functions as a Corporation-wide \"consulting group,\" offering analytical skills and policy insights to assist divisions' decision-making. During 2008-09, the Corporate Strategy and Marketing team managed and led the preparation and presentation to government of the ABC's Triennial Funding Submission 2009-12 (see Financial Summary page 76) and completed a review of television rights. Corporate Strategy and Governance A key divisional focus is identifying and assessing issues of strategic importance to the current and future directions of the ABC. The Corporate Strategy and Governance unit provides advice to the ABC Board and management on technological innovations and world-wide trends in broadcasting, online services and public broadcasting to inform decision-making. The unit also provides strategic support, analysis and advice in relation to the ABC's external reporting and corporate governance activities. Corporate Strategy and Marketing Michael Ebeid Director of Corporate Strategy and Marketing Michael Ebeid joined the ABC in March 2008 as Director of Corporate Development and is now Director of Corporate Strategy and Marketing. Michael brings to the ABC over 20 years experience in information technology, telecommunications and media, having held senior management and executive positions at IBM, Optus and Westpac. He was also on the Board of ASTRA (Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association) from 2000 to 2004. Michael holds a Bachelor of Business (Accounting and Marketing) and is a graduate of INSEAD's IEP and AMP programs in France. He is a member of the Australian Society of Accountants.3 ABC DIVISIONS 115SECTION It coordinates corporate planning and cross- divisional policy work, produces the Annual Report and leads or participates in major corporate projects. Corporate Strategy and Governance has a central role in the ABC's regulatory response activities. During the year, it wrote or coordinated submissions to Parliamentary inquiries, Government Departments and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Corporate Development Corporate Development is responsible for assessing significant domestic and international opportunities to strengthen and grow the Corporation, including partnerships, acquisitions and divestments. Corporate Development provides a central coordination, delivery and reporting mechanism for the initiatives arising from the Production Review (see page 69). The unit oversees the development and validation of business cases for initiatives, coordinates the implementation process for each initiative, facilitates internal communications and expedites resolution of issues as they arise. In 2008-09, Corporate Development was also involved in a number of new projects, including: working with Rights Management and Legal to develop a negotiation strategy for dealings with key blanket rights music bodies; assisting Television Multi-Platform prepare a business case reviewing the processes by which content is published on iView; working with Television, ABC Resources and Capital Works to manage the ABC's transition to file-based broadcasting; assisting ABC Commercial review the ABC Books publishing business and in assisting Innovation develop an efficient content distribution strategy. Corporate Marketing The Corporate Marketing unit manages the ABC's brand, its partnerships with other Australian organisations, community events and cross- divisional marketing needs. Digital marketing staff within the unit provide advice across the Corporation on new marketing technologies and opportunities.In 2008-09, Corporate Marketing coordinated a refresh of the ABC's brand. The new, unified brand vision, which was developed in collaboration with divisional marketing heads, will become the basis for all ABC marketing activities in the second half of 2009. The group has also developed a detailed 18-month Strategic Marketing Plan which will ensure all marketing teams across the ABC work together to strengthen the ABC brand. The unit also continued to focus on brand awareness and identifying opportunities to reach new audiences. Corporate Marketing managed a number of internal and external Corporate events during this period, including the ABC Leaders' Conference, the 2008 Boyer Lectures presented by Rupert Murdoch and the annual ABC Showcase at Parliament House in Canberra. The Corporation's travelling Exhibition Trailer visited 18 events. Its schedule included: an Australia Day broadcast of ABC Classic FM in Hyde Park, Sydney; the Apollo Bay Music Festival in Victoria; the Mt Isa Rodeo; Gardening Australia Expos; and ongoing participation in Royal Agricultural Shows around the country. Corporate Marketing organises and manages public tours of the ABC Ultimo Centre in Sydney, attracting approximately 8 000 visitors to the complex in 2008-09, up from 7 332 in the previous year, with a total of 420 different groups visiting the centre. Currently there are 16 volunteer tour guides involved in the Ultimo program. The unit has also supported and implemented tours of studios in other States and Territories. Audience Research Since March 2009, Corporate Strategy and Marketing has been responsible for Audience Research on behalf of the Corporation. In 2008-09, the ABC subscribed to a range of quantitative services to measure audiences and commissioned a range of quantitative and qualitative research to help inform strategy, programming, scheduling and marketing decisions; and to gauge audience attitudes to the Corporation's services. Information on the ABC's audiences in 2008-09 can be found in ABC Audiences (page 38).116 ABC DIVISIONSTHE STATE AND TERRITORY DIRECTORS lead their local executive teams to facilitate whole-of- business and cross-divisional outcomes in their branches. Responsibility for the State and Territory Directors lies with Murray Green, Director of International (see page 98). As key representatives for the ABC at a local level, the State and Territory Directors play an important external role communicating the ABC's corporate objectives, liaising with key stakeholders, building relationships with local communities and providing a central point of contact for the branch. Internally, they oversee the business of the ABC in their region, lead their executive teams and strive to promote and facilitate whole-of-business and cross-divisional outcomes. They support and promote a culture where staff can do their best work. 2008-09 saw the continuation of local feedback forums across the country both in metropolitan and regional Australia. Regional forums were held in places as far reaching as Geraldton, Broome, Karratha, Albury, Burnie, Launceston, Loxton, Whyalla and Cairns. These gatherings continued to provide the ABC with valuable, direct feedback from stakeholders and audiences, which contribute to on-going strategic discussions. In the past year, the State and Territory Directors worked closely with a range of external partners including emergency services agencies (particularly in relation to the floods and cyclones in the north and west and fires in the south-east of the country) and other public institutions. They also represented the ABC on a variety of community boards and consultative committees. Regular, ongoing discussions with both Federal and State politicians provided an important local point of contact for the ABC. A number of Directors also assisted with election coverage planning in their branch.Some key external initiatives undertaken by the group included: the production of an Indigenous football documentary for ABC Television, In a League of Their Own (NT); a major road show of content in Whyalla (SA), and for the first time, the remote Kimberley and Pilbara regions (WA); the commencement of the Brisbane and Melbourne accommodation projects (Qld and Vic); and support for the ABC's contribution to the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. Internally, the group oversaw a number of key initiatives including: the roll-out of the ABC Workplace Giving initiative; chairing local Green Futures committees (including the creation of staff community gardens); creating cross-divisional ideas groups for multi-platform content; and assisting with the development of the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan. The State and Territory Directors were also instrumental in the launch and national roll-out of the new ABC Values. This took the form of staff consultation sessions in metropolitan and regional locations through to the launch and communication of ABC Values to staff. The group has a significant role in helping to monitor best practice standards of corporate governance and compliance within their branches. Various Directors were involved in governance functions such as: the Policy Reference Group; Operations Support Group; National Green Futures Steering Group; National Business Continuity Group; Editorial Policies Group; Election Coverage Review Committee; and Executive Risk Committee. Territory Director (ACT) continued to conduct Freedom of Information internal reviews while State Director (Tas) supported by Territory Director (NT) also continued in their roles on the Complaints Review Executive and State Director (SA) continued to work on the Production Review. Directors also gathered information for the ABC's entry into the Corporate Responsibility Index. In line with fostering relationships with international communities, the State Director (Tas) took on the role of Program Director for the Solomon Island's Media Assistance Scheme (SOLMAS).Corporate Strategy and Marketing continued State and Territory DirectorsSECTION3 ABC DIVISIONS 117THE BONNER COMMITTEE'S role is to advance Indigenous development across the Corporation including areas of employment, cross-cultural awareness and supporting Indigenous events both internally and externally. The Bonner Committee has played a role in supporting the development of the ABC's Indigenous Cultural Awareness package, providing input and advice regarding the content and format. The Committee's activities included attending NAIDOC Week events and supporting a range of content in programs that reflected the recognition of NAIDOC Week around Australia in July 2008. In July 2008, the annual Indigenous Staff Scholarship Awards were presented at Ultimo, Sydney. Each year as part of the Scholarship Awards the Committee also presents an award in recognition of the work of an ABC non-Indigenous employee who promotes and supports Indigenous employment and Indigenous initiatives. In 2008- 09, the Bonner Award was presented to Mary-Jane Stannus, Head of Content Services in the Business Services Division for her continued contribution to major Indigenous initiatives, including the cultural awareness program. The Committee is a key stakeholder in the development of the Corporation's Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Work is currently being undertaken on the RAP , which will be launched in October 2009 at the annual Indigenous Staff Conference. The Committee is named after the late Neville Bonner AO, who was an ABC Board Director from 1983-91 and Australia's first Indigenous Senator.Bonner Committee118 ABC DIVISIONS THE DIRECTOR OF EDITORIAL POLICIES has three main functions: to advise, verify and review in relation to compliance with the ABC's Editorial Policies . The Editorial Policies are the ABC's leading standards and a day-to-day reference for makers of content for radio, television, online and in print. They give practical shape to statutory obligations in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (ABC Act), in particular the obligations to: provide services of a high standard, maintain independence and integrity, and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. The Editorial Policies set out the ABC's self-regulatory standards and how it enforces them, and are the source for the ABC Code of Practice . The code is notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, as required by the ABC Act. Advise Advice work aims at clarity and consistency in the interpretation of the Editorial Policies . The Director is available to advise the Managing Director and other Directors. The divisions have their own Editorial Policies specialists and day-to-day queries follow the longstanding procedure for upward referral within each division. The Director of Editorial Policies develops training events, issues papers and guidance materials on which the divisions may draw for their own training programs. Verify Quality Assurance (QA) projects are designed and implemented each year to check whether the ABC is meeting the high standards it sets for itself. The projects assess samples of content that have already been broadcast or published. They do not deal in any way with content that is yet to be broadcast or published; that is a quality control responsibility which properly rests with the content divisions, subject to the editorial control of the Managing Director. The quality assurance work is also separate from the ABC's system for handling formal complaints about particular items of content. The Director of Editorial Policies' QA projects examine broad samples of ABC content. The sample may have been created initially for any one of the ABC's delivery platforms\u2014Radio, Television or Online. Of course, a large amount of ABC content appears on more than Paul Chadwick Director of Editorial Policies Paul Chadwick joined the ABC as the inaugural Director of Editorial Policies in January 2007. A journalist and lawyer, he was the first Privacy Commissioner of Victoria (2001-06). He ran the Victorian operations of the non-profit Communications Law Centre for eight years and was a member of the Brennan Committee that revised the Australian Journalists' Association Code of Ethics in the 1990s. In 1997, he received the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism. Paul holds an honours degree in Law (Melbourne) and is admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor of the Victorian Supreme Court and federal courts.Corporate Editorial Policies3 ABC DIVISIONS 119SECTION one platform, simultaneously or through methods such as podcasting or the iView service. The aim of the quality assurance work is to design and test fair and rigorous methodologies for projects that can then be undertaken regularly and cost effectively by the content-producing divisions themselves. The purpose is to contribute to accountability and to the continuous improvement of ABC content. Two projects in 2008-09 examined the accuracy of samples of radio news bulletins, a staple of the service the ABC provides to Australians. In the first, QA Project 6, a sample of 128 items was tested for accuracy, using the methodology developed for and successfully tested in QA Project 2 in 2007-08. The overall level of accuracy was high: 91.4% were accurate for plain facts and 93.8% were accurate for context. However, the results indicated that weekday bulletins may be more accurate than items in weekend bulletins and that metropolitan bulletins may be more accurate than regional radio news bulletins. QA Project 10 looked at another sample of items drawn from metropolitan and regional bulletins from weekdays and weekends. This confirmed the accuracy differential indicated in QA6, but also found a high to very high level of accuracy overall: 92% for plain facts and 97% for contextual accuracy. In response, the News Division said it would look closely at the differential in accuracy between weekday and weekend items and between metropolitan and regional items. A review was conducted of the three quality assurance projects which in 2007-08 assessed aspects of the impartiality of samples of ABC content on Radio, Television and Online. The findings of the review were taken into account in developing methodologies for the next three QA projects dealing with impartiality, which were ongoing as at 30 June 2009. Review As the ABC adapts to the swiftly-evolving media environment, the Editorial Policies must be continuously reviewed and updated. Changing circumstances, especially changing technologies, can reveal gaps in the Editorial Policies which, unless filled, make the standards difficult to apply in practice and may expose the ABC to risk of harm to reputation. In 2008-09 the following review major work was undertaken:User-generated content (UGC) Section 9 of the ABC Editorial Policies was revised to adapt the ABC to the opportunities and risks inherent in this rapidly growing field online. The Board adopted the amendments in December 2008 and they took effect on 1 March 2009. Use of Social Media The astonishing growth of social media such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter\u2014as third-party platforms for ABC content and as places online where ABC staff and contractors engage for official and private purposes\u2014poses complex and still-evolving policy challenges for all large media organisations. The Director of Editorial Policies, in consultation with colleagues from other divisions, led ongoing work to ensure the ABC's policies allow it to maximise the benefits of social media while minimising the risks. Self-regulation Framework Review The standards set out in the Editorial Policies are part of the larger framework by which the ABC self-regulates. The framework also includes training, dealing with audience responses, formal complaints handling, remedies and penalties, appropriate data collection and feedback through the Corporation of the results of self-regulation activities to promote both effective accountability and continuous quality improvement. The Managing Director established a review of the framework in 2008-09, to be conducted by the Director of Editorial Policies with the Chairman. The Review involved significant and wide-ranging internal and external consultation. It was ongoing as at 30 June 2009. Helping ABC International to help Cambodia In November 2008, the Director of Editorial Policies, as part of the ABC International Division's project to assist Cambodia's public broadcaster Radio National Kampuchea (RNK), visited Phnom Penh, reviewed initial implementation by RNK of Editorial Policies prepared for RNK and adopted by it in 2007, delivered workshops and undertook consultations with staff, management and the Minister responsible for broadcasting.120 ABC DIVISIONSRob Simpson Director of Legal Rob Simpson joined the ABC as Director of Legal in August 2007. Prior to that he was a partner at law firms Gilbert + Tobin and Baker & McKenzie. He has also had extensive experience as a corporate lawyer and member of management teams, including as the first General Counsel of Optus. Rob holds degrees in Arts and Law (Honours) from the University of Sydney.ABC LEGAL PROVIDES a comprehensive range of legal services to the Corporation including: Pre-publication advice on a 24-hour, seven days per week basis Conducting litigation on behalf of the Corporation Detailed advice on contractual and rights issues, regulatory regimes and the statutory obligations of ABC divisions Advice on legal aspects of policy issues and developing submissions to parliament, government and other organisations about law reform. During 2008-09, Legal was involved in a number of major technology and distribution projects including contracting for new Web Content and Broadcast Management Systems; successfully defended a defamation action by Professor Bruce Hall in respect of a 2002 Science Show report (currently under appeal); and contributed to submissions on law reform including proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Freedom of Information Act 1982 and a Senate committee inquiry into sports news reporting and digital media. Other significant projects included providing pre- publication advice on a number of controversial programs including Four Corners, \"Code of Silence\"; standardisation of Television contracting processes; extension of major contracts with Optus and Broadcast Australia; and completion of contracts for the launch of digital radio on 1 July 2009. Legal continued its in-house media law training program, which is aimed at minimising the ABC's exposure to legal proceedings by delivering a series of specialised media law workshops for content makers within the Corporation, covering topics such as contempt of court and defamation.Corporate LegalSECTION4 SUMMARY REPORTS 121The ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 includes three levels of performance measurement. The first level measures the effectiveness or outcome of ABC services in providing benefit to the Australian community. These measures and the ABC's performance against them in 2008-09 are set out in the Corporate Plan Summary (page 8). The second measures how well the ABC performs in relation to four high-level objectives. These measures encompass 11 key result areas across four dimensions of performance identified in the Plan: good governance; output and audiences; value for money; and learning and growth.The third level of evaluation relates to the actions and performance targets set for each of 18 strategic priorities. For reporting purposes, these targets are assessed as: Achieved Target reached, no further action required On Track On schedule towards achieving a measurable target or required standard Not Achieved Deadline passed without meeting target, or fundamental failure to achieve the required standard Ongoing Required standards have been achievement met and are being maintained. Work will continue indefinitely in these areas. Key Results Areas Measuring how well the ABC performs in relation to four areas of performance: good governance; output and audiences; value for money; and learning and growth\u2014measured twice yearly. Objective One\u2014 Ensure the ABC's independence, integrity and high standards. Efficiency of complaints management measured by performance against statutory and ABC-imposed timelines. During 2008-09, Audience and Consumer Affairs provided a personal response to 10 197 written complaints. Of these 80.3% were responded to within the 28-day time period specified in the ABC Editorial Policies . Overall, 99.73% of written complaints were responded to within 60 days, which is the statutory period for response to complaints about ABC Code of Practice matters. During the same period, the ABC's Complaints Review Executive reviewed 49 complaints. Of these 82% were responded to within 28 days and 100% within 60 days.Corporate Plan 2007-10 Section 4 Summary ReportsSection 4Summary Reports 122 SUMMARY REPORTSResults of Editorial Policy Assurance Surveys. Five Editorial Policies Quality Assurance (QA) Projects were undertaken during the reporting period, building on the five projects completed in 2007-08: QA 6 Accuracy (Radio News) examined the accuracy of ABC Radio news. A random sample of 150 items was checked. The result was 91.4% were accurate for plain facts and 93.8% were accurate for context. QA 10 examined another sample of ABC Radio news, with a focus on whether, as QA6 data had suggested, there was a difference in accuracy rates between metropolitan and regional bulletins and between weekday and weekend bulletins. The metropolitan and weekday bulletins were confirmed to be slightly more accurate. For the whole sample of 100 items the overall result was high to very high accuracy\u201492% for plain-facts accuracy and 97% for contextual accuracy. The purpose of QA 9 Impartiality (Election Coverage) was to design a fair and rigorous way to assess the impartiality of samples of election campaign coverage. The methodology was to be capable of being scaled up to assess much larger amounts of content drawn from radio and content from other platforms. As at 30 June 2009, the methodology was being piloted using a sample of ABC Local Radio Brisbane's coverage of the 2009 Queensland election and ABC Local Radio Canberra's coverage of the 2008 ACT election. Two other QA projects were still in progress as at 30 June 2009. Fulfilment of statutory and regulatory obligations. The Corporation believes it has fulfilled all of its statutory and regulatory obligations during 2008-09 with the exception of responding to all written complaints within the 60-day statutory period. The ABC responded to 99.73% of written complaints within 60-days.Environmental impact assessment and evidence of response. The ABC is continuing with the review, assessment and implementation of green initiatives. The position of Green Futures Co-ordinator has been established and filled to manage the Corporation's overall drive to meet its 2020 and 2050 targets. The Corporation has set targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% (to 60% of 1997 levels) by 2020 and by 60% (to 40% of 1997 levels) by 2050. In 2008-09, the ABC reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 0.9% to 43 375 tonnes CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) (from 43 758 tonnes CO2-e in 2007-08). Electricity consumption was reduced by 2%. The ABC performed well in the 2009 Corporate Responsibility Index, co-ordinated by the St James Ethics Centre (see page 75). (See also Commitment to a Greener Future page 65).

The technology allows journalists to browse and edit video at their desks and take direct creative control of their stories. The ScheduAll system has been upgraded to ensure optimum use of major production assets, provide an online planning solution for ABC Resources and client divisions to capture demand for facilities and labour and manage supply in real-time. Following the Production Review, a new transfer pricing approach was introduced from 1 July 2008. Divisions are now charged by ABC Resources for use of major assets as well as labour. Levels of new business activities. The following is a cross-section of activity during 2008-09. ABC iView was launched in July 2008. iView is a free internet broadcasting service, designed and built in-house by Innovation, which offers full- screen video, streamed on-demand and at a high resolution. ABC News Breakfast began on ABC2 in early November. The three-hour program is hosted by Virginia Trioli and Joe O'Brien. The program is using new technology, including studio automation, and is a key building block in the development of the ABC's Continuous News Centre. The Continuous News Centre, announced in March 2008, is being set up to provide multiple, simultaneous streams of news content, 24 hours a day, to every outlet of the ABC and any destination within the digital domain. The Asia Pacific News Centre was launched in November, merging the news resources of Radio Australia and Australia Network. With 60 journalists dedicated to 24-hour cross-platform coverage of Asia and the Pacific, the APNC will be one of the most significant multimedia newsrooms in the region. One of the APNC's first priorities was a merged website where audiences can explore a full range of multimedia news content.Objective Three\u2014 Deliver maximum benefit to the people of Australia through the effective and efficient delivery of ABC services. Levels of resource utilisation. The level of resource utilisation of production staff within the ABC Resources Division was 88.2% for 2008-09 compared to 89.2% in 2007-08. Levels of asset utilisation. Phase 1 of the ScheduAll software upgrade project saw the reconfiguration and expansion of the facilities that are provided to television production (News and general television) with significantly improved processes for accurately planning, assigning, recording and tracking facilities usage. Phase 1 also saw the tracking of actual usage statistics on facilities for television production. Whilst the precise levels of usage can now be reported, the next stage of the ScheduAll implementation involves defining capacity against which usage can be measured. Reporting of this data will commence in July 2009. Efficiencies delivered through business process re-engineering. The following provides a cross-section of activity during 2008-09. Major efficiency gains are being sought through increased studio automation with the replacement of Television News studio technology which is reaching the end of its life cycle. This technology will reduce capital and production costs. A Centralised Graphics Production project will improve the efficiency of graphics production for ABC Television News programs by making better use of the existing capacity of graphic designers and equipment in Sydney and Melbourne. Part of ABC Resources remit is to flexibly respond to the changing demands of the digital media environment. ABC Resources have been given incentives to increase utilisation of both resources and facilities through the hiring of production services to the ABC's output divisions or to the external market.Performance Against the Corporate Plan 2007-10 continued4 SUMMARY REPORTS 125SECTION and distribution of ABC Books); Pascal Press (logo license for ABC Reading Eggs ); Mobilestreams (for the distribution rights for mobile catalogue in Australia and New Zealand); Mio.TV (sale of rights to publish video short-form programming on Mio.

The following is a cross section of activity during 2008-09: In November 2008, the ABC joined Freeview, along with other free-to-air networks to help drive the take-up of digital television in Australia. Freeview will work with Government to ensure consistent messaging regarding the switch from analog to digital television broadcasting. Technology and Distribution continued to work closely with other free-to-air networks to support development of the Freeview receiver standard and Electronic Program Guide. Engagement with Government regarding the ABC's Triennial Funding Submission 2009-12 . ABC Radio liaised with emergency services, Broadcast Australia and other relevant bodies during the unprecedented bushfire crisis in Victoria in February 2009. 32 young Australians attended the annual Heywire Youth Issues Forum held in Canberra in February 2009. In March 2009, the ABC hosted its second reception at Parliament House, inviting all Members and Senators. Production partnerships: ongoing relationship and initiatives being developed with funding agencies including Film Australia, Australian Film Commission, State film funding bodies and the Australia Council.ABC Earth went live, allowing the audience to view selected ABC News and local content in Google Earth. Sydney Sidetracks was launched in November 2008. This is a website that presents selected audio and video archive recordings related to points of interest around inner city Sydney that can be explored via a map. The site also offers a version which can be downloaded to mobile phones. The project involved collaboration with a number of institutions, including the Powerhouse Museum, City of Sydney, National Film and Sound Archive and the State Library of NSW. The Cricket results site was established in time for the 4th test between Australia and India in early November. The site provided live scores and running commentary for all four matches in the series. Innovation established the ABC's presence on the Twitter platform. The importance of this new communication platform was apparent during the emergency broadcasting coverage of the February Victorian bushfires. A comprehensive suite of mobile phone products under the banner of ABC Mobile was launched in March. ABC Mobile includes m.abc.net.au, a website designed for mobile phones which can be accessed from any web enabled mobile phone handset, and a downloadable application for both the Apple iPhone and handsets running the Android operating system. During 2008-09, ABC Commercial entered a range of business ventures, including arrangements with BBC/Roadshow (DVD distribution); Zapruder's Other Films (development and production rights for Project Next ); Chaser Broadcasting (for the distribution rights for Lawrence Leung's Choose Your Own Adventure ); Spotty Ltd Partnership (Weta Productions, for the distribution rights for The Wot Wots ); iTunes (ABC Content Licensing Online\u2014Download to Own); HBO (Program Sales Worldwide for Summer Heights High ); ITV (for the DVD distribution rights for Lost in Austen and Wuthering Heights ); HarperCollins Publishing Australia (licensing partnership for the publishing 126 SUMMARY REPORTSObjective Four\u2014 Sustain and grow the ABC through high-quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity. Employee survey results. The restructure of the People and Learning Division was finalised in December 2008. Since then, the division has focused on the introduction of ABC Values (see page 60), and has also embarked on a significant business planning process. People and Learning aims to build employee engagement by creating a leadership culture based on ABC Values. In that context, an employee survey is not considered beneficial, and accordingly it no longer forms an integral part of the division's current plans. Measurement of employee engagement may be undertaken once further steps have been taken to embed ABC Values and enhance culture. Turnover and absenteeism benchmarked externally. The ABC tracks employee initiated separation and unscheduled leave. In the past, the Corporation has used free benchmarking services (updated annually) through the Australian Human Resource Institute (AHRI) and Info HRM Consulting. Those resources are no longer available. However, the ABC continues to report internal turnover and absenteeism results. Employee initiated separation (turnover) measures the proportion of the workforce that initiated its own separation from the ABC and indicates unplanned skill loss to the ABC. In 2008-09, the rate of turnover was 7.01% (compared to 9.98% in 2007-08). Unscheduled leave measures the percentage of available workdays employees are absent on personal leave for unscheduled reasons. This can be an indicator of employee morale and a predictor of future turnover. In 2008-09, the absence rate was 6.87 days per full time equivalent employee (compared to 6.71 days in 2007-08). This indicates that each employee, on average, is absent from work (for instance due to illness) for about seven days each year.Investment in staff learning and development. A level of 2.06% of base salary expenditure was spent on staff learning and development in 2008-09 (compared to 2.12% in 2007-08, incorrectly reported in that year as 2.14%). This is in line with the Corporate Plan target of a minimum of 2% of base salary expenditure. Performance against external occupational health and safety benchmark standards. In 2005, the ABC committed to national targets for occupational health and safety (OHS) performance established by Comcare for the period 2002-12. These targets relate to achieving reductions in workplace injury, lost time and time elapsed for return to work. Comcare measures performance against these targets for all Commonwealth agencies including the ABC. These measures provide benchmarks for the ABC to assess its performance in this area. Of the four targets, the ABC: met the targets relating to achieving workplace fatalities and reducing the average time taken for rehabilitation intervention in workers' compensation claims is on track to deliver on the target relating to reducing workplace injury and disease did not meet the target relating to reducing the average lost-time rate. However, a significant amount of lost time (38.4%) was directly linked to an isolated number of workplace illness cases, which affected performance against this target (See Appendix 12, page 199).Performance Against the Corporate Plan 2007-10 continued4 SUMMARY REPORTS 127SECTION Objective One\u2014 Ensure the ABC's independence, integrity and high standards.

The Directors' Responsibility for the Financial Statements The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , including Australian Accounting Standards (which include Australian Accounting Interpretations). This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor's Responsibility My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on my audit. My audit has been conducted in accordance with Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate Australian Auditing Standards. These auditing standards require me to comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Corporation's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion. 140 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORTIndependence In conducting the audit, I have followed the independence requirements of the Australian National Audit Office, which incorporate the requirements of the Australian accounting profession. Auditor's Opinion In my opinion, the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (a) have been prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , including Australian Accounting Standards; and (b) give a true and fair view of the matters required by the Finance Minister's Orders including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's financial position as at 30 June 2009 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\") are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. The financial report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2009 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 30 July 2009. 1.1 Basis of Accounting The financial statements and notes are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and are a General Purpose Financial Report. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (FMO) for reporting periods ending on or after 1 July 2008; and Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Equity have been prepared on an accruals basis and are in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities, which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial report is presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless disclosure of the full amount is specifically required. Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FMO, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Corporation's Balance Sheet when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under agreements equally proportionately unperformed are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Liabilities and assets that are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments and the Schedule of Contingencies (other than unquantifiable or remote contingencies, which are reported at Note 13: Contingent Assets and Liabilities). Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, revenues, gains and expenses are recognised in the Corporation's Income Statement when and only when the flow or consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.2 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions Significant Accounting JudgementsIn the process of applying the accounting policies, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied the following estimates and assumptions: Long service leave, as detailed in Note 1.11: Employee Benefits; Provision for make good, as detailed in Note 1.12: Leases; Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 1.21: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment; Depreciation, as detailed in Note 1.21: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment; and Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 1.22: Impairment of Non-Current Assets. No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next accounting period.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1511. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.3 Statement of Compliance Adoption of new Australian Accounting Standard requirements No accounting standard has been adopted earlier than the application date as stated in the standard. The following adopted requirements have affected the amounts reported in the current or prior periods or are estimated to have a financial effect in future reporting periods. AASB 1052: Disaggregated Disclosures The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008 and amends the disclosure requirements for entities to disclose departmental assets and liabilities by major activity, in addition to income and expenses. Major activities are considered to be equivalent to outcome, rather than output reporting. As such, assets, liabilities, income and expenses are disclosed by outcome, with additional disclosures required at the output group and output level for income and expenses, in Note 20: Reporting by Outcomes. AASB Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes The Interpretation provides guidance on accounting for customer loyalty programs. It discusses credits granted to customers as part of a sales transaction, which subject to meeting any further qualifying conditions, customers can redeem for free or discounted goods or services. This Interpretation is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008. This Interpretation affects all applicable ABC Shop sales transactions from 1 July 2008 and has the effect of reducing revenue recognised in the Income Statement and recognising a liability in the Balance Sheet for the equivalent monetary value of the loyalty points awarded. As there has been no material impact on the Income Statement from applying the new Interpretation, the ABC has elected not to retrospectively adjust for the impact on prior-year balances. Future Australian Accounting Standard requirements The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but are effective for future reporting periods. It is estimated that the impact of adopting these pronouncements when effective will have no material financial impact on future reporting periods. AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting These Standards are applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The changes introduce the notion of a \"complete set of financial statements\", which alters the structure and includes replacing the balance sheet with a statement of financial position and replacing the income statement with a statement of comprehensive income. The statement of comprehensive income will include all income and expense items, including those previously recognised in equity, such as asset revaluation increments. As a result of this standard, AASB 2007-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 101 and AASB 2008-9 Amendments to AASB 1049 for Consistency with AASB 101 were also issued and apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The Corporation has chosen not to early adopt this Accounting Standard to be consistent with the current FMO. AASB 2007-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 123 This amendment removes the option of expensing borrowing costs related to qualifying assets. This Standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The ABC has chosen not to early adopt this Standard as the current FMO stipulate that borrowing costs are to be expensed as incurred. There are other changes to the Australian Accounting Standards but these are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's reporting in future periods.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 152 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.4 Taxation The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive since the year ended 30 June 2000 up to and including 30 June 2009. Goods and Services Tax Revenues, gains, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Balance Sheet while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet. Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a net basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed on a gross basis. GST commitments recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are disclosed separately. 1.5 Foreign Currency Transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken through profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 1.6 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes relevant to the Corporation is presented in Note 20: Reporting by Outcomes. Any intra-government costs are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia. 1.7 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; the seller retains no managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods; the revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of GST upon delivery of the goods to customers.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1531. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.7 Revenue continued Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. Revenue is recognised when: the amount of revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms. Receivables for goods and sales, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due less any provision for bad and doubtful debts. The ability to collect debt is reviewed at the balance date. Provisions are made when the recovery of debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Revenues from Government receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts. Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. 1.8 Gains and losses Sale of AssetsGains or losses from disposal of non-current assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. 1.9 Grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have not been provided or eligibility criteria have not been met. 1.10 Transactions by the Government as Owner Revenue from Government Parliament appropriates monies to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) which are then distributed to the Corporation and recognised as revenue from Government. The full amount received in respect of departmental outputs for the year is disclosed in Note 3: Revenue from Government. Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as 'contributed equity' in accordance with the FMO. Other Distributions to Owners The FMO require that distributions to owners be debited to contributed equity unless in the nature of a dividend. The Corporation also received monies from the Government by way of loans as detailed in Note 9: Interest Bearing Liabilities. Contributions Income is measured at the fair value of the contributions received or receivable. Income arising from the contributions of an asset to the Corporation is recognised when the entity obtains control of the contribution or the right to receive the contribution, it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the Corporation and the amount of the contribution can be measured reliably.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 154 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.11 Employee Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extent that they have not been settled. Liabilities for short-term employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits ) and termination benefits due within twelve months are measured at their nominal amounts.The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave for the Corporation has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, Professional Financial Consulting Pty Ltd, as at 30 June 2009. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. The liability for long service leave represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to the balance date. Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation (ARIA) fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and ARIA are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance and Deregulation as an administered item. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June represents outstanding contributions for the last 9 days of the year.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1551. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.12 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases and operating leases. Finance leases effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets. An operating lease is a lease that is not a finance lease. In operating leases, the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Operating lease rentals are not segregated between minimum lease payments, contingent rents and sublease payments, as required by AASB 117 Leases , as these components are not individually material. Lease incentives taking the form of \"free\" leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. Provision for Make Good A provision for make good exists when the Corporation has an obligation to \"make good\" leased properties at the end of the lease term. As many of the leases are negotiable, the Corporation has determined the provision as set out below. Retail leased premises A provision has been recognised for all retail leases, where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement, based on the estimated costs to make good the site. Other leased premises A provision has been recognised for non-retail leased premises where the Corporation believes there is some likelihood that it will cease to occupy the leased premises in the future. The provision is calculated as follows: Leases expiring in: Method Less than 6 months 100% of estimated costs Greater than 6 months, but less than 1 year 75% of estimated costs Greater than 1 year, but less than 2 years 50% of estimated costs Greater than 2 years Nil A provision for those leases expiring later than two years has not been adopted as it is not possible to determine the probability of vacating the premises. 1.13 Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. 1.14 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 156 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.15 Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held-to-maturity investments; and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Fair Value through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; are a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or are derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised in the Income Statement except if they are classified as a cash-flow hedge where they are recognised in equity. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash-flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1571. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.15 Financial Assets continued Fair Value through Profit or Loss continued The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash-flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the Income Statement. Held-to-Maturity Investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash has been invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as \"other receivables\". Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. Trade debtors are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due, less an allowance for doubtful debt. Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each balance date. Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for loans and receivables or held to maturity investments held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced by way of an allowance account. The loss is recognised in the Income Statement. Held to maturity investments Investments held to maturity by the Corporation have maturities less than 12 months and Standard & Poors credit ratings of A- or better and are deemed not to be impaired. Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the probability of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 158 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.16 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as \"other financial liabilities\" in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. The fair value of loans from Government is deemed to be the initial principal amount. The Corporation does not have any commercial bank loans. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Corporation has the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Supplier and other payables are recognised at amortised cost. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Settlement is 30 days commercial or as otherwise negotiated. 1.17 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment is expensed as incurred. 1.18 Joint Ventures Joint Ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with AASB 131 Interests in Joint Ventures and the FMO . Further details relating to joint ventures, to which the Corporation is a party to, are provided in Note 15: Related Party Disclosures. 1.19 Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the relevant schedule and Note 13: Contingent Assets and Liabilities. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability, or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. 1.20 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1591. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.21 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Balance Sheet. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Basis of Revaluation Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value. Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below. Asset Class Fair Value Measured at Freehold Land Market Value Freehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Land Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Improvements Depreciated replacement cost Infrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Following initial recognition at cost, property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary, with the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised through profit and loss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit and loss except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2009 2008 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold buildings Life of Lease Life of Lease Leasehold improvements 5 to 99 years 5 to 99 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years 3 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation and amortisation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 5C: Depreciation and amortisation. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are stated in the Balance Sheet at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 160 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.22 Impairment of Non-Current Assets All non-current assets except: inventories; assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . At the reporting date, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired. Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 1.23 Intangible Assets The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use, broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-6 years (2008 3-6 years). These assets are assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amounts of impaired assets are written down to the higher of their net market selling price or depreciated replacement cost. The Corporation's right to use broadcast licences and spectrum are held at their fair value.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1611. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.24 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Produced Programs External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Balance Sheet. The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics\u2014100% on first screening; Children's, Education and Movies\u2014straight line over three years from completion of production; Programs produced specifically for ABC2\u2014equally over three years; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; and Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. The costs of programs produced for Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur.Write-down of Merchandise Inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value, will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of Inventory Held for Distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. 1.25 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 162 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS2.

In December 2008, the ABC formally appointed Colliers International as agent to sell the site.

The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous period. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a continuous basis. To meet the Corporation's financial risk management objectives, surplus cash has been invested into short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as \"other receivables\".Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 176 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS12. Financial Instruments continued 12.3 Financial Risk Management continued The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies as approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 12.4 Market Risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, which is detailed in Note 12.5: Foreign Currency Risk, and interest rate risk, which is detailed in Note 12.7: Interest Rate Risk. The Corporation is not exposed to any other price risk on financial instruments. 12.5 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in foreign exchange rates. The Corporation's activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not Australian dollars. The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk arising from some of these transactions. The Corporation is exposed to foreign currency denominated in United States Dollar (USD), Great British Pounds (GBP) and Euro (EUR). The following table details the effect on the profit and equity as at 30 June from a 12% favourable/unfavourable change in the rate of the AUS dollar against the currencies to which the Corporation is exposed, with all other variables held constant.

Financial Instruments continued 12.6 Hedging Instruments Specific Hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50 000 or greater (equivalent) are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. The net loss of $39 383 (2008 $21 584) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2008 to June 2009 has been recognised at balance date in the Statement of Changes in Equity. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective. The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. Sell Australian Dollars Average Exchange Rate 2009 2008 2009 2008 $'000 $'000 Buy USD Less than 1 year 1 295 2 087 0.7423 0.9094 Buy GBP Less than 1 year 51 849 0.4927 0.4709 Buy EUR Less than 1 year 73 82 0.5617 0.6111 General Hedges The Corporation also enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50 000 (equivalent) of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is generally held between 40% to 60% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been recognised in the Income Statement. The net gain of $52 528 (2008 net loss $41 669) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2008 to June 2009 has been recognised at balance date in the Income Statement. 12.7 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Corporation is not exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings, as all borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The Corporation derives interest revenue from funds invested, which is impacted by interest rate fluctuations. Although, the Corporation is not dependent on interest revenue to continue operations, a 0.75% decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease in interest revenue of $1 600 698 (2008 $1 385 136) and a 0.75% increase in the interest rate would result in an increase in interest revenue of $1 600 698 (2008 $1 385 136). The change in interest revenue is proportional to the change in interest rates. 12.8 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Corporation will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Corporation is dependent upon indirect revenue from Government. In excess of 79% (2008 78%) of normal activities are funded in this manner, and without these appropriations the Corporation would be unable to meet its obligations.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 178 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS12.

Loans from Government are provided on a long-term, fixed interest rate basis. 12.9 Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and derivative instruments. The Corporation has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation undertakes credit ratings assessments through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17912. Financial Instruments continued 12.9 Credit Risk continued The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of allowance for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in the Balance Sheet. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts, as disclosed.

Output cost attribution The ABC's price of outputs is determined through an attribution process that identifies those costs and revenues directly related to the provision of a particular output. Those support costs and revenues that can be attributed as directly supporting a particular output and other overhead costs and revenues are attributed across outputs on a notional basis. This attribution approach is applied fully in determining the price of outputs for Radio, Television and New Media within Outcome 1. The price of outputs for Outcome 2 and Outcome 3 consist entirely of direct costs, as these outcomes are comprised entirely of dedicated analog and digital transmission functions.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 186 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS20.

Human Resources Committee The Human Resources Committee considers the remuneration of the Managing Director and Executives, and the Managing Director's annual performance appraisal. The Committee did not formally meet in 2008-09 as these matters were dealt with in Board meetings.Appendix 4\u2014ABC Board and Board Committees Audit and Risk Committee The Audit and Risk Committee provides independent assistance to the ABC Board on the Corporation's risk, control and compliance framework, and its external accountability. The Audit and Risk Committee also provides a forum for communication between the Board, senior management and both internal and external auditors. The Committee met on five occasions during 2008-09:Meeting No. 3 2008 30 July 2008 Meeting No. 4 2008 18 September 2008 Meeting No. 5 2008 10 December 2008 Meeting No. 1 2009 19 March 2009 Meeting No. 2 2009 14 May 2009Meetings during 2008-09 were attended by Steven Skala, Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, Peter Hurley and John Brown. John Brown was appointed to the Audit and Risk Committee in December 2007 and is not a member of the Board. Committee meetings are also attended by the Chief Operating Officer, Head Group Audit and a representative of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The Chairman of the Board, the Managing Director and other members of the Board also attend Committee meetings. Appendix 5\u2014Audit and Risk CommitteeAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 193Appendix 5\u2014Audit and Risk Committee continued At its meetings, the Audit and Risk Committee endorsed the 2007-08 Annual Financial Statements and monitored progress against the 2008-09 Audit Plan. During 2008-09, the Committee conducted an assessment of its performance and reviewed the Audit and Risk Committee Charter to ensure it aligned with best practice. The Committee also noted the implementation of audit recommendations by management, fraud awareness initiatives and fraud investigations undertaken. The Committee dealt with matters related to, and reports from, external audit and the Corporation's requirement to formally report on compliance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . During its meetings in 2008-09, the Committee also endorsed the 2009-10 Audit Plan for approval by the Board and considered and discussed the findings of audit reports and the performance of ABC Group Audit in providing services to the Corporation. The Audit and Risk Committee also considered information papers related to risk management and compliance matters and matters related to the preparation and finalisation of the 2008-09 Annual Financial Statements. Group Audit Group Audit provides an independent and objective audit, review and advisory service to: Provide assurance to the Board that the Corporation's financial and operational controls, designed to manage the organisation's risks and support the achievement of the Corporation's objectives, are operating in an efficient and effective manner Assist management in improving the Corporation's business performance. Group Audit is responsible to the Audit and Risk Committee for contributing to the achievement of the Corporation's goals and objectives by: Assisting management in evaluating processes for identifying, assessing and managing the key operational, financial and compliance risks of the ABC Assisting management in evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems, including compliance with internal policies Recommending improvements in efficiency to the internal control systems established by management Being responsive to the Corporation's changing needs, striving for continuous improvement and monitoring integrity in the performance of its activities Facilitating the integration of risk management into day-to-day business activities and processes Developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity and promoting a culture of cost-consciousness, self assessment and adherence to high ethical standards. Group Audit is responsible for generating and implementing the ABC's Audit Plan, which seeks to ensure that audits focus on key risk areas to the Corporation. The Audit Plan is endorsed by the Audit and Risk Committee and approved by the Board annually. In 2008-09, Group Audit performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to utilise technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. Group Audit also provided advice and guidance on good governance, policies and controls, and provided advice and input on a number of key projects and initiatives being undertaken by the Corporation. Group Audit reviewed the processes implemented by the Corporation to support reporting requirements in respect of compliance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . During 2008-09, Group Audit continued to operate with a combination of in-house staff and outsourced external providers. This provided access to expertise in specialist areas and supplemented internal resources and experience. It also helped to ensure that the internal audit function continued to be aligned with industry better practice. Coordination with External Auditors Group Audit continued to liaise with the ABC's external auditors, the ANAO and its nominated representatives, KPMG, who were appointed during 2008-09. It sought advice regarding proposed areas of focus, the identification of areas of potential ABC reliance on Group Audit and to ensure that there was minimal duplication of audit coverage. In this regard, the ANAO, KPMG and Group Audit developed a Coordinated Audit Plan for 2008-09, highlighting areas of audit coverage and reliance, as well as audit coverage of ABC strategic risk and financial reporting risk areas.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 194 APPENDICESAppendix 6\u2014ABC Advisory Council In 2008-09, the ABC Advisory Council met three times. It made seven recommendations and 16 commendations. Advisory Council Members Jane Munro\u2014Convenor Joanne Roach Geoffrey Cadogan-Cowper Joshua Knackstredt Jaime Phillips Anthony Peters Catherine Prosser Joel Buchholz Rosemary Redgen Moira Neagle Victoria Shenstone Craig Wallace Summary of Recommendations, Responses and Commendations 2008-09 Recommendation R1/2/08 Collectors The Advisory Council recognises the incredible popularity and excellent presentation of the television program, Collectors and suggests that the magazine which accompanies each series be published more frequently. Director of ABC Commercial: The Director of ABC Commercial thanks the Advisory Council for their recommendation. In order to increase the frequency of the Collectors magazine, and to meet the resulting increase in editorial and advertising sales demands, ABC Commercial would need to engage an external publisher to publish under licence to the ABC. ABC Commercial has explored this option and has an interested publisher. However, it needs to further build sales and advertising to make a revenue share more profitable for the ABC than the existing arrangements, under which the ABC publishes the magazine itself twice a year. ABC Commercial may look to engage the external publisher from next financial year, dependent on the ongoing success of the magazine and the Collectors program. Recommendation R2/2/08 Design The Advisory Council suggest a program on three-dimensional design, in areas such as jewellery, domestic objects, textiles and furniture. The design of new products is a strong impetus for creativity and innovation in society, inviting the user to re-imagine the way they shape their world. A strong design industry helps to create distinctive cities and local cultures, stimulating economic activity. A five-minute program profiling a designer, their influences and the iterative/inventive process of design would be appropriate. Potential subjects could include Marc Newson, Julia deVille, Jon Goulder and Akira Isogawa. Director of Television: Each week the ABC program New Inventors regularly showcases the design of innovative new products including domestic household objects, various aids, furniture, electrical and mobility and other designs all seeking to bring benefits to everyday life. The program seeks to showcase the actual invention and design process of each week's contestants with filmed and studio segments. In tandem the program seeks, through showing by example and the encouragement of the show's host and regular panel, the nurturing of a strong, creative and innovative design industry and for the viewer to enjoy and have an awareness of the benefits, complexity and sometimes simplicity of modern design. Director of Radio: Council may not be aware that ABC Radio National's weekly By Design program presented by Alan Saunders includes items covering Australian designs for new products. The program deals with architecture and material culture, from the latest developments in urban design through to the design of everything that humans make, from cars to clothes. It is broadcast first on Saturday mornings at 9.00 am and repeated at 3.00 pm on Wednesday afternoons. It is also available as a podcast and can be downloaded at abc.net.au/rn/bydesign/. Council's suggestions regarding potential subjects for interview have been passed on to the program. In addition, ABC Local Radio covers aspects of these and other related topics from local and regional perspectives. A range of this content is available and searchable online through abc.net.au/local/. R3/2/08 Urban Planning and City-Building The Advisory Council recommends greater coverage of urban planning and design, looking at the creative and practical processes that underpin the development of Australian cities. How do architecture, landscape design and commercial streetscapes contribute to the social fabric, sustainability and liveability of our cities? Director of Television: The issues of urban planning and design has been covered in the following programs: Walks with an Architect; The Perfect Home; Building the Gherkin; I Love Carbuncles; Stone Upon Stone Upon Stone; Raising Valhalla; Frank Lloyd Wright: Murder, Myth and Modernisation; Daniel Libekind: The Making of an Architect; Sir John Sloane: An English Architect, An American Legacy; Invitation To A Voyage: Eileen Gray, Designer and Architect and IOU: Robin Boyd .Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 195Director of Radio: ABC Radio National's weekly program By Design also includes a strong element of coverage of urban planning and design. While there isn't a dedicated program on ABC Local Radio, these issues are covered frequently in regular Radio and Online content, from local and regional as well as state and national perspectives. R1/3/08 Reality Check Council recommends that ABC programming reduce the airing of commercial-style \"reality\" programs such as Navy Divers, Brat Camp and Chopper Rescue as the Council feels that the demand for these programs are well catered for by other networks. Director of ABC Television: ABC Television notes the Council's recommendation. However, ABC Television believes that these documentaries add to the range of diverse programming presented on ABC platforms. The programs were popular and appreciated by our audiences. R2/3/08 State and Territory Election Coverage Council noting recent feedback recommends that when utilising expertise of national analysts, commentators and presenters in the coverage of State and Territory elections, the ABC ensure these staff are adequately briefed in relation to details such as pronunciation of local placenames and aspects of the political landscape idiosyncratic to the area. Director of News: News acknowledges the point raised. Great care is taken by the likes of Antony Green and Kerry O'Brien to ensure they get local pronunciations correct. Sometimes, some commentators err and News is acutely aware that these errors can affect the credibility of the ABC's election coverage. The Council's feedback has been noted and forwarded to the Executive Producer, Election Coverage. Director of Radio: Wherever possible, ABC Radio makes use of national analysts, commentators and presenters in the coverage of State and Territory elections and ensures that they are made aware of pronunciation of candidates and local placenames, as well as unique characteristics of the local political landscape. Radio notes the Council's comments and feedback, and will keep this recommendation in mind for future election coverage. R3/3/08 The ABC's Online Educational Presence Council recommends that, in the development of the ABC's proposed online education portal, the ABC addresses issues in the current abc.net.au/learn domain pertaining to inconsistent style, dated content and uneven attention to different areas of the curriculum. The ABC should aspire to the portal becoming the nation's pre-eminent online learning environment and educational resource repository. As such, it will be vital for the ABC to: Enhance partnerships with schools, educational authorities and universities Respond to the changing national curriculum landscape Connect authentically and seamlessly to other ABC content and platforms Effectively promote access to schools, teachers, students and parents. Director of Television: ABC Television notes the Council's recommendation and that the Managing Director has recently established a cross-divisional Education Group, convened by the Director of ABC Commercial, with the aim of better coordinating educational content and programming, both existing and planned. ABC Television is represented on this group, which it believes will address issues raised by the Council. Director of News: The Council's recommendation on ABC's Online Educational presence has been noted. Director of ABC Commercial: ABC Commercial's educational activities leverage ABC-generated content as well as best-practice educational information. This information and related materials are developed for children, parents, students and teachers and are provided across a range of platforms and channels, including online. ABC Commercial publishes Behind the News Magazine and Behind the News Teacher's Kit , which complement ABC Television's long-standing educational initiative for students to learn about current issues and events. Both these publications refer readers back to the relevant link on abc.net.au. ABC Commercial has recently launched, ABC Reading Eggs, a digital learning portal to help children learn to read, in partnership with Pascal Press. Developed by an experienced team of teachers and educational writers and developers, the portal focuses on a core reading curriculum using skills and strategies which complement what children are learning at school. Director of Innovation: ABC Innovation would like to thank the Advisory Council for their recommendation. The proposed development is under active consideration and Innovation will keep the Council informed. Director of ABC International: Australia Network's and Radio Australia's educational programming focuses on providing English-language learning (ELL) content to overseas audiences. This is provided in the form of television programs and segments, multilingual radio programs and associated online content. The online content includes a range of downloadable podcasts and vodcasts so that audiences can access the content whenever and wherever they choose.Appendix 6\u2014ABC Advisory Council continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 196 APPENDICESMuch of the above content has been produced in cooperation with educational institutions, including AMES (Adult Multicultural Education Services) and Insearch at the University of Technology, Sydney. Discussions have been initiated with several Australian universities and other educational institutions to explore further opportunities for cooperation. R1/1/09 Improved indexing system for delicious While Council acknowledges that the annual indices published in the December/January issue of delicious magazine each year and also on the web are useful, Council recommends that a cumulative index which collates all previous annual indices in a single, consistent fashion would be of benefit to the many readers who collect all their magazines over many years. A format which allows users to easily mark their favourite recipes would also be of benefit. Director of ABC Commercial: delicious magazine has looked into publishing a Lifetime Recipe Index at various times. Unfortunately, it is not financially viable. Each annual index runs to around 16 pages, so a Lifetime Recipe Index would run to well over 100 pages. This would be very expensive due to the cost of printing an additional edition of the magazine. As indexes are traditionally offered as free supplements to the magazine, a Lifetime Recipe Index could only be funded via advertising or sponsorship. In the current economic climate, advertising spend budgets are tight. There has not been sufficient advertiser interest to make publishing of a Lifetime Recipe Index financially viable. Currently, delicious has searchable indexes online from 2002 to 2008 (in the form of searchable PDFs) at deliciousmagazine.com.au. It is agreed it would be valuable and useful to be able to collate all of the recipes into a single, searchable database, but it has previously not been determined to be cost-effective. delicious is now in the process of redesigning its website, and is examining whether new technology would allow this option to be revisited. Commendations The ABC Advisory Council commended the following programs and publications: Australia: Land of Parrots; Wild China; The Elders with Andrew Denton; The Gruen Transfer; and Life at 1/Life at 3 . Also the Council commends the coverage of the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games by the Grandstand Team; ABC Television for iView; ABC Radio National for the ABC hosting of the National Poetry Slam; ABC Television for making politics, both past and present, accessible, engaging and entertaining for Australians via a range of programs such as The Howard Years, The Hollowmen, Q&A and the series of documentaries on past Prime Ministers; Radio National for its consistently high-quality programs, such as Breakfast with Fran Kelly, The Book Show, By Design, Background Briefing, Australia Talks; Q&A and Tony Jones for the program's strong format and public-interest content; Irene Poinkin for her assiduous, erudite and humorous defence of the English language; the ABC for its increased coverage of the Australian arts scene in all its forms and the ABC's coverage of the 2009 Victorian bushfires.

The ABC's performance in this area is measured through: Implementation and auditing of a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system Incident and workers' compensation claim statistics Performance against the Comcare National OHS Strategy Targets 2002-12 ABC workers' compensation premium rates. ABC OHS Management System Initiatives The ABC implemented a number of initiatives in 2008-09 to ensure the continued improvement of its OHS management system including: Appointing an OHS Manager. Reporting to the Head of Industrial Relations, the OHS Manager is responsible for developing strategies, advice and services to assist the ABC to achieve its business objectives and ensure compliance with relevant legislation, industrial agreements and duty of care. Appointment of a part-time Injury Prevention and Management Adviser. Reporting to the OHS Manager, the Injury Prevention and Management Adviser is responsible for the development and implementation of national injury management and prevention strategies aimed at the progressive reduction of injury numbers and severity. This complements the National OHS Adviser position, also reporting to the OHS Manager. The National OHS Adviser is responsible for providing advice and support to the ABC on technical OHS matters, the implementation of the OHS management system and coordinating cross-divisional collaboration to ensure consistency in the delivery of OHS. Coordinated cross-divisional approach to safety and security at events in which the ABC participates, organises or manages. In 2008-09, Radio launched an OHS intranet site addressing safety issues associated with Outside Broadcasts. Radio worked with Legal, and the risk and insurance units to develop standard processes and documents for use across Radio. A training module was also developed and rolled out across Radio's networks. Ergonomic assessments provided to staff on request to promote safe working practices and reduce the incidence of occupational overuse injuries and muscular strains. A total of 182 ergonomic assessments nationally were completed in 2008-09, with 21 being for compensable cases and 161 as injury-prevention measures. Amalgamation of the National OHS Management Group and the Executive Risk Committee to better coordinate risk management of common and cross-divisional safety issues and to provide a clear line of reporting to the Board Audit and Risk Committee. These initiatives are in addition to the range of existing strategies previously reported such as: OHS consultative framework including state-based OHS Committees to address local issues Divisionally-based OHS Groups in the ABC Resources and Technology and Distribution Divisions The ABCWorkSafe Incident Reporting and Return to Work computer modules to monitor safety incidents and better manage the return to work of ill and injured employees Quarterly ABC OHS reports of compensation and incident data and analysis on a divisional basis for areas to better manage their OHS responsibilities Hazard identification and risk assessment procedures, governing activities and projects in which the ABC participates Ongoing review and development of the ABC A-Z of Safety site providing online advice for Managers, employees and contractors to manage operational OHS risks Including in employee job plans individual role-based safety accountabilitiesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 200 APPENDICES Ongoing electrical appliance inspection, testing and tagging program delivered nationally Ergonomic assessment and advice provided to divisions on request, and where new technologies and new equipment have been introduced in order to prevent injuries. Management of injured workers continues to promote early and durable return-to-work outcomes through the implementation of rehabilitation programs, reducing workers' compensation costs and \"lost time\" through injury and illness, specifically through: Promoting early intervention in all cases, particularly where employees are likely to be off work for five days or more Development of return to work plans for all employees that are expected to be off work for more than 10 days to ensure a safe and durable return-to-work outcome Collection and analysis of incident and workers' compensation claims data to identify trends within the workplace. Comcare Improvement Notices Comcare issued no Prohibition Notices or Improvement Notices to the ABC under the Act. The ABC implemented Comcare recommendations based upon investigations throughout the year. Employee Assistance Program The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) continues to provide and receive wide support to and from ABC managers, staff and families. The rate at which employees and their families used this service in the year to 30 June 2009 was 5.75%, which is a slight increase on 5.36% for 2007-08. This represents a greater usage by the ABC than the average across media and entertainment organisations of 3.52%. The EAP service was accessed in every State and Territory during the 2008-09 financial year with reported high levels of EAP awareness amongst staff. A breakdown of issues presented to the EAP show that 69% of issues were personal issues and 31% work-related issues. Twelve specialised trauma sessions were requested by the ABC during 2008-09 for employees who attended significant trauma events where their well-being was likely to have been affected. The Managers Assist service was accessed by 23 ABC managers during 2008-09. Incident and Claim Statistics 2008-09 A total of 217 incidents were logged in ABCWorksafe in 2008-09. This compared favourably to the 259 OHS-related incidents reported in 2007-08. Since ABCWorksafe was implemented in 2005, it has enabled the tracking of serious incidents and identified trends or problem areas allowing preventative strategies to be implemented. This has helped to facilitate an early response to injury management and minimise incident recurrence, reducing workplace injury. Of the 217 incidents, 60 claims for workers' compensation have been accepted by Comcare to date. An analysis of the workers' compensation claims in 2008-09 shows that the main types of injuries contributing to the ABC's workers' compensation premium were body stressing and slips, trips and falls. While there are fewer slips, trips and falls than manual handling injuries, per claim they are more expensive. As a comparison, body stressing accounted for 50% of workers' compensation claims this financial year and only 29% of workers' compensation claim costs, while slips, trips and falls accounted for 17% of workers' compensation claims, yet 36% of workers' compensation costs. Over the past four financial years, mental stress workers' compensation claims have continued to decline. In 2008-09, mental stress workers' compensation claims accounted for 3% of workers' compensation claims and 14% of workers' compensation costs. Whilst this is an increase from 2007-08 (when there were zero mental stress workers' compensation claims) it is a significant decrease from the 2005-06, when mental stress claims were 7% of claims and 32% of actual costs, and 2006-07, when mental stress claims accounted for 6% and 34% of actual costs. There has been an overall decline in both the number of workers' compensation claims and in the average workers' compensation total cost (cost-to-date plus likely future costs) of each claim, which for 2008-09 was $10 626 compared with $14 563 for 2007-08. This compares favourably to the Australian Government Agency average total cost of $29 886. The average cost to date for ABC workers' compensation claims for 2008-09 is $2 419, compared to the Australian Government Agency average cost to date of $5 535. ABC injury prevention activities in the 10-year period between 1998-99 and 2008-09 has seen the number of all workers' compensation injury claims at that time reduce by 60% from 148 to 60. This figure is adjusted by Comcare over time to account for retrospective claims. The sustained improvement in the ABC's OHS performance is evidenced by the 2009-10 workers' compensation premium of $1 753 187, representing a 44% reduction on the $3 151 923 premium for 2008-09.Appendix 12\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 201OHS Training OHS training programs specific to divisional OHS risks and hazardous operations programs delivered included: Fatigue Management. Initially training commenced in New South Wales, and was delivered to the News, ABC Resources, Television and Radio Divisions. The purpose of the training is to address the risks of fatigue in operational areas. The approach has been cross-divisional and a selection of employees have been trained as trainers to present this package to their colleagues. To date, 220 employees have been trained in New South Wales with positive feedback received, indicating the content is relevant to the participant's work. The delivery of training to other ABC Divisions including Business Services, Technology and Distribution, and Innovation is planned for 2009-10. Online Ergonomics, Manual Handling and OHS Induction Training packages. Implementation of an OHS-specific module within the ABC \"New Managers\" Training Program to support and encourage good OHS management practices.

Target 1\u2014Reduce Incidence of Workplace Injury and Disease by 40% The ABC remains on target to reduce the incidence of workplace injury and disease, resulting in a decrease in workers' compensation claims. This change represents a significant improvement from 2007-08. The following graph represents the number of claims with a fifth day of incapacity determined in that financial year. Target 2\u2014 Zero Workplace Fatalities The ABC met this target. There were no workplace fatalities in 2008-09.The following graphs demonstrate that in 2008-09, the ABC achieved a continued improvement in reducing the incidence of workplace injury and disease-related workers' compensation claims. These graphs are current as at July 2009. However, due to latency effects and retrospective claims as reported by Comcare the 2008-09 data must be considered \"immature\" and the ultimate incidence rate, lost time and rehabilitation intervention rate may differ from the information reported here.

Analysis of the claims contributing to the ABC's workers' compensation lost-time incidence rate indicates that 237.6 incapacity weeks lost by ABC employees were directly linked to a number of isolated workplace illness cases which significantly affected this target. Without including these illness cases, the ABC would have recorded 381 weeks of ABC employee incapacity, close to the targeted 375 weeks. Target 4\u2014Reduce Average Time Taken for Rehabilitation Intervention by 90% Target 4 measures the average number of weeks after the date of an injury for the employee to return to work. The ABC has met this target for 2008-09. Strategies for continued improvement against this target include: Developing and implementing a \"Return to Work Plan\" for rehabilitation cases where an employee is likely to be off work for more than 10 days Immediate case manager contact with the injured worker, once notified via ABCWorksafe or referred by their manager.Appendix 12\u2014Occupational p Target WksWeeks of lost time Claims with incapacity determined in Target W eeksAverage weeks for return-to-work activity to commence Claims with the first rehabilitation service date in each financial year Source: ComcareAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 204 APPENDICESThe ABC's workers' compensation premium rate continues to improve. This represents a financial saving for the ABC. The ABC's current workers' compensation premium rate at 0.59% of total salary costs is lower than the Commonwealth average of 1.25% of salary costs, and represents a substantially better-than-average performance in injury prevention and management than other Comcare insured organisations in 2008-09. The ABC also compares favourably to the Government average in relation to the estimated claim frequency and the average lifetime claim cost.Appendix 12\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continued Claim Frequency and Cost Compared to the Australian Government Average ABC 2008 2007 2006 2005 Estimated Claim Frequency (per $m of payroll) * 0.22 0.28 0.39 0.44 Average Lifetime Claim Cost (after capping) $18 584 $7 963 $12 969 $16 272 All Australian Government Premium Paying Agencies Estimated Claim Frequency (per $m of payroll) * 0.21 0.26 0.39 0.45 Average Lifetime Claim Cost $41 182 $35 055 $31 384 $31 031 * Estimate at end May 2009 Development at end February 2009ABC Workers' Compensation Premium Rates ABC Performance Against Australian Government Agencies Combined Premium Rates 2009-10 2008-09 2007-08 2006-07 ABC Premium Rates 0.59% 0.63% 0.86% all Australian Government Agencies Combined 1.25% 1.36% 1.55% 1.77%Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 205Compliance with Performance Reporting Framework The ABC is required to report on its performance in meeting the Commonwealth Disability Strategy under two of the designated core government roles of Employer and Provider. Employer Employment policies, procedures and practices comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . The ABC Disability Action Plan, which forms part of the Equity and Diversity Plan, includes strategies for recruitment, selection, training, development and support. Strategies included in the Equity and Diversity Plan are linked to the Corporation's plans and retain the target of 5% representation of staff with disabilities of the total workforce. The ABC's representation of non-casual employees with disabilities was 8.9% at 30 June 2009, compared with 9.4% in 2008. The ABC's Equity and Diversity in the ABC: An Overview includes references to people with disabilities and a statement about access and equity for people with disabilities. Recruitment and selection guidelines advise on selection processes, merit selection and avoidance of stereotyping, assumptions and discrimination. The ABC Workplace Values and Code of Conduct include references to values that provide for a workplace that is free from discrimination and that promote equity in employment and a workplace that values diversity. New ABC Values of Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation were introduced in 2009, following extensive consultations with staff (see page 60). ABC employees are required to be aware of and apply the ABC's Discrimination and Harassment Policy and the principles of the Equity and Diversity Plan and comply with Australian anti-discrimination legislation. Relevant plans, policies and guidelines are available to staff on the ABC's intranet site. State People and Learning Managers have access to information on external disability organisations, contacts and resources to assist managers and staff. The News and Radio Divisions have provided job opportunities in conjunction with external disability agency programs. The Television Division has participated in an external mentoring program, coordinated by the Australian Employers' Network on Disability, by providing a mentor to support a student with a disability with skills and information to assist with future career aspirations in the television industry. Mental Health First Aid Certificate Courses have been undertaken by ABC People and Learning Managers and other relevant staff in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Further courses are scheduled for the remaining States and Territories. In October 2008, the ABC presented a Depression Awareness seminar for all staff at ABC Ultimo. An A-Z of Safety site has been developed on the ABC intranet that includes a section with information for staff with disabilities. The ABC continued to improve accessibility to its properties for both employees and visitors with disabilities. This has been achieved through the provision of accessible toilet facilities as part of the building fitout of the ABC's new premises at Esperance, Western Australia and through the provision of hearing augmentation in the Eugene Goossens Hall and the Main Reception Desk at the ABC's Ultimo building. An external resource regarding the preferred terminology and reportage of people with disabilities has been distributed to the News Division as a guide for journalists. Recruitment information for potential job applicants is available in accessible formats on request. Accessible formats are available for potential job applicants and were provided on request during the year by mail, fax, email and online. The turnaround for responding to accessible format requests was usually the same as for other requests. Advertisements have also been provided on the internet. The ABC did not receive any requests from applicants with disabilities for formats other than those already available. Agency recruiters and managers apply the principle of reasonable adjustment. Information on the principles of reasonable adjustment has been provided to managers and those responsible for recruitment. Both training and information have been provided to ABC State People and Learning Managers and Health and Safety Representatives. Research has been undertaken and provided to State People and Learning Managers on case law about disability discrimination, reasonable adjustment and meeting the inherent requirements of work duties. The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data collection form includes a question about individual staff needs and adjustments in the workplace for staff with disabilities. Employees who requested assistance were followed up and assisted individually with their needs.Appendix 13\u2014Commonwealth Disability StrategyAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 206 APPENDICESA number of staff were accommodated with equipment, facilities and flexible work arrangements during the year. Training and development programs consider the needs of staff with disabilities. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Plan includes strategies on training, development and support. Through its performance management system, the ABC ensures that all staff, including people with disabilities, have their training needs identified and addressed. The ABC is a Registered Training Organisation and is required to meet standards of training and accommodation which are inclusive of people with disabilities. ABC Property Services has been consulted about the need for accessible training rooms and facilities. Training and development programs include information on disability issues as they relate to the content of the program. The ABC's mandatory training program, \"Creating a Better Place to Work\", continued to be delivered nationally during 2008-09. A total of 5 347 staff, including executive directors and managers, have been trained since its introduction. The workshops cover the areas of diversity, bullying, discrimination, harassment and conflict resolution and provide the opportunity to focus on disability employment issues. Staff induction information includes the ABC's Discrimination and Harassment Policy and the Anti-Bullying Policy. Complaints/grievance mechanism, including access to external mechanisms, in place to address issues and concerns raised by staff. The ABC's Discrimination and Harassment Policy and the Anti-Bullying Policy are included in a Complaint and Grievance Resolution web page. This site includes information on what discrimination, harassment and bullying mean; the responsibilities of management and staff; complaint and grievance support and procedures; access to external complaint mechanisms and the appointment and role of grievance contact officers. Contact officers receive specific training when appointed. The ABC's employment agreements include provisions for consultation and settlement of individual grievances and other disputes and the performance management system has provision for appeals. A widely-publicised professional counselling service for staff and their families is provided through the ABC Employee Assistance Program (see Page 200).Provider Providers have established mechanisms for quality improvement and assurance. Several mechanisms assist with quality improvement and assurance within the ABC, such as the ABC Editorial Policies and the ABC Code of Practice . Importantly, the Editorial Policies cover a range of areas and include content standards on discrimination and stereotypes, with express reference to people with disabilities. The use of the term \"mental illness\" is explained and reference is given to the availability of external resources about portraying people with a mental illness. The content standards also address accessibility. A section in the News Content area warns against labelling groups or individuals, so as not to portray stereotypes. The ABC Code of Practice also includes a clause about taking care with the use of language and images so as to avoid discrimination and stereotypes. The ABC Advisory Council also makes recommendations to the ABC Board on programming issues and holds small group consultations to obtain community views on ABC programs and services (see page 194). The Council includes members with disabilities. Providers have an established service charter that specifies the roles of the provider and consumer and service standards which address accessibility for people with disabilities. A statement of what audiences and customers can expect in their dealings with the ABC is incorporated in the ABC Service Commitment . Access for people with disabilities is provided through captioning, accessible television and online. Guidelines have been developed specifically to make ABC Television services more accessible for people who are blind or have a visual impairment or limited reading comprehension. Complaints/grievance mechanism, including access to external mechanisms, in place to address issues and concerns raised about performance. The ABC Editorial Policies, Code of Practice and Service Commitment include extensive guidelines for dealing with program complaints and the range of methods of lodging complaints. The guidelines include the option for people who are not satisfied with the ABC's response to a complaint about a Code of Practice issue to refer their complaint to an independent body, the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The Editorial Policies allow for alternative arrangements to be made where a person has genuine difficulties, such as a disability, in putting their complaint in writing. A teletypewriter (TTY) facility is available for the purpose of contacting the ABC about services and programs.Appendix 13\u2014Commonwealth Disability Strategy continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 207Bonuses were paid to 137 executives totalling $723 040, an average of $5 278 per executive.Bonuses were paid to 109 non-executive employees totalling $449 383, an average of $4 123 per employee.Appendix 14\u2014Performance Pay Appendix 15\u2014Staff Profile Total ABC Staff Strength, June 2009 Over- Division ACT NSW NT seas Qld SA Tas Vic WA Totals % ABC Commercial 0.30 21.09 in full-time equivalents. 2.

The ABC's 2007-11 Heritage Strategy covers identification and care of heritage property under ABC control and complies with the requirements of Division 5 of the EPBC Regulations 2000, \"Managing Commonwealth Heritage Places\". The Heritage Strategy assists the Corporation in dealing with ABC property with Commonwealth heritage values and addresses management and planning issues associated with ownership of heritage items. The preparation of the ABC's Thematic History has been completed to assist in the ongoing identification of ABC owned properties that demonstrate Commonwealth Heritage values. In March 2009, the Heritage Assessment and Conservation Management Plan for the Coronation Drive, Toowong site in Brisbane was completed. Evidence of the existence of Commonwealth heritage values was confirmed and an EPBC referral was made in July 2009 in preparation for the divestment of the Toowong site.The ABC identified its properties Western Australia; Collinswood, South Australia; and Hobart, Tasmania as having Commonwealth heritage values and nominated each for inclusion in the Commonwealth Heritage List in February 2009. The ABC is currently undertaking a Heritage Assessment of the ABC Orchestra and Music Centre at West End in Brisbane. In August 2008, the ABC returned its annual National Environment Protection Measures Questionnaire to the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA). In October 2008, the ABC lodged its total Annual Energy Consumption on the Department of Climate Change OSCAR (Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting). In February 2009, the ABC submitted its waste data for inclusion in the Australian Government's Annual Report for 2007-08 to the National Packaging Covenant (NPC).Appendix 16\u2014Ecologically-Sustainable Development and Environmental Performance The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) published eight reports in 2008-09. 1. The Panel upheld a complaint against ABC News in Tasmania in relation to a report of the murder of the late John Lewis Thorn, broadcast on 29 August 2006. The complainant alleged that the broadcast contained serious inaccuracy and was unfair in its reporting, and pointed in particular to the statement in the report that Mr Thorn had been \"convicted of growing marijuana in the area.\" The complainant alleged that the words \"in the area\" introduced a wider and more detrimental meaning. The complaint was not upheld by ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs or the Complaints Review Executive, and was then referred to the ICRP for consideration. The Panel's review of the complaint focused on the use of the words \"in the area\" in reference to Mr Thorn's conviction. The Panel was satisfied that Mr Thorn's actual drug conviction and penalty were manifestly less serious than what was presented in the ABC news report. The Panel therefore was satisfied that an inaccuracy in the news report had been established. The Panel recorded that it was not satisfied that there was deliberate sensationalising involved in the report; rather, there was a lack of adequate care in reporting. However, the lack of reasonable effort to ensure accuracy led to the public possibly obtaining an incorrect impression of Mr Thorn. The Panel did not recommend that the ABC make a public apology as sought by the complainant. However, the Panel recommended that, in addition to notifying the complainant of the Panel's decision, the ABC give consideration to providing a similar notification directly to the Thorn family and that a report of the Panel's decision be placed on the radio station's website in a prominent position. An Editor's Note was added to the version of the news report available on the ABC's website. The note included a link to the Panel's full report. 2. The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against an ABC News Online report entitled \"Aurora defends dumping BPL\", published on 6 December 2007. The report dealt with the Parliament of Tasmania House of Assembly's Businesses Scrutiny Committee's sitting on 6 December 2007 which scrutinised Aurora Energy's operations, including its decision to end its Broadband over Powerlines (BPL) trial. The complainant alleged that the ABC report failed to mention that Aurora Energy Pty Ltd was then under investigation by the Office of the Tasmanian Energy Regulator (OTTER) for breaches of the conditions of its Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review PanelAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 209licence occurring during its trial of the BPL technology over powerlines. The complainant alleged that the ABC engaged in a \"deliberate case of suppression\" of this fact. The complaint was not upheld by ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs or the Complaints Review Executive, and the complainant then referred it to the ICRP for consideration. The Panel noted that the broadcast was no more than a short news item dealing with part of the proceedings before the Parliamentary Committee on 6 December 2007. It was not, and nor did it claim to be, an in-depth analysis of the matters under consideration. Nor was it in any way a piece of investigative journalism. In relation to the OTTER investigation, the Panel found that \"although the Complainant complains of the absence of reference, in the broadcast, to the OTTER investigation, the fact is that no reference was made to it before the Committee and, consequently, such a reference would have had no place in a report of the contents of the hearing.\" The ABC provided the Panel with a schedule listing 14 online, radio and television program segments dated between 2005 and 2008, which, according to the Panel, demonstrated that the issues surrounding the BPL trial were appropriately covered in that period. The Panel noted that Editorial Principles require staff to ensure balance is sought although it may not necessarily be achieved within a single program, but will be achieved as soon as practicable and in an appropriate manner. The Panel was of the view that all relevant news issues relating to the BPL trial appeared to have been appropriately and regularly covered by the ABC. The Panel concluded that the ABC acted responsibly and appropriately given the purpose and nature of the broadcast complained of, in reporting the Parliamentary Committee's hearing in the way that it did. 3. The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against a report broadcast in the ABC Television 7 pm News bulletin on 6 December 2007. The report was about the brumby population in the Kosciusko National Park and dealt briefly with problems posed by it, its history, previous attempts at control and the current Horse Management Draft Plan propounded by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), which involved a significant reduction in the population size. The segment contained film footage of large numbers of brumbies galloping together across open parkland, through water and across a dirt road. These scenes were shot from above from an ABC helicopter. The complainant alleged that the ABC report was \"biased against the brumby\" and that the aerial camera work in the report was \"nothing short of sensationalism\". The complainant also criticised particular parts of the program, asserting they were inaccurate or unsupported by independent evidence. The complainant also asserted the uncontrolled galloping of a large mob of brumbies, shown in the film footage, indicated an imbalance occasioned by undue favouring of the NPWS's position on culling. The complaint was not upheld by ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs or the Complaints Review Executive, and the complainant then referred it to the ICRP for consideration. The Panel considered that more should have been done in the program to indicate that the \"charge\" scenes were helicopter induced. However, the Panel noted that this was only a short news item, not an in-depth documentary or current affairs type of program, in which competing points of view should, necessarily, receive appropriate exposure. The Panel can find a relevant breach of the Policies only when a sufficiently \"serious\" case is demonstrated. In the Panel's view, this was not such a case. 4. The Panel upheld a complaint made against a segment on The 7.30 Report titled \"Pulp mill could taint catch: fishing industry\", broadcast on 5 June 2007 and later made available on ABC Online. The complainant took exception to a graphic displayed in the program which showed dioxin effluent from the pulp mill being apparently discharged directly from the mill to the adjacent waters. The complainant also objected to the use of old, unacknowledged file footage of scallop fishing activities in the introduction to the segment, claiming it was misleading because \"no commercial scallop catch had been made in the vicinity of the effluent outfall since before 1999\". The complainant felt that the material was significantly misleading and damaging to Timber Communities Australia. ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs had upheld the complaint, acknowledging errors in the use of the footage of scallop fishing and the diagram used to illustrate the dioxin outflow from the plant. The ABC also acknowledged that these specific segments of the report, through misrepresentation, lacked the necessary impartiality required by the ABC's Code of Practice . The next working day, the video was removed from the website and an Editor's Note added which stated: \"The video of this story has been removed from the site, as it contained visual elements that were potentially misleading\". The complainant was not satisfied with the ABC's response and lodged a complaint with the Complaints Review Executive and, remaining dissatisfied, referred the matter to the ICRP . The Panel considered whether in this instance an online correction several months after the program Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 210 APPENDICESwent to air on national television, was the most appropriate correction available to the ABC. The Panel found that these breaches did constitute a serious misrepresentation of the situation and in these circumstances, considered it incumbent on ABC management to ensure that any misunderstanding was properly and fully corrected. The Panel found that no further apology was required since the complainant had received an apology from the ABC in a letter dated 14 December 2007. However, the Panel considered that corrections should have been broadcast promptly, as part of The 7.30 Report , clarifying that (a) scallop farming did not currently occur and was, therefore, not under threat and (b) the dioxin outflow from the plant was not as depicted in the diagram. In this way, the corrections would have reached as many as possible of the original viewers who could have been misled by the program. Although considerable time had elapsed since the broadcast went to air, the Panel believed that ongoing public interest in this development meant these corrections should be supplemented by an appropriate on-air correction broadcast during a segment on The 7.30 Report , on an occasion when the program was again dealing with issues relating to the pulp mill development. The ABC accepted the Panel's recommendation and an on-air correction was broadcast on the program on 16 December 2008. 5. The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against an item on The 7.30 Report titled \"The Middle East in 2007,\" broadcast on 3 January 2008, prepared by the ABC's then Middle East correspondent Matt Brown. The complainant was concerned by a remark made in the report by commentator Professor Barry Rubin during his analysis of significant events in the Middle East in 2007. The complainant said the views Professor Rubin expressed on The 7.30 Report were at odds with the views he has consistently expressed elsewhere. The complainant asserted that the construction of the report was an example of \"blatant journalistic fraud\" on the part of the ABC. The Panel acknowledged that ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs initially considered the complaint and concluded that the inclusion of the edited remarks of Professor Rubin, where they appeared in the item, could lead the audience to believe that he attributed \"the impossibility of peace\" to the Israeli blockade, which was not what the Professor had stated in his interview. The ABC's response to the complainant acknowledged the \"regrettable error\" and \"clumsy construction\" of this aspect of the report. An Editor's Note was added to the transcript on The 7.30 Report website which stated: \"The ABC advises that Professor Rubin's comments do not refer to the Israeli blockade in Gaza. He was referring to Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip.\" The complainant was not satisfied with the ABC's response and lodged a complaint with the Panel. He rejected the ABC's explanation that a mistake had been made and referred to a number of other instances in ABC programs which he considered examples of \"the ABC doing its bit to promote hatred of Israel\". In relation to these allegations, the Panel formed the view that, consistent with the role given to it under the ABC's Editorial Policies , it must confine its review to the program in respect of which the complaint had been made. The Panel noted however that \"the Complainant clearly asserts the view that it is an example of what he conceives to be a pronounced anti-Israel bias on the part of the ABC\". As the ABC had already accepted that the editing of Professor Rubin's views was problematic and had taken remedial action, the Panel considered that the only question for its investigation was whether the acknowledged inaccuracy \"was not due to the reasons accepted by the ABC but was, in fact, deliberate on the part of the reporter, being occasioned by bias against Israel\". Accordingly, the Panel sought and considered statements from the reporter to assess how the error had arisen. The Panel expressed satisfaction with the answers provided by Mr Brown. The Panel accepted that Mr Brown had seen Professor Rubin's comment as providing a succinct conclusion and used it as such, without adverting to the possibility that its positioning could appear to reflect adversely on the Israeli blockade. The Panel concluded that this explanation effectively ruled out any deliberate intent on the part of Mr Brown to give effect to a bias against Israel in this report. The Panel also found that Mr Brown \"holds and has evinced no such bias.\" 6. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against an ABC News Online report published on 1 March 2008, titled \"Israel warns of reply to Hamas' rocket fire.\" The report translated the Hebrew word \"shoah\", used by the Israeli Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai in the item, to describe the response that would be felt by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as \"holocaust\" rather than \"disaster.\" The complainant alleged the ABC had incorrectly translated the Hebrew word \"shoah\". The complainant's concerns were initially investigated by ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and upheld. The ABC accepted that the report should be changed and this was done. An Editor's Note was added to the report to explain the change. The complainant remained dissatisfied with the ABC's response and referred his complaint to the ICRP . The Panel noted that the complainant \"referred Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 211to this as being yet another 'mistake' on the part of the ABC, which served to portray Israel negatively, leading to the inference that these mistakes were not inadvertent but deliberate.\" The Panel noted that an aspect of the complaint made to it was that \"the ABC has a negative attitude or, perhaps, policy towards the State of Israel, this being regularly exemplified in its reporting of events concerning it\". The Panel explained that it could not enter into an investigation of this assertion. In keeping with the Panel's expressed role and jurisdiction, it was required to confine its review to the action program item about which the complainant complained. The Panel acknowledged the actions taken by the ABC in response to the complaint. When the ABC was apprised of this problem arising from the dual meaning of the Hebrew word, it moved to deal with it by publishing an Editor's Note to the Online story, which read \"The original version of this story reported Defence Minister, Matan Vilnai, saying the stepped-up rocket fire would trigger what he calls a bigger holocaust in the Hamas-controlled coastal strip. The Hebrew word 'shoah' can mean a big disaster and also the Nazi Holocaust. The story was amended on 3 April 2008 to replace the word 'holocaust' with 'disaster'.\" The Panel found that this explanation by the ABC sufficiently indicated that there was no bias, deliberate or otherwise, in the relevant reporting and no breach of the Policies was established. 7. The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against a report in the ABC1 Television News bulletin broadcast on 29 May 2008. The report was from ABC US correspondent Mark Simkin about a new book released by a former adviser to former US President George W Bush. The news reader introduced the segment, \"In a major embarrassment for the White House, a former adviser to George W Bush has released an explosive, tell-all memoir. Scott McClellan says the war with Iraq was unnecessary and the President used propaganda rather than the truth to sell it to the public.\" Mr Simkin continued his report, \"The criticisms aren't new ... the source is.\" He continued the report with quotes from the author, Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary and two former Bush advisers. The complainant alleged that Mr Simkin's report had missed \"the real story on US politics and the illegal actions committed by the Bush Administration.\" ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and the ABC Complaints Review Executive both found the editorial requirements for this report had been met. The complainant then referred the complaint to the ICRP . The Panel considered that the segment clearly did not purport in any way to involve a close analysis of the book's contents or an in-depth discussion of issues raised in it concerning the Bush Administration's handling of the Iraq War or its response to Hurricane Katrina. It was a very brief report of a clearly newsworthy event of the day, namely the release of Mr McClellan's \"explosive tell-all memoir,\" including the reported reaction to it by current representatives of the White House administration. The Panel concluded that this short news segment did not, and could not, provide an appropriate occasion for the ABC to enter upon a full consideration of the issues raised by the complainant. It was a program which clearly had the narrow focus referred to above and would have been so perceived by viewers. In these circumstances, the Panel found that the requirements for accuracy and balance were not infringed and therefore found no breach of the ABC Code of Practice or ABC Editorial Policies . 8. The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against the ABC Radio National Breakfast program broadcast on 25 September 2008. The complainant alleged that the program's presenter Fran Kelly misled listeners by referring to Kurds and Sunnis in the same sentence. The complainant explained that \"to refer to Kurds and Sunnis in the same sentence has the potential to mislead listeners, some of whom can be expected to know little about the peoples and religions of the Near East. The distinction is potentially misleading because almost all Kurds living in the northern region of Iraq are Sunnis. (A small number of Kurds living in the north of Iran are Shiites).\" Both ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and the Complaints Review Executive did not accept the report was misleading; the complaint was referred to the ICRP for review. The Panel was of the view that a clear distinction could have been made between Arab Sunnis and Sunnis in general. However, the Panel also acknowledged that the complaint related to a short introduction to a program segment and considered that the audience would have recognised it as such and would not have focused on the individual words to the extent that the complainant had done and the Panel had also done in its analysis. The Panel acknowledged that it is desirable for all possible misleading impressions to be eliminated from radio broadcasts, but recognised that the Editorial Policies require only that \"every reasonable effort\" be made \"in the circumstances\" to ensure accuracy. The Panel was made aware that the producer of the Breakfast program must work at consistently high speed to meet an early deadline analysing and collating material from a number of news sources worldwide and took these matters into account. The Panel can find a relevant breach of the Policies only when a sufficiently \"serious\" case is demonstrated. In the Panel's view, this was not such a case. Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 212 APPENDICESCurrent as at 30 June 2009; last updated 1 July 2008. This Code of Practice summarises the major principles which guide ABC content. 1. Introduction 1.1 The ABC's place in the media industry is distinctive. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , gives the Corporation particular responsibilities such as the provision of an independent news service. The ABC Charter (Section 6 of the Act) sets out the functions of the Corporation and can be found on the internet at abc.net.au/corp/pubs/charter.htm. 1.2 The ABC Act guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation's programs. The ABC holds the power to make programming decisions on behalf of the people of Australia. By law and convention neither the Government nor Parliament seeks to intervene in those decisions. 1.3 This Code of Practice applies to ABC Radio and Television, Online and other emerging media services. Some parts of the Code apply to a particular medium such as Section 6: Television Program Classifications. Where this is the case material is marked accordingly. 1.4 The word \"content\" is generally used throughout the Code and covers material broadcast on ABC Radio and Television, provided on ABC Online and through emerging media services. 1.5 This Code of Practice sets out the major principles which apply to ABC content. The ABC distinguishes between four types of content: news and current affairs opinion topical and factual performance. 1.6 All four content categories are covered by the general content codes below. In addition specific requirements apply to the content categories of news and current affairs, opinion, and topical and factual. 1.7 The ABC Editorial Policies set out programming policies and guidelines in full and can be found at abc.net.au/corp/pubs/edpols.htm.2. General content codes 2.1 The guiding principle in the application of the following general content codes is context. What is unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. However, the use of language, sound or images for no other purpose but to offend is not acceptable. 2.2 This Code is not intended to ban certain types of language or images from bona fide dramatic or literary treatments, nor is it intended to exclude such references from legitimate reportage, debate or documentaries. 2.3 Warnings. From time to time the ABC presents content that it recognises may disturb or offend some of the audience. Where appropriate, the audience will be given advance notice about such content. 2.4 Violence. There will be times when there are genuine reasons for using violent images and sounds to adequately illustrate a story. Particular care must be taken in the presentation or portrayal of violence. The ABC's decision to use such images or sounds should be based on editorial judgement, together with regard for the reasonable susceptibilities of audiences to the detail of what is broadcast or published. Such content should not put undue emphasis on the violent images or sounds, and where appropriate it should be preceded by a warning. 2.5 Language. Variations of language favoured by different groups of Australians are valid and have their place in ABC content. On occasions, the language of one group may be distasteful to another. Use of such language is permitted provided it is not used gratuitously and can be justified in the context of, for example, news, current affairs, fiction, documentary, dramatisation, comedy or song lyrics. 2.6 Sex and Sexuality. Provided it is handled with integrity, any of the following treatments of sex and sexuality may be appropriate and necessary: it can be discussed and reported in the context of news, current affairs, information or documentary programs it can be referred to in drama, comedy, lyrics or fictional programs it can be depicted or implied.Appendix 18\u2014Freedom of Information Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of PracticeThe Freedom of Information Act 1982 (\"FOI Act\") gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act gives the ABC an exemption in relation to material that is program related.During the past year, the ABC received 10 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Two requests were granted, three were granted in part and five were refused.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 2132.7 Discrimination and Stereotypes. To avoid discrimination and stereotyping, content should not use language or images which: disparage or discriminate against any person or group on grounds such as race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, age, disability or sexual preference; marital, parental, social or occupational status; religious, cultural or political belief or activity are not representative and reinforce stereotypes, or convey stereotypic assumptions convey prejudice make demeaning or gratuitous references; for example to people's physical characteristics, cultural practices or religious beliefs. The above requirements are not intended to prevent content which is factual or the expression of genuinely-held opinion, or content presented in the legitimate context of a humorous, satirical or dramatic work. 2.8 Privacy. The rights to privacy of individuals should be respected in all ABC content. However, in order to provide information which relates to a person's performance of public duties or about other matters of public interest, intrusions upon privacy may, in some circumstances, be justified. 2.9 Suicide. Suicide is a legitimate subject in ABC content. The depiction or description of suicide must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Care must be taken to ensure that events or methods depicted or described do not encourage others to copy these actions. 2.10 Intrusion into Grief. Sensitivity should be exercised in presenting images of, or interviews with, bereaved relatives and survivors or witnesses of traumatic events. Except in special circumstances, children who have recently been victims of, or eyewitnesses to, a tragedy or traumatic experience should not be interviewed or featured. 2.11 Program Promotions. Program Promotions should be scheduled so as to be consistent with the nature of surrounding content. 2.12 Content for Children. In providing enjoyable and enriching content for children, the ABC does not wish to conceal the real world from them. It can be important for the media, especially television, to help children understand and deal with situations which may include violence and danger. Special care should be taken to ensure that content which children are likely to watch or access unsupervised should not be harmful or disturbing to them.2.13 Religious Content. ABC religious content includes coverage of worship and devotion, explanation, analysis, debate and reports. This content may include major religious traditions, indigenous religions and new spiritual movements, as well as secular perspectives on religious issues. The ABC does not promote any particular belief system or form of religious expression. 2.14 Indigenous Australian Content. Significant cultural practices of Indigenous Australians should be observed in content and reporting. 2.15 Television Programs: Closed Captioning on Domestic Television Services for People who are Hearing Impaired or Deaf. Closed caption content will be clearly marked when information is provided to the press or when captioned programs are promoted. Where possible, open captioned advice will be provided if technical problems prevent scheduled closed captioning. Television programs broadcast between 6 pm and 10.30 pm and news and current affairs programs broadcast at any time are captioned in accordance with the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 . Addresses to the nation and events of national significance will also be transmitted with closed captioning. 2.16 Television Programs: Accessible Domestic Television Services for People who are Blind or Have a Visual Impairment or Limited Reading Comprehension. Where material appears in text format on ABC Television, the ABC will endeavour to provide it in audio as well, subject to availability of resources and considerations of creativity, editorial integrity and immediacy. 2.17 ABC Online. The ABC aims to make its online services accessible to audience members who are blind or have a visual impairment. It should however, be recognised that it will not always be possible to achieve this while maintaining standards of creativity, editorial integrity and immediacy. There may also be cases where time or resources limit the ABC's ability to provide this service. 3. News and current affairs content 3.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as news and current affairs in accordance with Section 5 of the ABC Editorial Policies . This content will be accurate, impartial and objective and thereby avoid bias. 3.2 Every reasonable effort, in the circumstances, must be made to ensure that the factual content of news and current affairs is accurate and in context.Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 214 APPENDICES3.3 The ABC will correct a significant error when it is established that one has been made. When a correction is necessary, it will be made in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable. 3.4 Content will be impartial. Editorial judgements will be based on news values. One perspective will not be unduly favoured over others. 3.5 Balance will be sought but may not always be achieved within a single program or publication; it will be achieved as soon as reasonably practicable and in an appropriate manner. It is not essential to give all sides equal time. As far as possible, principal relevant views on matters of importance will be presented. 3.6 The ABC will serve the public interest by investigating issues affecting society and individuals. 3.7 Re-enactments of events will be clearly identified as such and presented in a way which will not mislead audiences. 3.8 Television Programs: News Updates. Care will be exercised in the selection of sounds and images used in television news updates and news promotions. Consideration must also be given to the likely composition of the audience. 3.9 Television Programs: News Updates . During Children's Viewing Times. Particular care should be taken with scheduled television news updates at those times when programming is directed at children. News updates at such times must not include any violent content. 3.10 Television Programs: News Flashes. Because the timing and content of news flashes on television are unpredictable, particular care should be exercised in the selection of sounds and images and consideration given to the likely composition of the audience. This should be done, notwithstanding the need to get a news flash to air as quickly as possible. Before any news flash during children's and other G classified programs, a visual and audio announcement must be broadcast advising viewers that regular programming will be interrupted with a news flash. 4. Opinion content 4.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as opinion content in accordance with Section 6 of the ABC Editorial Policies . 4.2 Content must be signposted to audiences in advance. 4.3 The ABC is committed to impartiality and must demonstrate this through the presentation of a diversity of perspectives across a network or platform in an appropriate timeframe. 4.4 Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure factual content is accurate and that content does not misrepresent other viewpoints.5. Topical and factual content 5.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as topical and factual content in accordance with Section 7 of the ABC Editorial Policies . 5.2 The ABC is committed to impartiality: where topical and factual content deals with matters of contention or public debate, a diversity of principal relevant perspectives should be demonstrated across a network or platform in an appropriate timeframe. 5.3 Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that factual content is accurate and in context and that content does not misrepresent other viewpoints. 5.4 The ABC will correct a significant error when it is established that one has been made. When a correction is necessary, it will be made in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable. 6. Television program classifications 6.1 The ABC applies the classifications listed below to all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are based on the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 . 6.2 Classification of television programs G\u2014General (suitable for all ages)G programs may be shown at any time. This category is considered suitable for all viewers, and includes programs designed for pre-school and school age children. The G classification symbol does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or story-lines that are not of interest to children. Parents should feel confident that children can watch material in this classification without supervision. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be justified by context. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous.Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 215Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Nudity in a sexual context is not permitted. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG\u2014Parental Guidance (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years)PG programs may be shown: on weekdays between 8.30 am and 4.00 pm and between 7.00 pm and 6.00 am on weekends at any time except between 6 am and 10 am. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail.Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous. M\u2014Mature (recommended for people aged 15 years and over)M programs may be shown: on weekdays that are school days, between noon and 3.00 pm; and on any day of the week between 8.30 pm and 5.00 am. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category\u2014the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be high. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a high impact, and/or not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact.Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 216 APPENDICESVerbal and indirect visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged.Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+\u2014Mature Audience (not suitable for people under 15 years)MA15+ programs may be shown between 9.30 pm and 5.00 am on any day of the week. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category\u2014the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should be discreet. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. Depictions with a strong impact should be infrequent, and should not be prolonged or gratuitous. Realistic treatments may contain detailed depictions, but these should not be prolonged.Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent than depictions of violence in close to real situations or in realistic treatments if this does not increase the impact. Visual suggestions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used.Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown, but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 6.3 Implementation Guidelines. The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time-slots. For example, a PG program or segment of a program designed for teenage viewers could appear before 7.00 pm on a week day if that is the time most suitable for the target audience. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside their normal classification time zone, provided that a clear indication of the nature of the content is given at the beginning of the program. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the OFLC Guidelines, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Due to local scheduling arrangements, some programs will be broadcast to Broken Hill outside their classification time zone. 6.4 Television Classification Symbols. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program.Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 APPENDICES 217The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 6.5 Consumer Advice. Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program. 7. Complaints 7.1 This Code of Practice does not apply to any complaint concerning content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings or any complaint about a radio or television program which is made to the ABC more than six months after the broadcast to which it refers. However, please note the ABC cannot guarantee that it will have the necessary tapes to review complaints made more than six weeks after broadcast as this is the statutory period for which the ABC is required to retain radio and television tapes. 7.2 ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs. Complaints that the ABC has acted contrary to this Code of Practice should be directed to the ABC in the first instance. Phone complainants seeking a written response from the ABC will be asked to put their complaint in writing. All such written complaints are to be directed to ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs, GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of the complainant's State or Territory. The complainant will receive a response from the ABC within 60 days of receipt of their complaint. The ABC makes considerable efforts to provide an adequate response to complaints about Code of Practice matters, except where a complaint is frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith or the complainant is vexatious or not acting in good faith. 7.3 ABC Complaints Review Executive. If a complainant is dissatisfied with a response from Audience and Consumer Affairs, the complainant may request that the matter be reviewed by the Complaints Review Executive (CRE). The CRE is a senior ABC manager with editorial experience, who is separate from Audience and Consumer Affairs and content areas, and who can consider the complaint afresh. Complainants can write to the CRE at GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of the complainant's State or Territory. 7.4 Independent Complaints Review Panel. The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) is appointed by the ABC Board to review written complaints which relate to allegations of serious cases of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment arising from ABC content.A complaint of this nature may only be referred to the ICRP for review: if the ABC's normal complaints handling procedures (as described in 7.2 above) have been completed and the complainant is dissatisfied with the ABC's response; or the ABC has not responded within 60 days and the ABC has failed to provide an acceptable reason for the delay; and if in the case of a radio or television program, the complaint was originally lodged with the ABC within six weeks of the date of broadcast. Further information can be obtained from the Convener, Independent Complaints Review Panel, GPO Box 688, Sydney, NSW 2001 or by phoning (02) 8333 5639. If the Panel does not accept the complaint for review or if the complainant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the review and the complaint is covered by the ABC Code of Practice , the complainant may make a complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority about the matter. 7.5 Australian Communications and Media Authority. If a complainant: does not receive a response from the ABC within 60 days; or is dissatisfied with the ABC's response; or is dissatisfied with the outcome of the ICRP review (as mentioned above) and the complaint is covered by the ABC Code of Practice ; the complainant may make a complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority about the matter. 7.6 Contact Addresses Australian Broadcasting CorporationAudience and Consumer Affairs GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of your State or Territory Complaints Review Executive GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of your State or Territory Independent Complaints Review Panel GPO Box 688, Sydney, NSW, 2001 Australian Communications and Media AuthorityPO Box Q500, Queen Victoria Building, NSW, 1230Appendix 19\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2009 218 APPENDICESAppendix 20\u2014Performance Against Service Commitment The ABC Service Commitment is a statement of what individuals are entitled to expect in their dealings with the ABC.
