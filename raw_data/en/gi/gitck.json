Looking Ahead: A Platform of Recommendations and Key Actions 191 Endnotes 201 Index 215 IV MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDUNICEF was a c o-convenor of the 10th anniversary strategic review of the issues raised in the landmark 1996 M achelstudyon the impacts ofconflict on children. UNICEF welcomes the publication of thisreview, titled Machel Study 10-Year Strategic Review: Children andConflict in a Changing World, which aims to serve as an advocacy and policy tool on children and armed conflict, and as the foundation ofaplatform for action. The findings of the report are the results of a wide-ranging, multi-stakeholder process that includedparticipation by young people. Despit ethe considerable achieve- ments of the past 10 years, challenges remain. According to 2006 estimates,morethan 1 billion children under the age of 18 were living in areas in conflict or emerging from war.Ofthese, an est imat ed300 mil lion were under age five, and more than 18 million children were refugees or internally displaced. The strategic review notes that there is increased global awarenessaboutdeliberate violations against children in armed conflict, such as the recruitment and use of children byarmedgroups. However, appalling consequences that stem from the complex interplay of conflict, poverty and discrimination are oftenoverlooked. Children living in war-affected contexts are less likely to be in school or have access to cleanwater and basic sanitation. They aremore vulnerable to early mortality as aresult of disease and undernutrition, and they have less chance of becoming adults able to play a constructive role in the ir so cieties. Inher2000 cr itical r eview, Gra\u00e7a Machel said, \"Our collective failure to protect children must be transformed into an opportunity to confront the problems that cause their suffering.\" UNICEF works collaboratively with governments,multilateral organizations, non-governmental organizations and civil societyto improve the quality of basic services that improve the lives ofchildr en - including education, water and sanitation, and nutrition -and seeks to strengthen the capacitiesof families and communities. This publication is intended to inspire even greater efforts to ensurethat c hildren suffering from the consequences of conflict receive thecare and support they need grow to productive adulthood and contribute to their communities. Ann M. Veneman Executive Director United Nations Children's FundFOREWORD \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-0653/ToutounjiPREFACE VWe have come a long way in the decade since Gra\u00e7a Machel first told the world of the horrors being visited upon children in the context of war. \"The impact of conflict on children iseveryone's responsibility, and it mustbeeveryone's concern,\" she said. In response, governments, the UnitedNations sy stem and non- governmental organizations and othe rrepresentatives of civil society havemovedintoaction. Collectively, they have helped strengthen inter- national standards and norms. They have advocated to place the plight of war-affected children higher on the agendas of both theGeneral Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. And they have raised globalawareness of the most effective strategies and programmes to assist and p rotect children caught up in war. In this regard, I would especially like to acknowledge Olara Otunnu, the Secretary-General's first Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, who has workedtirelessly on children's behalf. That same spir it ofcollective action has also inspired the immense effort that produced the document you hold in your hands: a 10-yearstrategic review of the original Machel study. This publication, the first multifaceted global assessment of war-affected children since 1996, details how far we have come - and how much we have yet to do.As part of my mandate to report onprogress, we first presented the findings of this strategic review to the General Assembly in October 2007 as a special section of myannual report. We are encouragedthat the Assemblytook note of it and agreed to carefully study its recomme ndat ions and to continue to discuss the issues raised therein. The main messag ewebrought tothe Ge neral Assembly, more fully documented here, is that the situation for millions of children is as dire as ever. Although we have made advances, especially in developing a solidframework of norms and standards,much more must be done to ensurecompliance, to fight impunity and toprotect children's rights. The changing nature of armed conflict presents ne wrisks and challenges that require our unwavering attention and commitment. Finally, the care and protection of children affected by armed conflict require all stake- holders to devise sensitive programmesthat protect all the rights of childrenliving in c onflict areas. I, and my office, will continue to focus on ending impunity, especially for the perpetrators of those crimesdetermined to be grave violations against children. We will continue to advocate for the rights of childrenaffected by armed conflict. We will also p ress forward in helping to build the political will and broad-basedpartnerships we need if we are to succeed in this most crucial ofhumanitarian endeavours.

The following year, the UN General Assembly adopted aresolution calling for the Secretary-General to appoint an independent expert to lead a study on the impact ofarmed conflict on children. Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican educator and international advocate for children, waschosen to lead that study. Her groundbreaking report, the 'Impact of Armed Conflict on Children', was presented to the General Assembly in 1996, 1which led to the creation of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (OSRSG-CAAC) in September 1997. It was unanimously endorsedand has continued to move the world ever since. In September 2000, following a recommendation of the Machel report, the Government of Canada hosted the International Conference on War-Affected Children in Winnipeg. The timing of the conference was well planned,coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the W orld Summit for Children. In preparation for the event, the Governments of Canada and Nor way suppor ted a UNICEF team to work with Mrs. Machel on a review of progress since her previous report. The resulting document, 'The Machel Review 1996-2000', was presented to representatives of more than 100 countries at the Winnipeg conference. Several months later the report was circulated to the GeneralAssembly and made into a book, The Impact of War on Children .2 In 2006, work got under way on a 10-year strategic review of progress since the original Machel study .This ambitious undertaking, financed by the Governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden, was co-convened by the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and UNICEF. In addition to these two UN bodies, more than 40 UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and academic institutions contributed to the report, along with children from nearly 100 countries. The initial findings were presented to the General Assembly in October 2007, as part of the annualrepor tof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. 3This publication is a more in-depth look at progress and remaining gaps. It is part of an ongoing advocacy effort to develop a commonplatform and to keep the cause of children in conflict in the conscience of citizens everywhere. 2 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD1. INTRODUCTION: TOWARDS A COMMON ETHIC 3More than a decade after it was presented to the United NationsGeneral Assembly, Gra\u00e7a Machel'sreport on the agony of children trapped in armed conflict remains the definitive assessment of the issue. It has continuously roused moraloutrage and has been a foundationfor programming and advocacy. \"I ha vealwaysbelieved it is our r esponsibility as adults to give childr enfutures worth having,\" she said when releasing the study in 1996. \"In the two years spent on thisreport, I have been shocked and angered to see how shamefully we havefailedin this responsibility.\" During the intervening years, herchallenges have inspired a groundswell of collective action. The Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, UNICEF and other UN bodies, Member States, non-governmental organizations and other representatives of civil society haveall had a hand in achievements of which we can be proud: the strength-ening o finternational norms and standards, the active involvement ofboth the General Assembly and theSecurity Council in making the issueof children in armed conflict a top priority,and the enhancement of strategies and programmes to protect and car eforwar-affected children. Although these strides represent significant progress, a great dealremains to be done. There are still gaps in implementation and obstaclestomonitoring the steps already taken. More needs to be done to ensure that the light against impunity is effective and that those w ho violate children are held accountable. Moreover, thechanging nature of contemporary armed conflict cries out for a different approach, one that no longer focuses on particular countries or themes but on the totality of issues affectingchildren caught in armed conflict, a point captured in Mrs. Machel's study. That is the c entral messag eof this 10-year strategic review, and it grows out of Mrs. Machel's powerful insight that \"war violates every right of thechild.\" We cannot hope to move forcefully on behalf of children inconflict until we turn our attention to all impacts, on all children, in allsituations affected by conflict. The organization of this report aims to heighten our understanding of the myriad ways in which armedconflict affects children - and howchildren regard their participationnot only in war but in programmesaimed at preventing violence against them and in promoting their recovery and reintegration. The report thus frames its findings within three categories: political and diplomatic Central African Republic \u00a9UNICEF/ NYHQ2007-0135/Pirozziactions and responsibilities; system- wide international policies, standards and ar chitectures; and prevention and response. The challenges before us are steep. As pointed out in chapter 2, inter-state conflicts have declined in numb erworldwide, but they are being supplanted by smaller-scale, low-intensity intra-state wars. These pose a new category of threats to children because they involve ill-trained combatants armed withreadily available small weapons. They fight for economic reasons such as control of natural resources and areoften under the sway of transnationalorganized crime. T errorism and counterterrorism continue to pose newchallenges for the protection of children. All the while, the trend that Mrs. Machel identified in 1996 - the deliberate targeting of civilians,especially children, as a tactic of war - c ontinues t ointensify . The impact on children is more brutal than ever. The decade since the o riginal Machel study has seen increasedattention to mitigating the directconsequences of conflict, such as unlawful recruitment, gender- based violence, killing and maiming, separation from families, trafficking and il legal detention. But the indirect 4 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD Sri Lanka \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1599/Nooraniconsequences of war - the severing of basic se rvices, and increased poverty, malnutrition and disease - take a similar ly devastating toll on children. In light of these circumstances, the initial findings of this strategic review, presented to the GeneralAssembly in October 2007, included among its recommendations expanded action in four key areas: securinguniversal compliance with inter- national norms and standards, withending impunity the top priority; prioritizing the protection and careofchildr en in armed conflict; strengthening capacity and leader- ship; and building peace while preventing conflict. These recom- mendations are outlined in full in chapter 11. And because the focus ofthis report is on action, the majority of chapters conclude with specific follow-up recommendations. Forall the horrors children face in armed conflict, hope survives, and Mr s.Machel has discerned it in the h uman hear t.\"I ha ve learned,\" she said in 1996, \"that d espit ebeing targets in contemporary armed conflict, despite the brutality showntowards them and the failure of adults tonurture and protect them, children are both our reason to eliminate the worst aspects of armed conflict andour best hope of succeeding in thatcharge. In a disparate world, childrenare a unifying force capable ofbringing us all together in support ofacommon ethic.\" /square6LISTENING TO YOUTH It is Gra\u00e7a Machel's contention that \"young people should be seen...as survivors and active par ticipants in creating solutions, not just as victims or problems.\"4With that in mind, a priority throughout this strategic review onchildren and armed conflict has been incorporating the perspectives of children and young people themselves. In total, 1,700 youths from 92 countries contributed their thoughts and ideas to this repor t. As a start, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund and non-governmental partners conducted focus group discussionsin 18 countries affected by conflict. Although each group concentrated onthe same set of questions, the young people chose different methods ofresponse, which allowed them to express their ideas in ways they feltappropriate to their own circumstances. In Somalia, for example, a focusgroup discussion was held via a radio talk show, which elicited views from140 children who called in. A compilation of these insights from childrenaround the world was subsequently assembled in \"Will you listen?\" Young voices from conflict zones ,launched as a companion piece to the Machel strategic review presented to the General Assembly in 2007. \"Will you listen?\" was produced in four languages and distributed to partner organi- zations worldwide. Quotes from it appear throughout this publication. Recognizing that young people are able to both express their concerns and identify ways to address them, a follow-up survey was conducted byyouth-led organizations experienced in working with children and youngpeople in conflict zones. Their recommendations for action are outlined inchapter 10. 1. INTRODUCTION: TOWARDS A COMMON ETHIC 5\"Children are both our reason to eliminate the worst aspects of armed conflict and our best hope of succeeding in that charge.\" \u2014Gra\u00e7a Machel, 1996Russian Federation \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-1308/PirozziTHE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT 28 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThe 1996 Machel study noted with deep concern how war tactics hadchanged, with civilians, includingchildren, increasingly becoming the targets ofviolence and the victims of atrocities. Regrettably, this trend continues. Armed conflicts today havean even more horrific impact onchildren, and on civilians generally.Intoday'swars, the strategies adopted by armed groups \"seek to bring the battle mo re immediately, more systematically, and more massively to the core of the civilianpopulat ion,\" 5and int othe li ves ofmillions of children. Asaresult, armed conflict has become more fluid and less easily defined. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the trend of armed conflict is towards \"further fragmentation of violence.\" The analysis goes on to say, \"This has been accompanied by the diversifica- tionof armed groups and the further erosion of the boundaries between different forms of violence. Much of this 'fragmented' violence is difficulttomeas ureand categorize.\" 6 The growing involvement of non-state actors and the use of non-traditional forms of warfare add to the difficulty of quantifying the impa ctofwar o nchildr en. The 1996 Machel cited 30 \"major armed conflic ts\"as taking pla cein 1995, when monitored according to battle deaths. In attempting to assess trends10 years later, the Machel strategic review found that the number ofconflicts in 2005 ranged from 17 to 56 worldwide. 7The lower figure pertains to conflicts with more than1,000 battle deaths; the higher derives fromathreshold o f 25 battle deaths, allowing for the inclusion of lower- intensity conflicts and those in whichaState was not a party to the conflict. The analysis of conflicts in 2005 drawsfromarecent and much-cited report by the Human Security Centre. Itemphasizes that while some analysts see a positive trend - a decline in the number of inter-state conflicts wagedaround the w orld since the 1990s and agrowing numbers of wars ending with ne gotiated settlements rather than militar yresolution 8-othe rs are not so s ure, given the changing nature ofwarfare. While most countries are no longer engaged in inter-state warfare, they are often host to one or even several armed conflicts involving non-state actors. These can include rebellions or opposition or secessionist movements involving paramilitary groups, anti-government guerrillas or others. Such armed conflicts may yieldfewer military battle deaths, but they exact a high human cost: Unarmedcivilians are victimized, basic servicesdeteriorate, societal divisions deepenand local economies decline. Itis also imp ortant t oremember that man yof the recognized armed conflic tdatase ts werebase don the traditional concept of war, involving inter-state warfare and disciplined militar yforces. Significantly, some of the lists only include armed conflictsinvolving a State party. Y et the data from one centre showed that, in 2005, all 56 armed conflicts listed also involved non-state actors, and in 25 o fthemaStatewas not a party to the conflict. 9 Fuelling many of these conflicts is the w idespreadproliferation and availability of small arms, light weapons and amm unition. Abundant, cheap and easil ycarriedbyachild, these weapons are often illegally traded. They are a modern-dayscourge. They not only account for the vast majority of direct conflict deaths, they enable wars to continue, sustain a cult ureof violence and facilitate further conflict. THE SHIFTING LANDSCAPE OF CONTEMPORARY WARFARE Haiti provides insight into the challenges on the ground that suchtrends present. While the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of Haiti helped quell the conflict that eruptedin 2004, man yarmed groups resisteddisarmament and transformed into entities that were primarily criminal in nat ure.Asdescribed in the most r ecent report of the Secretary-General on children and armedconflic t,\"Althoug hthese groups ar ecurrently essentially criminal in nature, their character and motivations may shift between criminal and political depending on the specific time and circumstances\"When conflict broke out in the community we fled our homes, and it felt like bullets were chasing us through the woods.\" -Young woman, 17, Philippinesand may pose a threat to peace and security.\"10 The majority of children who have been recruited in Haiti remain associatedwith armed groups, despite their ongoing transformations. In fact, children themselves have foundtheir status changing - once consideredvictims unlawfully recruited, nowtheyareseenas . Indetailing the realities faced by childr engrowing up in such an environment, there are \"confirmed reports that children have been usedas messe ngers, spotters, attackers and porters to transfer and hide weapons, as wellas for kidnappings.\" 11 Childr en have been abducted (in one case, 30 st udents were abducted while travelling on school buses), gang- raped and become victims of other forms of sexual violence. In some cases, armed entities have used schools as a base of operations.12 Recent research and policy analysis on conflict is attempting todocument the changing nature of contemporary warfare and thegravity of its impact on civilians. 13 Specific attention to children, however, remains rare, including thedelineation of age in data collection.Cross-analysis between such research and e xpertise o nchildren is therefore urgently needed. In the interim, this reportseeks t ohighlight key issues that require collaborative action. While each conflict possesses its own unique characteristics, the trends in contemporary conflict that affectTHE DEADLY AND DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF SMALL ARMS The poorly regulated and often illicit trade of small arms and light weapons, along with their wide circulation, \"increases the intensity andduration of armed conflicts, undermines the sustainability of peaceagreements, impedes the success of peacebuilding, frustrates effortsaimed at the prevention of armed conflict, [and] hinders considerably the provision of humanitarian assistance.\" 14 Small arms and light weapons are responsible for the majority of direct conflict deaths - between 60 and 90 per cent, depending on the conflict.15 The ease of handling small arms makes them especially accessible to children. The lightweight Kalashnikov (AK-47) is the most used and availablegun in the world. Untold numbers of children living in situations of armedconflict, sometimes as young as seven or eight, learn how to use them. This familiarity with small arms and their proliferation can sustain a culture of violence in post-conflict societies. At worst it has the potentialto reignite conflict. Guatemala, for example, is the most highly armedcountry in Central America. Only 1,500 weapons were surrendered in the1996 disarmament and, by 2002, the UN Verification Mission in Guatemalaestimated that there were 1.5 million illegal firearms in circulation. Thelevel of violence has reached alarming propor tions, with a recent sur vey showing that 88 per cent of the country's people are worried about becoming victims of armed violence. 16Southern Sudan is also saturated with small arms and light weapons. Among other factors, persistentinsecurity is hobbling attempts to implement the 2005 ComprehensivePeace Agreement between the north and south. A household survey found that almost every household had experienced some form of armed attack since the peace agreement was signed. 17 The 1996 Machel study stressed the importance for children of shifting resource allocations from arms and military expenditures to human andsocial development. This shift is still desperately needed. According to theControl Arms Campaign, an average of $22 billion a year is spent on armsby countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Thecampaign points out that this sum \"would otherwise enable those samecountries to be on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals of achieving universal primary education (estimated at $10 billion a year) as well as targets for reducing infant and maternal mortality (estimated at$12 billion a year).\" 18 2. THE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT 910 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDchildren in particular and demand our att ention include the proliferation of armed groups, the emergence of 'resour cewars'that incit eand sustain conflict, and the internationalization of terrorism. THE PROLIFERATION OF ARMED GROUPS While major inter-state armed conflic ts areonthe d ecline, there are many prolonged, intractable conflicts within States and across bordersinvolving a variety of non-stateactors. In addition, there is an increaseduse o f paramilitary and proxy forces with w eak sy stems of accountability for compliance with international law. The actions and motivations ofthese armed groups may switch backand forth from armed conflict tocriminal violence to other forms ofarmed political violence. An array of labels is applied to non-state groups and actors. Theserange from insurgents and resistance movements to separatists, opposition forces, militias and rebels as well as local d efencegroups and par amilitary units. In Afghanistan, armed groups include tribal factions, criminalnetworks and groups ideologicallyopposed to the Government, includingthe Taliban and the Hizb-e Islami. 19 Somalia, lacking a central government, presents o ne of the most complex situations, involving the Transitional Federal Government, the Union of Islamic Courts (a complex union of clan-based sharia courts), various clanmilit ias and E thiopian government forces (which have the backing of the US Government), along with suspected terrorists with al-Qaida links. 20Children made up an estimated 35 per cent of 1,200 civilians killed and severalthousand inj ured in Somalia between October 2006 and late 2007. 21 Reports indicate that all parties except Ethiopian government forces have recruited and used children.22In Aceh (Indonesia), where only the Free Aceh Movement (GerakanAceh Merdeka) is a party to the 2005 peace agreement, incomplete demobilization has resulted in fluidity among armed groups and an increase in criminal activity andbanditry, in which young people stillparticipate. 23In Nepal, substantial numb ersof children were recruited bythe C ommunist Party of Nepal- Maoist prior to the ceasefire agreement. Evolving unrest in the T erai region has led to the emergence of newpolitical and ar med groups, whose \"actions were criminal as much as theywere political in design,\" and newviolations of children's rights, including recruitment. 24 The miscat egorization of certain armed groups - and their exclusion from dialogue concerning conflict resolution or humanitarian access to civilians - has presented major problems. For one, it has restricted child protection workers from reaching childr en, identifying their needs and highlighting rights violations. Colombia, for example, has been besieged by armed conflict for almosthalf a century. A number of highlyorganized paramilitary groups,private security companies and drug trafficking mafias ha veemerged over the years. They are financed by kidnap ping ,extortion, trafficking or other organized criminal activity, in which children have become involved. 25Between 11,000 and 14,000 children are thought to have Russian Federation \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-1315/Pirozzi2. THE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT 11served in armed groups in a variety of roles in Colombia,26and many of them have remained beyond the reach of child protection workers. Research suggests that the demo- bilization process there has been applied inconsistently and is not reaching all armed groups. As reported by the UN Secretary-General, two illegal ar med groups outside the demobilizat ionprocess \"have been only partially demobilized, and it is believed that children are still present in those g roups.\"27Asaresult, only 15 percent ofColombia's former child combatants have access to demobiliza- tion and reintegration programmes. Those who remain have little hope ofever resuming a normal life. 28 The use o fparamilitary and proxy forces on the part of States increases the vulnerability of children due to diffuse mechanisms of accountability. Militias allied to the Government of the Sudan, for example, including the Janjaweed, have been among themost egregious violators of children's rights. This includes the recruitment and use of children and the use ofrape as a weapon of war. 29The Philippines report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the Optional Protocol notes that \"children are reportedly beingrecruited into paramilitary structures to provide security and protection against ordinary criminal elements such as cattle rustlers, thieves and other armed bandits\" and that these organizat ions \"are also fielded to fight guerrillainsurgents.\" 30The C hildr en's Rehabilitation Centre, a national non- governmental organization with three regional centres, has documented 819 incid ents o fhuman r ights violations involving children in the Philippines from 2001 to April 2005.31 Arising trend is the outsourcing of military and police functions to private security companies. Experts have raised concern about the use of force by such companies and the blurring of distinctions between civilians and persons participating in hostilities.32Allegations of misconduct by private security staff and of inap-propriate links to political parties or paramilitaries are all too frequent. This suggests the need to put greaterattention on ensuring that suchcompanies respect children's rights. Since national law and practice are critical in this area, considerationsand recommendations by theCommittee on the Rights of the Child will be especially important. THE EMERGENCE OF RESOURCE WARS Adistinctive feature of contemporary conflict is the emergence of resource warsor'assetwars', with 'blood' diamo nds a par ticular lynotorious example. Increasingly, armed conflicts that may have originated in political grievances are subsequently driven by opportunistic greed. Resource wars are driven by control of assets, illicittrade and exploitation of natural resources - including diamonds, other gems, timber, drugs, gold and other precious metals - intermingled with arms. The Security Council has noted that \"the exploitation, trafficking andillicit trade of natural resources have contributed to the outbreak, escalation orcontinuation of armed conflict.\" 33 As parties to armed conflict look for new sources of revenue, childrenare drawn into additional forms of \"They are not human.

They don't have sisters and brothers, they only have a gun.\" - Girls and young women, 14-17, Somalia12 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDhazardous labour, in addition to being recruited and used for militaryobjectives. For example, many analystsnote that in Angola, the struggle between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for T otalIndependence of Angola (UNITA)might have ended in 1992 had it notbeenforUNITA 's control over diamo nd revenues. This was made possib le bythe seizure of large numbers of children to work as soldiers and as labourers in thediamo nd mines and b ythe MPL A's abilitytocapture revenue from petrodollars. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where exploitation of the country's rich mine ral resources has been a prominent feature of the conflict, it is c ommon to find large numbers of children working in mines and used in trafficking. Acaring and p rotective environ- ment for children erodes further as civilians are pillaged, assaulted sexually and forced into labour.Childr enare at special risk because the groups that control resourcestypically also control communitystructures and assume state functionsin such areas as health, education, policing and j ustice.Armed groups cast the mselves as officials and extort civilians b ehind a v eneerof legitimacy. They interrupt the delivery of basic services, destroy livelihoods andplunge populations into deep and relentless poverty.The international community is struggling to respond to resource wars. Sanctions and embargoes canbe effective, but they must be carefully targetedto ensure they do not inflict unint ended harm. At the time of the 1996 Machel study, sanctions onregimes in a number of countries were having devastating effects on child mortality and the maintenanceof basic services. T oday, sanction measures by the Security Council are more targeted, and the humanitarianimpact is assessed. Beyond such measures as sanctions, a wider understanding of child rights in situations of armedconflict is required, along with a focusoncorporate social responsibility. Some of the most promising measures involve actions and cooperation among UN Member States and multinational enterprises. Certification schemes such as the Kimberley Process are potentially capab le of restricting the movement of goods that promote conflict involving children. 34Such schemes must include strict prohibition of violence against children and explo itationand ab use o f them. T o strengthen prevention and sustainab le action,children's rights must be integral to measures upholding a ccountab ility. The Special Representative of the Secretary- General on human rights and transnational corporations and otherbusiness enterprises has stressed that\"no single measure would yield more immediate results in the human rightsperformance of firms than conducting [human rights impact assessments].\" 35 Domestic law and legislation relating toindividuals and corporations operating multinationally should complement international treaties byimproving p rovisions regarding labour, disclosure and complicity in situations violating children's rights. INTERNA TIONALIZA TION OF TERRORISM In recent years, terrorism has come to define the security discourse. International terrorist incidents declined during the 1990s and thusdid not f eature in the 1996 Machel study. But the trend is now reversed: Incid ents o f international terrorism quadrupled between 2000 and 2004. 36 Asrecently affirmed by the UN General Assembly, \"acts, methods and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are activities aimed at the d estruction of human rights,\" 37 including children's rights. As noted in the Machel review presented to the General Assembly in 2007, \"such attacks are disproportionately against civilians, often perpetrated in places of worship, marketsquares and othe rpublic places.\" Children are consequently killed or injured or become indirect victims w ith the d eath o f their family members, especially parents. Woefully insufficient attention is being given to children amid \"Drugs are the root cause of recent armed conflict. Because of drug trade money, people can acquire arms. These people start using drugs, which makes them act violently, more and more so, until they spur each other on to murder, to rape and to abuse children.\" - Young men, 16-18, Haiti2. THE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT 13the 'war on terror' paradigm. Analyses of terrorism or counter-terrorism rarely consider the impacton children. Y et terrorism and count erterrorism measures can havemultiple consequences for children, as described below. Targeting of children as victims. Recent years have witnessed strikinginstances of terrorism aimed atchildren. Examples include the 2004hostage-taking at the Beslan school in the northern Caucasus and the2007 suicide bomb attack against adelegation of members of parliamentand civilians in Pul-i-Khomri district,Baghlan province, Afghanistan. Thelast atta ckalone killed 70 people, including 52 schoolchildren and five teachers. Of the 110 injured, half werestudents. 38 Targeting of children as perpetra- tors. Of great and growing concern is the use o fchildren as perpetrators or accomplices in terrorist acts, including across borders. Reports from Afghanistan note that childrenare\"being used to perpetrate attacks and, in so me cases, as human shie lds by the Taliban and other insurgents.\" 39 Astudybythe U nitedNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan concluded that at least some of the suicide bombers in that country are children aged 11 to 15 who have been tricked, promised money or otherwise forced. The study alsofound that bombers \"appear to be young (sometimes children), poor,uneducated, easily influenced byrecruiters and drawn heavily frommadrasas (I slamic r eligious sc hools) across the border in Pakistan.\" 40 In Iraq, children have been used as decoys in suicide car bombings \"by insurgent group milit ias, Al-Qaida and Al-Qaida-affiliated groups.\"41In Sulawesi (Indonesia), reports indicate that the y oung me nrecruited by the insurgent groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Mujahidin KOMPAK with thehelp of local leaders were youths who hada\"history of violence.\" 42 Counterterrorism measures have also posed challenges, especially withregards to the violation of interna- tional standards of juvenile justice. Partly because Palestinian children are used in terrorist attacks, they are increasing ly under suspicion. Also, morethan 1,500 Iraqi children are in detention in Iraq. They are accused ofmaking and planting roadside bombsor caught when acting as lookouts orcarrying guns. These children are either under administrative detention byUS f orces,orin Iraqi detention. 43 Amnesty International has reported grave abuses against childdetainees. 44 Hundreds of children have been detained by Israeli forces,under military provisions thatcontravene international humani- tarian law and standards of juvenilejustice. A 2007 report of the Secretary-General notes that \"at any given point during the reporting period, between361 and 416 Palestinian children were being held in Israeli prisons anddetention centres, including childrenas young as 12 years. ... There are reports that some children held in detention undergo physical beatings and psychological torture, includingthreats of sexual violence. Thesystematic transfer of Palestinianchild p risoners outside the Occupied Palest inian T erritory into Israel is in directviolation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\" 45The 2006 report of achildren's rights organization operating there showed that 64 per cent of children's sentences were on charg es of stone-throwing.46 In2007, UNICEF and other child protection actors worked with the Government of Afghanistan and other rule-of-law actors to advocatefor juvenile justice consistent with child rights. They called for the anti- terrorism law under development to explicitl ystatethat, in the case of children, only the Juvenile JusticeCode would apply. Other countries face similar legislative challenges.In2007 in I ndonesia, for instance, legislative reform was needed toensure that the anti-terrorism lawcomplied with domestic and inter-national standards of juvenile justice. The use o faerial bombardment todeal with terrorism also has conse- quencesforchildr en. In Iraq and Afghanistan, there have been cases of mistaken identity and collateraldamag ewhere the victims have been children.14 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDRestriction of access to basic services. Terrorism and counter- terrorism measures have also multiplied restrictions on children's lives and their access to basic servicesand protection. Again, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian T erritory is especially grave. According to aDecember 2007 report of the Secretary- General, \"The denial of passage or delays at checkpoints has significantly affected the access of civilians, partic- ularly children, to medical care and services, causing serious threat to their physical health.\" 47Curfews and checkpoint closures have also disrupted children's access to education. This has contributed tothe perpetuation of the crisis, sincepoor school performance has been akey factor in encouraging young people to join militant factions. 48In Nepal, contrary to peacebuilding andprevention objectives, donor restric-tions prevented some agencies fromproviding programmes for childrenassociated with the Maoists. 49ALTERING OUR RESPONSE Current methods of counterterrorism may only beget more violence. In November2007, a report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and p rotection of human rights while countering terrorism identifiedelements in current counterterrorism legislationand st rategies that are counterproductive for youth. Other inadvertent effects, the report pointsout, are marginalization of vulnerablegroups, including young people, and the creation of conditions that provide\"fertile soil for recruitment to move- ments that promise prospects for change but resort to unacceptable means o facts ofterrorism.\" 50Indeed, amore constructive response may be one that echoes the calls made in this report - that is, attention to the multifaceted needs of children and young people in a way that also enlists the ir active involvement. Resear chsuggests that urban young people with some educationbutfew job prospects and no opportunity to express dissent or participat econstructively in political processes are seen as a pool of potential recruits for those whoinstigate others to violence. 51An evaluation of a German anti-terrorism programme provides important insightsintoapproaches that have proved effective with young people. Among themaretargeted programmes - such as the participation of youth in the political process in Indonesia, addressing the needs of urban youth in the Maghreb States of north Africa,and promoting dialogue between Muslim and indigenous groups in Mindanao, Philippines - that helpedreduce the risk of young peopleresorting to acts of terrorism. Improving opportunities for political participation and job prospects were identified as key components.The assessment also observed that effective anti-terrorism programming is similar to other peacebuildingprogramming and should be incor- Democratic Republic of the Congo \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2003-0554/LeMoyneporated into more traditional development activities.52 Calls for such multifaceted approaches are being taken up ininternational reports and guidelines.The World Development Report 2007 published by the World Bank highlights that incr easing the capa city for lasting and productive civic engagement can help to prevent political violence.53 The OECD-D ACGuidelines f or a Development Co-operation Lens on T errorism Prevention call for \"greaterattention in donor programming to young people's job opportunities and education to prevent the emergenceoffragile,disenfranchised youth.\" These also cite the need to \"deepen analysis of the social changes brought about by development and the multiple causes of disaffection and exclusion among the young.\" 54 KEEPING OUR FOCUS ON CHILDREN Asthis c hapterhas attempted to show, the nature of armed conflict is indeed changing. But what hasremained constant is the vulnerabilityofchildr en. The moral outrage galvanizedbyMrs. Machel in 1996 is still very much needed today. However, what we also have to drawupon today is a firmer foundation ofinternational humanitarian law thatseeks t oprotectchildr en's rights. The good news is that States remain committed to the rules thatgovern and must be applied in armedconflict. The Declaration adopted at the 2002 UN General Assembly Special Session on Children, for example, affirmed the commitment of theinternational community to protectchildren from war. The Declarationstates, \"Children must be protected fromthe horrors of armed conflict. Children under foreign occupationmust also b eprotected, in accordance with the p rovisions of international humanitarian law.\" 55More recently, at the 2007 I nternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent,States expressedthe fact that they are \"convinced that international huma- nitar ian la wremains as relevant today as ever before in international and non-international armed conflictsand continues to provide protection for all victims of armed conflict.\" 56 Intoo many spots around the globe, international law and normsappear to be ignored altogether. Thatmay be the case. But the real challengelies in applying the rules established underinternational humanitarian law. 57Children's rights are not subject toderogation. They apply both in peacetime and in war. And even in the shifting landscape of contemporary conflicts, the international community is not absolved from taking action.AsMrs.Machel reminded us in her 1996 r eport, \"The impact of armed conflict on children is an area in which everyone shares responsibility and a degree of blame.\" /square6 KEY RESOURCES Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI Yearbook 2008: Armaments, dis- armament and international June website, <www.sipri.org>.

THE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT 15Lebanon \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1040/BrooksTHE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN318 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDIn many wars, children and young people are not merely bystanders, buttargets, as the 1996 Machel studyhighlighted. \"Not only are large numb ersof children killed and injured,\" the study said, \"but countless others grow up deprived of theirmaterial and emotional needs,including the structures that givemeaning t osocial and cult ural lif e. The entire fabric of their societies - their ho mes, schools, health systems and religious institutions - is torn to pieces.\" The st udycould only surmise the fullextent of the suffering because data c ollection on the problem was still in its infancy. Although major obstacles remain, the numbers gathered forthis strategic review represent a substantial advance over previous quantitative assessments. Y et more than a decade later, the impact of armed conflict on children remains difficult t ofullyascertain. The information available is patchy, and it varies in both specificity and accuracy. While efforts to systematically gatherdetails o ncertain conflict-related violations and their impacts areunder way, available data are notsufficient to fully compare or identifytrends in the decade since the 1996 Machelstudy. \"Some children fall victim to a general onslaug ht ag ainst ci vilians; others die as part of a calculated genocide,\" the study said. \"Still otherchildren suffer the effects of sexual violence or the multiple deprivationsof armed conflict that expose them to hunger or disease. Just as shocking,thousands of young people are cynically exploited as combatants.\" The study went on to note that both during and after armed conflict,even those children not suffering as adirect result of conflict often sufferequally devastating consequences.Itis to the world's shame that more than a decade after this landmark study, these descriptions remain astrue as ever. Despite areas of progress,as described in other parts of this report, it is clear that children continue tosuffer the extreme effects of war and its aft ermath. THE HUMAN TOLL58 In 2005, a set of conflict-related violations against children wasidentified as part of a periodic report by the UN Secretary-General on childr enand ar med conflict. These six 'grave violations' - killing or maiming children; recruitment or use of child soldiers; attacks againstschools or hospitals; rape and other grave sexual violence; abduction of children; and denial of humanitarianaccess - were chosen for regularmonitoring, reporting and response because o f their exceptionally brutal and deliberate nature. The overview ofthe v iolat ions presented here only begins to tell the story of the impact of armed conflict on children. In addition to the violations documented by the UN-led mechanism, anumber of other violations are alsocommonly perpetrated against children during and after war. T ortureand other forms of ill-treatment,administrative detention, enforced displa cement, sexual exploitation and hazardous work can have equally detrimental effects on the lives ofchildren and young people. Even the briefest analysis of how theseviolat ions aff ect children, outlined below, can deepen our understanding ofthe c onsequences of war. During and after armed conflict, the interruption and disintegration ofbasic se rvices and sources of social protection also lead to further violat ions of child rights - with repercussions that could last a lifetime. In an attempt to explore these iss ues, new analyses conducted for this 10-year review of the Machel study have found that conflict-affected countries and territories have shown less progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) than many of their more fortunate counter- parts,as described later in this chapter. This means that children and young p eople living in those countries are more likely to be poor, malnour-ished, out of school or in generallypoor health than many others aroundthe globe, whether as a cause or a consequenceof armed conflict. While overt violations and negative effects maynot b esolelyattributable to war, it is fairly clear that the interplay of armed conflict, poverty and discrimi- nation often compounds the harmful consequences for children.\"We have all lost a part of our life, and it will never come back.\" -Young man, 18, Burundi\"During the war ,Ilost my 10-year -old brother and 14-year -old sister. Our house was damaged. My father died, and now my older brother works.\" -Young woman, 15, Afghanistan 3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 19Populations affected The scale and scope of armed conflict globally can be measured in differentways. Among these are simply counting the number of conflicts based on a set of defined parameters (as described in chapter2), estimating the number of people affected or killed, or account ing f orother types of human costs. These costs include deaths due tomaln utrition and disease, psycho- logical and social harm, damage to propertyand loss o f livelihoods. Estimat es o faffected populations. Globally, just over 1 billion children under the age of 18 live in countriesor territories affected by armed conflict - almost one sixth of the total world population. Of these,approximately 300 million are underthe age of five. 59In 2006, an estimated 18.1 million children were among populations living with the effects ofdisplacement. Within that group werean estimated 5.8 million refugee children and 8.8 million internally displaced children. 60Inaccurate estimates of overall populat ions,as wellas refugees and internally displaced persons, may arise d ue toongoing movements of people, deliberate attempts to over- estimate or underestimate numbers, or the fact that available populationdata ma yvary in quality. The data are influenced by lack of access to people or communities affected by armedconflic t,absenceoffunctioning birth and death registration systems, and populat Machel study noted that \"an estimat edtwomillionchildr enhave been killed in armed conflict. Three times as man yhave been seriously injured or permanently disabled.\" These estimates are repeatedly cited as current, though they refer to theperiod between 1986 and 1996. 61 It is a concern that such figures, now more than a decade old, are citedwithou tadateorreference. In attempting to update the statistics o ndeaths due directly to Iraq \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2003-0493/Noorani20 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDconflict, the Machel review presented to the General Assembly in 2007 bypassed the issue altogether. Since conflict-related databases are not disaggregated for children, the reviewsaid that it ha d\"found that an attempt to aggregate numbers would giveinaccurate results.\" Instead, it preferredto describe \"specific issues and contexts illustrating the impact of conflict on children.\" Indeed, while there arediffering levels of accuracy in quanti- tative global estimates of populationsaffected and the number of child deaths,available evidence leaves little doubtabout war's horrific consequences. Further accounting of human costs. Epidemiological and humanitarian surveys are beginning to quantify theimpact of armed conflict on disease,its transmission and the disease burdenin a g ivencount ry.For instance, a series of mortality surveys onchildren under five conducted by the International Rescue Committee hasdocumented the humanitarianimpact of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2000. The surveys show that 5.4 million excess deaths occurred betweenAugust 1998 and April 2007. Theconclusion is that the majorityresultedfrom preventable infectious diseases, maln utrition and neonatal and p regnancy-related conditions. Children were disproportionately affected, accounting for nearly half ofthe d eaths w hile c onstituting only one fifth o fthe population. 62 Asimilar s urvey in northern Uganda found a mortality rate of near ly 1,000 excess deaths per week in the Acholi region in the first half of 2005. Forty per cent were children under five.63These cases demonstrate that, globally, the extent of war-related mortality, particularly for children, has y ettobe fully measured. In addition, emotional distress during and after armed conflict is often exacerbated by displacement,lifein overcrowded camps, disruption of social institutions or services,loss of livelihoods, tension withincommunities, and the collapse ofpolitical authority and rule of law. The accum ulationof stress over time and the long-term consequences ofdistressing e vents can ha ve an intensely disturbing and potentially far-reaching impact on children's social, emotional, cognitive and spiritual well-being and development.While the consequences are difficult to assess, research andprogramming are beginning todocument them. Analysis of global data, forexample, has shown \"how protective factors such as parental support and moral guidance can helpchildren overcome horrific experiencesand help to promote individual healingand c ommunityreconciliation.\" 64 The effect of armed conflict on communities is often cited in the professional literature, but the extent of disruption to family life is sometimesdifficult t ocapture. It is not uncommon that families c opewith the hardships imposedbyarmed conflict by encouraging children to take on additional responsibilities to provide forthe family. This can lead to school dropout, working or living on the streets, engaging in sex work and other activities that carry significant protection risks. Armedconflict also frays com- munity structures. Research conducted in a n umb er of camps for internally displaced persons in Burundi found ahighnumb er of child-headed households. Prior to the conflict,families and neighbours looked outfor one another, took care of eachother's children and took in orphans. With the o ngoing ar medconflict, however, families were stretched even tocarefortheir own.This disappear- ance of informal social networks to look after orphans and other children at risk was shown to have made them even more vulnerable. Occupied Palestinian T erritory \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0772/El BabaGrave violations against children An examination of the six grave violations against children identified above is an important tool for assessing the c onsequences of war. The d ecision by the UN Security Council t ofocus o nthese six violations grows out of its determination to fight impunit ybydelineating specific, targetedcrimes committed by persistent violators of child rights. KILLING OR MAIMING Killing o rmaiming includes any action that results in the death or serious inj ury-such as scarring, disfigur ement or mutilation - of one or more children. While often intentional, maiming can also result from wounds caused by bullets in a crossfire or detonation of anti- personnel landmines. Widespread deliberate targeting of children and other civilians creates aclimate of fear that is often effective in destabilizing and scattering civilian populations. Such tactics are a matterof tremendous concern in such countries as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Somalia, Sri Lanka and the Sudan. The principles of distinction and proportionalityrequire fighters to distinguish between combatants and civilians, and they prohibit civilian damage beyond the scope of military advantage. But this principle is eroding among armed forces and groups. Another worrisometrend is the rise in suicide attacks, andthe manipulation and use of children to carry them out, especially in suchplaces as Afghanistan, Iraq and theOccupied Palestinian T erritory. 65 Apositive note is the marked decrease in c hild cas ualties fr om anti-personnel mines, a result of efforts to slow their proliferation. These inc lude adoption of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production andTransferofAntipersonnel Mines and on their Destruction. Also effective has b eenthe ple dgebyanumber of non-stat earmedactors to adhere to the 'Deed of Commitment' banning anti-personnel landmines, initiated by the organization Geneva Call. Yet more than a third of the global casualties from explosive remnants of war are children. Some progress has also been made in this area: Recorded casualties continue to fall, and in 2006 over 450 squarekilometres of contaminated land werecleared. 66Threats r emain, however, in as man yas 78 c ount ries affected to some d egree by landmines and about 85 affected by explosive remnants of war. Around 13 countries continue to produce - or reserve the right toproduce - anti-personnel mines, with no decrease in the past two years. 67 RECRUITMENT OR USE OF CHILDREN BY ARMED FORCES AND ARMED GROUPS Despite wide condemnation and response o ver the last decade, girls and boys continue to be recruited or used by the armed forces and armedgroups. Recruitment is defined as thecompulsory, forced or voluntary conscription or enlistment of children into any kind of armedforces or organized armed group(s).Oncerecruited, children might be usedas fig htersor for non-combat purposes, including sexual ones. Inrecent years, concern has increased about the re-recruitment of previously released children. Andwithout specific forms of assistance and support, children recruited into armedforces or groups are often in mortal danger if they try to escape. They also face huge barriers in making the transition from militaryto civilian life and returning to theirfamilies and c ommunities. Inhis r eports to the Security Council on children and armed conflict, the Secretary-General has listed parties that recruited or usedchildren in situations of armed conflic tin 17 countries or territories from 2002 to 2007. 68These same reports cited a total of 127 different parties in volvedin such actions during that time. Of these, 16 parties, sometimes referred to as 'persistent violators' , have appeared on the list four consecutive times.69 The goodnews,according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldie rs,is that the number of armed conflicts in which children are involved is down, from 27 in 2004 to 17 by the end o f2007. Still, \"tens of thousands of children remain in the ranks of non-stat earmed groups in at least 24 different countries or territories,\"\"When we were living in the camp [for internally displaced persons] there were people everywhere in avery small place. It was horrible.\" -Girl, 13, Sri Lanka 3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 2122 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDaccording to the Coalition's 2008 Global Report. The report goes on to say, \"The record of governments is also little improved - children were deployed in armed conflicts by government forces in nine situations ofarmedconflict, down only one fromthe 10 s uch situations recorded when the last Global Report was published in 2004.\"70 While it is possible to determine where children are associated with armed forces or armed groups, it is much more difficult to determine how man ychildren have been involved. Infact,the Coalition to Stop the Use ofChild Soldiers no longer provides estimat edfigur es.However, there is a sense that the numbers have fallen over the past decade, as conflicts in some countries have ended and demobilization agreements have been reached. The difficulty in assessing the full extent of the problem is partly due to fear about the repercussions ofreporting among families and communities, as well as armed forces and groups. Also, formerly recruited children may want to hide theirprevious association with armedforces or groups to avoid stigma.Field reports often contain scant numb ersofrecorded cases, and where numb ers do exist, they are often not compar able across countries. ATTACKS AGAINST SCHOOLS OR HOSPIT ALS Attacks onschools and hospitals include targeting of educational or medical fa cilities resulting in their total or partial destruction. They may also involve the occupation, shelling ordeliberate targeting of personnel, students or patients. These attacks not only damage property and harm the individuals involved; they also incite fear and limit access to these basic services by other children.Schools and hospitals are often madeinaccessib le to conflict-affected populations because of militaryoccupation or their use as camps for internally displaced persons. Attacks on and occupation of education and health-care facilities \"have risen dramatically in recent years,\" according to the Machel strategic review presented to the General Assembly in 2007. The destructive effects of attacks on schools are magnified by the importance ofeducation in sustaining children's well-being in wartime and in helping pave the way to post-conflict recovery. Incident reporting on education attacks suggests that the worst- affected countries and territories over the past fi veyears are Afghanistan, Colombia,Iraq, Nepal, the Occupied Palestinian T erritory, Thailand and Zimbabwe. 71InAfghanistan between August 2006 and July 2007, 133 incidents of school attacks were documented. A number of deliberateattacks targeted female students and teachers. Of growing concern is the situation in Thailand, where more \"We were mobilized by our clan militia heads to come to the playground. All of us were young people about the same age. They told us to defend our village. We were in the queue with our guns. When the Marehan clan attacked us we defended our village.\" -Boys and young men, 14-17, Somaliathan 100 schools were burned down in late 2006 and early 2007.72Such attacks are a major factor in keeping children out of school and limiting their ability to concentrate in class. Similarly, attacks on health facilities and workers continue to hamper access to health care, playing arole in d enial of humanitarian access. After the April 2006 attack on ahealth clinic in Afghanistan and the murder of five of its staff members, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res pulled out of the country - after 24 years of providing health services there. Due toattacks onhealth c entres, along with g eneral insecurity and poor service provision, agencies haveestimated that only 40 to 50 per cent of people in Darfur had access to health services in 2007. 73 RAPE AND OTHER FORMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE The use of rape and sexual violence as a war tactic - and the impunity affordedits perpetrators - poses a particular risk to girls in conflict zones. Attention to rape as a weapon of war began during the conflicts inthe Balkans and Africa's Great Lakes region in the early 1990s. Y et limited progress has been made on theground to end this crime. From 2000 to 2007, as part of the S ecretary-General's reports on childr enand ar medconflict, rape and other forms of sexual violence werecited in 16 countries and territories: Burundi, the Central African Republic,Chad, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, theDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Israel, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda and the former Yugoslavia. The risk of sexual violence increases dramatically with the increasedpresence of fighting forces and thebreakdown of law and order. In suchcases mechanisms for protection are typical lyno lo nger functioning or are not given priority. Moreover, the b y-products of armed conflict - povertyand jo blessness - can create extremely perilous conditions for young girls, including trafficking for sexual e xplo itation. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a climate of impunity has resulted in rampant sexual violence:From October 2006 to July 2007, more than 10,000 survivors of sexual violence, 37 per cent of whom werechildren, were identified by United Nations partners in the eastern region. 74It is believed that during the war in S ierraLeone, as many as 10,000 w omen and girls were abducted, mostly from rural areas, toservethe R evolutionary United Front. Their primary role, according toUNICEF, was to provide domestic and sexual services. ABDUCTION The abduction of children by force, either temporarily or permanently, canrange in purpose from recruitment by armed forces or groups and \"For the time being, there are many violent attacks that may happen at any time. Some of us may die in the street or in school or even at home, which means no safety for anyone at any time.\" -Girl, 12, Occupied Palestinian Territory 3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 23Georgia \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0683/Volpe24 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDparticipation in hostilities to sexual exploitation or abuse, forced labour,hostage-taking, information- gathering and indoctrination. Recruitment of a child by force is considered two separate violations:abduction and recruitment. The most recent Secretary- General's report on children and armed conflict cited cases of abduction in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, the Occupied Palestinian T erritory, the Sudan and Sri Lanka. 75Between 2003 and 2006, additional abductions were noted in Angola, Iraq, Liberia, Myanmar,Nepal, Sierra Leone and Uganda. One of the most notorious situations involving widespread abduction of children over the past 10 years took place in northern Uganda, where the number of abductions since the onset of armed conflict wasestimated to have reached 25,000 or more. 76In fact, the Lord's Resistance Army would likely have been unableto mount a viable fighting force without child abductees. Inthe U gandan districts of Kitgum and Pader, more than one third of allmale youths and one sixth of all female youths have been abducted for at least a day. 77In June 2005, it was estimated that as many as 40,000 children and youth were 'commuting'to city centres each night to escapethe possibility of abduction. However,the security situation has improved,and sinc eearly2007 less than 1,000 were continuing to commute. 78DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN ACCESS 'Denial of humanitarian access' entails blocking the free passage or timely delivery of humanitarianassistance to persons in need, including children. There is a pressing need to better define the scope of the term, since it is often used euphemistically. Humanitar ian a ccess may be denied for either security or political reasons. A State or non-state actor may claim it wants to protect human- itarian workers from danger when inrealityit has a hidd en agenda of limiting witnesses to human rights abuses. Since States are bound toprovide access to civilians in need under international humanitarian law, a State's obligation to allowhumanitar ian a ccess is all the more pressing if the c onflic tis declared an 'armed conflict' . The 2007 Secretary-General's report on children and armed conflict highlighted restrictions of humani-tarian access affecting children in Colombia, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan (Darfur). 79In addition, the Secretary-General's report on protection of civilians cited access restrictions in Afghanistan, the D emocratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Myanmar, Somalia and the S udan (Dar fur). It specifically highlightedconstraints in the Sudanese region of Darfur.80Millions of children are denied the humanitarianassistance they need in these andother situations.Of particular concern is what seems to be an increase in deliberate attacks against humanitarian workers.One report found almost a doubling of major acts of violence against humanitarian workers between 1997 and 2005. National staff were at particular risk. 81In2007 in Afghanistan, morethan 130 attacks took place against humanitarian programmes, with 40 humanitarian workers killed and 89 abd ucted.82 The most recent report of the Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in armed conflict highlights constraints on humanitarian access as aprincipal protection concern. The report launched an initiative to better monitor and document access constraints. This includes efforts to better define the concept by developing a typology of access constraints, such as lack of security in the o perating environment, blocking ofaid ship ments and deliberate attacks against humanitarian workers. OTHER CONFLICT - RELATED VIOLATIONS Violations against children - including torture, enforced disappearance, administrative detention, forced displacement, sexual exploitation and ab use, and hazardous work - havealso b eenreported during and after armed conflicts. Torture. T orture and other forms of ill-treatment remain prevalent in armed conflict situations, even though prohibited by the 1984 Convention against T orture and\"The girls when captured are made wives, and if the girl is not yet of age she gets damaged.\" -Young man, 16, Sierra Leone3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 25OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and other conventions and treaties, including the C onvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). In a 2000 report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commissionon Human Rights on torture andother cruel, inhuman or degradingtreatment or punishment, particularconcern was noted over children'ssubjugation to extreme forms oftortureand othe rill-treatment as a result of armed conflict. Enforced disappearance. The enforced disappearance of childrenafterarrest, detention or abduction with the a cquiesc enceofagovernment is prohib itedby the 1992 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It is consideredacrime und er interna- tional la win the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the r ecentlyadopted International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Watchlist on Children and ArmedConflic tidentified, among othe roccurrences, a widespread pattern of enforced disappearances in Nepal, including among thoseunderage18,as par tofthe f ormer government's counter-insurgency operations. para-militar ygroups were implicated in enforceddisap pearances of children throughout the late 1990s and the early part of this decade. Administrative detention. The 2007 Secretary-General's report on childrenand armed conflict expresses concern over the prevalence of detained childr en in Burundi, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq,Israel and the Philippines. In the context of armed conflict as well as counter-terrorism activities, anunkno wn number of children in several parts of the world have beendetained on security grounds. They areheld thr oughan administ rative (non-judicial) process that often denies guarantees of due process,such as the right to legal defence or to challenge the decision with anindependent authority. Typicalfeatures of administrative detention includeundetermined duration, restricted contact with family and limited monitoring. Forced displacement. Acommon and visible violation during armed conflic tis forced displacement, whether within one's own country or across national borders. Displacementcan be both a cause and a consequenceof armed conflict, typically increasingchildren's risk in terms of otherviolat ions. Children's well-being is also in jeopardy if they become separatedfrom their families or caregivers. As previously mentioned, an estimat ed 18.1 million children were among displaced populations in 2006 (see table 1). At that time, the est imat edtotal p opulation of internally displaced persons was well over a third higher than the total number of refugees. Despite the somewhat higher percentage of refugeeswho ar echildren (41 per cent of refugees are children compared to 36 per cent of internally displaced persons), the absolute number of displaced children is a third higher than that o f child refugees. Evenwhenaccompanied by parents or caregivers, displaced children often have to take on adultresponsibilities or dangerous tasks. Displacement subjects them toprecarious living conditions and insecure environments with limited access to education and health care. Sexual exploitation and abuse. The risk of sexual exploitation and abuse incr eases dr amat ically during and after armed conflict. During repatriation and reintegration, for example, children are especially vulnerable to conditions that canexacerbate gender-based violence.Low estimate, all ages (millions)High estimate, all ages (millions)Estimated total, all ages (millions)Per cent childrenNumber of children (millions)Per cent womenNumber of women (millions)Per cent women and childrenNumber of women and children (millions) Refugees by origin11.2 17.2 14.2 41% 5.8 26% 3.7 67% 9.5 Internally displaced persons15.7 25.2 24.5 36% 28% 13.2 66% 31.3TABLE 1.

In addition, the preconditions for and causes of sextrafficking are compounded in armed conflict and post-conflict settings. Theycan lea dtoenslavement, forced prostitution and rape. Finally, the visibility and persistence of allegations of sexual exploitationand abuse by peacekeepers has been striking in r ecent years. The Under- Secretary-General for PeacekeepingOperations has acknowledged the endemic nature and exploitative dimensions of the problem. Hazardous work. Asdescribed in chapter 2, children have increasinglybeen pulled into hazardous forms of work as parties to armed conflict seek newsour ces of revenue to sustain military campaigns. Children work because their survival and that of their families d epend o nit - a situation that often worsens in an environment of armed conflict. However, such work can put them at risk. International Labour Organization Convention 182 identifies childslavery, trafficking, debt bondage, forced recruitment of children for use in ar medconflic t,prostitution, pornography and the production or trafficking of drugs as the worstforms of child labour. It calls on these to be immediately eliminated.THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF CONFLICT ON DEVELOPMENT It is readily apparent that armed conflict not only leads to violations ofchildr en's rights but in many contexts hamp ers development progress, and thus children's opportunities. Thereare many ways to explore this issue, and discussion of specific conse- quencesfollows throughout this report. A comparison of progress towards the MDGs in conflict-affected countries and elsewhere provides a more global understand- ing o fhowconflic tinterrupts and delays development. 84 The MDGs have become a universal framework for reducing poverty and promoting development since adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration by UN Member States in 2000. Six ofthe eight goals include specific commitments to promote child rights; the remainder address problems of the communities aroundthem.Giventhe goals' emphasis on childr en,progress towards achieving them - or lack thereof - can be an important indicator in understandingthe situation of children affected byarmed conflict. The M achel review presented to the General Assembly in 2007 noted that, \"whether as a cause or as aconsequence, conflict is a significantobstacle to achievement of the MDGs.\"Despit ethis asse rtion, halfway to the 2015 targ etdate for achievement of the MDGs, limited analysis has beenmade of progress in conflict-affected countries. Most research on these countries has concentrated on sectors, such as education, rather than the ful lsetofgoals. The impact of conflict as measured by the MDGs Identifying c onflict-affected countries. As highlighted earlier, the number of armed conflicts said to be taking place at any one time across the globe varies widely depending on the criteria used. T o analyse MDG progress, it was first necessary to identify a recognized set of conflict-affected countries. Through compar isonof three reliable conflict databases, 33 countries were found to have experienced at least one armed conflict on their own soil between 2002 and 2006 (see table 2). 85 The 33 c ount ries and territories identified are Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Congo, C\u00f4ted'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq,Israel, Lebanon, Liberia, Myanmar ,Nepal, Nigeria, the Occupied Palestinian T erritory, Pakistan, Philip pines, Russian F ederation, Rwanda, Senegal,Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey and Uganda. From this list it is clear that armed conflic tis a g lobal p henomenon, although Africa and Asia are affected disproportionately: Among the 33 countries and territories, 16 are in Africa and 9 are in Asia. The remaining3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 278are in the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. Itis also noteworthy that armed conflictoccurs in countries with widely varying levels of economic development. Roughly half the 33 countries or territories have been designated as'least developed' , while the other halfrepresent a le-inc ome c ountries. Analy sing sp ecific MDG indicators. This analysis compared the 33 conflict- affected countries that have globaland r egional estimates for each MDG indicat or. This includes selected indicat ors, such as underweight prevalence for children under five, primary school enrolment and under- fivemortality rates. For each MDG indicator reviewed, 196 countries were ranked, regardless of whether they were affected by conflict, to identify those countries appearing amo ng the w orst 20 performers. In addition, a review was made to determine whether conflict-affected countries were considered on trackforeach MDG target. While this initial analysis has not determinedany degree of causality, a number of interesting findings emerged thatreinforce a special concern for children in conflic t-affected countries. Globally, more than two thirds ofchildr enunderfive who are under- nourished live in countries affected by conflict. Children out of primaryschool in these countries constitute as many as two thirds of that groupNotes: 'X' indicates at least one violent conflict (minor conflict or war ,as per the Uppsala Conflict Database; severe crisis or war, as per the Institute of Heidelberg) in a given year. Data from theUppsala Conflict Database includes both 'wars' and 'minor conflicts'. 'War' is defined as a conflict with at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a year. 'Minor conflict' is defined as having at least 25 butless than 1,000 battle-related deaths in a year .Institute of Heidelberg data include 'violent conflicts of high intensity', referring to conflicts scoring 4 or 5 ('severe crisis' or 'war') on the 0-5 range of thedatabases. Project Ploughshares defines an armed conflict as having at least 1,000 battle-relateddeaths in a year .For the purposes of this analysis, minor conflicts were also included, based on the Uppsala Conflict Database criterion of at least 25 but less than 1,000 battle-related deaths.

And two thirds of conflict- affected countries have shown insuffi-cient or no progress in reducingunder-five mortality rates. Of populat ions without improved sanitation and safe drinking water globally, approximately half live incountries affected by conflict. Andsuch countries have higher debt servicecosts and lo weroverseas development aid p ercapita than non-conflict count ries. This limits state budgets and other support for children. Furthermore, countries in conflict generally show slow progress towards the MD Gs.Ofthe 20 lowest achievers across al lthe goals, typically half were affected by armed conflict (see table 3). The countries that appeared most frequently among the 20 lowest achievers in each of the MDGs are conflict-affected least-developed countries: Afghanistan, Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia and the Sudan. MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and h ung er.Levels of poverty and hunger are a critical factor in children'shealth and d evelopment. A target for this MDG is, between 1990 and 2015,to reduce by half the proportion ofpeople who suffer from hunger. In reviewing the MDG indicator of underweight prevalence for children under five, this analysis has found that the reare98.5 mil lionunder- nourished children below the age of five living in conflict-affectedcountries. This is more than two thirds of the 143 million childrenunder five globally who suffer from undernutrition. The average underweight prevalence for children under five is 32 per cent in these conflict- affected countries, compared to an average of 25 per cent for the world as a whole. In addition, 19 of the 33 conflict-affected countries have shown either insufficient or no progress towards the target of halving the p roportion of people suffering from hunger by 2015. MDG 2: Achieve universal primary educat ion. Achieving the education- related MDGs is recognized as pivotal in meeting many of the other goals.MDG 2 targets the completion of a fullcourse of primary schooling for boysand girls everywhere by 2015. This analysis reviewed the number ofchildren out of primary school as well as the net enrolment/attendance rates in c ount ries aff ected by conflict. In 2006, nearly 60 million children werenot in sc hool in the 33 conflict- affected countries, 86out of approxi- mately 93 million children of the same ag egroup out of school globally in 2005-2006.87 In these conflict-affected countries, the average primary school net enrolment/attendance ratio (essentially the p ercentag eof children of the appropriate age group enrolled/ attending c lasses) is 81 p ercent. While 10 of these countries are on track to reach universal primary education by 2015, another 19 have shown no progress at all.MDG 3: Promote gender equality and e mpower women. Asastarting point for women's equality and empowerment, a target was set of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education by2005 and at al llevels by 2015. In reviewing the primary school net enrolment/attendance ratio and gender parity index, this analysis found that in c onflic t-affected countries, just o ver half of those not attending primary school, 31.3 million, are girls. Girls clearly fall behind on thisindicator in 13 of the 33 conflict- affectedcountries where the gender parity index is below 0.96. 88 While an impressive 21 conflict- affected countries are on track towards eliminating gender disparity in primary education by 2015, another 12 ha ve made insufficient progress. MDG 4: Reduce child mortality. Addressing child survival is literally amatt eroflife or death. This MDG targets a two-thirds reduction in under- five mortality between 1990 and 2015. This anal ysis found an a verage under-five mortality rate of 81 per 1,000 live births in conflict-affected countries.89This compares to a world average of 72 deaths per 1,000 live births. Among the 33 countriesaffected by conflict, 20 have shown eitherinsufficient or no progress towards achieving the targ et. MDG 5: Improve maternal health. Amother's health is an important factor in a child's survival and\"Most of the children in Afghanistan work on the streets. At the age when they should just study, they are forced to work and earn a living for their families.\" -Girl, 14, Afghanistan 3. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 29development. This MDG aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratioby three quarters between 1990 and 2015. This anal ysis found that, on average, women in conflict-affected countries face a lifetime risk of dying fromthe c omplicat ions of pregnancy or childbirth of 1 in 276. This is less than the world average of 1 in 92 but far higher than the average forindustrialized countries of 1 in 8,000. (The average risk in conflict-affected countries is heavily skewed by Israel[1 in 7,800] and the R ussian F ederation [1in 2,700]). 90 The average maternal mortality ratio for the 33 conflict-affected countries is considered high at 477 per 100,000 live births, compared to aworld average of 400 per 100,000 live births. In fact, about half of the 33 conflic t-affected countries have maternal mortality rates of 550 or more, considered very high. MDG 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and consistently availableonly for conflict-affected countriesfrom sub-Saharan Africa, a comparative analysis was not p ossib le. MD G7:Ens ure environmental sustainability - basic sanitation and safe drinking water. Use of basic sanitat ion and safe drinking water is a key strategy for child survival.This MDG aims to halve, by 2015, the p roportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking waterand basic sanitat ion. This analysis, based on 2004 data, found that just over half a billionpeople (529 million) lack access toimproved drinking water sources in the 33 conflict-affected countries. This represents about half of the 1.1 billionpeople without safe drinking waterglobally. That said, 21 of the 33 conflic t-affected countries are on track to reach the MDG target. Interms of sanitation, a staggering 1.4 billion people living in conflict- affected countries do not have access to improved sanitation facilities. Thisrepresents about half of the 2.6 billionpeople g lobally without toilets or other forms of improved sanitation. Fewer countries have made progressin sanitation than in water: 16 of the 33 count ries aff ectedby conflict have made no progress at all towards halving the p roportion of people without sustainable access to basic sanitation. MD G8: Develop a global partner- ship for development. This MDG calls for comprehensive action to deal with the debt problems of developing countries and to address the special needs of the least-developed countries. Such initiatives are especially important for children because of their impacton national budgets and the provisionof services. Areview of debt servicing found that the 33 conflict-affected countrieshad overall higher debt servicepayments than countries not affected byconflict (8.5 per cent versus 5.9 per cent). 91Moreover, the 33 conflict- affected countries received less aid per capita - $28.20 compared to $43.70 - than no n-conflict countries. This means that, on average, less aid is available for each child in aconflic t-affected country than for children in other developing countries (see table 4, page 31).MDG Indicator Conflict-affected countries Non-conflict countries Among 20 lowest achieversAs a proportion of all conflict-affected countries (N=33) (%)Among 20 lowest achieversAs a proportion of all non-conflict countries (N=163) (%) 1 Underweight prevalence in children 9 27 11 8 2 Primary school net enrolment/attendance ratio 10 30 10 83 Gender parity in primary school 10 30 10 8 4 Under-five mortality rate 9 27 11 85 Maternal mortality 11 33 9 77 Use of improved sanitation 9 27 11 87 Use of improved drinking water source 8 24 12 9 Average number of countries 9 29 11 8TABLE 3.

These includethe g eographic lo cation of an armed conflict and how that might relate to certain development disparities,the influence of armed conflict as opposed to poverty or discrimination on development outcomes, and the continuing legacy of armed conflictonceaconflict is considered over. Geographical disparities. Armed conflicts in certain countries areconfined to particular areas, such as the northern region of Uganda,Darfur in the Sudan, eastern portionsof Turkey, certain parts of India, southernregions of Thailand and Chechnya in the Russian Federation. Only a small percentage of the entirepopulation in those countries isdirectly affected. It can be argued,however, that in some cases, the presence of armed conflict in a count rydrains state resources from other activities and can impede foreign investment, thus affectingchildr en's development opportunities. Because c omparable region/state/ provincial-level data are not currently available for many of the 33 countries being considered, this analysis was not able todifferentiate findings within a country. Unfortunately this means that larg e-population countries with armed conflicts confined to portions of their territory skew certain figures. The socio-economic situation before aconflict. Count ries also differ in their ability to deal with the effects ofarmed conflict because of pre- existing socio-economic conditions.For instance, despite having beendevastated by three wars since 1980,Iraq is a middle-income country. Far moreIraqis ha veaccess to improved sour ces of drinking water and sanitat ionfacilities than Afghans, who live in a least developed country and have experienced several decades of conflict. While inequality and poverty can lead to or result fromDEVELOPMENT IS SLOWED IN WAR-TORN AREAS OF UGANDA The situation in Uganda offers insights into the disparities in development that may be linked to armed conflict. Data from a number of indicators in thenorthern region of the country, which has suffered more than two decades of war, show outcomes that are clearly worse than national estimates. By comparing national estimates with 2006 data compiled by Demographic and Health Surveys for regions that included the North andWest Nile and Karamoja, along with a sampling of camps for internallydisplaced persons, this analysis found that: /square6Levels of pover ty are greater in conflict-affected regions; 58 per cent of the poorest households in the North fall within the poorest quintile nationally. /square6While the prevalence of malnutrition among children under five (as measured by weight for age) was 16 per cent for the whole of Uganda, this rose to 22 per cent in the North and 36 per cent in Karamoja. /square6School attendance is lower in some conflict areas. For instance, 43 per cent of children in the Karamoja area attend primary schoolversus 82 per cent at the national level. /square6The conflict-affected areas of Uganda have a higher under -five mor tality rate, with a rate of 185 in W est Nile versus 134 nationally . /square6In general, a lower percentage of bir ths are assisted by a skilled bir th attendant in areas affected by conflict - 42 per cent at the national level compared to just 18 per cent in the Karamoja area and 31 per cent in the North.armed conflict, it is not possible to establish any causality or clearcorrelation based on data. The c ontinuing legacy of armed conflict. This analysis has taken into account only countries in which activeconflicts were under way over theperiod 2002-2006; post-conflict environments were not considered. Nevertheless, the time it takes from the e nd o faconflict to achieve demonstrable improvement in MDG indicators can be critical. Data fromRwanda, forexample, show that it can tak emorethan a decade for child mortalityindicators to improve after fighting has ended. It takes time to rebuild in all areas, underlining the importance of sustained funding and support. Building on this analysis. In further expanding this analysis, it would be useful todevelop a more detailed assessment and explore specific challenges for children in countries affected by conflict. For example,what uniq ue fa ctors are present in conflict-affected countries that aremaking progress and are on track to meet the MDG targets versus those that are not? What are the key differences between conflict-affected countries and other low achievers? Howdodispar ities in d evelopment progress play out in areas of the country where armed conflict is presentversus areas where it is not? Data on progress made before the outbreak of and during armed conflict could likewise be compared in order to assess the extent to which armed conflict slows or halts development. GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Amajor gap in monitoring the situation of children in armed conflictremains the availability of accurate andreliable data. This is t rue in terms of both specific violations and progress towards a ful lrangeofrights. In the coming years, greater emphasis m ust b eplacedon the enhanced coordination needed to analyse gaps in kno wledge, conduct research, strengthen capacity, addressprogramme needs and establish realistic goals and plans to respond to violations of children's rights and interruptions or delays to development during and after armed conflict. Interventions aimed at preventing armed conflict and building peace should be prioritized. Astrong focus is needed on human rights, conflict resolution and the involvement of children and young people in framing solutions. The following chapters will explore in mo re detail many of the conse- quences highlighted here and suggest specific r ecommendations to further address the situation of children caught in the crossfire of war. /square6All countriesConflict-affected countriesNon-conflict countries Debt service as a per cent ofexports of goods and services, 2005*6.5% 8.5% 5.9% Aid per capita (current US dollars), 2005$40.70 $28.20 $43.70TABLE 4.

THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN 31Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-0461/FurrerCHILDREN AS PEACEMAKERS4Children's participation is itself a human right as well as a means to secure other rights, including survival, protection and development. These rights apply to all children inall contexts, including situations of armed conflict. When girls and boys, especially the most marginalized, have the opportunity to express themselves,toaccess information and t oparticipat ein decisions that affect their lives, they are better able to claim their rights and to holdadults accountable. At the time of the 1996 Machel study, child participation was emergingas an imp ortant aspect of development practice among child-focused agencies.But uncertainty existed about the participation of children in humani- tarian endeavours, specifically in settings affected by conflict. In the intervening years, the nature and scope of participatoryprogramming has expanded, thoughits application in conflict situationsremains limited. Greater emphasis is being pla cedonthe involvement of younger children as well as adolescents, taking int oaccount their evolving capa cities.Atthe same t ime, there is growing recognition of the need to engage with children and youth as participants w ithin sp ecific p rojects and programmes as well as in the various dime nsions of their everydaylives - domestic, educational, economic, cultural and political. The value of understanding and responding to the political and social reality of children's lives has beenhighlighted by a growing number of practitioners and academics in theyears since the 1996 study. 92 WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID While the M achelstudy did not focus at length on children's participation, the p otential of such an approach to programming was indicat edin various sections of the study. In paragraph 182, for example, the study says that \"young p eople should the mselves be involved in community-based relief, recovery and reconstruction programmes. This can be achieved through vocational and skills trainingthat not only helps to augment theirincome, but also increases their sense of identity and self-worth in ways thatenhance healing.\" It goes on to say that \"developing and implementing programmes for younger children\" has been successful in \"giving adolescentsasense o f meaning and purpose.\" PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE At the global level. Anumber of important global developments in thepast d ecade have supported children's participation, including involvement in two major international events: the UN General Assembly Special Session on 34 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD\"We feel and understand what's happening, so we want todo something to change it.\" -Age and sex not specified, Indonesia Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-2173/Cranston4.CHILDREN AS PEACEMAKERS 35Children in 2002 and the 2006 World Report on Violence against Children . For both of these undertakings, children's participation was encouraged at the lo cal,district, national, regional and global levels. Drawing upon lessons learned, standards in children'sparticipation have been established,adapted, adjusted and applied invarious c ontexts to ensure more ethical and meaning ful engagement onthe par tof children. In 2006, for example, the Committee on the Rights of the Childheld a 'Dayof General Discussion onthe C hild' sRight to be Heard' . The event was part of the process of preparing a 'General Comment' to be adopted by the Committee in 2008 that w ould p rovide guidance to States parties in realizing children's right toparticipate. The importance of ensuring implementation of article 12 of the CRC, 93even in situations ofconflict and their aftermath, was raised in the course of this discussion. Participants acknowledged the contributions that children can makein sit uations of conflict, post-conflict resolution and reconstruction followingemergencies. It was also noted thatparticipation can enhance children'spsychosocial well-being and benefit the widercommunity. The importance of protecting children from exposure to situations that ma ycause the mharm was also reiterated. As noted in the introduction, this 10-y ear strategic review of the original Machel study also involvedextensive consultations with and engagement of children and youngpeople affected by armed conflict. Atthe fie ld le vel.Agrowing n umb er ofinitiatives in conflict situations have beenundertaken by local agencies and government institutions with the support of such organizations as UNICEF , the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, Save the Children, Christian Children's Fund and Plan.94For example, efforts havebeen increasing to involve children - including children associated with armed forces - inresearch, monitoring and evaluation to understand and strengthen theimpact of humanitarian responses. 95 The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, for instance, has undertaken programmeand policy reviews and has supported participatory research with adolescents in Kosovo, northern Uganda and Sierra Leone, aiming to highlight adolescents' distinct experiences and their potential as active members of society. 96 Save the Children Norway launched athematic evaluation of children'sparticipation in armed conflict, post- conflict transition and peacebuilding inBosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala,Nepal and Uganda. Throughout this effort,whichlastedfrom 2006 to 2008, children aged 10 to 18 were recruitedas advisers, researchers, reporters and advocates. 97 Childr en's involvement in peace- building is not an isolated activity; it is part of a larger process of transition and r econciliation. While still not commonplace or consistently carried out,children's participation in peace- building has contributed to formal mechanisms, such as peace talks andtruth and reconciliation commissions. The Sierra Leone Truth and Reconci-liation Commission is widelyconsidered a milestone in having created the first 'child-friendly' forum to enable children to participate inthe search for closure to the violence that tore their country apart. Overcoming constraints to children's participation. One constraint on the development ofparticipatory activities has been the concern for children's protection, an especially urgent issue in situations ofPRACTICE STANDARDS IN CHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION Standard 1: An ethical approach: transparency, honesty and accountability Standard 2: Children's participation is relevant and voluntary Standard 3: A child-friendly, enabling environment Standard 4: Equality of opportunity Standard 5: Staff is effective and confident Standard 6: Participation promotes the safety and protection of children Standard 7: Ensuring follow-up and evaluation Source: International Save the Children Alliance, 'Practice Standards in Children's Participation', Save the Children UK, London, to workingwith children in armed conflict,much remains to be done. Gaps are evident in various dimensions of programming, including understanding children's involvement in politicalviolence and confrontational politics;addressing diversity and disparities inparticipat ion;and promoting the ethos o f participation, even in institutional hierarchies. Understanding children's involvement in political violence and c onfrontational politics. The 1996 M achel study observed that it is mislea ding to describe any military recruitment of boys and girls as voluntary. Rather than exercising free choice, these children are more likely responding to a variety of pressures - economic, cultural, social and political. The study recognizes, however, that y oung p eople may engage in political struggles for ideological reasons: \"It is important to note that children may also identify with andfight forsocial causes, religious expression, self-determination ornational liberation,\" the study said.\"As happened in South Africa or inthe Occupied Palestinian T erritory, theymayjoin the st ruggle in pursuit of political freedom.\" Itis imp ortant t ounderstand more thoroughly the motivation behind some children's use ofviolence - or support for it - while avoiding judgements arising fromKOSOVAR YOUTH BECOME A FORCE FOR PEACE During the 1999 Kosovo crisis, around 20,000 young Kosovars in six Albanian refugee camps came together to form their own Youth Councils. The councils took action to improve safety and living conditions in the camps, organized spor ts and music events, distributed landmine-awareness information and provided psychosocial counselling for younger children.When the young activists subsequently returned to their home villages,many continued their community development work, setting up a networkthat promotes local peacebuilding efforts. AFGHAN CHILDREN SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF INSECURITY In north-eastern Afghanistan, children were ask to map what they perceived to be safety risks in their communities, providing poignant evidence of thedifferent realities faced by girls and boys. The exercise, supported by theAfghan arm of the Christian Children's Fund, led to the formation of localChild Well-Being Committees - one for girls and women, the other for men and boys - in individual villages. The committees are monitoring the risksidentified by local children and taking action to mitigate them. The committees are also facilitating the use of small grants to conduct civicworks projects that will improve children' squality of life. Source: M.

Approaching children's participation in political violence or confrontational politics, at times asaconsequence of some degree of choice, is important for programming efforts for the following reasons: /square6Addressing the experiences, frustrations, needs and aspirations that mo vechildren to participate in violenceis vital in t ransitioning awayfromconflic t.101 /square6The kno wledge, skills, strengths and id entities that children acquire through participation in political v iolenceorconfron- tational politics can be put to beneficial use in peacetime. /square6Inclusive and appropriate processes of transitional justiceand peacebuilding are part of reintegrating war-affected children. Indications suggest that partici- patory programming can actually strengthen the ability of children to resist efforts by armed groups to recruit them. For example, some members of village-based children's clubs in N epal targ eted for recruitment have said that their participation in these c lubs he lpedthemassert themselves,negotiate and avoid being lured into dangerous situations. 102 On the other hand, organized participatory activities can also be astepping stone towards involvement in violence. 103When such activitiesSIERRA LEONE'S TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BREAKS NEW GROUND The involvement of children in Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2002-2003 has been hailed as a significant shift that placed children' sparticipation in truth-seeking bodies firmly on the international agenda. Although children's issues were addressed in other truth commissions - in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala and Peru - the process in Sierra Leone set a new precedent by: /square6Soliciting confidential statements from children in all districts of the country /square6Inviting children to testify in district hearings (with suppor tfrom child protection agencies) /square6Organizing a two-day thematic hearing on children in Freetown /square6Allowing official submissions from children to the Commission /square6Suppor ting children' scontributions to a child-friendly version of a Truth Commission study /square6Using a 'Voices of Children' radio programme to disseminate information during the truth and reconciliation process /square6Creating opportunities for children's representatives from a Children's Forum Network to meet with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the President of Sierra Leone Source: United Nations Children's Fund, Adolescent Programming Experiences during Conflict and Post-Conflict: Case Studies, UNICEF, New York, 2004, p. 59; 'Children and Adolescents in Transitional Justice Processes in Sierra Leone', Contribution of the Women's Commission for Refugee Womenand Children to the Machel study 10-year strategic review, June 2007.fail to lead to meaningful change, children whose consciousness andconfidence have been raised throughsuch activities may be susceptible to groups p romising change, including through political or criminal violence. This has been evident in such settings as Kosovo. 104 Addr essing di versity and disparities in par ticipation. Factors such as gender, age, class, caste, ethnicity, religion, language, birth order, residence, level of education, anddisab ilityand HIV stat us all affect the infl uenceof conflict on children. Theyalso aff ect the evolving roles, responsibilities, needs and aspirations of children. Moreover, conflict invariably creates new roles and responsibilities for them. These include the full-time care of younger siblings because of the death, injury or disappearance of parents. If programming fails to take into account the realities of girls' and boys' daily lives and their diverse needs - assuming instead a singular'ideal'of childhood - it is \"unlikely to prove sustainable and may becounterproductive, contributing to asense of disempowerment and alienation amongst participants,\" according t oareport by the Refugee Studies Centre. 105 Community-base dorganizat ions for children and youth - such as clubs, committees and other groups -provide a regular space for expression, analysis, collective action and electionof representatives. However, it is important t orecognize the tendency forcertain c hildr ento be over- represented. Urban children typically enjoy greater opportunities than those in rural areas, for example, and b oystend to participate more than girls in many settings. Moreover, educational level, class or caste, alongwith the force of one's personality orphysical ability, can create unequalpower relations among children and youth. Participatory activities are not imm une t othe consequences, with the r esult that so me children may dominate others or cause their exclusion.As a recent experience in youth programming in Afghanistan has suggested,suchinequalities may reflect and reinforce relations of power within wider society. 106This raises par ticular concerns where patterns of domination or exclusion follow entrenched lines of difference in such categories as class, ethnicity,religious affiliation and gender,thereby echoing and reinforcing the dynamics of conflict. Promoting the ethos of participation, evenin inst itutional hierarchies. In recent years, great strides have been made in developing standards 4. CHILDREN AS PEACEMAKERS 39 Cambodia \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0763/Thomas40 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDand guidelines for participatory programming with children. Theseinclude the practice standards of Savethe Children Alliance outlined in the box on page 35. Nevertheless,participation as an applied approach remains marginal or even antithetical to much of the work of UN andinternational organizations in settingsofarmed conflict. In such circum- stances, the expertise of outsiders is commonly valued more than theviews,knowledge and experience of local people. In emergency settings especially, organizational hierarchiesare commonly reinforced - to thedetriment of consultative ways of working. Much thought needs to begiven to developing the skills, knowledge and dispositions ofhumanitarian workers, as well as to creating organizational structures and cult ures in k eeping with the ethos o fparticipation. 107 Humanitarian programming is usually short-lived. Once a perceivedperiod of 'emergency' is over, agenciesoften withdraw or refocus their efforts. Childr en's participation, however, is inherently development oriented and long term in nature. It offers opportunities for both the personaland collective development ofchildren. The specific challenge of engaging children in the transition away from conflict requires supportthat is sustained throughout the conflict and post-conflict phases and from emergency to develop- ment programming. Promoting and strengthening child-led organizations can be an effective way to bring about sustainableand democratic participation. However, for this to happen, participants may need support in challenging establishedpatterns of discrimination and exclusion based on such factors as gender, class, religion and ethnicity. Collaboration with governments and c ommunityleaders is also required to ensure that spaces for children's participation are incorpo- rated in local governance structures. This inc ludes in schools, local government and child-protection systems - as well as in policy- formation processes, including formal peace talks. In working with boys and girls as partners in this e ndeavour, it is vital to take into account not only the suffering they may have experienced but the skills, insights and knowledge they have acquired. RECOMMENDATIONS While participation received limited attention in the original Machel study, it was highlighted as an important issue in the 10-year strategic review presented to the UN General Assembly in 2007. Thereview encouraged Member States to make a greater commitment to Syrian Arab Republic \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0737/Nooraniaddressing obstacles to the participa- tion of young people in decision-making and to actively promote their engagement in national andlocal-level governance, peace processes and justice, and truth and reconciliation processes. The review also urged an increase in technical and financial investment, including focused support for youth activities,secondary and tertiary education, and li velihood projects. With the aim of further main- streaming children's participation in the coming years, the following are recommended as priorities for action: 1. Mainstream children's partici- pation. Member States, humani- tarian actors and communities should promote the safe and meaningful engagement of childrenand young people in decisionsthat affect their lives. T o achieve this involves (1) institutionalizing mechanisms for participation; (2) a dapting and using g lobal standar ds and guid elines w ith careful consideration of the local context; (3) promoting an egalitar ian, democratic organiza- tional culture that is consistent with the philosophy and aims of children's participation; and (4) building the capacity of adults and staff toworkwith children and youth in conflict and post- conflict situations. 2. Facilitate participation in political processes by childrenand young people. Member States should facilitate the inputand views of children and youngpeople in political processes, including the development and monitoring of peace agreements. Childr en's participation is required to identify, address and monitor structural factorsthat inhib it peaceand/o rthe fulfilme nt ofchild rights. 3.Supp ort organizations led by children and youth. Member States, UN and international and lo cal no n-governmental organizat ions should increase support for the development of inclusivechild-le dand y outh-le d organizations, networks and partnerships by increasing children's access to information, helping them build their skills and sensitizing adults to theimportance of children's partici- pation in civil society. 4.Pursue sustainability of partici- pation. Donors, Member States, UN and international and local non-governmental organizations should seek to make participatory processes s ustainab le, ensuring continuation of donor support and integration into local and national sy stems. 5. Develop research initiatives. Member States, humanitarian agencies and r esear chinstitutes should develop participatory research initiatives with the aim ofinvolving a greater number and range of children in collaborativeand s ustained efforts to analyse the causes and consequences of political violence in each specific context. /square6 KEY RESOURCES Hart, J., Children's Participation in Humanitarian Action: Learning from zones of armed conflict, Refugee Studies Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, February 2004, <www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/PDFs/Childrens%20Participation%20Synthesis%20Feb%202004.pdf>.

It will require \"improved international cooperation, political commitment and action not only onthe part of Governments withinwhose borders conflict exists,\" thestudy said, \"but also on the part of those Go vernme nts w hose citizens are indirectly responsible for inciting orprotracting conflicts for economicor political gain.\" One of the most significant advancements over the past 10 yearshas been the recognition that political and diplo matic engagement is fundamental to resolving conflicts and to responding to the plight ofwar-affected children. Key to theseefforts is action by the Security Counciltoprotect war-affected children as a matt erof peace and security. Towards this end, a series of landmark resolutions has been adopted by the United NationsSecurity Council and General Assembly. Children's concerns are nowmorefrequently reflected in peace negotiations, peace accords and mandat es of peacekeeping missio ns.And regional bodies and other diplomatic initiatives more consistently note the obligations of States and other actors to protect and care for children. This e xpansio nand progress in political engagement is finally beginning to coalesce with advocacy and programmatic initiatives in thefield.Awareness is growing that meaningful efforts to protect andassist these children must includesystematic monitoring of violationsand identification of perpetrators. Itmust also inc ludeadoption of targeted measures against persistent violat orsand e ngagement by all parties in child protection dialogue and action plans. Recent reports speak of the need for an 'era of application' . Alltoo often, as the following chapters make clear, advances at the highestinternational levels belie unspeakable acts of violence against children on the ground. All States have a respon-sibility to accelerate accountability, legislation, policy development andaction at the national level. At thesame t ime, continued and expanded political and diplomatic engagementon children and armed conflict isneeded by all governments and channels, from the General Assemblyand Security Council to regional bodies and bilateral initiatives. PROGRESS AND REMAINING GAPS The work of the General Assembly As explored more thoroughly in chapter 6, the Convention on theRights of the Child, adopted by theUN General Assembly in November1989, and more directly its OptionalProtocol on the involvement ofchildren in armed conflict, providesan overarching basis for the promotion and protection of child rights in both peacetime and war.Article 38 of the Convention calls onStates parties to take every feasiblemeasure \"to ensure protection and care of children who are affected by armed conflict.\" This commitment isreaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit outcome document. 108 While the primary responsibility for protecting children resides with\"Why don't we put them [world leaders] in a room alone and unarmed and it's up to them to finish the conflict by themselves.\" -Young woman, 20, Indonesia Colombia \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0791/DeCesare5. POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 45States, the General Assembly - along with such entities as the SecurityCouncil, treaty bodies, the HumanRights Council and regional organi- zations - has a cr itical role to play in addressing international concerns. The General Assembly in particularcan exert strong leverage on behalfof children affected by war due to itswide-ranging mandat es in human rights and development, its role in setting int ernational standards and norms, and its global scope. The General Assembly's work includes specific resolutions on childr enand armed conflict as well as declarations, pledges and action plans o f a global nature. Among the most p rominent of these is the 2000 M illennium Declaration, out of which emerged quantifiable and time-bound targets for reducing poverty and promoting development - the MDGs. Neither conflict prevention norchild p rotection is featured as a specific target. But the goals address man yaspects of children's rights and seek to create an environment inwhichthe r oot causes of conflict are diminished. In the MillenniumDeclaration, Member States com-mitted to \"spare no effort to ensurethat children and all civilian populations that s ufferdisproportionately the consequences of natural disasters, genocide,armedconflicts and other humanitarian emergencies are given every assistance and protection.\" 109 Atthe 2002 UN Special Session on Children, the General Assemblyadopted a strategy for children known as A World Fit for Children. Its Plan of Action includes the commitment to\"protect children from the impact of armed conflict and ensure compliance with international humanitarian lawand h uman r ights la w.\" 110Italso proposes 13 specific actions to protect children from armed conflict. In essence, the General Assembly has enabled the international agenda on children and armed conflict to move forward, including through theMachel study. As part of the follow-up to the study's recommendations, the General Assembly also established themandate of the Office of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary- General for Children and Armed Conflict, which has been an important facilitator of political and diplomatic engagement on the issue over the pastdecade. Since 1994, the GeneralAssembly has adopted an annual resolution on the rights of the child that has gradually become more specific on the need to protect children caug ht up in ar medconflict. 111 Regular dialo gue, with the inpu t ofUN e ntities and othe rs, is requiredtomaintain the c onsensus of UN Member States and adopt more concrete calls for action. This should build on contributions to the Assembly's work, in particular the ann ual r eport of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Children and ArmedConflic t,UNICEF's input into the annual report of the Secretary- General on follow-up to the Special Session on Children, and the annual report of the Committee on theRights of the Child. The reach of the Security Council The greatest advances in political action on children and armed conflict have taken place within the Security Council. Following special briefings and d ebate,the S ecurity Council passe dResolution1261 in 1999. This landmark step affirmed that the protection of children in armed conflict is a peace and security concern. Resolution 1261 created anew platform for political and diplomatic engagement on the issue. Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-0575/Noorani46 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDIt included subsequent action on the part of the Security Council to progressively incorporate the protection of children in conflict in its w ork,as described below. Action on the recruitment of childr enand othe rrights violations. Since1999, the Council's resolutions, statements and debates have generated significant momentum and pressuretohold par ties accountable for violations of child rights, to galvanize work by diverse entities to protectand assist c hildr enin conflict, and tobegin to redress impunity. Aturning point in efforts to address the b ehaviour and r esponsibilities of parties to conflict came in 2001, with Security Council Resolution 1379.It recommended that the Secretary-General attach to his annual report alist o fparties to armed conflict that have recruited or used children in violation of international obligationsapplicable to them. It also called forthe list to include a description ofcountry situations that were on theCouncil's agenda or that could be brought to the Council's attention underarticle 99 of the UN Charter, which allows the Secretary-General to bring to the Council's attentionanything that he o rshe believes may threaten international peace. The fir st list, presented as an annex to the 2002 Report of the Secretary-General on children and armedconflic t, concentrated on situations on the Council's agenda.It listed 23 parties, including governments. One of the challenges in preparing it was the lack of information on the specific ages of children involved in armed conflict, which was necessary in determining whetheraparty was in violation of its particular obligations. The next year's report of the Secretary-General was expanded to includeparties in c ountry situations outsidethe Council's agenda that recruited or used children in armed conflict. These were listed in a separateannex. All subsequent reports have includedcountry situations both under consideration by the Counciland outside its formal agenda. As discussed in chapter 2, 127 parties in 17 country situations were cited on lists covering the years 2002 through 2007. The 'name and shame' initiative provided the Security Council with a valuable tool to press for accountability amo ng par ties recruiting children. Nevertheless, Council consideration of situations outside its agenda has requiredregular advocacy efforts. The lists also offered child protection actors a useful instrument for negotiating with parties to conflict. This has resulted in the subsequent release of children. In itsResolution 1539 of 2004, the Security Council t urned up the heat even morebycalling o nparties list ed by the Secretary-General to prepare and implement concrete, time-bound action plans to halt the recruitmentand use of children.Entry on the list is limited to parties that recruit and use children,even though five other 'graveviolations against children' are now monitored by the Security Council. This is a point of ongoing discussion. It is therefore important to considerthe list in conjunction with theSecretary-General's full reports,in w hichthe r ecruitment and use ofchildren is put into context with progress and shortfalls in releasing children and other violations committed by a party. For example,the sit uationof Haiti has not been citedin the S ecretary-General's lists. Butreporting on other grave violations of children's rights in Haiti, outlined in the b ody of the Secretary-General's reports, has contributed to a more coordinated response by the peace- keeping mission there and by other actors. Most recently, Security Council Resolution 1780 condemned the grave violat ions against children in Haiti, including \"widespread rape and other sexual ab use of girls.\" 112Aconstructive development in 2005 was the notationofothe rgrave violations committed by a party in the annexes of theSecretary-General's report. Another recent advance has been the 'delisting' of certain armed groups that ha vecome int overified compliance. The situation of C\u00f4te d'Ivoireis one example. Following the 2003 listing of certain parties to the conflict there and subsequent efforts of child protection organizations on the ground, the Forces arm\u00e9s des forces5. POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 47nouvelles released approximately 1,200 children to UNICEF in 2005. In2006, four militia groups submittedan action plan and also began to release c hildr en who had been recruited for combat or non-combat purposes. In 2007, it was determined that someparties had fulfilled their action plansand could be 'delisted' . It is clear thatthe list ing p rocess is an incentive for parties to halt the recruitment of childr enand ensure their release. Monitoring and reporting on grave violat ions of children's rights. In Resolution 1539, the Security Council also cal ledonthe Secretary-General for urgent development of a mechanism tosystematically monitor and report onthe sit uation of children affected by armed conflict. The aim was to provide the Council with accurate, reliable, objective and timely information on the recruitment and use o fchildren by parties to armed conflict as well as on other violat ions of children's rights. Based on discussions with relevant organi-zations insid eand outside the UN system, the Secretary-Generaldetermined that the monitoringmechanism would focus on six graveviolations against children: killing or maiming; recruiting o rusing rgrave sexual violence; abduction; and denial of humanitarian access. Following extensive discussions among Council members, led byBenin and France, the Security Council a dvancedthe dr ive for compliance by establishing the proposed monitoring and reporting mechanism in its Resolution 1612(2005). The resolution created both a monitoring and reporting mechanism at the country level and a Security Council Working Group on children and armed conflict - essentially bridging the gap between political actionat the hig hest le vels and action in the fie ld. In a relatively short period of time, the mo nitoring and reporting mechanism has e xpand ed from a pilot p rojectin se ven countries - Burundi, C\u00f4ted'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nepal, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Sudan - to imple mentation in 11 countries by the e nd o f2007. 113Itis esp ecially significant that the me chanism has been adopted by countries outsidethe agenda of the Security Council, including Chad, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Uganda. The engagementof these countries is a clear sign of the persuasive effect of both dialogueand the threat of action againstviolators of child rights. In Myanmarin 2007, two non-state groups agreedto halt and prevent the recruitmentand use of children after being citedin the S ecretary-General's list and following a series of discussions with UN personnel. The mo nitoring and reporting mechanism is clearly a milestone in progress for children affected by armed conflict. Nevertheless, it stillhas shortcomings, including the factthat it is only triggered by the citingof situations and parties for whichrecruiting and using children is an iss ue,not the fi veothe rgrave violations. The mechanism is based on the listing process established in Occupied Palestinian Territory \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0773/El Baba48 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDResolution 1379, despite the broader efforts of the Secretary-General toreport on all six grave violations ofchildren's rights and other issues of concern. T o date, the action plans called for also focus exclusively onchild r ecruitment and use. T o be sure, this emphasis has been strategically helpful in calling attention to the threats topeace and security posed by child recruitment. It has also contributed to a degree of success on that issue since the 1996 study. But it has been at the expense of other equally graveviolat ions of children's rights. Recent discussions among Member States, experts and advocates haveconsidered an incremental approach to addressing the problem. For example, adding incidents of rapeagainst children and other forms of sexual violence as a 'trigger' forcitation in the Secretary-General'slists would mean that such situations would be included in the monitoring and reporting mechanism and in theworkprogramme of the Security Council Working Group. The Machel strategic review recognizes the practi- calityof an incremental approach in view of the workload generated by the mechanism and challenges in preparing verified reports on perpe- trators in conflict-affected contexts.However, in keeping with the original vision of the mechanism, it stronglyrecommends that all six grave violations beincluded, as expressed by the Secretary-General in reports S/2006/826 and S/2007/757. Furthermore, in viewof Resolutions 1261 and 1612, and the demonstrated impact of themechanism as a deterrent and tool to fight impunity, the Machel strategic review suggests expansion of the mechanism to include all situations in which grave violationsagainst conflict-affected children have occurred. Resolution1612 also reaffirmed the C ouncil' sresolve to impose targeted measures against parties that continue to violate their obligations to children. Translating this into concreteaction remains a central issue, one that w illchallenge the credibility ofthe int ernational community in terms of its commitment to children in the d ecade to come. Advances made by the Security Council W orking Group. The Working Group established by Resolution 1612 reviews reports of the mo nitoring mechanism, assesses progress on action plans for the release of children, reviews information on the other five grave violationsagainst c hildr en and makes recom- mendations to the Council as well asother bodies in the UN system onmeasures to promote the protectionof children affected by armed conflict. The Working G roup has adopted terms of reference and a programme ofworkforbimonthly meetings and consideration of scheduled country reports. The leadership of France as chair of the Working Group and that Afghanistan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-1137/Nooranicountry's overall commitment to the issue of children and armed conflicthave been a vital source of theprogress since 2005. Part of the Working G roup's success is due to its innovative nature among sub-organs of the Security Council. For example,in addition to its regular workprogramme, the Working Group alsoconsiderswhat is called a Horizontal Note, which helps to monitor - in the most up-t o-dat ewaypossible - key developments in all situations covered in the annual report of theSecretary-General and in other emerging crises. The Working Group also in vites other Member States to relevant discussions on situations of concern and has adopted a 'toolkit' of26 possible actions in response to violations. These include various diplo matic actions, field visits, public statements and targeted measures. The Working Group has taken a firmstand in d ealing w ith egregious violations against children. For example, it has drawn attention to cooperation with the InternationalCriminal C ourt (ICC) in reviewing the situation of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Ugandaand has issued letters to relevantparties in response to all reports reviewedbythe end of 2007. While this is an impressive amount o fworkin a r elatively short time, the effectiveness and credibility of the Working Group will hinge onaddressing a number of key challenges. Among them is the needto take serious action against persistent perpetrators, including theimposition of targeted measures as detailed in Resolutions 1539 and 1612. T o date, 16 parties have repeatedlybeen cited in the Secretary-General's annual annexes, as mentioned in chapter 3. The sit uationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a case in point. Parties and individuals operating in that country have been referred to the Council's sanctions committee since 2006, but no further actionhas b een taken. Where a sanc tions committee exists, and where sanctions are recognized, moremust be done to curb abuses. The adoption of targeted measures by the Council is not only a matter of political will. It also requires anorganizational infrastructure. T owardsthat e nd,the S ecurity Council should seriously consider establishing a sanctions committee exclusively forgrave violations against children in situations of armed conflict. Contrary to a number of specific calls in its r esolutions on children and armed conflict, there has been weak overall integration of childprotection into the peacekeeping and peace agreement work of the Council, as discussed below. In fact, someobservers worry that the Working Group is emerging as the body primarily responsible for ensuring implementation of Council resolutions related to children and armed conflict.For field-level results for children, it is essential that protection of theirrights is given priority in all of the Council's work. Mainst reaming act ionfor children in peacekeeping mandates. Successive Security Council resolutions, the Secretary-General's reports on children and armed conflict, and even Gra\u00e7a Machelherself have all requested that country-specific reports to the Council include issues on theprotection of children and their integration into peacekeeping operations and peace processes.Advancements in this area over thepast d ecade have shown distinct progress, but the track record is insufficient to make a real difference in children's lives. For example, in 2004 the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflic tanalysed the integration of child protection concerns in relevant Security Council resolutions. It found that fewer than 10 of more than 80 country-specific resolutions in theprevious three years included anyreferences to children. Those that did were limited to three countries: Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone. 114 As noted above, progress for children has accelerated with establishment ofthe Security Council Working Group.Still, even in 2007, only 15 of 38 relevant resolutions included specific references to children. 115 5. POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 4950 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDAt present, the Council's atten- tion in deliberating a situation isdetermined by quarterly reports of the Secretary-General. Y et even here,insufficient progress has been demonstrated. In 2006 and 2007, 38 per cent of relevant reports of theSecretary-General to the Councilincluded specific references to childprotection in situations of armed conflict. This is a decline from 43 per cent in 2005, but an improvement from 2003, when only 18 per cent of such reports included references tochildr en. 116 Akeypoint of success since the 1996 M achel study is the integration of issues related to children and armed conflict in establishing peace- keeping and political missions. Where there was previously no reference to children, some aspect of children protection is included in the mandates of 12 of the 13 peacekeeping missions established between 2000 and 2007. While this d emonstrates progress, greater attention must be devoted tothe o ngoing implementation and reporting of a mission over time.Child protection was featured in theestablishment of the UN Mission inLiberia in 2003, for example. But specific att entiontochildren proved tobe problematic on the ground. Provisions forchildren were at first overlooked in a disarmament, demo- bilization and reintegration initiativein that c ountry. And throughout the process it was difficult for childprotection actors to influence the mission's approaches and actionsrelated to children, including in regardto sexual exploitation and violence. 117 Nevertheless, there appears to be growing recognition that peacekeeping can play a major role in advancingthe political dimensions of childprotection. This includes moresystematic mo nitoring and reporting, and dialo gue w ith parties to achieve action for conflict-affected children. Akey development facilitating the role of peacekeeping operationsin the p rotection of children is the deployment of child protection advisers. They assist the head of a missio nin devising a comprehensive approach to the problem, which may include monitoring and reporting; dialogue with perpetrators; assisting the UN C ountry T eam in developing action plans; and ensuring that all civilian, military and police personnel attachedto peacekeeping operations receive comprehensive training in howtoprotect and promote child rights. The first peacekeepingmandat etoinclude a child protection adviser was the United NationsAssistance Mission in Sierra Leone in 2000; over subsequent years,60 posts have been established in 10 diff erent missio ns. The issue of children and armed conflic tis fir mlyonthe p eace and security agenda. Now the Security Council, UN entities and advocates should fur ther explore how peace- keepers could play a more active role in protecting children's rights. Drawing on the prevention andprotection goals of the 'responsibilityto protect' , as set out in the 2005 World Summit outcome document, advocates note greater scope for peacekeeping in places where there is a need to protect populations,including children, from gravehuman r ights v iolat ions. Inputs to the st rategic review suggested that morerobust peacekeeping includes more forceful means of intervention to protect children and bring perpe-trators to justice. Bringing children into peace negotiations and agreements. The 1996 Machel study noted that \"children are rarely mentioned in reconstruction plans or peace agreements, yet children must be at the centre of rebuilding.\" In the ensuing years, the importance of bringing children into peace processes has been recognized, but the actual inclusion of relevant provisions has been random and uneven. Forexample, in one analysis of 30 peace agreements from 1999 to2007, only six made reference to childprotection imperatives. Another, wideranalysis of 103 publicly accessible peaceagreements between 1989 and 2005 f ound that just over half addressededucationin so me way. Children's issues that are less frequently found in such agreements include general commitments to uphold international legal obligations,5. POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 51such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child; ending the use ofchildren by armed groups and theirrelease and reintegration; attention torefugee and displaced children; and attention to rehabilitation programmes and health care for children. 118 While engagement by the Security Council o nsuchissues is crucial, many peace processes and agreements are forged outside the auspices of the United Nations. The Security Council's collaboration with regional organiza-tions and othe rmediators on child protection priorities therefore needs tobepromoted and integrated. In this r egard, greater collaboration is needed between political leaders, child p rotection organizations and experts to ensure timely advice to peace mediators (both inside and outside the United Nations), as well as training in child protection for their support teams. Though it has not been entirely successful, the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement did a good job of incor-porating child protection issues. The agreement gave extensive coverage tothe release of children associated witharmed forces and groups, compensationfor war victims, the role of the African UnionMissio nin protecting children from gender-based violence and the prosecutionofperpetrators. As an important follow-up action, the Security Council adopted Resolution1769 in 2007, requesting that child protection be addressed in the imple-mentation of the Darfur Peace Agreement. The resolution also requested that monitoring of and reporting on grave violations againstchildren continue, as well as dialogueon protection with parties to conflictfor the development of action plans. Child protection was also high- lighted in the 1999 Lome Peace AccordonSierra Leone, which addressed the special needs of children in the disarmament, demobilization andreintegration process. It also establishedthe Sp ecial Court for Sierra Leone, reconciliation processes and anational c ommissio nfor war-affected children. The 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement on Sudan stipulatedasix-month timeframe for the demo- bilizat ionof children and registration of separated children. And the 2006 peaceagreement in Nepal included provisions to cease all types of violence against children, including childlabour and sexual exploitation andabuse, and the use of children less than 18 years of age in the armed forces and ar medgroups. Itis crucial that the c oncerns of children be integrated at the earliest phases o f the negotiation process and followed through in agreements and implementation. Furthermore, child-specific provisions should be viewedas opportunities, rather than aspotential areas of discord. Human Rights Council The Human Rights Council, which includes the protection of children affected by armed conflict within its mandate and responsibilities, is also a crucial d estination for action. The Council meets annually to examine issues concerning the rights and protection of children and adopts anomnibus resolution on the rights ofthe child every four years. The SpecialRepresentative for Children andArmed Conflict submits a report to Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-0370/Parkerthe Council on this basis, as mandated by the General Assembly. The Human Rights Council has also indicated its strong commitmentto ending grave violations against children, pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1612 (2005). The Council's recently launched Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process enables issues ofchild p rotection in general, and children impacted by armed conflictinparticular, to be scrutinized by its members as part of Council efforts to ensure the application andenforcement of international norms and standar ds to protect children's rights and end the impunity ofviolating parties. The work between the UPR and treaty body mechanisms, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child, could beenhanced through coordinated and complementary efforts, which could ensure a more systematic main- streaming o f the rights of children affected by armed conflict throughout the w orkof the council. For example, the Human Rights Council couldensure that concluding observations and recommendations made by theCommittee on the Rights of theChild on reports submitted by States parties in compliance with article 8 of the Optional Protocol tothe Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of childrenin armed conflict also form the basisof the UPR process. ENGAGEMENT BY REGIONAL BODIES In view of the changing nature of conflict and its increasingly trans-national dime nsions,regional p olitical and diplomatic engagement has an increasing lyimportant role to play in responding to such concerns as grave violations, trafficking and displacement. The 1996 Machel study called on regional and subregional bodies t o\"formulate plans of action toprotect children.\" While there are important examples of regional action,this dimension of political anddiplomatic engagement has lagged over the past decade. It requires more concerted commitment from political leaders and other key actors to move from declarations to more structuredmechanisms and follow-up. Constructive action by the Security Council would includeintegration of child protection intoits the matic workon cooperation with regional and subregional organizations. This would help ensure that child protection receives the high-levelpolitical attention it deserves and is integrated into established structures.These should include secretariats, coordination mechanisms, mediation teams and partnerships for maintainingpeace and security. 52 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDDemocratic Republic of the Congo \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-1240/LeMoyne5. POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 53Among regional organizations, the European Union stands out interms of integrating issues related tochildren and armed conflict in a progressive and systematic way. Guidelines on the subject were adopted by the European Union in 2003 - including a commitment to influence third countries and non-stateactors to address the impact of armedconflict on children, to put astoptothe recruitment and use of children, and to end impunity. An implementation strategy for theguid elines was a dopted in 2006. The experience of the European Union suggests that persistent advocacy is needed to succeed in these objectives and that r egional engagement is important. Working across the European Community and European Union system, and in partnerships with other regional bodies, is comple- mentary to approaching governments directly. It also tends to form synergies that strengthen implementation and thus the s uccess of programmes. Re-energizing Mrs. Machel's call forregional action plans featured in the strategic review's consultationswith regional groupings. It led topromising developments - follow-up within the Commo nwealth M inist erial Action Group and by the League of Arab States,whichagreedto action on children's rights in armed conflicts among the priorities resulting fromthe T hird Regional Conference for the Middle East and North Africa onviolence against children. Particularly welcome is the African Union's 2007 'Call for Accelerated Action' , which notes that progress on the issue has been\"grossly inadequate.\" It goes on to commit States parties to \"protectchildr en from the impact of armed conflic tand inc lude children in post- conflict reconstruction and rehabili- tationactivities.\" It also promises to imple ment the r ecomme ndat ions of the 10-year strategic review of the Machel study. 119 Other channels of political engagement Beyond the United Nations and regional organs, political and diplomatic engagement on children and armed conflict must include the full spectrum of channels, mechanisms and even direct bilateral action. Anumber of direct initiatives on the part of governments feature as highlights of progress since 1996. These include the efforts of Norway along with those of Austria, Ireland, Peru,NewZealand and the Holy See in achieving the recent Convention on Cluster Munitions. France played akeyrole in a chieving the 2007 Paris Commit ments t oprotect children from unlawful recruitment or use byarmed forces or armed groups, whichhavebeen endorsed by 66 governments. Likewise, Canada's leadership was invaluable in pushing through the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. Partnerships that developed since the Mine Ban Treaty have led to an especiallyinnovative mechanism to include non-state armed groups in its goals.Bysigning the Geneva 'Deed of Commitment' , non-state armedgroups commit to comply with thespirit and intentions of the Mine Ban Treaty and other international instru-ments. Indeed, the success of the achievements highlighted here is due to multifaceted collaboration among States, UN agencies and civil society. In view of the changing nature of armed conflict, such engagement with no n-stat earmedgroups is v ital in realizing the rights and protection ofchildren. While international humanitarian law establishes the foundat ionforholding no n-state armed groups accountable for protecting children, other tools and instruments, such as the Secretary- General's lists and action plans, areneeded to bring about tangible results. At the same time, it is vital to maintain the p olitical and diplo matic involvement that is necessary to Central African Republic \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-2444/Holtz54 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDsupport the United Nations and other agencies in engaging armedgroups directly. Forthe purpose of protecting children, it is critical that the United Nations has the option to engage in dialo gue w ith al lparties tothe conflict, whether they are States parties or non-state actors. Such engagement, particularly with non- States parties, should not prejudge the legal status of any party. Eventhough non-state actors are notsignatories to international legalstandards, it is necessary to developsystems that hold such actors accountab le.Inthe S ecurity Council's framework for engagement on Children and Armed Conflict, theemphasis has b een on fostering dialogue towards the preparation of concrete and time-bound actionplans - w ith all parties to conflict - to address the recruitment and use of children and to address all othergrave violations against children. This has been a collaborative process led by OSRSG-CAAC and UNICEF,toworkcloselywith the UN Country Task F orce for the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on grave child rights v iolat ions. Finally, in view of resounding calls for a focus on implementation,action at the national level is crucial.In this regard, parliamentarians areessential stakeholders and should beengaged more actively in promoting political a ctionfor children affected byarmed conflict. A useful resource is a handbook prepared by UNICEF and the I nter-Parliamentary Union on child protection, which highlights key actions for parliamentarians inadvocacy, legislation, policy develop- ment, monitoring and reporting, and allocation of resources topriorities for children. 120 All of these initiatives demonstrate the p owerofpolitical and diplomatic engagement and what can be achieved. They expand our vision of what ispossible in the next decade - if thepolitical will is there. RECOMMENDA TIONS Benchmarks for future action come from the commitments adopted by Member States over the past decade throughthe Ge neral Assembly, the Security Council, regional bodies and other mechanisms. In view of this sound body of guidance, the 10-yearstrategic review presented to theGeneral Assembly in October 2007 included a platform of recommenda- tions. It focused on achieving universal implementation of inter- national norms, ending impunity and integrating priorities for children in peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Key political and diplomatic actions needed to fulfil those recommendations and previouscommitments include the following: 1.Promote wider engagement on the iss ue o fchildren and armed conflict in regional bodies. In order to more specifically translate commitments and declarationsintoaction,regional bodies should: review previous commitments, including through peer review Iraq \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-2305/Kambermechanisms; include an agenda item dedicated to childrenaffected by armed conflict inannual summit meetings; seizeopportunities for action through,for example, regional follow-up to A World Fit for Children; andestab lish a hig h-level advocate and develop child-rights expertise in their peace and security structures. 2.Enc our agetime ly act ion on Security Council recommenda- tions.The Security Council Working G roup o nChildren and Armed Conflict, established pursuant to Security Council Resolution1612, should ensure timely follow-up to its conclusions and r ecommendations. 3. Ensure that children's concerns and child protection issues aresystematically incorporated intoevery peace process. This needs to take place at the earliest stages,regardless of the mediating parties, whether United Nations political departments, regional bodies or acount ry-led initiative. T o facilitate fulfilment of child protection obligations, the UN Secretariatshould a dopt a mechanism to ensure that peacemaking, peace- keeping and peacebuilding takeinto account the needs andproblems of children affected byarmed conflict. 4. Protect children from grave violat ions of their rights through provisions in peacenegotiations. Such provisions should also ensure accountabilityfor such violations, including through truth and reconciliation commissions and the establishment of institutional and legal reforms that protect children from exploitation and ensure their full and successful reintegration in post-conflict structures. 5. Seek mechanisms to impose sanctions when required. The Security Council should establish mechanisms enabling it to imposesanctions in all situations of concern on the children and armedconflict agenda. This includes exploring the possibility of estab- lishing a sanc tions committee for children and armed conflict. The Security Council should give equal p riority to all categories ofgrave violations and all relevant situations of concern. 6. Facilitate dialogue with non- stat eactors. The United Nations should, when possible, engage in dialogue and support the development of concrete and time-bound action plans with all parties to conflict to halt recruitment and use of children in violation of applicable inter- national law, and to address all other grave violations and abuses against children in close coopera-tionwith the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, with UNICEF and with the UN country task forces on monitoring and reporting. Continuous monitoring and verification of action plans should b eensured. /square6 KEY RESOURCES The following websites provide regular updates and links to information regarding advocacy and political action on children and armed conflict: Security Council Report, <www.securitycouncilreport.org>.

POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT 55Haiti \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0129/KamberUPHOLDING JUSTICE 658 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThe 1996 Machel study highlighted that w emust frame the protection of children in armed conflict by using the standar ds and no rms e mbodied in int ernational law, national legislation and local custom and practice. The2001 review went further, stating, \"International standards and their enforcement are the strongest defence against impunity for child rights violat ions in ar medconflic t.Y et they will only be effective if and when they are widely known, understood and implemented by everyone.\" In many ways, international attention on children in armed conflict, galvanized by Gra\u00e7a Machel's originalstudy,has b eenacatal ystin the fight toend impunit y. In fact, the first case of the newly established InternationalCriminal Court (in 2006) concerned the illegal recruitment and use ofchildren in hostilities, which constitutes a war crime. Adecade later, significant achievements have been made inimproving the legal protections provided to children and ending impunity for perpetrators. But it is obvious fromthe situation on the ground thatmuch remains to be done. PROGRESS TO DATE Building a global framework for justice Children benefit from a comprehensive framework of international law that protects their rights, including in times of war. Under the broad scope of international human rights, refugee lawand h umanitarian law in particular provide the basic international legalframework for protecting children caught in situations of armed conflict.121 The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides the most comprehensive code of rights as well as the highest standards of protection andassistanc especific to children of any international instrument. In addition to protections derived from this and othe rtreaties, gains are also being madein cust omaryinternational law, which is derived from common acceptance and consistent practice byStates with respect to the rule of law. Awide range of other inter- national instruments and guidelines haveemerged to complement, elaborate upon or operationalizeman yof these standards. Among themareinstruments providing special measures and protections for children interacting with justice systems, as described in the second half of this chapter, on ending impunity and securing justice. Inaddition to this international framework for protection, regional and national instruments are criticaltosecuring c hildren's rights and protection. Action at the national level is of the greatest importance in providing t imely and concrete meas ures to both prevent and respond to violations of children's rights. Advancing international human rights The Convention on the Rights of the Child. As noted above, the CRC, together with its Optional Protocol6.1 ADVANCING INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS AND NORMS Russian Federation \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0622/Pirozzi6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 59on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC), provides the most comprehensive legal foundationfor the protection of children's rights,including in situations of armed conflict. At the time of the 1996 Machelstudy,the CR Chad already beenratified by 179 States. T oday, allbut two countries are States parties to it. While particular provisions address ar medconflict specifically, the CRC provides protection to all children affected more generally by situations ofarmedconflict and displacement. 122For example, as statedin its non- discr iminat ion(article 2), the CRC applies to all children within the jurisdiction of States parties, not only to nationals. Moreover, the CRCdefines a 'child' as anyone under 18 years of age,123meaning that its provisions apply to adolescents aswell as younger children. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, established in 1991 tomonitor States' implementation of the CRC, has adopted various General Comments in recent yearsillustrating ho wdifferent provisions can be interpreted in relation to armed conflict. 124The Comments have highlighted, for example, thecritical role of education in peaceful conflic tresolution. They have noted that sp ecific att entionmust be paid to the relationship between HIV and the abuse suffered by children in thecontext of war. They have also drawnattention to the obligation of States to protect children from the dangers posed by small arms, light weapons and landmines both during war and its aftermath and to ensure the rightsof children with disabilities resultingfromarmed conflict. 125 Indeed, the Committee has repeatedly emphasized that \"the effects of armed conflict on children should b econsidered in the framework of all the articles of the Convention; that Stat es should take measures to ensure the realization of the rights of all children in their jurisdiction intimes of armed conflict; and that theprinciples of the Convention are notsubjecttoderogation in times of armed conflict.\" 126 The CRC also provides for measures to be taken by States partiesto assist child victims recovering from armed conflict. Article 39 broadly encourages the d evelopment of comprehensive programmes to alleviatemental distress, promote reintegration into society and the education system, and bolster thedelivery of basic resources. 127Its focus on the well-being, recovery andreintegration of children affected byarmedconflict applies to children involved in justice or reconciliation mechanisms, release and social rein- tegration programmes, and to refugee and int ernally displaced children. Legal and no rmative advances have been especially remarkable on the issue of the recruitment and use of children by armed forces or groups. A key provision in the CRC,article 38, maintains that Statesparties are required to respect and ensurerespect for rules of inter- national humanitarian law that apply to conflict situations and arerelevant to the child. The protection of children was strengthe nedeven more by OPAC, whichwas promoted by the 1996 Machel study and entered into force in February 2002. Among other things, it requires States parties to\"takeallfeasible measures\" to ensure that p ersons under the age of 18 are neithercompulsorily recruited into their armed forces (article 2) nor take adirect part in hostilities (article 1). Asof March 2008, OPAC had been ratified or acceded to by 119 States parties, the majority of which had made declarations indicating that 18 years or older should be the minim um ag efor voluntary recruitment. It is noteworthy that underOPAC, armed groups (as distinct from the armed forces ofaState) ar ethemselves directly prohibited from recruiting personsunder age 18 or using them inhostilities. States retain the obligationto take all feasible measures to prevent suchpractices by armed groups, including the use of legal means t oprohib it and cr iminaliz e these practices. States parties to OPAC are required to submit a report to the Committee on the Rights of the\"It is one thing making resolutions and another enforcing and monitoring their progress.\" -Young man, 24, Ghana60 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDChild w ithin two years and follow-up reports every five years thereafter. In October 2007, new reportingguidelines were adopted that aim tostrengthen its implementation (seebox above). As of 17 March 2008,the Committee had reviewed thereports of 34 countries (out of a total of 49 received) on their imple-mentation of OPAC. 129ILOConvention 182. Otherpositive developments since the Machel study include the elaboration of theInternational Labour OrganizationConvention 182 (1999). It obligesStates parties to take immediate andeffective measures to prohibit andeliminat ethe worst forms of child labour, including the forced or compulsory recruitment of children(under the age of 18) for use in armed conflict. African Charter on the Rights and Welfar eof the Child. Progress at the global level was brought one step further with the entry into force ofthe African Charter on the Rights andWelfare of the Child (1999). It is thefirst regional treaty establishing 18 as a minim um ag efor military recruitment and par ticipat ion in hostilities. Paris Commitments and Principles. Mindful o fthe need for more detailed operational guidance in addressing the unla wful recruitment and use of children in combat, UNICEF spearheaded a process that resulted in the 2007 'Paris Commitments' and 'Paris Principles' .130Although non- binding, these two documents lay out legal and operational principles as well as guidelines to protect children fromrecruitment and use in armed conflict. The documents include advice pertinent to specific groups of children, such as girls, refugees andthose int ernally displaced, and on issues related to prevention, familyreunification and reintegration. Ending impunity before the law. Critical d evelopments since 1996 in the fig ht to end impunity include a numb erofSecurity Council resolutions, which are binding, and formation of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The importance of the ICC cannot be overstated. The 1998 RomeSTRENGTHENING THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL THROUGH STRICTER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS The revised reporting guidelines recently issued for the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict are an important step in protecting children's rights. 128The guidelines, which describe in detail the information necessary to assess progress made by States parties, will enable the Committee on the Rights of the Child to provide approp-riate recommendations. For example, in order to ensure that recruitment is voluntary, the guidelines ask for information on incentives used by the national armedforces to encourage volunteers (such as financial incentives, scholarshipsand advertising). Countries are also asked to report on measures put inplace to prevent attacks on civilians and civilian 'objects', including placeswhere children are usually present, such as schools and hospitals. Otherrequirements include information on all criminal legislation in forcecovering relevant offences in the Optional Protocol and whether suchprovisions have been included in transitional justice measures, such as war crimes tribunals or truth commissions. Reflecting the changing nature of war fare, the guidelines also request a description of laws concerning the criminal liability of 'legal persons', suchas private military and security companies, and of legal provisions allowingextraterritorial jurisdiction over serious violations of international humani-tarian law .It is hoped that such detailed provisions will result in more comprehensive monitoring and will guide States par ties and civil society in instituting concrete measures they can take to protect children.6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 61Statute, out of which the ICC emerged, classified as war crimes the enlistmentor use of children under the age of15 to take an active part in hostilities. Otheracts cited as war crimes include deliberate attacks on hospitals and schools, along with rape and othergrave acts of sexual violence,including against children. 131 Security Council resolutions. Certain Security Council resolutions have highlighted specific areas of concern, such as underagerecruitment and the special vulnera- bilities o f girls. 132Theyalso mak e detailedrecommendations for action byall parties to armed conflicts. These include requests to States parties to submit concrete action plans and establish structures such as working groups and monitoring and reporting mechanisms to address specific aspects of the protection ofchildren in armed conflict. Cross-fertilization with other treaty bodies. The momentum generated by the M achel study over a decade ago, together with efforts by the Committeeon the Rights of the Child, has resultedin greater awareness and cross-fertil-ization with the work undertaken by othe rtreatybodies and me chanisms. For example, treaty bodies including the C ommitt eeonthe Eliminat ionof Discrimination against Women and the Committee against T orture haverepeatedly raised concerns related to children affected by armed conflict. 133Looking ahead, it is equally important to capitalize on the synergies between the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (esp ecially its monitoring role under OPAC) and other mechanisms,suchas the monitoring and reporting mechanism o nthe use o fchild soldiers established under Security Council R esolution 1612. Promoting international humanitarian law The Geneva Conventions. Inter- national humanitarian law, which isintended to regulate the means and methods for conducting military operations, has its primary basis in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and three Additional Protocols. 134 In 2006, the Geneva Conventions achieved universal acceptance whenallMember States of the United Nations had either ratified or acceded to them. The Fourth Geneva Convention, which addresses the protection of civilians in armed conflict, offers general protection to children as civilians. T ogether with Protocols I and II, added in 1977, it contains over 20 p rovisions sp ecifically focused on safeguar ding c hildr enaffected by armed conflict. While p rimar ilyconcerned with international ar med conflicts, the four Geneva Conventions contain a common article 3 that covers \"armed conflicts not of an international character.\" It obliges parties to theconflict to respect certain minimum humanitarian rules with regard topersons not (or no longer) taking anactive part in hostilities. Such persons, including c hildr en, are to be treated humanely and protected from \"violence to life and y,both Protocols stipulat ethat respect and additional protections should be accorded to children. This includes both protection against any form of indecent assaultand the o bligation to provide them with careand aid. Provisions in Protocol I includethe right to be kept separate from adults in situations of detention orinternment. Article 4 of Protocol II details aspects of the care and aid that children in armed conflict require, including receiving an education and family reunification services. Customary international law. Specific provisions applicable to childr en are also to be found in customary international humanitarianlaw.Astudy conducted by the Inter- national Committee of the Red Crosshas shown that such provisionsinclude the obligation to providespecial respect and protection to childr enaffected by armed conflict (Rule 135) and the prohibition against recruiting c hildr enintoarmed forces or armed groups and allowing them to take part in hostilities (Rules 136, 137). 135Such rules are applicable both in international and non-\"The UN should also take strict action against a battling nation which violates the rights of the children in a country it is attacking.

Protecting the rights ofrefugees and those internally displaced Armed conflicts typically result in mass p opulat ionmovements, forcing persons to become refugees in an asylum country or displacing them from their homes within their own country. In addition to the dangers they are fleeing, children who are either refugees or internally displacedare vulnerable to a host of other threats, including separation from family, trafficking, abduction by military groups, lack of food and basic services, and exploitation and abuse. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The legal framework providing protection to refugeesincludes the 1951 Convention Relating totheStatus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well as regional refugee instrume nts. 136ExecutiveCommittee Conclusions by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), along w ith v arious p olicies and guid elines, also p rovide important normative guidance. In particular, ExecutiveCommittee Conclusion No.105, onWomen and Girls at Risk (2006), and No. 107, on Children at Risk (2007), provide detailedguidance on issues and standardsrelating to children who are eitherrefugees or internally displaced. 137 The Conclusion on Children and Risk (2007) specifically identifieswider environmental and individual risks and r ecommends that measures be taken to address such factors as capacity building, access to resources,unaccompanied and separated children,and integration and resettlement.Special c onsiderations must be taken intoaccount in determining refugee status forchildren, as spelled out in a number of UNHCR policy documents and guidelines. 138 The C ommitt ee on the Rights of the Child. The C ommittee on the Rights of the Child has also referred to the situation of refugee children in various General Comments. For example, General Comment No. 6 (2005) stat es that determination of national refugee status must take into account gender-based violence and child-sp ecific forms of persecution, including persecution of kin, under- agerecruitment and trafficking. No matter what country refugee childr enare in, States parties are obliged to extend the full range ofrights inscribed in the CRC to them,including children who are unaccom-panied by parents or other caregivers. Provisions suchas article 2, on the principle of non-discrimination, and article 22, onthe r ights o f refugee and asylum-seeking children to protection and assistance, confirm that the r ights in the CRC apply to children even in States that have notratified the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Guiding Principles on Internal Displac ement and the h umanitarian reform process. Perhaps the most important development in this sector during the past 10 y earshas b een the emergence of new international standar ds and p ractice relating to internallydispla cedpersons. Both the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, issued in 1998,139and the humanitarian reform process, which has established an international response mechanism through the 'cluster' approach (described in chapter 7), have stepped in to fillimportant gaps for those displaced within the b orders of their own country. In addition to describing acomprehensive set of rights, the G uiding Principles emphasize the particular needs of internally displaced children and their rights tobasic se rvices, education and civil liberties. They also prohibit the recruitment or participation ofthese c hildr enin host ilities. Alleviating the threat from landmines, weapons and other instruments of war The 1996 Machel study exposed the lethal thr eat tochildr enposedby landmines and e xplosi veremnants of war and the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons. In addition to calling for assistance to children victimized by these weapons, it calledon States to mitigate the impact of armed conflict on children by adopting legislation to ban the development,production, use, trade, transfer andstockpiling o f anti-personnel mines. The Mine Ban Treaty. In 1996, Canada initiated the 'Ottawa process' , which culminated in the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. The Convention, which became known as the Mine Ban Treaty, came into force in 1999 and was a major step forward in reducing the thr eat o fanti-personnel landmines. In addition to the 156 States parties that ha veratified the Convention, 140 34 no n-state armed groups have also committed to uphold its objectives bysigning the Geneva 'Deed of Commitment' banning anti-personnel mines.141Many States that are not parties tothe t reaty abide by its provisions, undertaking mine clearance, stockpile destruction, mine-risk education and assistanc etovictims. As a result, activity related to the production and sale of anti-personnelmines, once a large component ofthe g lobal ar ms ind ustry, has almost ceased. 142Still, States that have not become parties to the Mine Ban Treaty continue to stockpile more than 160 millionanti-personnel mines, with the vast majority held by five States.143 In2005 and 2006, non-state armed groups use danti-personnel mines or similar improvised explosive devicesin at least 13 countries. 144Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War. The additional Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V tothe I nternational Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons) came int oforcein 2006, obliging the parties to a conflict to clear explosive remnants of war, share information and provide warnings to civilians andassistance to survivors of accidents. 145 Banning c luster munitions. Cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war continue to pose aserious threat to children in conflict and p ost-c onflic tzones. 146InMay 2008, a global initiative by 46 States, ledbyNorway, resulted in the adoption of an international treaty banning cluster munitions. The treaty is expected to be ratified and enter into force. Prohibiting trade in small arms and light weapons. In April 2008, the UN S ecretary-Ge neral's report onsmal larms and lig ht w eapons was presented to the Security Council. The report noted that \"small arms facilitate a vast spectrum of human rights violations, including killingand maiming, rape and other forms of sexual violence, enforced disap- pearance, torture, and forcedrecruitment or use of children by armed groups or armed forces. Morehuman r ights ab uses ar e committed with them than with any other weapon.\" During the past 10 years, the Committee on theRights of the Child has repeatedly expressed its concern over the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the proportion of childr enboth carrying them and who ha vebecome the ir victims. Most notably, it has recommended that States parties ensure that their domestic law and practice prohibit trade in small arms and light weapons tocountries where children take part in armed conflict. 147 REMAINING GAPS Translating international standards into national action Despit ethe b road and rapid acceptanceofinternational legal standar ds to protect children in armed conflict, a significant gapremains between these standards and 6.

The most important challengetoday is translating internationalstandards into action that can make atang ible diff erence on the ground. States generally incorporate or adopt international instruments intwo ways: either directly by virtue ofaprovision in the national constitu- tion,orbyincorporating the specific provisions of international treaties intonational legislation. However, adoption of relevant national legislation is not sufficient. T o give the legislation'teeth' requires administrative and othe rimple mentation mechanisms, suchas the lishment of relevant institutions or bodies with corre- sponding powers and training. While vitally important, these mechanisms require more resources than the simple adoption of legislative provisions. International cooperation and support are often critical to help count ries emerging from armed conflict meet their obligations. That said, the onus of responsi- bility remains clearly with the State.\"Governments have the most direct formal, legal and political responsibil-ity to ensure the protection of allchildren exposed to armed conflictwithin their countries,\" wrote the Special R epresentative of the Secretary- General for Children and Armed Conflic tin a 2005 r eport. \"Any actions by United Nations entities and international NGOs at thecountry level should always be designed to support and complementthe protection and rehabilitation roles of national authorities, never to supplant them.\" 148 Ensuring consistency between international standards andnational legislation and practice. An important first step is for countries to ensure that internationalhumanitarian law is reflected in relevant national legislation and practice.For instance, international humanitarian law obliges States parties totakelegislative measures to prohibit the use of the death sentence against anyone under the age of 18 at the time of the offence. Inaddition, they have an obligation toundertake activities at the national level to disseminate knowledge of and compliance with internationalhumanitar ian la w, 149including through training programmes. Ensuring that national implemen- tation is consistent with international standar ds and, more particularly, the Rome Stat ute,is also imp ortant in enabling national authorities to cooperate with the ICC. National provisions relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes should ensure that these crimes are punishable under national law and have the same scope as the definitions contained in the Statute. Many States are already taking steps in this direction.150In addition, criminal provisions relating to such areas as defence, statutes of limitationand rules of evidence should not create obstacles to the investigationand prosecution of internationalcrimes, including against children. 151 Promot ing imple mentation of national laws. The treaty-body monitoring process, especially that ofthe C ommitt ee on the Rights of the Child, is another important mechanism for bridging the gapbetween the standards States have accepted and their implementa- tion. 152States parties to the CRC commit to undertake \"all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in theConvention\" (article 4). States must report to the Committee on the Rights of Child on the measures they have adopted to this effect. National implementation can also b eencouraged by regional bodies and init iatives.For example, a key objective of the 2003 European Union Guidelines on Children in Armed Conflict is to \"influence third countries and non-state actors to implement international [andregional] human rights norms and standar ds and h umanitar ian la w.\" 153 One positive note in this regard is the progress made in securingcommitments from armed groups tocomply with international humani-tarian law. For example, a number ofarmedgroups have agreed to participate in action plans to cease the recruitment and use of children\"So many people break the Convention on the Rights of the Child and nothing happens.\" -Young woman, 18, Sri Lanka6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 65and ensure their reintegration, rather than face the possibility ofsanctions. In June 2007 in the Central African Republic, for example, theGovernment, the Assembly of the Unionof Democratic Forces rebel group and UNICEF signed an agreement for the release and reintegration of 400 children associated with armed groups. RECOMMENDA TIONS The 10-year strategic review of the Machel study presented to the UN General Assembly in 2007 made four principal recommendations that concern this chapter. The firstappears below and is followed by additional suggestions that seek to complement it. The remaining threerecommendations, along with key resources, appear on pages 78 and 79. GA RECOMMENDA TION 1 Achieving universal imple- mentation of internationalnorms and ending impunity. 1.Contribute to treaty reporting. Civil society actors, such as national human rights institu- tions and NGOs, should be encouraged to submitindependent reports on the implementation of treaties,including the CR Cand OPAC, to relevant treaty bodies. 2. Provide follow-up to the recom- mendations of treaty bodies.Civil society actors should be supported in providing sustained national follow-up (including monitoring) to the recommenda- tions of relevant treaty bodies,as benchmarks for measuring further implementation. 3. Promote and disseminate information on the rights of the child. States, UN agencies and civil society should facilitate strategic dissemination of information onthe rights of children in armedconflict and the corresponding obligations in international law to groups including children, the public, non-state armed actors and p rofessio nals w orking in relatedareas, such as members of the police, judiciary and military, as well as medical, immigrationand refugee authorities. The international community shouldsupport international cooperation and assistance programmes towards this end.BRINGING TANGIBLE GAINS TO WAR-AFFECTED CHILDREN: IMPLEMENTING THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL Arecent analysis by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) of 16 country reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Childidentified several areas in which national implementation of OPAC must be strengthened. 154Most countries, for instance, still lack an adequate legislative framework to protect children in armed conflict. Many lackprovisions in their penal code prohibiting child recruitment, and many lag in exercising their jurisdiction (including extraterritorial jurisdiction) over this crime. The absence of adequate birth registration systems is another obstacle to preventing recruitment of children under the age of 18. For example, in reports to the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, many countries have cited the lack of bir th registration as areason for the failure to prevent underage recruitment. 155 Asylum countries must also do more to assist the physical and psycho- logical recovery of victims in their territory ,especially refugee and asylum- seeking children who have fled conflict in their countries of origin. Also key is better dissemination of information on the provisions under OPAC,including to children, the public at large and professionals, such as membersof the judiciary, police, immigration authorities and the military. Statesparties also have an obligation to stop arms trade with countries that usechild soldiers and provide suppor tand assistance to other States in imple- menting the provisions under OPAC. In the case of state practices that allow voluntary recruitment of children, the Committee has consistentlyencouraged raising the age of recruitment to 18. 66 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThe past decade has seen major advances towards justice for children. This culminated in the first prosecu- tions of perpetrators of violations against children in special courts and the newly established International Criminal Court. However, as noted in the 2007 review of the Machel study presentedtothe Ge neral Assembly, \"much more remains to be done.\" The review goes on to say that \"greater will and commitment are needed to accelerate accountability and to operationalize legislation, policy and action at the national and field levels.\" Childr en,and disa dvantaged children in particular, face over- whelming obstacles in accessing justice. In time of war, these include fear of reprisal and inadequate protection. Children may also lack knowledgeof or trust in formal institutions or simply be unable to access them, especially if they are economically disadvantaged. Even iftheymanag eto do so, children often face justice systems that do not take them into account, in terms of either the law or legal processes, a situation that is tantamount to legal and insti- tutional discrimination. PROGRESS TO DA TE Coming to terms with past abuses: children and transitional justice The term 'transitional justice' refers to the \"full range of processes andmechanisms associated with a society'sattempts to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and achieve reconciliation. These ma yinclude both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, withdiffering levels of international involvement (or none at all) and individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-se eking, institutional reform, vetting and dismissals, ora combination thereof.\" 156 In implementing any of these mechanisms, the participation of children and adolescents must be a priority. Experience since the 1996 Machel study has confirmed that policies and practices supportingchildren's involvement in transitional justicemeasures help improve accountability for crimes against them. Such actions also contribute tothe development of child-friendly policies and procedures that protect children's rights. 157 This se ction highlights key developments and challenges for children in special tribunals, the ICCand nat ional c ourts and informal systems as part of transitional justice processes and mechanisms. The work of criminal tribunals \"People al loverthe w orld want toknowthat h umanit ycan st rike back - that wherever and whenever genocide, war crimes or other such violations are committed, there is a court before which the criminal canbe held to account; a court that puts an end to a global culture of impunity;acourt where 'acting under orders' is no defence; a court where all individuals in a g overnment hierarchy or military chain of command, without exception, from rulers toprivate soldiers, must answer for their actions.\" - Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking at the Rome Conference of Plenipotentiaries foran International Criminal Court, 17 June 1998. The d evelopment of special criminal t ribunals. During the past decade, one of the most noteworthy successes in achieving accountability has b een the establishment of a wide rangeof special criminal tribunals. Through these mechanisms the international community seeks to stop and prevent the recurrence of violations of human rights and humanitar ian la w, bring those responsible to justice and ensure a meas ureof justice and dignity for victims. Criminal tribunals can alsoplayan imp ortant role in helping societies transition from conflict. The institutional models that have emerged include ad hoc tribunals,such as the International Criminal Tribunals f orthe f ormer Yugoslavia (ICTY )and for Rwanda (ICTR); 158 mixedtribunals, suchas those for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and Sierra Leone;159the use of inter- national judges and prosecutors, such as in the courts of Kosovo; and panels\"[Resolutions and treaties] are pretty ineffective, as it seems they try to affect issues at the top of the tree. Children are at the bottom of the tree and seem to be forgotten.\" -Young man, 16, United Kingdom 6.2 ENDING IMPUNITY AND SECURING JUSTICE6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 67with exclusive jurisdiction over serious criminal offences, such as thoseestablished by the UN TransitionalAdministration in East Timor. 160 These sp ecial t ribunals have not only set new precedents in holding perpetrators accountable for graveviolations of child rights. They havealso contributed to the developmentofan imp ortant body of jurispru- dence that can strengthen and informfuture practice. Thanks to the deliberations of tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, forexample, there is now greater clarity onquestions of rape as a war crime and cr ime ag ainst h umanity, the elements of genocide, the definition of torture, the nature of individual criminal r esponsibility and the doctrine of command responsibility. 161 The Special Court in Sierra Leone is considered the first war crimes tribunal to explicitly expose and a dminist erjustice for abuses perpetrated on or by children.162 Asof June 2007, the Special Court had convicted and sentenced threeformer leaders of Sierra Leone's Armed Forces Revolutionary Council - and three months later, a member of the Civil Defence Forces militia -for the recruitment and use of childr en. 163Previousl y,the same court indicted the former president ofLiberia,Charles Ghankay Taylor, for war crimes and crimes against humanity.164The prosecution of sexual violence and rape as war crimes and an instrument of genocide by the tribunals in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda set equally importantprecedents that recognized the gravity ofsexual v iolence and the imperative of combating impunity. 166The establishment of the International Criminal Court. The adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998, and the subsequent establish- ment of the ICC, represents one JUSTICE FOR CHILDREN: WHAT IT WILL TAKE Achieving justice for children requires a continuum of standards at the international, national and local levels and the implementation of thesestandards by respective duty bearers. Ensuring that national systemsconform with international standards for the protection and rights ofchildren, and that the necessary institutions are established to implementthem, is a vital first step. Respect for the rule of law, including in conflict and post-conflict situations, is essential to lasting peace and security. This point wasrecognized by Member States at the 2005 World Summit. A functioningjustice system - which includes legal, judicial and law-enforcement institutions, and non-formal mechanisms - is central to the rule of law.Furthermore, this system must seek to fulfil the rights of children at everystage of the legal process. This view was recently endorsed in the 'UNApproach on Justice for Children', 165adopted in September 2008, which aims to ensure that all UN entities reflect child rights, as elaborated in inter-national norms and standards, in their rule-of-law activities. The approachemphasizes that child justice must be addressed in national planningprocesses; legal, institutional and policy reform efforts; and capacity building,training and accountability programmes. In addition, collaboration should besought with other sectors, particularly social protection, which has a crucialrole to play in prevention of child rights violations and social reintegration. In the context of armed conflict, strategic inter ventions to protect children's rights must be undertaken at the earliest possible opportunity. Among the actions recommended in the UN Approach is strengthening systems of justice and social services. This includes measures to buildknowledge on the specific rights of par ticular groups of children (such as girls and indigenous children) and to recognize the different impact the justice system may have on them. Another area of concern is promoting restorative justice, and diversion and alternatives to deprivation of liberty, so that a child's reintegration into society can be achieved as quickly as possible. 68 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDof the single most significant devel- opments in ending impunity for perpetrators of crimes against childr en.This a ccomplishment is all the more impressive considering that the United Nations recognizedthe ne ed for such a court as early as 1948. 168Althoug hthe Rome Statute only entered into force in 2002,169 it is alr eadyhaving an impa ct: It has established a vital channel to addressimpunity by codifying grave violations of international law, including against children. It has put would-be violators on notice. And it has served as a catalyst for the adoption of nationallaws against the most heinous ofinternational crimes. 170 The ICC has jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.The definition of these crimes includesvarious references to children. For example, the definition of 'enslavement'as a crime against humanity makesparticular mention of children. One ofthe v iolat ions cited as a war crime is conscripting or enlisting children under age 15 or using them toparticipate actively in hostilities(article 8). The Rome Statute was also the fir st legal inst rument to codify sexual violence as both a crime against h umanit yand a war crime. In order to facilitate and regulate the involvement of children in theproceedings of the ICC, both child- friendly and protective measures havebeen put in place to ensure the safeinvolvement of child witnesses in court proceedings. These include, for example, adoption of closed sessions and establishment of a victim and witness protection unit that takes into account the special needs of children, including those who have experienced trauma o rsexual violence. In the past couple of years the ICC has also b roken new ground in prosecuting crimes against childrenbycharg ing and indicting warlords from the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Uganda with recruitingand using children in hostilities. 171 The ICC is seeking arrest warrants for Ali Kusha yband Ahma dMohammed Harun for their role in facilitating the J anjaweed'sattacks on Darfur's civilian population. And in May 2007, the Court announced the opening of an in vestigation in the Central African Republic on allegations of rape IMPROVING CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO JUSTICE Avariety of interventions can improve children's access to justice, both insituations of armed conflict and in the transition process that often follows. They include promotion of child rights and legal awareness amongchildren, their families and communities; support for community-based legal and paralegal services for children; and encouraging children's partici- pation, such as through projects that ensure children's involvement from the outset of transitional justice mechanisms and in restitution/reparationprogrammes. This participation in turn requires interventions that promote child-sensitive procedures in judicial, administrative or community-basedprocesses, including non-state justice mechanisms. Other interventions that can improve children's access to justice include reforms of the judicial and security sectors. Measures may also be required to deal with the proliferation of small arms in wartime. Training and legislative reforms are also usually needed to address discriminatory attitudes in relation to juvenile justice and gender issues and to curbabusive practices. In addition to ensuring that children' sconcerns and interests are included in transitional justice mechanisms, it is vital to engage in inter - ventions that prevent infractions of justice in the first place. These include: developing the capacity of civil society to design and run programmes that seek to provide justice for children in emergencies; suppor ting the capacity of non-state justice mechanisms, 167which often play a crucial role in periods of crisis; and ensuring that children' sconcerns are included from the start in peace agreements or joint UN assessments and planning missions. Such inter ventions can be instrumental in mitigating further harm to children in conflict situations. and other acts of sexual violence perpetrated against hundreds of reported victims.172 The role of national courts and informal administration of justicesystems. Although international criminal tribunals represent progress in ending impunity and restoring ameasure of justice and rule of law,\"no ad hoc, temporary or externalmeasures can ever replace a functioningnational justice system,\" according toa2004 report of the UN Secretary- General. 173At its core, the rule of law is based on a strong judiciary that is independent; properly financed, equipped and trained; and empowered to uphold human rights, even under difficult circumstances. National legal mechanisms must also b eable to address civil claims and disputes, such as property disputes, citizenship/nationality questions and other legal issues that arise in post- conflict situations. Regarding children, it is not e noug hfornational legal systems to be aware of violations and legal issues particularly affecting children in the context of armed conflicts. They must also have juvenile justicesystems in place that can treat children involved in criminal or civil procedures in accordance with recognized international standards. Interms of criminal prosecutions related to children in situations of armed conflict, several concerns havecome to light. One, in many instanceschildren have not received compensa-tion or redress for the suffering they have experienced, and two, States have not prosecuted those alleged to have violated children's rights. Three, there is concern that despite provisions in the CRC and UN guidelines on juvenile justice, some States have detained children foralleged war crimes. And they have done so in a manner that is not sufficiently distinguished from the adult justice system, does not focus onchildren's reintegration and has involved long pretrial detention inverypoor conditions. 174 Furthermore, in many countries, largesections of the population havelittle knowledge about or contact with formal justice systems. They have long used less formal conflict- resolution and justice mechanisms. Ignoring these local traditions will exclude large sectors of society from accessing any form of justice, especially in post-conflict situationswhere formal legal institutions may be weak and seriously under-resourced. Supporting these informal mechanisms to better meet international standards, ensure special protections for children and take account of gender sensitivitiescan the refore be a key element in acomprehensive national justice strategy. In some cases, independent \"In Somalia, we now have 'seafarers' who offer us the false promise of a better life, when we pay them to take us across to Yemen.

UPHOLDING JUSTICE 69Chad \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0246/Pirozzi70 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDnational human rights commissions can also complement national courts during t ransit ional periods and play acritical function by providing accountability, dispute resolution, redress and protection.175 The national courts of countries not in volved in armed conflicts are also playing an increasingly prominent role.176Through adoption of extra- territorial provisions, for example, they may be able to prosecute those accused of crimes against children committed in another country. They may also take legal actionagainst companies involved in illegaltrade. Asylum cases involving the careand p rotectionof children have been brought before national and administrative courts. In recent years,an unprecedented number of caseshave also been brought to the national courts of third-party States under the universality principle. 177 Other transitional justice mechanisms Despite the successes and benefits of international criminal courts, andthe growing capacity of nationalcourts, it is also true that most crimes committ ed in conflict situations go unpunishe d.Asreported by the Secretary-General in a 2004 report: \"In the end, in post-conflict countries, the vast majority of perpetrators... will never be tried, whether interna- tionally or domestically.\" 178For this reason, the report goes on to say, prosecutorial policy must be strategic, public expectations must be based on sound information, programmes must be in place to protect and supportvictims and witnesses, and futureinternational or hybrid tribunals must giveconsideration to an ultimate exit strategy. 179\"Moreover,\" the report continues, \"other transitional justicemechanisms ... may need to be putin place in order to overcome theinhe rent limitat ions of criminal justice processes - to do things that courts donot do or do not do well.\" 180 Other transitional justice mechanisms are also necessary topromote national reconciliation, encourage moderate forces and ensure that those r esponsible for human rights violations or for aiding in repression are removed from jobs in the j ustice and security sectors. 181 Aholistic transitional justice strategy must ensure that child rights and concerns are adequately addressed from the outset. This must include due regard for relevant international standards and guidelines, such as the UN G uidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and WitnessesofCrime. At the same time, such a strategy must take into account gendersensitivities and the best interests ofthe child, while embracing theprinciples of participation, non- discr iminat ion,empowerment and a ccountability. Truth and reconciliation mechanisms. It is now widely recognized that truth commissions, which are often undertaken together Afghanistan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ1996-0199/Hartleywith reconciliation processes, can be apositive complement to criminal prosecutions.182Truth and reconci- liation commissions are temporary, non-judicial me chanisms mandated to investigate and document human rights abuses and to produce a reporton violations. In addition to promotingnational reconciliation, they canrecomme nd institutional reform and r eparations for victims and help re-estab lish c onfidence in the rule of law. 183 Reconciliation processes and truth commissions can be forums in w hichchildren and adolescents184 can e xpress themselves, relate their experiences and contribute as citizens tocommunity efforts towards accountability, reconciliation and reintegration. The past decade has brought greater understanding of how children are affected as victims and witnesses of systematic human rights ab uses, and with it, greater focus by truth commissions.185 Forinstance, reporting on specific violations committed against childrenhas d emonstrated that children are not only indirect victims of theconflict but also direct targets ofcruel violence. 186 Tradit ional appr oaches to justice and r econciliation. Alongside these formal r econciliat ion processes, local approaches to justice and reconciliation are playing a larger role in transitionaljustice strategies. These are important because they are products of localCHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION IN TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSIONS The lessons drawn from the involvement of children in truth and reconcilia- tion commissions in Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste have provided insight into the opportunities of child-friendly procedures - and the challenges thatremain. For example, it is clear that special measures are necessary toensure proper protection and support for children and adolescents whoparticipate in such commissions. And training is needed to ensurespecialized staff can address the specific needs and capacities of children.Child protection agencies in particular can play a positive mediating role by assisting such commissions in developing child-friendly measures,facilitating children' sinvolvement and ensuring follow-up. While children can be key contributors in justice and reconciliation efforts, their right toparticipation and their right to protection must be mutually supportive. 187 The Sierra Leone T ruth and Reconciliation Commission, in par ticular , offers a comprehensive model of child and adolescent par ticipation.188 Children gave confidential statements, participated in thematic hearings, prepared an official submission to the Commission and contributed to the preparation of a child-friendly version of the Commission' srepor t. The creative strategies developed to encourage children's involvement throughout that process are now part of a legacy that continues to enrichinternational practice. The involvement of children is also being encouraged in Liberia' s reconciliation process. For example, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act specifies children's participation and protection; children'sawareness workshops have been held and found successful as an outreachstrategy; statements are being obtained from children by officials trained inchild rights and child-friendly procedures; and children's hearings are beingplanned. Efforts are also under way to link the Commission with educationthrough a curriculum component. These encouraging steps have beenfacilitated through close collaboration between the Truth and ReconciliationCommission and the Liberian Child Protection Network. Meanwhile, important research initiatives are under way to promote further involvement of children in transitional justice mechanisms, especially truth and reconciliation commissions. 189 6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 71culture and because state and inter- national responses to massive human rights violations have built-in limitations. Local approaches havebeenimplemented in a number of countries, including Angola, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,Timor-Leste and Uganda. They havetaken a variety of forms, includinginformal courts and traditionalceremonies. Because they focus ontransformation rather than punishment, they are considered particularlysuited for children. Reconciliation ceremonies in northern Uganda, forinstance, were a strategic culturalmechanism for dealing with abducted childr enwho were both victims and perpetrators of violence. 190 In research conducted in Sierra Leone by the Women's Commissionfor Refugee Women and Children forthis pub lication, 191local a ctors cited the most p ositive reconciliation experiences as those that included traditional approaches. Children compelled to commit atrocitiesduring the c onflict reported that theyhadgained acceptance in their communities through traditional healing me chanisms. Although it is important to ensure that such tradi- tional ceremonies conform to inter- national standards, this experience shows that they complement and extend the reach of formal mechanisms at the community level. Reparations to children. The question of reparations for harm suffered by victims as a result ofarmedconflict is a central issue for transitional justice, applying to bothjudicial and non-judicial mechanisms.Atrust fund has been established at the International Criminal Court for victims and the ir families; it willgive priority to the most vulnerable, including c hildr en. 192 Y et comprehensive guidelines have been missing for implementing large-scale reparation programmes, and the interests and participation ofchildren in particular have long been neglected. In December 2005 theUnited Nations General Assemblyadopted the Basic Principles and Guidelines o nthe Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International HumanRights Law and Serious Violations ofInternational Humanitarian Law, alsoknownas the Van B oven/Bassiouni Principles. 193Thoug hnon-binding, these p rinciples no wprovide a com- prehensive guide to standards and principles related to the right toremedy and reparation. Reparations can take many forms and a ddress v arious post-conflict challenges, such as the loss of property and land by refugees and displa ced persons. They can be individual or collective (or both) and e xercised legally through a lawsuit or as a result of political and diplomatic pressure. However, reparations can also include non- monetary elements, such as the restitution of a victims' liberty and other legal rights, reintegrationprogrammes, physical or psycho- logical assistance, the adoption ofpreventive measures and otherguarantees of non-repetition, as well as symbolic acts such as com- memorativeceremonies and official apologies. Under the Van Boven/ Bassiouni P rinciples, the Stat e responsible for the violations continues to be the primary source of reparations, but persons (corporate or individual) can also be held responsible. 194\"The Truth and Reconciliation Commission helped a great deal. People have had the opportunity to apologize for crimes committed and have received forgiveness, and this has been one good step towards keeping the peace.\" - Young people, 15-19, sex not specified, Sierra Leone 72 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDLebanon \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1061/BrooksUSING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE APPROACHES TO RECONCILIATION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE Aprocess of reconciliation is often necessary before children formerly associated with armed forces and groups are welcomed back into their communities. Such processes can be important in restoring a child's sense of well-beingand even ensuring their protection. Yet little attention is often paid to reconciliation and social justice issues inprogrammes for children's reintegration into society following a conflict. Acommunity-based reintegration programme in Sierra Leone focused on these two themes when attempting to elicit cooperation between formerly recruited children and village members - who both feared and mistrusted eachother. The programme began by facilitating dialogues in which local people described their suffering during the war.In doing so, they developed empathy towards each other and began to create the psychological space needed toallow them to work together. Further dialogues were subsequently undertaken on the subject of children's needs and community projects that could best address them. If the group decided, for instance, that education and the construction of a school were priorities, joint teams of those who had and had not been recruited worked togetheron construction, while earning an income. This process of developing empathy, planning collectively and working together on a project that contributed to their livelihoods succeeded in reducing tensions, altering preconceptions and building social cohesion. Formerlyrecruited youth reported that the programme helped them improve their relations with the community, whichappeased their fears and reduced their stigma - two major sources of psychosocial distress. The experience demonstrates the value of a reintegration approach that includes community reconciliation and provides childrenwith psychosocial support. In the Nor thern Province of Sierra Leone, tradition calls for those who have harmed a community to make some form of restitution - in other words, if reconciliation is to last, social justice must be achieved. One method of doingso, identified during dialogues on traditional healing, was considered especially valuable by one community: Uponreturning to his village, a boy tells his family what happened to him during the war .The parents then go to the village chief and ask him to speak to the boy .If the chief agrees, the boy lies face down on the floor and, while holding the chief' sankles, tells him his story .If the chief believes him and thinks he should be allowed to return, he may give the boy a task that is helpful to the community. He also assigns him to a mentor. Acceptance by the parents is the first step in this community reintegration process. In his interaction with the chief, the boy's posture of submission symbolizes his break with his military past and his recognition of local authority. Through community service, the boy seeks to repair the wrongs he has done to the village (the greater the wrongdoing, the greater the ser vice required). This allows villagers an oppor tunity to view the boy in a new light. The mentor is also there to guide the boy in re-establishing social relations and readjusting to civilian life. Anumber of insights can be drawn from these two examples. First, reintegration is not simply an individual proces s or one of reuniting children with their families and communities. It is an inherently communal process of creating socialacceptance and building reconciliation through social justice. Communities themselves have to make the transformationtowards peace. Thus it is vital that national reconciliation processes be backed by local reconciliation processes.Second, reintegration often requires social justice, which is based on traditional practices. Finally ,such experiences show that community reconciliation work is an important aspect of assistance to formerly recruited children. 6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 73Source: Drawn from notes provided to the Machel review by the Christian Children's Fund on two of its projects in Sierra Leone, February 2008.Predictably, however, many challenges remain. Who among thevictims should be compensated?What types of harm should be considered and how much compen- sation should be awarded? How can diff erent types of harm be quant ifiedand compared? How can acommunity provide compensation tochildr en who have taken part in hostilities,and p erhaps been forced to commit crimes against their own communities, without triggering asense o finjustice on the part of their victims? For example, survivors ofsexual and gender-based violence inarmed conflicts, including children,have long been neglected in reparations programmes.In 2007, the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concernas to whether the budgets for nationalreparation programmes were adequate. It recommended that States parties allocate appropriate resources towardscomprehensive reparations measures, ensuring that they take gender into perspective. 195 While the in volvement and consideration of children in reparations programmes continue to pose difficult challenges,196there is also g rowing realization that children are entitled to reparations in theirown right. Children, therefore,must be involved from the outset in id entifying the issues at stake, and the ir representation must beensured in restitution processes. Moreover, it has become apparentthat no single form of reparation can provide entire satisfaction to victims, especially children. A timely and sensitive combination of reparation measures will generally be required asacomplement to other transitional justice mechanisms, such as criminalprosecutions and truth commissions. 197 According to a 2004 report of the Secretary-General: \"States have the obligation to act not only against perpetrators, but also on behalf ofvictims - including through the provision of reparations. Programmes toprovide reparations to victims for harmsuffered can be effective and expeditious complements to the contributions of tribunals and truth commissions by providing concrete remedies, promoting reconciliation and restoring victims' confidence in the State.\" 198 Institutional and security sector reforms. Post-c onflict situations are not only characterized by a lack ofcapa citytodeliver basic services; the police, the judiciary and other keyinstitutions may themselves be a sourceof public insecurity, mistrust and pastviolations of human rights. Profound reforms ar eoften required, including avetting process that screens out individuals asso ciatedwith past ab uses. However, a vetting process is only one element of wider justice and se curity reforms. Such reforms also represent a critical opportunity\"[Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration] is good, but they train us and send us to work in communities that do not trust us. The people give us no jobs,sosome of us sell our tools to live. They should address trust in communities.\" - Young man, 19, Liberia 74 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDDemocratic Republic of the Congo \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-0431/LeMoyne6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 75to highlight child rights and the responsibility of state institutions, including the security and law enforcement sectors, as duty bearers in child p rotection. Special protections for children involved in justice mechanisms In addition to advances in prosecution, progress has also been made in the treatment of children in justice processes. A key principle in international law is that children involved in judicial proceedings,including transitional justice mechanisms, require special measures that protect their rights and take into account their vulnerability and best interests. This applies whether they have been perpetrators, victims or witnesses. The sp ecial protections afforded child victims and witnesses are spelled out in the 2005 UN Guidelines onJustice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime. These guidelines, based on rights outline din the CR Cand othe rinter- national inst ruments, reiterate such principles as respect for the child's dignity;the b est int erests of the child; and the c hild' sright tobeheard, express his or her own views and contributetodecisions affecting his orherlife. 199Achild-fr iendlyversion of the UN guidelines has also beenprepared in all UN languages to help children understand and accesstheir rights.Special protection provisions forchild v ictims and w itnesses can include hearings on camera, pre- recorded testimonies, the use of pseudonyms to protect the child'sidentity, videoconferencing andgender-sensitive approaches.International courts and tribunals have witnessed considerable progress in this area. As described above, boththe Special Court for Sierra Leoneand the ICC ha veadopted protective measures and child-friendly procedures to facilitate participation by child victims and w itnesses. Important protections also exist for children who must undergo criminal proceedings. Article 40 ofthe CR C, in particular, details minimum legal guarantees for these children and requires States to set a minimum age of criminal responsi- bility, provide alternative measures besides judicial p roceeding sor institutional care, and promote theestab lishment of a distinct system of juvenile j usticeaimed at reintegrating children into a society in which they can pla yaconstructive role. This provision should be read togetherwith articles 37 and 39 of the CRC.Article 37 bars certain punishments 200 and p rovides that any restriction of liberty must be as a last resort and for the shortest possible time. Article39 relates to the child's physical and psychological recovery and reintegration. Significant strides have been made in developing implementation guid elines f orthe administration of juvenile justice, especially through arange of related UN rules and guidelines. 201The Committee on the Rights o f the Child has repeatedly advocated for the establishment of juvenile justice systems in conformity with these international standards and guidelines. It has also provided detailedcomme nts e xpressing concern that country practices are Haiti \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-1912/LeMoyne76 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDnot in line with international standards.202Most recently, in Comment No. 10 of 2007, itarticulated the leading principles (articles 2, 3, 6 and 12) and core elements for a comprehensive policyon juvenile justice. Children as perpetrators Acontentious question in recent years concerns accountability for crimes allegedly committed by children during armed conflict. A newstandar disemerging based on the practice of the ad hoc tribunals in the f ormerYugoslavia and Rwanda, the policy of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Rome Statute forthe ICC. It specifies that childrenunder age 18 should not be held criminally responsible in interna- tional tribunals or courts for grave violations of international humani- tarian la w.203The Sp ecial Court for Sierra Leone, established in 2002, included provisions to prosecute persons 15 years or older, but theprosecutor elected not to prosecutechildr enbelow18.He stated that he preferred to \"prosecute the people who forced thousands of children to commit unspeakable crimes.\" 204The Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court does not allow for prosecution of persons below the age of 18 for war crimes, crimes againsthumanity or genocide. 205 This emerging standard has recently been supported in the ParisPrinciples. The Principles maintain that children accused of crimes under international law allegedlycommitted while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily asvictims of offences against interna-tional law, not only as perpetrators. They must be treated in accordance with international juvenile justice standar ds and no rms and w ithin a framework of restorative justice and social reintegration. Counterterrorism measures Agrowing p roblem related to children in justice processes concerns counterterrorism policies, especially detention practices. While interna- \"When I saw the people responsible for organizing the killings of many people and destroying their homes... I was happy, because they were now in a tight place. I felt it was an opportunity to represent the voiceless, and my story told their story.\" - Former child soldier and witness to the Special Court of Sierra Leone, testifying through a video link in Freetown, June 2007 6. UPHOLDING JUSTICE 77tional law requires the treatment of children to focus on reintegration,the counterterrorism measures being increasingly applied and the practice of national courts have sometimes resulted in prolonged detention of children and otherviolations of international juvenilejustice standards. Forexample, in April 2003, US authorities revealed that children as young as 13 w ere among the foreign nationals being held at Guantanamo Bay. One widely publicized caseinvolves a boy who was arrested in Afghanistan in 2002 for crimes he allegedly committed when he was 15 years old. He was subsequently transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where he has been held for over five years as of February 2008. 206 Children are held in \"administrative detention\" in Aghanistan, Iraq and Israel. In Nepal, children were detaine dunder the T errorist and Disruptive Activities Ordinance, whichhas no set minimum age and grants security forces wide powers toarrest and detain any person suspected of being associated witharmed groups, including children. 207 Countless other examples from around the world are regularly reported. International law requires States to provide children with special safeguar ds and car eincluding le gal protections appropriate to their age. These obligations cannot besuperseded by security measures. As the Committee on the Rights ofthe Child has recently cautioned, measures to prevent and combat terrorism should not result in retroactive or unintended punishme nt forchildr en. 208 REMAINING GAPS Significant p rogress has been made in developing a g lobal no rmative framework to protect children's rights in conflict situations. But a troubling dichotomy remains between the advances in norms at the interna- tional le veland the p revalence of serious violations of children's rights on the ground. Reports are rampant of children's recruitment and use in conflic tand othe rgrave child rightsviolations, including killing, maiming, abduction and sexual violence. Even in cases where countries haveratified or acceded to interna- tional treaties, the enactment of national legislation is lagging, and the absence of will or capacity to implement standards leaves innumerable violations against children unpunished.Inmany cases, national legislation is und ermine dbypractical and operational challenges. Formal justice systems in p ost-conflict countries are often dysfunctional or plagued by a lack of resources; sometimes they are virtually non-existent. Acomprehensive approach to transitional justice that adopts a Uganda \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-1153/LeMoynevariety of complementary mechanisms is needed to meet the different needs of society, communities and individual victims. While important efforts have been made towards facilitating the participation of children in these mechanisms, challenges remain, such as the involvement of girls - especially survivors of sexual violence. Manyyearsafter war has ended, children will continue to search forhealing and a ccountab ility,material reparations and emotional support, truth and r econciliat ion.Itis incumb ent upon citizens everywhereto 'build back better' and to integrate children's concerns into broaderefforts to re-establish the rule of law - now recognized as a principalkeystone in promoting security and lasting peace. RECOMMENDATIONS The review of the Machel study presented to the General Assembly in 2007 ma defour p rincipal r ecom- mendations that concern this chapter. The first appears on page 65; the other three are outlined below,along w ith additional complementary recomme ndat ions.GA RECOMMENDATION 2 End impunity for violations against children. 1. Adopt specific measures to end impunity. States not involved in conflict should also adopt specific measures that end impunity for violations against children in armed conflict. Such measures may include adopting extraterritorial provisions forrelevant crimes; ensuring that national provisions comply with the r ules and p rovisions of the ICC; applying the uni versalityprinciple where relevant; ensuring that domest ic legislation criminalizes arms t radetocount ries with a record of illegally recruiting and using c hild soldiers; and adopting provisions that address money laundering and permit freezing the assets of persons or legal entitiesaccused of serious violationsagainst children in armed conflict. GA RECOMMENDATION 3 Prioritize children's security. 2.Reduce arms proliferation. States should review their domestic legislation and practice in order to abolish arms trade to countries wherechildr entakepartin armed conflict, including trade in small arms and light weapons. Violations ofarms embargoes should be criminaliz edand p rosecuted. States should imple ment existing legal inst rume nts that a ddress landmines and explosive remnants 78 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD\"Orphans and street children join militias at clan checkpoints to rape, loot and kill people.

In addition, Member States should include in their national reportsunder the UN Programme of Action informationonmeasures taken or neededtoprotect children from the sc ourg eofsmal larms. GA RECOMMENDATION Promote justice for children. 3.Ens urecoordination and sustaine defforts to move from crisis to long-term development. The international community and UN ag encies in particular should ensure coordination amongthemselves as well as with other actors (such as donors, NGOs, national governments) in working to(re)estab lish as quickly as possible the rule of law and a justice system that includes a distinctsystemfor juvenile justice. The latter should be consistent with int ernational standards and supported by institutional links with the so cial se ctor/child protectionsystems. Efforts by different actors at different stages ofthe p rocess - from crisis to early recovery to development - should be sustained and shouldbuild on one another. 4. Apply an integrated approach to justice for children. The policies and programmes of UN agenciesshould be in line with the UN Common Approach on Justice for Children. Both States and UN agencies should aim to integratechildr en'sconcerns in legislative, judicial and se curitysector reforms, including those of lawenforcement institutions, such as the police. 5. Support the participation of children in justice processes. States and the international community should support the par ticipat ionofchildren in transitional justice processes by drawing on established principles,such as the best interests of thechild, and good practices identified to date with regard to child protection measures and child- friendly procedures. They shouldalso p rovideadequate resources to support transitional justice processes and related programmes forchildren and children's inclusionin reparations programmes. 6. Improve children's access to justice. The UN and NGOs should support community-based legal and paralegal services for children, families and c ommunities alo ng with p rogrammes that establish diversion, alternatives to justiceand r estorative justice. /square6 KEY RESOURCES International Committee of the Red Cross, Customary International Humanitarian Law , edited by J.-M.

UPHOLDING JUSTICE 79Iraq \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2003-0178/LeMoyneSYSTEMS OF RESPONSE782 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDEVOLUTION OF EFFOR TS TO STRENGTHEN CHILD PROTECTION Almost every action taken on behalf of children affected by armed conflictis rootedin a system - the combination ofinternational treaties, national policies and programmes, funding strategies, and monitoring and evaluation structures that underpinofficial r esponse t oviolat ions of the rights of these children. This chapter addresses developments andchallenges from the perspective of these systems. Their componentssupport every sector or issue in caring f or and protecting conflict- affectedchildren. (The more specific sectors and issues are discussed in chapter 8.) Despite the continuing challenges in protecting and caringfor children affected by armedconflict, the global system of responsehas e volved significantly since the 1996 Gra\u00e7a Machel study. This system is built on a foundation of standards and norms.The Convention on the Rights of theChild and its optional protocols covering armed conflict and sexual exploitation; the Geneva Conventions, which limit the barbarity of war;and the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court -all of these, along with the many others mentioned in chapter 5,codify the r ights o f children and their need for special protection in situations ofarmed conflict. 'A World Fit for Children' , the final document adopted at the 2002UN General Assembly Special Session on Children, includes in its Plan of Action a key goal on children affected by armed conflict. 209It states that governments will \"protect children against the impact of armed conflict and e nsure compliance with interna- tional humanitarian law and human rights law.\"210The document goes on tooutline 13 a ctions that can be takentoachieve this goal. Further key elements of the United Nations' efforts to protect children fromarmedconflict are the landmark SecurityCouncil Resolutions 1539 (2004) and 1612 (2005). These haveledtothe d evelopment of a system- wideMonitoring and Reporting Mechanism o nthe six grave violations against children in armed conflict(discusse dlater in this chapter). UN efforts have also resulted in a working group, comprised of all members of the Security Council, that regularly assesses progress by parties to conflicts in developing action plans to release children associated with armed forces and groups. This working group is also mandat ed to suggest further action should sufficient progress not be made. This mechanism and otherefforts by partners have improvedcoordination, data collection and monitoring. In turn, these advances have led to more focused responses and p revention strategies. ROLES AND PARTNERSHIPS The impact of armed conflict on children, the 1996 Machel study stressed, \"must be everyone's concernand is everyone's responsibility.\" Built on the foundation of norms, standards and goals are the operational and programmatic guidelines, policies and procedures steering the specialized organizat ions and technical groups that work on behalf of childrenaffectedby armed conflict. The system benefits from the diverse natureofthe e ntities involved - from Member States of the United Nations to community groups, includingnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), traditional structures,women's organizations, youth groupsand religious leaders. They are all essential in a chain that extends from the Security Council to the most isolat edvillage. The mandates and partnerships are complementary, and they include children themselves, as discusse dearlier in this publication. This chapter highlights key develop- ments in this system of response. Key drivers in the UN system The roles of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (OSRSG-CAAC) and UNICEF, as well as other UN agencies, are widely acknowledged as funda- mental t othe U nitedNations' global work on children and armed conflict. The key agencies are described below. Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and ArmedConflict. This o ffice, established by the General Assembly, is one of the key results of the 1996\"The impact of armed conflict on children must be everyone's concern and is everyone's responsibility.\" -1996 Machel study7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 83Machel study. The mandate of the office includes assessing \"progressachieved, steps taken and difficultiesencountered in strengthening the protection of children in situations of armed conflict\"; raising awareness about the plight of affected children;and working closely with and fosteringcooperation between governmentsand int ergovernmental bodies, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and notab le UN b odies and mechanisms, as well as non-govern- mental organizations. 211The OSRSG offers a vital independent, moral voicefor children affected by armed conflic taround the globe. The office also pla ys the lead role in bringing the UN sy stem together on behalf of the S ecretary-General, in initiating and sustaining with UNICEF the global Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism, and in maintaining dialogue with Member States and relevant parties to conflict. In con- junction with UN country teams, the OSRSG a dvocates for the development of action plans to cease the recruit-ment and use o fchildren in conflict, and to address all other graveviolations against children. The work of the OSRSG has been central to maintaining the Security Council' sengagement on children's issues. With the support of UNICEF and k eyUNsystemand NGO par tners, it has played a central role in generating political consensus for the Monitoringand R eporting Mechanism in the UN Security Council and beyond.The SRSG has invested considerable time and effort on high-profile field missions to placesaffected by armed conflict, and these visits ha veserved to enhance global advocacy for protection efforts. She has also engaged with governmentaland non-state entities on issues ofaccountability and compliance insituations w here UN system partners and othe ractors may have been constrained by practical field realities. Following a number of field visits by the Special Representative of theSecretary-General, parties to conflict havemade commitments to formulate action plans to end children's partici- pation in armed conflict. The OSRSG presides over a Task F orce on Children Affected by Armed Conflict. It works to mainst ream the issue throughout UN agencies, offices and mandates, and it identifies trends and policies that needtobe discussed. A chief respon- sibility of the Task Force is vetting the Secretary-General's annual report on children affected by armed conflict. UNICEF . As the lead UN agency for children, UNICEF is responsible fordeveloping policy around children'sissues; supporting advocacy; developing guidelines and w orking t ools; increasing capacity; and developing and maintaining e ffectiveresponses for children, including those affected by armed conflict. UNICEF has consistently argued for an agenda that does more than simply respond tothe needs of children fighting in armed forces. It also aims to promotearights-based approach to ensure aprotective environment for all childr enaffected by armed conflict. UNICEF's response is grounded by its 2004 Core Commitments forChildren in Emergencies. In response to the 1996 Machel study'srecommendation to increase capa cityto serve children affected byarmedconflict, UNICEF has developed a team to focus on policy and systems development. Along with the M onitoring and Reporting Mechanism, this team addresses prevention of recruitment and release of children associated with armed forces and groups, sexual violence, child p rotection and psychosocial issues. In most countries affected byarmed conflict, UNICEF and partners have gradually begun to dedicate specific human, financial and mat erial resources to this issue. In addition, they work to help governments raise their capacity to respond, which is of utmostimportance in developing sustainable, integrated mechanisms to preventand respond to the six graveviolations and to additional ones. In collaboration with the OSRSG, UNICEF has tak enthe lea din working with the Monitoring and Reporting M echanism Steering Committee to develop systems and tools to improve the quality and sustainability of the mechanism. UNICEF is also the lead agency for Sri Lanka \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1591/Nooranithe Child Protection Working Group in the Inter-Agency StandingCommittee Global Protection Cluster,dealing with the situation of childrenin emergencies, including thosecaused by armed conflict. Other UN entities also have key roles and responsibilities regardingchildren. The 1996 Machel studycalled for all \"United Nations bodies[to]treat c hildren affected by armed conflicts as a distinct and priorityconcern.\" 212Successive Secretaries-General have emphasized the need for collective responsibility to ensurethat the issue is not regarded as specificto one agency and to ensure the UN famil yworks with governments and civil society throughout the humani- tarian community. In September 2004,then Secretary-General Kofi Annansubmitted to the General Assembly aComprehensive Assessment of the United Nations System Response to Childr enAffected by Armed Conflict. 213 Much of what was noted in thatassessment remains relevant today. Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). DPK Ohas significantly expanded the incorpo- ration of children's issues in peace- keeping operations. This includes more coverage of child rights andprotection in training for peace- keepers, as recommended by Mrs. Machel in 1996. It has also led toanothe rimportant development: the inclusion of child protectionadvisers in peacekeeping missions. Beginning with the deployment of asingle adviser in Sierra Leone in 2000, DPKO currently deploys more than60 advisers in seven peacekeepingmissions and one political mission. 214 Arecent evaluation by DPKO, 'Lessons LearnedStudy:Child Protection - The impact of child protection advisersin peacekeeping operations' , recognized the important work doneby child protection advisers in raisingattention to the rights of war-affected children. In many locations, childprotection advisers have been instrumental in implementing theMonitoring and Reporting Mechanismand documenting child rights violat ions.They have also engaged in dialogue with parties to conflict and conducted advocacy onpolitically sensitive issues. 215 Through such work, DPKO supports operational partners who maybeunable to engage in overt political a dvocacy on child rights violations without jeopardizing theirlong-term work. As a follow-up to the lesso ns lear nedstudy, DPKO has recruited a child protection focal point at H eadquarters to develop apolicy within the department. This person will work with child protection advisers in the field and collaborate with such key partners as UNICEF and the OSRSG. Office of the United Nations HighCommissio ner for Human Rights (OHCHR). OHCHR's function is evolving from advisory to operational. Its field presence in Nepal and Ugandaand its r ole in p roviding human rights monitors to peacekeepingmissions have made important contributions to improving themonitoring and reporting of violations and in r aising the le velofexpertise in formulating response strategies and actions.OHCHR has pla yedamajor part in monitoring and reporting on grave violations against children in itsNepal and Uganda operations. It has also placed a dedicated child rights Philippines \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1453/Bito 84 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 85focal point in its Nepal country operation. Similar child focal pointsshould be established in all OHCHRcountry operations where practical. Anothe rrecommendation calls for OHCHR to employ a full-time focal point on children and armedconflict at Headquarters to betterintegrate its field-based monitoringand a dvocacy activities. OHCHR also facilitat esthe work of UN human rights me chanisms, such as the Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies monitoring compliancewith int ernational human rights treaties - including the Committee onthe R ights of the Child. As recommended in the Secretary- General's 2004 assessment report tothe Ge neral Assembly, OHCHR is urged to recruit more expertise onchild rights at Headquarters. United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR). UNHCR has played a major role in drawingattention to the needs of children displaced by conflict within or acrossborders. As part of the humanitarian reform process, UNHCR is taking onnew responsibilities to protect anddeliver services to internally displacedpersons, and has taken the lead in protection, emergency shelter and camp c oordination and management. Inthe ear ly1990s, UNHCR a dded aHeadquarters-level officer to coordinate issues pertaining to childrefugees. It now requires annual participatory assessments as part of its age, gender and diversity main- streaming strategy - an important example to other agencies. UNHCRreviewsimple mentationof the Machel commitments for children every two years. It has been encouraged toexpand its field child protection staffto better monitor, report, advocatearound and respond to grave violationsagainst c hildr en for populations of concern under its mandate. UN Development Programme Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery.The B ureau is mandat ed to provide a bridge between humani- tarian response and longer-term development following a country's recovery from conflict. Its growing work on youth and conflict is an area calling f oreven further collaboration, both across the UN system and withother partners, to improve policy and programme coherence for this priority age group, 15 to 24 years old. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA works through a network of field offices that support UN humani-tarian coordinators and countryteams. OCHA 's work on protection of civilians and follow-up to Security Council r esolutions and reports of the Secretary-General on that theme are an important component of international p olicies s upporting initiatives for children and armed conflict. OCHA also leads the process of soliciting donor support for UN humanitarian programmes, mainly through the Consolidated Appeals Process and the Central Emergency Response Fund. Kenya \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0470/Cranston86 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDOther UN entities essential to children and related armed conflict issues include: the Department of Political Affairs, which couldcontribute to more consistentinclusion of children's concerns in mediation leading to peace agreements; the UN Office for Disarmame nt Affairs, especially in connection with the impact of small arms and lig ht w eapons; the United Nations D evelopment Fund for Women, especially in its role spear- heading the campaig ntoend v iolence against w omen;and the U nited Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), with its f ocus o nreproductive health, gender-based violence and HIV . Monitoring and reporting mechanisms One of the most significant develop- ments during the past 10 years has been the creation of the UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM), as cal led for in Security Council Resolutions 1539 and 1612. The new system was crafted in part to address the la ckof an effective child rights enforcement mechanism in situations of armed conflict. It created a channel tolink inf ormation collected at the country level with reporting to the Security Council and to other organi- zations that can p ress a ctors to comply with international child rights and protection standards.The aim is t oprovidethe Security Council w ith accurate, reliable and timely information on therecruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict in violationof international law. In addition, itwill provide information on othergrave violations against children insituations ofarmed conflict as the basis for appropriate action. Asspecified by the 2005 Secretary- General's report on the situation of childr enand armed conflict, 216the mechanism c oncentrates on six categories of grave rights violations: /square6Killing and maiming of children; /square6Recruitment and use o associated with armed forces and g roups; /square6Abduction; /square6Rape and other acts of grave sexual violence against children; /square6Attacks on schools and hospitals; /square6Denial of humanitarian access. The MRM Steering Committee, co-chaired by the OSRSG and UNICEF, is an inter-agency initiative. It is meant to guide country task forces onmonitoring and reporting, includingon their review of draft reports, iden- tificat ionofpolicy iss ues, provision of guidance and development of working tools. Most recently, thecommittee has focused on technical issues r elatedtobuilding a common vision and understanding for the mechanism's global guidelines. The Steering C ommittee's work needs to beplanne dmoresystematically to ensure inter-agency commitment tothe MRM initiative globally and in the field. The Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism has achieved notable initial success, although it is more labour-intensive than anticipated and demands serious investment in human,financial and material resources.MRM c ount ry task forces have been estab lishe din 11 c ount ries. Each is led by the most senior UN staff member in the country, whether theSpecial Representative of the Secretary- General or the Resident Coordinator. Most task forces for children andarmed conflict are co-chaired by the UNICEF R epresentative; some by other agency heads. The SRSG-CAAC for children and armed conflict plays acrucial r ole in advocating for the monitoring and reporting exercise to remain a true inter-agency process involving all UN and child rights and p rotection institutions. Aworkshop organized by UNICEF and the OSRSG-CAAC in Pretoria(South Africa) in April 2007 providedaunique opportunity for exchange of experiences and lessons learned among members of the country task forces, Headquarters staff and other repre- sentatives. This work contributed substantially to the MRM global guid elines, whichcallfordeveloping a'state of knowledge' study to identify all potential sources of information.It should assess the risk of imple-menting the mechanism for those who p rovideand g atherinformation as well as for witnesses and victims.\"NGO/UN have been working in our areas, supporting us. They are all leaving too soon, and this is making everything worse.\" - Young woman, 18, Sri Lanka7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 87RECOMMENDATIONS GLOBAL RESPONSE SYSTEM 1. Make information available at alllevels. The United Nations should facilitate access to thelatest resear chbyUN ag encies, international and local NGOs, Member States and other stakeholders. This will aid thedevelopment of national policies and support scaling up projects, leading to a sustainable impact onchildr en. 2. Generate more knowledge. Stakeholders, including academic and r esear chinstitutions, should increase their investment in generating and managing knowledgerelated to children and armed conflict. 3. Develop a common set of indicat ors and an information management system. T o enable more accurate analysis of trendsovertime, global and field-based indicators are needed. It is crucially important to develop abaseline of data and a system to manage information (bothquantitative and qualitative) onallrelevant issues. 4.Build a stronger evaluation system.Itis vital t oimprove documentation and analysis ofthe impact of prevention and response activities on the well- being of children.MONITORING AND REPOR TING MECHANISM 1. Prepare practical guidelines for field w orkers. Inclose c onsulta- tion with country task forces, the MRM Steering Committee should prepare a concise field manual for those responsible for data collection,reporting and analysis, as well as for prevention and response activities at the country level.MRM task forces should ensurethat the selected data collectiontools complement the approachesoutline din the guidelines. 2. Build the capacity of national and local partners. Donors, UN agencies and internationalNGOs should support efforts to build capacity among the childprotection partners (national and local) who will participate in the monitoring and reportingmechanism. Skills can be developed throughtraditional training courses, but mentoring is also effective. Training packages should bedeveloped in collaboration withthe MRM Steering Committee. 3. T ake steps to ensure the security of victims, witnesses and com-munities. Safety and security issues related to the mechanism should be assessed globally. Such aproject, convened by the OSRSG,UNICEF, OHCHR and other Philippines \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1460/Pirozzi88 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDglobal partners, should start with agreement on the precautions that data collectors should take in the field. It should also train field staff in security, establish a security incident monitoring system and develop contingency plans to respond to incidents. Global guidance, field manuals andtraining should, at a minimum, clarify field monitors' obligations and methods for safeguarding the identities of victims and witnesses. 4. Support the mechanism with resources. Asuccessful Monitoring and R eporting task forces will need to continue to strengthen capacity by recruiting dedicated, skilled staff and ensuring that allinvolved in the process are trained and kept informed about policy developments. All key stakeholders, including Member States, donors, UN entities and NGOs, are urged to dedicate greater levels of human and financial resources toconsolidat ethe mo nitoring, reporting and response mechanisms. Donorsshould c ontinue to fund prevention and response activities because they are an integral part of the mechanism. 5.Integrate child protection advisers into missions by DPKO and the D epartment of Political Affairs. In countries implementingthe Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism, the heads of peace- keeping and political missions co-chair the UN country task forces along with UNICEF. The child protection advisers shouldbeintegrated into all relevant peacekeeping and political missions to make sure that all staff incorporate a child rights approachintoperformance of their functions. 217 INTER-AGENCY COLLABORATION ANDHUMANITARIAN REFORM The 1996 Machel study emphasized that protection of children \"must be central to the humanitarian, peacemaking and peacekeeping policies of the United Nations, and should be given priority withinexisting h uman rights and humani- tarian procedures.\" It also called for inter-institutional mechanisms togive sufficient priority to children. 218 Improvements have been made in mainstreaming and prioritizing childr en'sconcerns in United Nations decisio n-making, including discussions of UN executive committees. Along w ith the S ecretary-General's Policy C ommitt ee,the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA) and o nPeaceand S ecurity (ECPS) ar ethe most c entral to decisions that involve response to children affected by armed conflict.219 Established in General Assembly Resolution 46/182 of 19 December1991, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)220is the p rimary mechanism for inter-agency coordi- nation of humanitarian assistance. IASC is uniq ue in that it inc ludes principal UN entities and non-UN partners. Under the leadership ofthe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, the committeeworks to: /square6Developand agree on system- wide humanitarian policies; in humanitarian programmes; /square6Advocate for humanitarian principles; /square6Identify areas with gaps in mandates or lack of operational capacity; /square6Develop and agree on a common ethical framework for all humani- tarian activities.221 IASC's growing role in children's issues is reflected in the number of guidelines it has issued during the past decade. Atthe fie ld level, the 1996 Machel studycalledfor children and armed conflict to \"be reflected in the terms of reference for resident and humani- tarian c oordinators and those with political r esponsibilities, such as special representatives of the Secretary- General.\"222Leadership and engagement on children's concerns from theserepresentatives of the UN system 7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 89have improved during the past decade. For example, special representativesand humanitarian coordinators more consistently advocate for child-sp ecific c oncerns and provide leadership for monitoring, reporting and responding to grave violationsagainst children. Interviews conductedfor the strategic review 223found that the n umb erofagencies concerned with c hildren and armed conflict issues has incr eased. Now concerns related to children are raised by UN entities in the field in addition toUNICEF ,in par ticular by OCHA, peacekeeping operations, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNHCR. The United Nations is undergoing an inst itution-wide process of reform in which the humanitarian sector has advanced considerably. The reform process is intended to clarify account- ability across sectors, prepare common standar ds and guid elines, improve information collection, and develop newemergency and inter-agency cooperation.It aims to increase response capacityand effectiveness in emergencies by building global capacities and providing p redictable leadership, stronger inter-agency partnerships, greateraccountab ility, and improved field-level coordination and priority setting. 224This approach has improved the delivery of services to conflict-affected children.Reinforcing civil society and social support structures In conflict-affected countries, civil society - including the media, local NGOs, faith-based organizations, and private sector and communitygroups and networks - often operatesin par allelto governmental and inter- national relief efforts. Civil society shares the burden of delivering services and protecting children from harm. These groups are frequently the firstones o nthe g round and o ften provide aid when others cannot. Advocacy networks. In addition tooperational agencies, numerous advocacy ne tworks have emerged or consolidated during the past decade. These networks - which include theCoalition to Stop the Use of ChildSoldiers, the Inter-Agency NetworkonEme rgency Education and the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict - have provided significant help in reaching out to children and generating action to prevent and abolish the abuse of children in situations ofarmed conflict. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, for example, produces a comprehensive report every four yearsonthe r ecruitment and use of children by armed forces and armed groups. Although not specific to children, Landmine Monitor reports, an init iative of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, contain informationrelevant to the impact of war on children.Local non-governmental organiza- tions. Even closer to the front lines for conflict-affected children are localNGOs. Women's groups, faith-based organizat ions, cultural groups and other community associations regularly provide aid or help monitorthe situation of children. By utilizingtheir access to and understanding oflocal sit uations,they play a vital role in delivering services, monitoring and advocacy. Civil society organizations often proliferate in response to a crisis and may continue to operate after theconflic t. But without coordination theymaywork at cross purposes. Aselaborated in chapters 3 and 9, youth groups and children themselves arean important resource, supporting eachother and working to build peace. Like NGOs, these groups do not always have sufficient resources to carry out their work. But investment in training, mentoring and collaborative partnerships can empower them to contribute more effectively to protection and care of children in their communities. Religious leaders and organizations. Faith-based entities can be a wellspring of resilience and communal strengthduring a crisis. They need more attentionfrominternational agencies toimprove understanding of how and whentoworkwith and support them. Religious leaders and institutions can also play a key role in peacebuilding and r econciliation. Examples include Bishop Desmond Tutu's role in \"Our home was damaged during war and we migrated to Pakistan. We lived for 10 years in Pakistan. We came back to Afghanistan. We have a place to build ahouse, but have no money to pay for it. We have rented a house and live there now, but it is very hard for us to pay for it.\" -Young man, 17, Afghanistan90 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDSouth Africa and beyond, and a coalition of church groups in the Philippines that worked as an inter- mediary between the Government and the National Democratic Front. They can also play a key role inchildren's protection. Religious leadersand faith-base dorganizat ions oftenhaveaccess to wide global networks, useful in mobilizing people around the car eand p rotection ofchildren. The me dia. The me dia has a r ole in raising a wareness o fchildren's rights, reporting violations against children, and p roviding c hildr enand y outh the opportunity to express their own ideas and opinions. Search for Common Ground has initiated Y outh Voice radio projects in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone. These projects encourage dialogue byallowing youth to express their opinions on a range of issues affectingthem,such as demobilization of childr enassociated with armed forces and armed groups, child rights and inter-ethnic conflict. Similar projects havebeenundertaken in Nepal. Harnessing the power of national media as partners in information sharing,advocacy and awareness raising is key to promoting peace and driving positive change. Also neededare efforts to sensitize the mediaabout ethical reporting on children'sissues and best practices in covering child-r elated issues. Given the delicacy of issues relating to childrenaffected by armed conflict, all media coverage should reflect a code ofconduct focused on safeguarding thebest interests of the child and abiding bythe 'dono harm' principle. The private sector. With growing recognition of the role of businessand 'war economies' in situations ofconflict, private sector involvement is crucial. UN in vestigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and S ierra Leone, for example, exposed the complicity of some international corporations, and inresponse, corporate actors began to regulate trade flows and support human rights standards. The PeaceDiamond Alliance in Sierra Leonebrought two major buyers together with the Government, NGOs and donors. They now jointly regulate diamond production, monitor violence and ban the use ofchild labour. 225 Analyses for the Machel strategic review identified some importantnewareas for action. One is that private sector companies need to be viewed as duty bearers - those withobligations to help fulfil child rights. This requires promotion of a wider understanding of corporate socialresponsibility and of child rights in situations of armed conflict. Some of the most promising measures involvecooperation among Member Statesand multinational enterprises. TheVoluntary Principles on Security andHuman Rights, for example, promotehuman rights risk assessments and training of security providers. TheExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative establishes a degree of revenue transparency in the taxes, royalties and fees companies pay tohost governments. The Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact represent important par tnerships in w hich childr en's rights should be part of the cr iterion. 226 Child pr otectionnetworks. Inman y count ries,child p rotection networks perform a variety of roles, including advocacy, coordination among sectors,information sharing and harmonizing programme approaches. 227Such networks have commonly been formed to address a particular issue, suchas release and r eintegration of children connected with armed groups, or separated children. Their memberships t end to be broad, including UN agencies, government departments and civil society groups. Usually these networks do not take on child rights monitoring and reporting, but in some instances they have been mobilized to contribute to the UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism. Communitygroups in Somalia, for example, have organized to help document grave violations against children and to collect information on internal displacement and theimpact it has on communities.7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 91Developing national systems Central to the idea of protecting children's rights in times of conflict is the primary responsibility of the State to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all persons within its territory. The Convention on theRights o f the Child, like all other major human rights instruments, reiterates State responsibilities, including in times of war and internal conflict. Clearly,however, national governments in conflict-affected count ries ar econstrained in delivering essential services and reaching populations in need. Majoremergencies att ract large- scale int ernational action, which can quickly evolve into capacity substitution rather than capacitybuilding. When these internationalactors withdraw, a country can be left bereft of protection capacities for such initiatives as conducting family tracing and reunification or assistance to link victims of gender- based violence with public services. Solutions tosuch issues include development of the skills needed to gradually integrate services into national programmes and plans. Within nat ional sy stems, capacity building to protect children against violence, exploitation and abuse faces particular constraints. Becausesuchissues can be culturally sensitive, politically charged or focused onmarg inaliz edgroups, the p olitical will to prioritize them may waver.Even when governments want to be involved,the Stat emay lack capacity in justice and social welfare systems, and national human rights commissions. An approach emphasizing integrated systems and a coordinated response involving national govern- ment, civil society and international agencies could help scale up services. This r equires long-term commitment; it cannot be achieved through short- term emergency funding. National governments should work closely with the MRM task f orcetobuild capacity to prevent violations, respond to them and ensure thatstrong accountability mechanisms are in place. Recommendations 1. Continue mainstreaming within the United Nations and other organizations. Senior child protection focal points should be designated within all relevant UN ag encies, departments and offices, and in field operations.Periodic assessments should be undertaken to gauge progress in mainstreaming against specific criteria: (a) the extent to which the iss ue o fchildr enaffected by armed conflict is brought to the highest levels of decision-makingof Member States and the UNsystem, including the governingboards ofagencies, funds and p rogrammes; (b) senior management commitment to and promotion of concernsaround this issue; (c) integration ofthese c oncerns into doctrine and p olicy fr ameworks, strategic plans, operational mandates, and programmes and activities;(d) adequacy of in-house knowledge,expertise and training to inform policies, strategies and operations; and (e) adequacy of resources to support these actions. Iraq \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-2322/Kamber92 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD2. UNHCR and OHCHR agencies: Recruit more expertise on childrights at H should employ a full-time focalpoint o nchildr enand armed conflict at Headquarters to better integrate its field-based monitoring and advocacy activities. 3. Build and strengthen national structures and systems . Through cluster assessments, work plans and training, UN agencies and international NGOs should helptransfer functions to governmentand ci vil society. This calls for gradually integrating actions into national p olicies, plans and programmes. Italso r equires helping governments and civil society deal with challenges such as lack of resources.4. Coordinate responses. Integrated systems facilitate coordination among national government, civilsociety and international agencies.This, in turn, allows activities tobe scaled up and provides greaterbenefits to a broader group ofchildren. Donors and interna- tional partners must acknowledge that this process will be longterm, and they must commitresources to its success. 5. Provide technology. Donors, inter- national organizations and privatecompanies should collaborate to identify affordable information and communication technologyappropriate in crisis situations.They should ensure that this tech- nology is transferred to nationaland local actors, and that staff aretrained to use and maintain it.6. Decentralize partnership mechanisms. The United Nations, international NGOs and local civil society should establishpartnership mechanisms at thenational and/or subnationallevels. A number of countries with func tioning c hild p rotection working groups or national networks have already taken steps in this dir ection, but the model could be adapted and expanded. Inparticularly large and complex count ries,the model can be mirrored at the subnational level, as has been done for cluster mechanisms in the D emocratic Republic of the Congo. 228 SETTING GLOBAL STANDARDS The 1996 Machel study stressed that in armed conflicts, \"everyone concerned with children mustpractice a consistent set of principles, standards and guidelines.\" 229 Thanks to increased international cooperation,numerous inter-agency standards have been developed over the past decade. Many of them have beendeveloped through broad consultative processes, which aids their acceptance and au thority. This growing body ofpolicy standar ds and p ractice guidelines extends the international legal framework to the level of implementation. In February 2007, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNICEF organized the ministerial Myanmar \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0344/Dean7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 93meeting 'Free Children from War' . It culminated in a global consultative process to update the Cape T own Principles and other technicalguidance on children associated with armed forces and groups. The first outcome document, endorsed by66 governments, was the Paris Commitments (discussed in chapter 4). It reaffirms States' commitmentstointernational standards on protection of children associated with armed forces and groups, and to good practices to support their release and reintegration. The second docume nt,the Paris Principles, incorporates current knowledge and lessons learned on disarmament,demobilization and reintegration. Itaims to help practitioners ensure that these p rocesses lead to better quality of care for and protection of children. 230T ogether, the Paris Commitments and Paris Principles comprise a ne wsetof standards and guidelines. They provide coherence between governmental promises, inter-national obligations, and programmeprinciples and best practice. The standards and guidelines developed during the past decadeinclude: /square6Sphere Humanitarian Charter and Minim um Standar ds in D isaster Response (1997); /square6Guiding rinciples on Internal mine and Unexploded OrdnanceAwareness Education (1999);/square6The Secretary-General's bulletin on special measures for protection from sexual exploita- tion and sexual abuse (2003);231 /square6Inter-Agency Guiding Principles on and Separated Children (2004); /square6Inter-Agency Network for Educa- tion in Emergencies Minimum Standar ds forEducation in Emergencies, Chronic Crises and Early Reconstruction (2004); /square6IASC G uidelines f orHIV/AIDS Interventions in Emergency Settings (2004); /square6United Nations Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (2005); /square6IASC Guidelines for Gender- base dViolence Interventions in Humanitarian (2005); /square6Integrated Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Standar ds(2006); /square6IASC Guidelines on Mental Health and P sychosocial Support in Emergency Settings (2007). Challenges in converting policy into practice The ne wstandar ds and guid elines have helped unify approaches. This, in turn, improves consistency in advocacy and programmes, and aids coordination and development of common strategies among partners. Results are being seen. For example,in an e valuationofimplementation ofminim um standar ds developed bythe Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies, respondents notedimprovements in community participation and coordination, analysis, adoption of a more holisticapproach to education, and attentionto advocacy and capacity building. 232 Humanitarian actors have tried to extend their accountability and predictability beyond voluntaryadherence to standards. IASC's 2005 adoption of the cluster approach to inter-agency cooperation was key (it is discussed further below). Through a set of indicators to measureimprovement, more attention hasalso been given to monitoring and evaluationof programmes for childr enand youth in armed conflict settings, and the implementation of standar ds and guidelines. For example, UNICEF has been developing a performance monitoring system forits C oreCommit ments f or Children in Emergencies. 233 It is clear that the improved body of standards and guidelines (only some of which are outlined here) ha vegone a long way towards imple menting the 1996 M achel study'skeyfinding s.Asawhole, however, the application of standards in the field needs to be strengthened\"[The UN] needs to go to the grass roots.\" - Young man, 15, Nigeria94 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDand institutionalized at all levels. Experience has shown that locally adapted and translated guidelines are indispensable, along with greater investment in training and capacity building, as discussed below. Recommendations 1. IASC should ensure issues pertaining to programmatic response for conflict-affected children are incorporated innew cluster guidance, common standards, guidelines and assessment tools. 2. Further the implementation of standards and guidelines. Member States, civil society organizations, UN agencies and international NGOs should concentrate on incorporating standards into their organiza-tional policy and operations documents, such as standard operating procedures, manuals and strategic plans. Progress towards harmonizing inter- agency, government and donor standar ds should b esystematically monitored through a framework of indicators and benchmarks. Itwould be useful for the Committeeon the Rights of the Child toconsider implementation of these standards and guidelines inreviewing Member States' effortstotranslat einternational law into domestic law.ENSURING CAPACITY FOR RESPONSE Across all areas of work on children affected by armed conflict, the strategic review found common gaps and constraints. These include inadequate human resources; insuffi- cient funding, especially in terms oftimeliness and flexibility; poor adherence to standards and guidelines;and ins ufficient monitoring, evaluation and documentation. This section highlights developments concerninghuman and financial r esour ces. Investing in human resources UN agencies and civil society groups need more personnel to monitor,report on and respond to issues pertaining to children and armed conflict, as well as to increase coverageand st rengthen child protection systems. Protection of children affected by armed conflict is extremely labour-intensive and requires specializedskills and e xperience. Human resources support is required across all levels - including the Security Councilworking group on children and armedconflict, UN agencies dealing with these issues at Headquarters and in the field, NGOs and community- base dorganizat ions. Furthermore, the humanitarian community needs to do more to develop the capacities of national authorities so they can assume their responsibilities to protect children. Where possible, UN agencies anddonors should facilitate an assessment of national human resources needsand work with governments todevelop strategies for human resource development and management. In areas affected by conflict, innovative strategies will be needed to retainqualified civil servants, who may also need on-the-job support. Training is an imp ortant tool for improving the implementation of standar ds and the q ualit yof response for children. Despite the extensive training being offered around theworld, many sectors still lack adequately trained personnel. The IASC g lobal clusters have been working to map capacity gaps for humanitarian action in emergencies foreach sector and to develop strategies to address these gaps. Anoteworthy inter-agency training initiative, Action for the Rights of the Child, was launched byUNHCR and the I nternational Save the Children Alliance in 1997; UNICEF and OHCHR jo inedin 1999. It consists of 14 trainingmodules, including one covering international law and its applicationfor children and specific issues suchas separated children, disability,education, landmine awareness, sexual and r eproductive health, and abuse and exploitation. Based on the results o fan ind ependent evaluation in 2006, the steering committee decided to revise the entire initiative. This work is still in process and offers an excellent opportunity to integrate\"If you go to the Fourah Bay road there are many beggars and they are assisted by children. When I see them I never feel good because the children are all my peers.Why shouldn't they go to school, why shouldn't they get the opportunity? And most of them are war affected. Their mothers are dead or they only have one parent who probably has amputated limbs. So please, they should build homes for them, and then educate them.\" -Young woman, 16, Sierra Leone7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 95recent developments in standards and practice into the training module. Also in 2007, the inter-agency modular training package 'Introduction toChild P rotection in Emergencies' published. UNICEF and the otherpartners 234nowconduct regional training sthroughout the world on child protection in emergencies. Rostersare one way of addressing personnelshortfalls and providing quick deployment in emergencies. The IASC global clusters for education,health, nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation have established or are establishing rosters of personnel toserve as cluster coordinators and provide technical support. ProCap,administered by the Norwegian Refugee Council, is a roster of protection specialists who can serve in crisis situations. It has an agreement with UNICEF to help fill the need for senior child protection officers. DPKO also maintains a rosterof child protection experts, from which it draws child protection advisers. It is important to providetraining and t oexplore ways to maximize use of the rosters. Increasing financial resources Donorcount ries have recognized that financing q uality prevention and response measures for children affectedbyarmed conflict is crucial, and they have generally supportedsuch programmes. However, as noted in the strategic review report to the 2007 General Assembly,\"the gaps in resources for children affected by conflict are so extremethat it is clear that a quantum leap infunding is needed.\" 235 Sincethe M achel study, commitment to strengthening coordination between donors hasgrown. This makes disbursement ofhumanitarian funds longer-term support and aid t oprojects that fall in the gap between emergency response and post-conflict transition, and itensures greater transparency. Chang es in the UN h umanitarian financing sy stemduring the past decade, including those within the recent frame of humanitarian reform, allneed to better incorporate child- specific priorities and tracking: Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP). Administered by OCHA, the CAP is k eytohumanitarian funding. It has become the main tool for coordinated planning, implementation and monitoring ofhumanitarian actions, and it has improved cooperation betweengovernments, donors, aid agencies,the International Red Cross and RedCrescent Movement, and NGOs. On average,since1992, the Consolidated Appeals Process has sought $3.1 billion peryear and r eceived $2.1 billion per year (68 per cent). Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP). When OCHA developsaconsolidated appeal on behalf of acountry or region experiencing a humanitarian emergency, CHAP isthe foundation. It is unfortunate that not al lhaveincluded child-specific analysis in their rationale or objectives. CHAPs for several Africanregions affected by conflict have notmentioned children or child-relatedissues in the ir sections on \"strategic priorities for humanitarian response.\" 236Explicit inc lusion of child-focused programming in all CHAPs would be a valuable way tobring c hildren's issues to the fore in the UN ap peals p rocess. The IASC Needs Assessment Format, which guid es preparation of the CHAP , should he lp; it has a child protection subse ction, and the education section addresses such issues as attacks on schools and teachers. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). CERF is a financial instrument designed to ensurepredictable funding for rapid response and underfunded emergencies. As ofSeptember 2008, CERF has committed $926 million for almost 1,000projects in 62 countries. 237It could be a mechanism for fundingforgotten emergencies and crises toosmal ltoattract the attention of bilateral donors and larger NGOs. Y et onlyasmal lamount o fhumanitar ian aid flows through the CERF, so its impact is limited. Concerns have also been expressed about the 'life-saving' criterion for CERF projects andwhether it is consistent with the human rights approach to humani- tarian assistance. The definition oflife-saving may diminish CERF's flexibility and therefore its ability toprovideadequate resources for education and protection activities.Emergency Response Funds. This mechanism enables NGOs (which cannot access CERF) and UN ag encies to respond quickly to emergencies by making start-up funds available in cases of rapidly changing circumstances and humani- tarian needs.238Typically the amount is $250,000 or less. Countries that have used these funds include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Liberia and Somalia. An early OCHA evaluation of the mechanism found that it has provided the greatest value in the middle phase of an emergency, filling gaps in humanitarian response, increasing humanitarian access and enabling NGOs t oscale up their activities. 239 Common Humanitarian Fund/P ooledFunds. These funds weretested in the Sudan240and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to quickly and flexibly provide resources before Consolidated Appeals Process funds became available and to givehumanitarian coordinators greater flexibility. An independent evaluation found that the success of the decen- tralized allocation processes depended on cluster capacity, which varied widely. It recommended a more streamlined management process thatwould give the humanitarian coordinat ormorediscretion. 241 Multi-donor Trust Funds. The increasing use of these funds representsa direct application of the aid effec-tiveness agenda and UN reform initiatives. They provide flexible,coordinated and predictable fundingto support national priorities. In their governance structure and operations, these funds are consistent with objectives of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, 242national ownership, alignment with nationalpriorities and coordination. 243 The total amount o f humanitarian aid is hard to quantify, but it has been estimated that around 10 p ercent is now delivered by new mechanisms. The evidence is not conclusive as to whether these new mechanisms will effectively pool funding impar tially and rapidly as well as direct funds to priority needs. There is a concern that they could introduce another layer of bureaucracy and transaction costs without resulting in improvement. 244 Foracomplete picture of human- itarian resources it is necessary to include funds from governments that are not members of OECD, fundschanne lled through military forces for humanitarian activities, remittancesfrom the various diasporas respondingto crises, funds raised from the publicby NGOs, corporate and foundation contributions, and the consistently underappreciated contribution of affectedStates,local communities and households. Most of these data are either not collected or not collated. It has been estimated that donors outside the Development Haiti \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0128/Kamber 96 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 97Assistance Committee now contribute 12 per cent of official humanitarian financing.245They focus on humanitarian engagement in ne ighbouring countries and maintain a strong preference forbilateral aid, including the Red Cross/R edCrescent Movement, over multilateral mechanisms. 246 Funding continuity Donors continue to provide resources for prevention, response and post- conflict reconstruction in three distinct envelopes. This lack of funding continuity continues to hamper interventions on behalf ofchildren affected by armed conflict. Short-term emergency relief remains the preference, with time frames as short as three months. Short-term, piecemeal funding has not been conducive to a systematic approach tosustainable programming. This approach also contradicts the conceptof flexible financing expressed in the c oncept of Good Humanitarian Donorship, a well-publicized commit ment by24 d onor bodies toensure that sufficient emergency aid is available at the right time. 247 Assessing the impa cts ofhumanitar - ian funding r eforms,the Humanitarian Policy Group has noted that \"global humanitar ian funding to date does not ap pear t obegrowing more predictable or needs-based. On the contrary, donor governments'funding trends run counter to thestated requirements of the interna-tional humanitarian system.\" 248 Abackground paper presented toIASC and Good Humanitarian Donorship in July 2007 noted that the reforms of the United Nations,donors and NGOs of the past decademay have improved individualcomponents of the system, but itsoverall structure is still inherentlyinefficie nt. 249Donors frequently mak edecisio ns without consulting eachothe r,and c ollective efforts to pool funding and make joint decisions about needs assessment are viewed as inefficient and inimicaltorapid service delivery. The challenge lies in how to determine whether aid is reaching children. Obtaining data to determinewhether more aid is reaching childrenis not easy. Many of the newmechanisms do not explicitly refer to children or disaggregate their databy age. Child-focused funding isoften masked 'affected populations' or'vulnerable groups' . Reporting by Common Humanitarian Fund, Pooled Funds and CERF shouldinclude indicators of humanitarianaid specifically benefiting childrenaffected by conflict. Areview of the Consolidated Appeals Process for 11 countries revealedawide disparity in how childr en'sissues are articulated. 250 Each CHAP was analysed using the following criteria: (a) analysis ofchildren's issues in the section on'context and humanitarian conse- quences'; (b) child-focused objectives included in strategic priorities or objectives at the country level; and(c) child-focused objectives includedin response plan objectives. All but one CHAP included general descriptions and statistics on children's issues in the section Iraq \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-1625/Kamber98 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDon context and humanitarian consequences. In the section on strategic priorities for humanitarian response, several countries or regions (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes Region, Somalia and West Africa) did not mention children or child-related issues. Children and child-focused programming was,however, included in numerous plan objectives. Although the trend seems to be to mainstream children's issues across sectors/clusters, their explicit inclusion,particular ly in strategic priorities,is a v aluable way to bring childr en's issues to the fore and to ensurethey receive priority. Anadditional funding problem is the tendency to allocate funds toprojects addressing the needs of a narrowsubgroup of young people, such as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration funds dedicated exclusively to work with children formerly associated with armed forces and armed groups rather than forcommunity work in areas wherethese children return and where non- combatant young people may be even morevulnerable. This problem is noted across all sectors and undermines best p ractice on multi-sectoral and community-based approaches. Recommendations 1.Enhanc ehuman resources and build the base of expertise at all levels.Keystakeholders such as Member States, regional organiza-tions and UN entities should invest significant resources in building the base of expertise on child protection, including for monitoring, reporting and responding in both programming and advocacy. They should give priority to investing in additional human resources to meet thegrowing needs of child protection entities at UN Headquarters, and at regional and country levels. 2. Expand access to training at all levels. Humanitarian staff and peacekeeping personnel should haveaccess totraining - and so should lo cal se rviceproviders, suchas teachers, health workers and staff ofnational institutions. Member States, donors, the United Nations and international NGOs should offer or supporttraining in conflict-affected countries, which will allow greater access by staff of local NGOs and government agencies. These inter- national and national entities should also support local NGO leaders to participate in interna- tional t raining p rogrammes and conferences. The impact of training should b eroutinely evaluated by such methods as knowledge assessments before and after training and assessments ofhow the knowledge is applied. 3. Incorporate analysis of issues in planning d ocuments. OCHA, with support from UNICEF,should ensure that CHAP guide- r equire clear articulation child-related strategic objectives. 4.Ensure continuity of funding throug hcrisis and recovery. Donors and implementing agencies should id entify ways to manage funding to ensure continuity and sustainability of critical programmes. Donors should allow implementingagencies g reater flexibility and a broader time frame to use funds. IMPROVING PROGRAMME RESPONSE, MONITORINGAND KNOWLEDGE SHARING Studies, assessments and day-to-day observation by the international humanitarian and human rightscommunity have raised awareness of the devastating effect armed conflict has on children. Although broad agreement exists on the necessity of accurate and comprehensive information, the true extent of the impact remains elusive. Two of the key themes in the 1996-2000 M achel strategic review werethe ne edfor improved moni- toring and reporting on child rights violations in conflict, and improving information, data collection and analysis on children in conflict. 251 Many systems and initiatives have been launched over the past decadetoimprovethe mo nitoring, reporting and response. Y et an effective global framework to guide the work and7. SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 99support the regular collection and consolidation of information has not been fully developed. Due to insufficient global coordination of data collection and collation, this body of work has not been readily availab le toall in one central location. The mo nitoring, reporting and response components of the mechanism are essential to ensure that children receive the maximum impact ofprogrammes. But they also present practitioners with numerous logistical, conceptual and methodological challenges in situations of conflict. Logistical challenges include the difficulty of collecting data in insecure environments with shifting populations. Problems of impact assessme nt are made even more complex when baseline data are lacking and access to populations in insecure environments poses methodological constraints and personal r isks t oresearchers. Common programme monitoring framework Acommon programme monitoring framework would improve the level of programming across the global system. Efforts to develop one should build o nexisting w ork and emphasize adivisionoflabour, with data being collectedthrough different agencies and p rocesses. Aclear starting point would be the framework offered in 'A World Fit for Children' . T o implement itsgoals and monitor its progress,governments should prepare national plans o f action. Progress would be reviewed through regular reports of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly. 252Aglobal five-year progress report was prepared at the end o f2007, but it contained very little data on children affected byconflict. 253An examination of data from the Millennium Development Goals and World Fit f or Children databases f orconflict-affected countries, as begun in chapter 2 of this review, should be expanded and made more systematic. The me chanisms in pla ceto monitor compliance with theConvention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols represent another important system. 254 The UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys provide rich data on the situation of children. But dueto resource and other constraints, data have not always been disaggre- gatedtoreveal displacement or other effects of armed conflict. Because impacts reach across all sectors,amapping exercise would identify existing initiatives and systems that could provide data on children. A gap analysis, which should bedone as a part of the mapping, would reveal incomplete information. Among existing initiatives and systems to draw from is the registration database so ftwar e.Using it, UNHCR can generate statistics and other information on separated and unaccompanied children as well aschildren and adolescents at risk.This category includes ex-combatants, children in conflict with the law,child heads of households and their siblings, children with special educational needs and children atrisk of not attending school. OCHA 'splans to collect data across the clusters could also contribute to a consolidated system, as long as it incorporates disaggregation by age and gender. In 2003 in Sri Lanka, UNICEF launched (and continues to operate) a database to monitor recruitment of children into armed groups. Much information has been collected - the challenge now is to mak eit accessible. Strengthening information and knowledge sharing Knowledge must also be used to inform policy and programming. The humanitarian community produces an extensive amount of documentation and data related to conflict-affected children. But much ofit remains invisible to humani- tarian workers and researchersbecause it sta ysat the local level, available only in hard copy or inaccessible due to issues of Internetaccess reliability and affordability. The Machel study helped to invigorateacademic and practitioner interest in research. It resulted in numerous initiatives to document the impact of armed conflict on children. However, much of this resear chremains g enerated by institutions from the North, and its\"The biggest challenge is the freedom of movement and education system.\" - Young people, sex not specified, 17-20, Kosovo (Serbia)100 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDoutputs areoftenhardtoaccess by people in the South.

In 2008 they plan to launch the Care and Protection of Childrenin Emergencies Agency Learning Network.

More independent financing and acommit ment torigour, including a peer review mechanism for research,arerequired.Resear ch can contribute toman ygoals,including debunking myths and bolstering a particular advocacy or institutional agenda. Children and armed conflict is an emotional iss ue, and war inevitably politicizes the r esear ch context. Given these realities, the highest standar ds ofrigour and peer review are essential if research is to contribute to evidence-based policies. BOLSTERING THE SYSTEM: THE W AYFORW ARD Hopeful new initiatives and the atmosp hereof reform hold much promise for improving the lives of childr en affected by conflict. There are many opportunities to ensure that their needs are represented instructures, policies and programmes. Passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1612 marked a criticalthreshold: The age of enforcement ofnorms, agreements and instruments has arrived. In a relatively short period of time, the international system needs to expand its efforts togive children the protection that istheir legal rights. Generating norms without ensuring adequate imple- mentation does not effectivelychallenge impunity. 'AWorld Fit For Children' offers astrong foundation for a global agenda that maintains its focus onending grave violations againstchildr enwhile taking a st ep further to encompass the many other ways in w hichwar hinders children's development, such as through loss ofeducation, health, nutrition, water and h ygiene services. The humanitar- ian reform process will continue to offeropportunities to re-evaluate past w ork and improve response. Innovative funding mechanisms, if supported by better needs assessmentdata, could fill gaps. National and local a ctors, the centrepiece of any response to help children in need, must be given greater support.Groups and individuals at all levels of the system should continue to build links that w ill allow them to harmonize their efforts and work towards common goals while respecting each others' differences. The elements of the system to help childr en affected by armed conflic tarenowclearly established. The ne winstitutions, standards and mechanisms hold much promise for alleviating the suffering of children.

SYSTEMS OF RESPONSE 101Sri Lanka CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 8104 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD\"War violates every right of the child,\" the 1996 Machel study declared, \"theright to life, the right to be with family and community, the right to health,the r ight to development of the per- sonality and the right to be nurtured and p rotected.\" In the decade since the report, efforts to address the plight of war-affected children have focused on particular thematic areas of concern, sometimes in connection with specificcount ries.Sincethen, there has been growing recognition of the report's insight that there can be no long- termprotection and care for children in armed conflict without addressing the whole mosaic of factors affecting allchildr en, in all conflict situations. For example, interventions in such areas as health, nutrition, education, and water and sanitation are vital. But their provenbenefits will not ultimately help children with differing experiences and ne eds unless they are accompanied bycross-cu tting se rvices such as mental health and psychosocial counselling. Inthe years since 1996, experience has c ontinued to show how armed conflict can disrupt the social fabric of a community. It increases children's vulne rability, jeopardizes their right to survival and development, and increases their risk of marginalization, abuse and e xploitation. Part of the solution is longer-term community- based care and protection - and theeducation that is every child's right.The more insecure and fragile thecontext, the more these rights are at riskof being violated and left unfulfilled. Efforts to address these issues gained momentum when the Machel study offered the first comprehensive look at the impa ctofwar on children. This chapter provides an overview of the principles and approaches that havebecome increasingly common toall sectors and response areas since that time. They take into account the primacy of children's rights andthe r ealities o ftheir diverse needs and capa cities. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTION As discussed in chapter 6, the frame- work of international norms andstandards for children and armed conflict, especially the Convention on the Rights on the Child (CRC), provides the f oundat ion for response. The Convention commits States parties to respect the rules of international humanitarian law that are relevant to children, ensure protection and care of children who are affected by armed conflict, and take all appropriate measures to promote childr en'sphysical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. States parties to the Convention must e nsurethat the r ights it pledges are extended to every child under their jurisdiction, including refugees and those internally displaced, withoutregard to their status or that of their parents. But while the State retains primary responsibility for ensuringthe rights of the child, circumstances may leave it ill-equipped to properly carry out its role. Armed conflict often leaves central governments struggling t oprovide such public services as education, health care, welfare, water and sanitation, and security,and unable to ensure the quality of these services or their equitable delivery. In such situations, agreater burden may fall to muni- cipal and lo cal au thorities. Others also have responsibilities for the care, protection and develop-ment of children. Parents, community-base dorganizations, religious groups and the private sector all play key roles in realizing children's rights. Beyond these groups, the magnitude of children's unmet needs in conflict-affected countries has long led inter-national actors to respond. Efforts to create a coherent system across these organizations - all of which have their individual mandates - weredetailed in chapter 7. RESPONDING TO THE UNIQUENESS OF EVER YCHILD The 1996 Machel study stressed the importance of ensuring that every response r ecognizes children's diversity. Children and young people are not a homogeneous group. Y oung children and adolescent girls, for example,have very different needs. But while eachchild affected by armed conflict has had a multiplicity of experiences,8.1 PRINCIPLES AND APPROACHES\"Armed conflict [may be] finished, but we still have other types of wars - poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, youth delinquency and many more.\" -Young man, 16, Angolaall of them, without exception, share the same rights. Children and adolescents also have very different capacities, and the lines between them are oftenblurred. In a child's early years, thefocus is o nsurvival, with special attention needed in health, nutrition and p rotection. Research shows, however, that cognitive development is equally important. 256Y oung children have special vulnerabilities, and the ir protection requires close collaboration with and support of caregivers. Aschildr engetolderand begin to enter school, greater emphasis is placed on socialization, intellectual growth and skills development. Regular attendance at school can be an imp ortant sour ceof protection. During adolescence, young people begin to assume adult roles, including experimenting with sex and seeking a vocation. Peer group pressure, political consciousness and socially constructed roles such as 'breadwinner' or 'fighter' also become more apparent. Gender plays an important partin defining the e xperience of childhood, and boys and girls have significantly different security and protection needs in conflict situations.Boys, for example, may be more vulnerable to recruitment by armedgroups, and they are often expectedtobegin earning an income at an early age. Girls typically face greaterrisk of sexual violence and abuse,and they are commonly expected totake on household tasks and be the first to forgo schooling. The ways in which children respond to the stress of armed conflictalso depend on their particular circumstances. These in turn areaffected by such factors as age, sex,personality type, personal and familyhistory, and cultural background. Moreover, armed conflict often pusheschildren into roles beyond their capacity. It can also prolong certain transitions for young people. Because children are agents of their own protection, and appropriate copingmechanisms require specific cognitivecompetencies, a key priority is sup-porting children's cognitive develop- ment through various life stages.The different ways in which armed conflict may have already shaped children's lives can expose them to additional risks. Children can b eespeciallyvulnerable if they areliving with a disability, with HIV o ronthe st reet, or if they lack access to school or health care. Similar ly,separation from family, the e xperience of gender-based violence, internal displacement or refugee status, and current or former association with the armed forces or othe rarmed groups can heighten the risk of further violations. A child's reaction depends on the accumula- tion of risks, and also on her or his coping skil ls, available sources of support and other resources.EARLY RELIEF EFFORTS INSPIRED A FOCUS ON CHILDREN'S RIGHTS Throughout history, efforts to respond to the suffering of those affected by war have played a large role in drawing attention to children's rights.Shocked by the aftermath of battles in 17th century Europe, Swissbusinessman Henri Dunant became concerned with the plight of non-combatants and prisoners of war. His work led to the founding of the RedCross as well as the 1864 Geneva Convention, which remains the basis of international humanitarian law today. Half a century later, Eglantyne Jebb organized emergency relief for children affected by the Allied blockade following World War I and formedthe foundation of what has become the International Save the ChildrenAlliance. She went on to become a leading advocate for children, and wasthe author and a main force behind the Declaration of Children's Rights in1923. This document was an inspiration for the 1989 Convention on theRights of the Child. Among other rights, the original Declaration stated that\"the child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.\" 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 105PROGRAMMING GROUNDED IN CHILDREN'S RIGHTS At the time of the 1996 Machel study, the CRC was still relatively new and untested. Y et it clearly offered a fresh,multidisciplinar yperspective that demonstrated the interdependence of all children's rights. During thepast decade, there has been increased learning in programme approaches that best he lp toprotect children's rights. What has become known as 'child rights programming' is now used byUN ag encies and othe rs to help realize the id eals e mbodied in international humanitar ian and h uman r ights la w. Although child rights programming has been less extensively applied inconflict situations than elsewhere, aconsensus has developed around the importance of using an inclusiveand c ommunity-based approach involving multiple sectors. Such methods, applicable across a range of responses, are essential in minimizing children's vulnerability, strengtheningtheir resilie nce,and mitigating the impa ctofarmed conflict on their lives and future prospects. This is true whether applied to specific sectors,such as education and health, or forspecific protection issues, such as psychoso cial s upport or responding to the recruitment of children by armed forces and groups. Child rights programming differs from needs-based programming.The ne eds-base dapproach is likely to respond only to immediately apparent needs. The rights-based approach\"There is no summer camp for this year. We cannot get together with our friends any more. That is so sad.\" -Girl, 13, Iraq GIVING CHILDREN THE RIGHT START IN LIFE, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF WAR Research suggests that critical brain development related to intelligence occurs during the first three years of life. This process is influenced by achild's nutritional and health status, exposure to stimulation, and inter-actions with people and objects in his or her environment. A child'sexperiences in the first few years can therefore have a lifelong impact. Field experience and research conducted during the past few decades indicate that interventions to promote physical, intellectual and emotionaldevelopment in early childhood, par ticularly in times of stress, make a difference for young children and their caregivers, both immediately andover the long term. Early childhood development programmes can bothsupport caregivers and ensure the quality care needed for children to surviveand thrive. In situations of armed conflict, it is crucial to return children to a normal routine as quickly as possible. In such circumstances, the sur vival and development of young children tends to depend even more heavily on their mothers or other caregivers and the stability of the emotional bond theyforge. Emotional proximity to the caregiver, in fact, is equally important ashealth and other factors. Early childhood development inter ventions should always work within the target population's cultural constructs of childhood. Such interventions should aim to address the differing needs of young children, based on theirstage of development. It should take into account the effects of war on thewomen, families and communities on whom children depend. A variety ofapproaches can be used. They include parenting classes, community-basedcentres, preschool programmes, psychosocial suppor t, and early stimulation and play activities. Programmes involving these and other approaches to early childhood development have been used in conflict zones from Chad toLebanon and from the Balkans to Iraq. 106 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDseeks to create an 'enabling' environment that is conducive tochildren's overall well-being. Inaddition to encouraging practical actions and delivery of services, child rights programming is balanced with efforts to protect children againstabuse and exploitation, encouragetheir participation, build the capacityofinstitutions and systems, support community networks and hold authorities to account. The fact that children bring with them a multiplicity of experiencesand id entities must be reflected in howtheir ne eds are addressed. Programming that addresses only one experience - such as that of being a child mother or having been recruited into a fighting force - is likely to ignore the range of needs as well as the rights and individual capacities of each child. It would also tend to ignore the root causes of the child' scircumstances and might not prevent re-recruitment or other forms of exploitation. Taking a c ommunity-based approach. The 1996 Machel study asserted that \"children's well-being is best ensured through family andcommunity-based solutions ... [and] those sol utions w orkbest when they arebased on local cultures and drawn froman und erstanding o fchild development.\" Since that time, community-based approaches havebeen reinforced through experience. Building on existing communitystructures - including at the family, local and national levels - this approach aims to ensure that services and protection reach all children in a c ommunity.Evidence to date has shown that community-based programming is more appropriate to the context and more sustainable in benefits for war-affected children and families than t raditional, needs- based programming. Implementing community-based programming and protection means addressing m ultiple factors. Does the community have the capacity to identify and implement its ownresponse? Would involvement imply significant costs to already stretchedfamilies? I sthe c ommunitybeing asked to provide a basic service, such as health oreducation, which is typically the responsibility of the State? Is the participat ionofallmembers of the community being ensured, or are community 'leaders' , who may notrepresent the range of needs and capa- cities present in the community, the only interlocutors? These questions can often be addressed during programme design. The inherent flexibility of acommunity-based approach makes it an imp ortant tool in a response that fosters local ownership. The humanitarian community has lo ng d ebated whether it is best to target responses to those perceived toREINTEGRATION ASSISTANCE ROOTED IN FAMILY AND COMMUNITY As Save the Children's 2003 study 'Going Home' discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, children and their caregivers value reintegrationassistance that is rooted in the community. The study cautioned that the\"role of the child cannot be independent of the family and community.\" Other highlights of the study follow: /square6Expecting self-sufficiency of children is unrealistic. Children cannot be helped in isolation; they should be aided in concer twith their families. /square6Assistance must be oriented towards parents. If carried out in the presence of children and in conjunction with awareness-raising activities, it will improve parental care for all children. /square6Children want to evolve with their families, without being stigmatized. /square6Rather than emphasizing time in transit centres, reintegration programmes should give priority to social education and skills activitiesin the community. /square6Children emphasize that two or three activities, including education, are necessary at the same time for effective reintegration. 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 107be the most vulnerable or to provide assistance to the community as a whole. When it comes to children and young people, there is growing consensus that an inclusive approach best addresses the mix of needs faced byallthose aff ected by armed conflict. Inreality, attempts at targeting have sometimes fallen short, partlybecause it is difficult to measure vulne rability. Where certain children require assistance, it has been found that free access to a service may bemore acceptable to the community than visible aid for a specific group. In addition to broadening access, an inclusive approach to programming avoids stigmatizing anyone, including specific groups such as survivors ofsexual v iolenceor children formerly associated with armed forces or other armed groups. The Machel study also advocated foran ap proach involving multiple sectors, arguing that a range of factors - disease, malnutrition, over-crowding, and lack of food and clean water, as well as poor sanitation and inadequate shelter - all contribute tochild mo rtality in emergencies. The study cautioned that \"only a multi-sectoral approach to health and n utrition can protect young children.\" In the intervening years, the understanding of this approachhas expanded to embrace many other types of interventions, including those in volving education, early childhood development, water andEMERGENCY SPACES FOR CHILDREN 'Emergency spaces for children' arose to provide integrated support for children in emergencies where services were weakened or absent. The spaces are designed to offer a mixture of protection, non-formal education, early learning, psychosocial support and access to basic services, geared to a child's developmental age. This multi-sectoralprogramming approach supports children's well-being during and immediately after an emergency. Variations on the model, sometimes called 'child-friendly spaces' or just 'safe spaces', have been widely used since 1999 in places including Aceh Province in Indonesia, Afghanistan, Albania, Darfur (Sudan), Liberia, Sri Lanka, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Timor-Leste. They are intended to complement other mechanismsneeded to protect children in dangerous circumstances. Emergency spaces can safeguard children by providing aprotected area and adult-supervised activities. Involved adults tend to develop an awareness of risks to children and learn to create protective environments for them. Christian Children's Fund Uganda, for example, has organized emergency spaces for children aged three to six in a camp for internally displaced persons in the northern part of the country. Communities decided on relevant activitiesand selected adults to organize learning sessions and recreation. They also disseminated messages about basichygiene, nutrition and protection. A comparison of two camps that had and did not have emergency spaces forchildren showed that the children who had access to them were less likely to be harmed while left at home alone, werebetter prepared for school, less likely to fight, and more likely to be regarded as 'well' according to local norms. 257 Challenges to creating such spaces include the fact that children of primary school age typically receive better support than younger children and adolescents. Moreover, in some cultural contexts, the participation of either girls or boys lags significantly behind the other. The concept also needs to be expanded to better serve adolescents. Levels of quality control, community engagement and links with other protection processes also vary considerably . Nonetheless, experience has shown that the intervention's strengths can include flexibility, rapid start-up, the ability to scale up, low cost, adaptability to different contexts and utility in mobilizing communities. A next stepforward is to strengthen the evidence base regarding the implementation of emergency spaces for children anddevelop inter -agency guidelines on their use. 108 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDsanitation, HIV prevention, livelihoods, justice and child protection. Experience shows, for example, that the best early childhood development programmes deal holistically with physical, intellectualand e motional needs - all of which areinterrelated. Early childhood development programmes carried outduring e mergencies clearly demonstrateincreasedimpact when health, education, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene areaddressed simultaneously. In northern Uganda, adding stimulation and play activities in the children's early years tonutrition, health and rehabilitation programmes appeared to speed uprecovery among children affected byconflict. REMAINING GAPS Althoug hthere has been progress in developing and applying child rights approaches and programmingduring armed conflict, much remains tobe done. Authorities in affected countries cannot always be relied upontoprotect the rights of all childr en. Moreover, in times of crisis, humanitarian workers sometimes reverttoprogramming based on needs ratherthan o nchildren's rights. While the value of community- base d,inclusiveand m ulti-sectoral approaches is acknowledged, imple- mentation does not always follow.Agreed-upon standards are notalways respected, in particular bynew, less experienced actors in thehumanitarian field. During the years since the Machel study, responses have been constrained by additionalissues that have received limitedattention. These include the inability toscale up init iatives, cost-related barriers and concern for the security of humanitarian workers.Scaling up response. How to expand programmes across large and often insecure geographical areas has emergedas a key challenge in recent years. It isparticularly significant in view of the international community's growing focus on those who are internally displaced and who may not necessarily TAKING EMERGENCY HEAL TH INTER VENTIONS TO SCAL E258 Early experience and guidelines on health programming during emergencies have been largely limited to activities conducted in refugee camps. T oday, relief workers are beginning to adapt this experience to serve populationsdisplaced within their own countries as a result of armed conflict. Providing public health services over large geographic areas, often with poor infrastruc-ture, presents a challenge very different from operating in a refugee camp. No one agency can deal with such demands. To cover large areas requires even greater coordination and operational partnerships. Onesuccessful example is a nationwide measles vaccination campaign in Afghanistan that was carried out in 2002 and 2003. The campaign, which aimed to reach all children aged six months to twelve years, vaccinated more than 95 per cent of the target population. It may have contributed to saving 30,000 lives per year. This multi-agency initiative, involving UN agencies, NGOs, Afghan ministries of health and education along with religious leaders, among others, provides lessons for the future. 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 109110 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDbe living in camps. While the challenges are not unique to one sector, lessons from the health sector, as sho wnin the b oxon page 109, can provide insights. Eliminating cost barriers. The need to eliminate or reduce costs for access tobasic se rvicessuchas education and health in difficult environments is another common challenge. The tension is especially apparent insituations of ongoing armed conflict or a fragile peace. With key donors nowexplicitly stating that their policies do not support cost recovery,questions of how to finance these services are vital when the State itself has a limited budget. Moreover, mostprogrammes struggle with short-term funding that does not address thelong-term nature of securing child rights in areas affected by conflict. Preventing the targeting of aid workers. Another constraint is the fact that civilians and humani- tarian workers are increasingly the target of deliberate attacks during armedconflicts.Attacks on personnel in Afghanistan deprived certain populations of health services; others had limited access to education forlong periods of time. In Afghanistan, Somalia and the Balkans, military forces have played a prominent role in the response to humanitarian emergencies. This trend is expected toincrease, thus compromising the perception of impartiality of humanitar ian ag encies and the ir workers. All actors will need tograpple with these issues if there is to be progress in respecting, protecting and fulfilling children's rights in armed conflict situations. Extending good practice. Humani- tarian actors have a responsibility to build awareness among both stateand civil society representatives abouthuman rights and internationalhumanitarian law, child rights pro- gramming and int ernational develop- ment goals, as well as community- base d,inclusive and multi-sectoral programming. The State is the primar y'duty bearer' in protecting the r ights of children. But it often needs support in fulfilling this role, whetherthrough enhancing technical capacity, bolstering coordination mechanisms or providing additionalsour ces of funding. Moreover, to maintain cr edibilityand a dvance progress, international entities must demonstrate good practices in pro- grammes, policy and advocacy, and build a b odyofevidence to show the impact of their work. States themselves need to deliver on their promises. And there is an ongoing need for civil society and communities to engage in advocacy, protection of children and, at times, delivery of services. At all levels, moreefforts are needed to involve childrenand young people in a meaningful way. This means, in part, listening to their views and acting upon their priorities and recommendations. Democratic Republic of the Congo \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-2171/PirozziRECOMMENDATIONS As part of the 10-year review of the M achel study presented to the General Assembly in 2007, a number ofrecommendations were made to better care for and protect children in armed conflict. These centred on ensuring access to basic services, supporting inclusive reintegration strategies and ending gender-based violence. Core principles and approaches w ere highlighted, including an integrated package of basic services, removal of all barriers to access, including costs, and alig nme nt w ith g overnment systems. An inclusive approach emphasizing long-term sustainability and c ommunity-based approaches was regarded as key. Further recom- mendations to forward an agenda of bettercareand p rotection for children affected by armed conflict follow: 1. Build response around children's diversity. Relevant ministries, UN agencies and NGOs should ensure that al lresponses respect children's diverse needs and capacities, taking particular care to reach young childr enand a dolesc ents. The use of participatory assessments addressing age, gender and diversity shouldbewidelyadopted. 2.Mainstream child rights programming in emergencies. Members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)should fur thermainst ream c hild rights programming in responseto emergencies. They should continue to foster inclusive partnerships and collaboration at all levels to promote learningacross lo cations and o rganizations and identify proven and promising practices. 3. Ensure use of community- based, inclusive and multi- sectoral approaches. Humanitar ian a ctorsshould continue to apply community- based, inclusive and multi- sectoral approaches in their work, with a special focus on building a base o fevidence regarding impact. 4.Improve the quality and accountability of response.Agencies focused on assisting children and youth in armed conflict, in addition to ensuring application of existing standards and guid elines, should imp rove monitoring and evaluation in ways that promote greater learning,accountab ility and coordination. 5.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 111\"There are no trees to play under and no playground to go to.\" - Girl, 10, in a transit centre for internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka112 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDWar-affected children and their communities regard education as paramount. In countless assessments involving displaced populations,refugee leaders and community members have specifically identifiedschooling as an immediate need andapriority humanitarian intervention for their communities, even before food,water, medicine or shelter. 259 Since publication of the Machel studyin 1996, anumber of global initiatives ha veemerged to protectthe right to education. The MDGs and the Education for All commit- ments aim to ensure universal basic education of good quality. Although the momentum around these com- prehensive frameworks has increasedthe number of children with access to educational opportunities, childrenliving in conflict situations still make up a disp roportionate number of those out of school. Basedonavailable figures, the latest UNICEF r esear chshowsthatnearly 60 million children are not attending primary school in 33 countries affected by conflict.This represents 46 per cent of the childr enof primary school age living in these countries and two thirds of the total number of children out ofschool globally. While 10 conflict-affected countries are on track toachieveuniversal primary education by2015 (MD G2), 19 have made no p rogress at all. 260 In addition, it is certain that many out-of-school young peopleaged12 and old er are unable to return to school once the conflict has ended. Others who have completed their primary education and wish to enter or resume secondary school are unab le todo so. Children in conflict situations are often prevented from attending school because of school closures, lack of safety and security in or en route to school, family poverty, bureaucr atic obstacles or lack of access to the next level of education. Even when children are able to go to school, the quality of the educationtheyreceive is often poor. It is still common to see students sitting incramped conditions, with few booksor materials, listening to a teacherwho has very little professional training .Teachers themselves may besuffering from the trauma of war,unab le toprovide children with the psychosocial support they need. Particularly in emergency and post-crisis settings, the curriculum needs to be enriched with survival8.2 PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION Syrian Arab Republic \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0720/Noorani8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 113messages and life skills that promote health and safety, peace, humanrights and citizenship. On the other hand, crisis can also b ethe path t oopportunity. Rehabilitation efforts following an emergency can provide an opening to 'build back better' - that is, torebuild schools to a higher, child-friendlystandar dand to create environments that are clean, safe and inspir ing f orchildren. While the number of children without access to primary educationis stag gering, the situation worsens significantl yafter primary school: According to the UN High Com- missio ner for Refugees (UNHCR), 70 p er cent of 1.1 million camp- base dadolescents were not enrolled in formal secondary education in 2007, compared to 20 per cent of the 1.9 million children of primary school age who were out of school. Investment in secondary education is especially critical in post-conflict transitions. Like younger children, youth have psychosocial needs duringand aft erconflict that can be addressed inpart by quality education. Education also provides them withthe skills they need to work towardspeace and the development of their communities and c ount ries. The issues of gender and disability, whichhavepractical implications for all sectors, pose particular challenges for education in conflict and post-crisis environments. Girls' education lags behind that of boys in manydeveloping countries due to such factors as early marriage, exploitation by teachers, and traditional gender roles and responsibilities. During a crisis, the c onstraints on girls' education - most notably the lack of physicalsecurity - usually intensify. For disab ledchildr en, social institutions such as schools provide important environments for developing and promoting the ir capab ilities.But even in the best of times, children with disabilities are often 'forgotten'and further marginalized. WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The 1996 Machel study emphasized that access to quality education is critical to the welfare of children and young people in crisis situations and should be a key component of thehumanitar ian r esponse. The study highlighted children's need for continuity in schooling. It stressedthat the right to quality education does not lapse under circumstances of crisis or displacement, within the c ount ryorin refugee contexts. \"Support for the re-establishment and continuity of education must be aprioritystrategy for donors and NGOs in c onflic tand p ost-c onflict situations,\" the study pointed out. Not onlydid the st udyreasse rt that e ducationis a basic h uman r ight; it also stressed that the structure education provides can help meet children's psychosocial needs in the most extreme circumstances. Thestudyfound that education can play acritical role in restoring normalcy for younger children, as well as for adolescents who are entering an important developmental stage in their lives. The study further urged that education providers should better prepare teachers both to cope with the effects of stress on children and to impart vital survival information,such as details about the emergency, landmine safety and HIV prevention. The Machel study also observed that schools are often targeted duringwar, and it unequivocally stated that\"I was in fifth grade when the war came to my village 10 years ago. Since then, I have not gone back to school. I cannot go back now andsit in the same class; I am too old for that. But I still want to learn.\" - Young woman, 22, Liberia Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-0895/Furrer114 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDgovernments and the international community must protect educationalfacilities fr om attack. \"All possible efforts should be made to maintaineducation systems during conflicts,\"the st udysaid. \"The international community must insist that Government or non-state entitiesinvolved in conflicts do not targeteducational facilities and indeed promote active protection ofsuch services.\" CHANGES IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING In 1996 the field of education in emergencies was newly emerging.The very inclusion of educationwithin the Machel study provided an important impetus to this effort. The study had a significant influence on development of the field and has served as a strong foundation for the programming and advocacy work that has taken place during the decade since its publication. In a 2001 follow-up review to the General Assembly, Gra\u00e7a Machel extendedthis influence, stating, \"It is important that e ducation programmes be viewed as a central part of the continuum from emergency relief to reintegration and development.\" Moving from peace dividend to essential aspect of humanitarian aid. Education was once considered part of longer-term development and a p eacedividend, rather than an essential part of humanitarian aid. During recent years, however,education in emergencies has emerged as a st ructured, institutionalized and priorityfield.Much of this progress has resulted from the collaborative work of the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE). As a follow-up to the Education for All Dakar Conference in 2000, UNHCR, UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Org anizat ion(UNESCO) w ere mandat ed to reinforce preparedness and response in education during emergencies. This led to creation of INEE later that year. It has grown into an open global networkGLOBAL STANDARDS RAISE EDUCATION QUALITY IN EMERGENCIES Perhaps one of the most significant changes the field has seen since publication of the Machel study is the development of the INEE MinimumStandards for Education in Emergencies, Chronic Crisis and EarlyReconstruction, launched in late 2004. Modelled on the Sphere Minimum Standards, the INEE Minimum Standards were developed through a highly consultative and broadly based process. The standards articulate a minimumlevel of educational quality and access for those affected by crisis. Theyprovide a global framework for coordinated action, good practice andconcrete guidance to governments and humanitarian workers on issuesrelated to: community par ticipation; analysis; access and learning environ - ments; teaching and learning; teachers and other education personnel; and education policy and coordination. Used in more than 80 countries and translated into 14 languages to date, these standards have increased the quality, coordination and accountabilityof education interventions. Although more work is needed to institutionalizethe INEE Minimum Standards, they represent a major development in theapproach to education in times of crisis. The holistic framework they provideis par ticularly relevant in complex and chronic emergencies, where the effects of insecurity and violence on children and the education system are multifaceted.8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 115of more than 2,300 practitioners, students, teachers and staff from UN ag encies, non-governmental organizations, donors, governments and r esear chinstitutions. As a result of the original Machel study and the 2001 review, and subsequent advocacy work by INEE members and partners, education in emergencies is now considered arelief intervention that can be both life-saving and life-sustaining. Illustrating this shift was the December 2006 decision of the IASC Working Group to apply the cluster approach to the education sector. Subsequently the IASCeducation cluster was established. Co-led by UNICEF and the Save the Children Alliance, creation of the education cluster indicates recognition by the international community of education's critical role in humanitarian response. It also demonstrates willingness to support a strengthening of the humanitarian response capacity, leadership, accountab ility and partnership in the education sector. Education is also now recognized as a sector that can provide continuity across the relief-to-developmentcontinuum. Education programmingoften cuts across the traditional boundar ies o f relief, recovery, development and preparednessactivities. It can address the key issue of how to protect and insulatepeople and so cieties from the shock of crisis. Education practitioners and policymakers strive to ensure that recoveryafter crisis offers more than asimple return to the status quo. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE These new understandings and institutional developments haveinfluenced policy and practice, but it is clear that a degree of influencegoes both ways. Progress in such keyareas as gender strategies, community capacities, teacher compensation policies, back-to-school campaignsand links across sectors is illustrative.Becoming mo re gender sensitive. Humanitarian actors recognize that emergencies are experienceddifferently by girls and boys, women and me n.Formation of a Gender Working G roup within the IASC education cluster, along with the ongoing work of the INEE GenderTask T eam, has had two important results: It has ensured that education programming in emergenciesaddresses g enderissues from the outset, and that this responsiveness is reflected in efforts to raise resourcesand d evelop training and research. The United Nation Girls' Education Initiative also collaborates on gender and education in emergency efforts.GETTING GIRLS AND BOYS INTO SCHOOL IN SOUTHERN SUDAN In Southern Sudan, a major programme was launched in April 2006 to rebuild the education system and bring 1.6 million children into the classroom. The Go to School Initiative, supported by UNICEF, initially focused on enrolment. But it soon shifted to education quality as a means to encourage both girls and boys to stay in school. \"Often during armed conflicts, schools and other education institutions are closed for one reason or another. This has a negative impact on children and young people's state of mind.\" -Girls and young women, 13-20, Iraq116 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDGrowing gender awareness has revealed that the number of female teachers in a school is a key indicator of safety in the classroom. As a result, greater efforts are being made to raiseboth the stat us and the proportion of female teachers in crisis contexts. An example of good practice comes out of West African education programmes for refugees. Since it was not possibletorecruit a s ufficie nt number of adequately qualified women teachers,the International Rescue Committeedeveloped a transitional model of female classroom assistants in theregion. The assistants work in the classroom alongside their male counterparts while also completingtheir own teacher education. Broadening c ommunity participation. Some of the strongest feedback from users of the INEE Minimum Standardshas b een on the usefulness of guidance encouraging community participa- tionin al lphases o f programming foreducation. 261Humanitar ian actors and educational personnel are often unfamiliar with the broader roles that c ommunities can play.Consequently, emergency programming tends to be 'top down' . Typically, forexample, affected communities areasked to provide only manual labour suchas ground clearance and class- room construction. As the INEE guidelines point out, it is vital to build strong communityeducation committees and/or parent-teacherassociations through local training and advocacy. This is especially true w hen education systems lack resources and external communica- tions are poor. Active community andfamil ysupport can enhance resilience, so sc hooling can c ontinue despite securityor economic problems that interrupt the normal functioning of the e ducation system. Ensuring adequate compensation for teachers. Alooming threat to education worldwide, but especially in conflict-affected and fragile States, is a p rojected shortfall of 18 million primary school teachers in the coming decade.262Ensuring that all teachers are compensated appro-priately is ultimately the role of the government. However, in circum-stances of emergency, fragility orconflict, the government may beunable or unwilling to carry out this role b ecause o fweakened capacity, damag ed infrastructure, limited budgets,breakd own of mechanisms to disburse funds and the movement of refugee populations beyond state jurisdiction. As a result, the inter- national community and localCOMMUNITIES IN IRAQ HELP RESTART EDUCATION Working in Iraq with people who had been internally displaced, an inter- national non-governmental organization (NGO), anonymous for security reasons, has had positive results using the INEE Minimum Standards relating to community par ticipation. The NGO facilitated the formation of a local Community Education Committee, and the two groups worked together to rehabilitate schools and improve children's access to them. Following theguidance in the INEE standards, particular effort was made to ensure thatthe committee included both men and women as well as members ofinternally displaced and host communities. The Community Education Committee was instrumental in rehabilitating schools, providing security advice and negotiating fair rates with localcontractors. Once the schools were completed, the committee identifiedsecurity as a major obstacle to girls' attendance. They subsequently agreedonproactive measures to ensure girls' safety by arranging for them to walk to school in groups or be accompanied by an escort.

Securing a dequate, consistent funding f orteachers' salaries is a critical problem. But there are many othe rchallenges to be addressed in estab lishing and sustaining effective systems for teacher compensation. T o address some of them, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children Alliance, Women's Commission for Refugee Women and C hildren, UNESCO, UNHCR and UNICEF are working together to develop guidance notes on com-pensating teachers in situations ofdispla cement, early reconstruction and fragile States. Jump-starting education through back-to-school campaigns. School attendance campaigns - involving majo radvocacy and communication efforts to mobilize donors, govern- ments,partner organizations and affected populations - have helped jump-start education in countries facing conflict. First launched in Rwanda f ollowing the 1994 genocide, back-to-school initiatives have becomeakey strategy to restore education in emergency situations and beyond.Typically led by a ministry of education through the support ofUNICEF and others, they have beencarried out in places as diverse asAfghanistan, Angola, Burundi, Grenada, Liberia, the Occupied Palestinian T erritory, Pakistan, Southern Sudan and Timor-Leste. Inrecent years, multi-phase initiatives - back to school, go to school and stay in school campaigns - have been implemented in countries including Uganda, where they aim tofosterlong-term commitment to building sustainable education systems. Back-to-school campaignsrespond tothe imme diateneed to restore education after a crisis while incorporating a longer-term perspective.Addressing education holistically. The establishment of an IASC education cluster has reinforced the links across sectors, which is vital in addressing children's needs holist ically. An inter-sectoral approach to education is especially critical in conflict and post-conflictcontexts because it can provide a safe spaceforlearning - o ffering physical protection against exploitation and harm as well as a sense of normalcy and psy choso cial s upport. Because o fthese c haracteristics, schools have also become a focus for REVIVING EDUCATION IN AFGHANISTAN After the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Government, working with local communities, non-governmental organizations and the international community, began rebuilding the country's education system. As schools across the country opened their doors in March 2002 for the first time in years, UNICEF mounted one of the largest back-to-school campaigns in its history. The campaign succeeded in bringing more than 3 million children, one third of them girls, into the classroom. The number of students has continued to increase, despite some recent violence. By 2007, an estimated 6million Afghan children were enrolled in school. 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 117delivering other important services, such as providing food, an area in which the World Food Programme has been active. Children's nutrition can be improved through school feeding programmes and a 'food for education' strategy in emergencies. Such interventions have proved particularly challenging, however, and must be carefully managed toensure that they are appropriate in aparticular context as well as sustainable. Schools, whether permanent or temporary, are also places where children can receive safe and reliable health services, advice on hygiene andlife-saving information. Safe waterand sanitation facilities for both girlsand b oysarean esse ntial aspect of health y, protective environments. Providing a safe place for education in emergencies not only reduces children's vulnerability totrafficking and other forms of explo itation; it also engages them in positive alternatives to military recruitment and involvement in gangs and drugs. In addition, it provides a place for identifying children with special needs, such as those d ealing with trauma or family separation, and facilitates their social integration. Educationin camp environments helps recreate elements of a social structure that children may have lost. At the outset of the emergency and incollaboration with the camp manage- ment, it is important to identify areasfor schools, play and other forms ofrecreation, and child-friendly spaces.Guidance on such standards as adequatesanitat ionis important to ensure safe and protective environments. School she lterscan b eanything from tents or other temporary structures to reconstructed education infrastructure. But they must be carefully planned to ensure that theycomply with minimum standards for size, safety of construction, lighting, and other essential elements. REMAINING GAPS While progress has been made since 1996, much remains to be done to promote education during emergencies. Manyofthe a ctions recommended in the Machel study still require concerted effort on the part of Member States and the international community to ensure that the educational rights of children affected by conflict are met. Preventing the targeting of schools. Despite the normative frameworks that protect educational facilities in times of conflict, a lack of systematic effort to monitor and address vio- lations severely undermines the right to education of children affected byconflict. According to a recent UNESCO st udy, the frequency of attacks on schools, students, teachersand other education personnel is rising. While accurate global figures for the numbers of teachers and students kil ledeachyear are not availab le, nationally reported assassi- nations, bombings and burnings of school building shaverisen dramati- callyduring r ecent years. 263 The monitoring and reporting mechanism f orSecurityCouncil Resolution1612 f ocuses specifically on six grave violations that, in line with the Machel recommendations, include attacks on schools. Its current scope and capacity are limited and\"No new schools are opened, the old ones are closed. Parents don't have money to send their children.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 119efforts should be made in improving, monitoring, reporting and respondingto this grave situation. Financing education in emergencies. The Machel study calledondonors to give priority tosupporting the re-establishment and continuation of education inconflict and post-conflict situations.More than a decade later, however, donorsstilltend to prioritize more traditional emergency sectors. And evenwhen education is part of the humanitarian response, funding allocations fall far below what is required. Arecent analysis by the International Save the ChildrenAlliance showed that conflict-affected fragile Stat es received only 18 per cent of total education aid from 2003 to 2005, though they account foraround half of the world's out-of- school children. 264Middle-income countries received 49 per cent of aid, while 33 per cent went to low-income countries. 265 Furthermore, although awareness is increasing about the need to support education in humanitarian crises, it remains one of the least fund edsectors. In 2006, the education sector received only 1.1 per cent of humanitarian assistance, although it represented at least 4.2 per cent ofhumanitarian needs. 266Only five donor governments explicitly refer to education as part of their humani-tarian p olicy :Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway and Sweden. 267Some governments are now committing substantial funding foreducating children in countries affected by conflict. But despite a number of pledges by the Group ofEight industrialized nations, a huge shortfall remains in funding for education in emergencies in terms ofmeeting the MDGs and Education for All commitments. Funding mechanisms such as the CentralEmergency Response Fund and theConsolidated Appeals Process, which are accessed through the IASC cluster system, provide alternative channelsforeducation funding in conflict- affected and fragile states. However, more flexible financing mechanismsare needed, along with sustained political will behind the funding. Thegoal is to meet short-term needs while supporting long-term development of systems and capacity. Expanding educational oppor- tunities for older children and out-of-school youth. The Machel study recommended giving special emphasis to appropriate educationalactivities for adolescents and youthaffected by conflict. It also called for promoting secondary school access and providing learning opportunitiesforout-of-school youth. Nevertheless, secondary and tertiary education for refugees and Rwanda \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-1387/Pirozzi120 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDinternally displaced populations have been grossly underfunded inrecent years. Making matters worse is a major gap in the availability ofteachers at all levels. Post-primaryeducation is nearly always fee-based, and families aff ected by conflict are oftenunable to meet these costs. Soevenwhen, against all odds, childr enaffected by conflict are able tocomple teprimar yeducation, many find that a ccess to secondary school is extremely limited. Creating opportunities for adolescents and youth who have not completed primary school alsoremains a challenge. Some inter-national NGOs now offer accelerated learning programmes and youthactivities designed to provide relevant literacy, numeracy, life skills and vocational training. Butgiven the large youth populations in man ycountries enduring conflict, these p rogrammes are severely limit edin sc ope. Building a r eliab le database. Final ly, there is a gap in the data pertaining to education in situations of crisis and early recovery. Many agencies are collecting data, includingthe UNESCO Education for All coordination team, UNICEF and key international NGOs. But challenges remain in coordinatingand systematizing data collection in many contexts. Developments in the IASC education cluster will help address gaps in the unif ormity and timeliness of data collection. These advances includepreparation of a common needs assessment format and toolkit as well as a comprehensive moni- toring and evaluation system. The resulting quantitative data and strategic studies will aid advocacy as well as broad programme learning and better response. Also ne eded is more evidence- base dresear chonthe v alue and impa ct of education in countries affected by conflict. Particularly challenging is collecting data on the role e ducation plays in mitigating community and state fragility and strengthening social cohesion.Practitioners and academics should develop research strategies that include longitudinal studies and address the preventive role that education can play in reducing conflict and the impact of crisis. RECOMMENDA TIONS The education sector has developed substantially during the decade sincethe Machel study, yet there are signi-ficant challenges ahead. The 10-year review presented to the UN General Assembly during 2007 recommendedaccess to a continuous, integrated Islamic Republic of Iran \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-2459/Nooranipackage of basic services - including education - aligned with government systems. It called for more investment in building capacities and for donors to ensure early and multi-year funding, both key priorities for education. The importance of secondary and tertiary education was specifically highlighted. The study called for elaboratingpreventive approaches to conflict, including education. The following are priority actions for education in emergencies, chronic crises and early recoveryin the coming years: 1. Ensure preparedness, rapid educat sustaine the r ight toeducation by providing continuous schooling before, during and after times of crisis. Donor governments should create bridgingstructures to link the risk reduction, preparedness, humanitarian and development arms of their education assistance programmes. 2. Improve coordination and capacit ybuilding. Donors, governments, and humanitarian and d evelopment actors should increase coordination through participat ionin global fr ame- works, such as the IASC education cluster, INEE and, at national levels especially, sectoral mechanisms. Theyshould e nhance profession- alism in education, ensuring adequate the develop- ment of 'surge capacity' , gapanalysis, and creation of profes- sional tools and training. 3. Strengthen standards and accountability. Donors, bilateral and m ultilateral organizations, and the humanitarian community should p roactively support imple- mentationof the global Minimum Standards and those developed at the nat ional level, including within the IASC e ducation cluster. They should develop an effective monitoring, reporting andevaluation system based on thesestandar ds,as wellas covering attacks against schools, as part of the Resolution 1612 monitoringand r eporting me chanism. 4.Provide adequate and consistent funding. Member States and donor governments shouldincrease the level and consistency of education funding for conflict- affected and fragile States. A sub- stantial portion of new education funding for basic education should go to conflict-affected fragile States. 5. Improve data collection and analysis. Humanitarian actors should improve the timelycollection and analysis ofeducationdata t odemonstrate the mag nitudeofan emergency, guide response and measure its impact. Further, more systematicdata c ollection is needed on the grave problem of attacks on schools. Longitudinal studies areneeded to assess education's role in c onflic tprevention and peacebuilding. /square6 KEY RESOURCES K. Tomasevski, Education Denied, Zed Books, London, 2003.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 121\"This is a year of ignorance.\" - Young woman, 16, Occupied Palestinian Territory122 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThe quality and accessibility of health care for war-affected children hasimproved since the 1996 Machelstudy. In fact, the entire technical field dealing w ith c hild health in conflict has become more professional in terms of guidelines, trainingopportunities and improvements in the evidence base of what does and d oes not w ork. Yetitisameasure of how much workremains that 9 of the 20 countries with the highest under-five child mortality rates have also been affectedbyrecent conflict. 268Achievement of the health-r elated MDGs is unlikely unless the h umanitar ian r esponse is scale dup dramatically and sustained, especially in protracted emergencies where high mortality rates persist over several years. Since conflicts often occur in areas where children already suffer from malnutrition and ill health, including c ommunicable diseases such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, malaria and measles, these ailments continue to be a major causeofmortality. 269Infact, available data suggest that these common childhoodillnesses are responsible for the majorityof childhood deaths in conflictsituations, in some instances out- numb ering d eaths dir ectly linked to conflict by a factor of 10 to 1. 270 Lowering these r ates requires rapid delivery of proven child survival interventions. The scale of theseefforts is particularly relevant because armed conflict often involves majorpopulation displacements over large geographic areas. Appropriate distribution of services is also vital if children and other vulnerable groups that la ckaccess to health services are to be reached. Inkeeping with a human rights- base dapproach, strategies to engage affected children should be considered thoroughlyin designing health programmes. Doing so will ultimately increase the use of services. WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The Machel study emphasized disparities between the horrific situations faced by children during armed conflict and the promise of article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates that children have a right to thehighest standar dof health and medical care available. For children affected by war, the reality is grim.As the Machel study pointed out: \"Thousands of children are killed every year as a direct result of fighting, fromknifewounds, bullets, bombs and landmines, butmany more die from malnutrition and disease caused orincreasedbyarmedconflicts.... Manydie as a dir ectresult utrition, while othe rs,compromised by malnutrition, become unable to resist common childhood diseases and infections.\" In assessing the delivery of health services, the Machel study stressed theneed to protect health workers and limit the disruption of services, including preventing the destruction of health facilities and the breakdown of supply lines. Italso hig hlighted security on roads and access routes needed toensure accessibility to such services. The M achelstudy's specific recommendations for relief workers involved in nutrition and health were aime dat estab lishing links b etween emergency interventions and long- term development programmes. CHANGES IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING T aking life-saving interventions to scale. The health community agrees that a limited set of proven interventions, taken to scale, can drastically reduce child mortality, even in areas facing conflict.271These interventions are increasingly carried outin emergency contexts, aimed at reducing child illness and death. The intervention package includes measles imm unization; vitamin A supplements; of prevention, early erand sanitat ion;appropriate nillnesses rehydration salts and zinc for diarrhoea, artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria and appropriate antibiotics for respiratory infections); standardized8.3 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND MANAGING DISEASE8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 123guidelines; and promotion of hygiene and correct infant and childfeeding practices, including exclusivebreastfeeding. These interventions have become mainstays of any emergency r esponse. Promoting multi-sectoral approaches. Advances have also beenmadein forging approaches that combine actions from diverse sectors. Public health, nutrition, food aid, water, sanitation, education and other relief programmes are now accepted as multiple elements in an emergency response because none o fthemis effective in reducing morbidity and mortality without the othe rs.It is common, for instance, todistribute vitamin A supplements and deworming medications during immunization campaigns, as took place during the 2004 measles imm unization campaign in Darfur. Delivering health services effectively. Progress has also been madein ap propriate delivery of child-health int erventions in countries facing conflict with inadequate or inaccessible health services. The right mix of facility-based and community-based services is critical to ensuring wide coverage of life-saving interven- tions.Community-based delivery may includecampaig ns to offer a package of services - such as immunization and vitamin A supplementation - at regular intervals. For example,Ethiopia's Enhanced Outreach Strategydelivers a package of services twice ayear, accompanied by community mobilization efforts. It is widely recognized that community-based activities are the futureof public health implemen- tation in resource-poor settings. Moreover, establishing community-based health activities prior to aconflict may help reduce the harm tochildr en's health should a conflict arise.This approach also contributes toemergency preparedness. However, emergency interven- tions will only reach children whenthe se rvices provided are appropriate tothe cir cumstanc es and accepted and und erstood by beneficiaries. 272 For this reason, active participation of key community members is critical. In Afghanistan, engaging religious leaders and using mosques as vaccination posts for a nationwide measles campaign contributed to the high coverage achieved in 2002.273 Inman ycountries affected by conflict, national governments have limit edcapacity to provide health services. This remains the case despitegrowing recognition that strengthening health systems is critical, especiallyfollowing protracted conflicts. Inresponse, such groups as the GA VIAlliance (formerly the Global Alliance forVaccines and I mmunization) have relaxed their application and co-financing cr iteria forfunding support targeted to strengthening health systems. The changes encourage fragile States with weak capacity to apply for these funds.Building robust health systems is a long-term investment. Other strategies have also been tried, including performance-based contracting. Under this approach non-state entities such as NGOscontract to deliver a package of services,and their performance is monitored using a predefined set ofindicat ors. Such strategies can leadtowidecoverage of life-saving interventions. They also enable governments to focus on theirnormative responsibilities, such as planning, policy setting, financing and regulation, rather than on service delivery. Although further evaluation of this approach isrequired, preliminary results from experiences in Afghanistan and Cambodia are promising. 274 PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Controlling major diseases. Since the 1996 Machel study, progress has been made in disease control among populations affected by conflict, with newinterventions available for use in comple xemergencies. Malaria, for example, can be prevented and managed throughusing mo reeffective medica- tions (ar temisinin-base uito nets and indoorspraying. Diarrhoea can be treated using oral rehydration salts in combination with zinc supplements. Measles was once a devastating killer of children in emergencies.\"Our only hope is to pray that we do not get sick. If you do, only God can save you from dying.\" -Young man, 18, Sierra Leone124 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDBut it is no longer a major cause of death in camps for refugees and the internally displaced since measles vaccination has become a priority insuch settings. In non-camp emergency situations, measles still kills many children. Nevertheless, several measles vaccination campaigns have beensuccessful lycarriedoutnationwide or over large geographical areas in conflict situations, including in Afghanistan in 2003 275and Southern Sudan in 2006-2007.276 Tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS were ignored for many years during complex emergencies. However, the importance of addressing these scourges, even inthe midst o fconflictis now recognized because HIV is endemic to a number of conflict-affected areas. Progress has also been made in negotiating periods of peace and security with warring factions so that services can be provided to populations isolated by conflict.The successful negotiation of 'zones ofpeace' and 'days of tranquillity' have made it possible to conduct campaig ns ag ainst p olio and dracun- culiasis (Guinea worm disease), for example, in countries including Afghanistan, the Sudan and Uganda. Making reproductive health an integral par tof the emergency response. The M achel study advocated awide reproductive health agenda covering both men and women and placing special emphasis on girls.This challenged the assumption that reproductive health was the responsi- bility of development programmes rather than a priority at the onset of comple xemergencies. Reproductive health is no wan int egral par tof an emergency response. The minimum initial service package, which includes condoms, universal precautions to prevent the spread of HIV , clinical management of rape and designationof a reproductive health coordinator,has b eenamajo radvance in camp settings. This is well outlined in the inter-agency Reproductive Health in RefugeeSituations Manual, currently being r evised. 277 Setting technical standards. In recent years, a number of inter-agency guid elines have been developed to provide benchmarks and guide stake- hold ersin responding to malaria, AIDS and other health issues. These guidelines include: Malaria Control in Complex Emergencies: An inter- agency handbook (2005); Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations: Aninter-agency Mental (2007); and the IASCGuidelines for HIV/AIDS Interventions in Emergency Settings (2004). Along w ith the Sphere Project's minimum standards for health services in emergencies, these guidelines have contributed to more effective and standar dized approaches. Since most were developed through an inter-agency process, they have the support of a majority of stakeholders and aretherefore widely used. Many in the field of health in emergencies are trying to document experiences and lessons in a more systematic manner. Journals areencouraging submission of articlesaddressing health issues in emergencies,suchas The L ancetseries o ncomplex emergencies in 2004. Some UN agencies and NGOs ha ve also developed books and guidelines on appropriate health responses inemergencies, such as M\u00e9decins Sans F ronti\u00e8res' 1997 publication, Refugee Health: An approach to emergency situations, and UNICEF's Eme rgency Field Handbook. A guide forUNICEF staff, published in 2005. Anumber of new textbooks on the subject highlight child health needs in these settings. Given that the first textbook on refugee health was onlypublished in 1983, this is a major accomplishment. Other tools for improved response. Inlate2005, when IASC introduced the cluster approach as a part of thehumanitarian reform process, childhealth was a core focus area in thehealth cluster. This places child health needs fir mlyonthe ag enda of actors responding to health in emergencies. Italso e nhanc es coordinat ion and complementarities among partners. The health cluster is developing tools and guidelines to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 125emergency humanitarian response. In addition to a multi-sectoral assessment tool to ensure a more consistent approach, other aids to identify gaps in health r esponse and map health actors are under development. Efforts are also under way to improvehealth stat istics through uniform and timely processes to collect, validate and disseminate critical data. The IASC H ealth and Nutrition Tracking Service is expected to address gaps in this very importantarea. Although it is still too early to assess the impact of these tools, they will eventually be evaluated. REMAINING GAPS Despite more than a decade of progress in providing health care to children affected by conflict, a number of gaps remain. In particular,'going to scale' with a package of proven, cost-effective interventions and sustaining them in areas ofprotracted conflict remains a challenge. The constraints include lack of adequate financing, insecurity and difficult a ccess,and limit ed numb ers of qualified staff. Areas such as chronic diseases, neonatal health and me ntal health also ne ed moreattention. Moreover, current emergency thresholds ne edtobereviewed to determine w hether they are relevant in today's emergency settings. If not,they should be revised to meet newrealities. This goes hand in hand withthe need to improve data collectionas well as dissemination and imple- mentation of guidelines. T aking proven interventions to scale. Asnewtechnologies become available, the humanitarian health community must continue toinnovate to make them available tomore people. A number of newvaccines - f orHib, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus and cholera - are nowavailable and may have major applications in the future for reducing morbidity and mortalityassociatedwith pneumonia and diarrhoea, the top two causes of childho oddeath. Community management of common childhood illnesses and therapeutic feeding have often been used in stable settings. But these techniques are now being introduced in areas caught up in complex emergencies, such as northern Uganda. Other proven interventions with potential for broader use include clean d elivery of babies, and antenatal steroids and zinc supplementation totreat severe diarrhoea. But the human resources to carry out suchinterventions - especially finding theright mix of health-care workers -remains a key challenge. Addressing chronic diseases. The humanitar ian c ommunityhas ma de alimited response so far to the threat of chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and AIDS and TB as well as to non-infectious chronic diseases suchas asthma and rheumatic heart disease. Although guidelines are now availableto implement HIV and TB controlprogrammes in emergencies, they are stillnot sy stematically used. Promoting neonatal health. Failure to safeguard the health of newbornsduring crises is increasingly recognizedas a cause o fmortalityand morbidity. This r equires greater programmatic and r esear chattention during the coming years. Preventing and treating a range ofpsychosocial disorders. Mental and so cial asp ects of health can be dramatically altered by conflict. Among the problems are risks to social health, including social rela- tionships; distress or absence of well-being; mild to moderate mental disorders (including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder); severe mental disorders (psychosis, conversion, severe depression); and hazardous alcohol and substance use. Addressing theserequires a multi-sectoral response, including preventive and curativehealth care. Removing barriers to access. Recognitionhas been growing of the cr itical need to remove barriers that hind erchildr enfromaccessing services. One such barrier is cost, and every effort must be made to ensure that services are accessible and affordable. Abolishing user fees Mozambique \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-2234/Pirozzi126 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDduring a conflict, when populations are more vulnerable due to loss of livelihoods, has proved successful inincreasing access to health services.Making this policy shift requires careful consideration of the consequences - without sufficient resources, services could b einterrupted. Another challenge is ensuring that formal user fees are not replaced by informal or 'underthe table' fees. Responding in a timely manner. Abroader range of triggers needs to be considered to mount a timely emergency response. The crude mortality rate threshold of one death per 10,000 people per day hascontributed decisively to defining the acute phase of a complex emergency. 278 This threshold was not appropriate, however, in defining an emergency in a middle-income country such as Kosovo. Filling gaps in data collection. Gaps remain in the availability of data onbasic health indicators in complex emergencies. Many agencies are collecting data in the field, includingM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in theNiger and the International Rescue Committee in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Others are compiling a vailable data for easy access and use, such as a database on complex emergencies establishedby the Center for Research on theEpidemiolo gyof Disasters. But challenges remain in systematically collecting, interpreting and usingdata for programmatic decision- making in al lemergency contexts. Making technical guidelines more accessible. Since the 1996 Machel study, many effective guidelines have been designed, but some health-care workers find them difficult to use.279 Evidence-based guidelines should belocally adapted for health-care workers who don't have a high levelof technical expertise; in most cases,local health-care workers provide thedirect care to children during armed conflict. New guidelines are also neededfor managing asphyxia, prematurityand infections in neonates, for physicaltrauma in young children, and forfinding and t reating TB in c hildr en. Enc ouraging children's participation. Final ly, children's health problems, especially in emergencies, cannot be resolved by technical services alone.Health interventions need to reflectan understanding of how children themselves cope with armed conflict. Childr en, particularly those who are older and attending school, need to be fully involved in their health and that of their community. RECOMMENDA TIONS Health services in emergencies and during r ecovery a well-established humanitarian response. Recommen- dations fr omthe 10-year strategic review presented to the UN General Assembly in 2007 reinforce this focus.They call for a proven, integrated package of basic services - including health - imple mentedon a wide scale. The review stipulated the needtoensure safe and unhindered access and delivery of humanitarian assistance to all children. It also calledfor investing in building capacity and knowledge acquisition and managementas wellas ensuring that appropriate operations research is conducted and documented, disseminated andapplied. Additionally, the review Kenya \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0231/Cranstonrecommended strengthening monitoring and reporting; these activities should include informationon all factors affecting children,and the data should b edisag gregated byageand se x.The following actions should be a priority in complex emergencies to mitigate the effects on child health: 1. Provide rapid and appropriate child-survival interventions. Working with Member States and other key stakeholders, humanitarian actors shouldensure rapid implementation of apackage of evidence-based child survival interventions targeting the major causes of morbidity and mortality. These should beappropriate to the context and provided at an appropriate scale in a coordinated manner with high coverage. 2. Continue development of guidelines and capacity building. The humanitarian health com- munity, including the IASC healthcluster, should continue to develop and update user-friendly guide- lines to ensure effective and stan-dardizedapproaches. Since health and r elatedresponses in complex emergencies require highly skilled personnel, human resources capa-city(both national and interna- tional) needs further development. 3. Explore and apply new health technologies. Health personneland researchers should continue to explore new technologies and innovative delivery strategies for conflict-affected settings.As new technologies becomeavailab le,donorsshould support their application in complex emergencies and ensure they are independently evaluated. Lessons learned in the processshould also be documented.Humanitar ian actors should invest in operational research,focusing o nkey strategic areas wherethereis ina dequate evidence and knowledge. 4. Ensure timely collection and analysis of data. Humanitarianactors should ensure that data, disaggregated by age and sex, arecollected and analysed in a timely manner. This is important in demonstrating the magnitude of anemergency,guiding an ap propriate response, measuring the impact of the response and advocating for resour ces.Systematic, continuous data collection is needed to monitor the health of affected populat ions,especially children. 5.Commit adequate and consistent funding. Donors should provide increased andsustained financing of humanitar- ian health r esponses focused on children in complex emergencies. /square6 KEY RESOURCES Inter-Agency Standing Committee, 'Health Cluster Working Group', <www.humanitarianinfo.org/iasc/content/cluster/health/default.asp?bodyID=20&publish=0>.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 127\"Every week a woman dies in childbirth on the road to the hospital.\" - Young woman, 19, Liberia Armed conflict can have a devastating impact on human nutrition by threatening livelihoods and com-promising food security, health and the ability of caregivers to provide for the young. During complex emergencies the prevalence of acutemalnutrition is typically high, specifi-callywast ing, nutritional oedema and micr onutrient deficiency diseases. The situation can worsen if people are forced to rely on food rations lacking in vitamins and minerals, as demonstrated by the 2001 outbreaksofscurvy in Afghanistan and pellagra in Angola. 280Of the 143 million children under age five who are underweight in the developing world, 98.5 million are living in emergency situations.281 The le velof acute malnutrition in many conflict settings is alarming:Ofthe 24 c ountries with national wast ing le vels ab ove the 'critical threshold' of 10 per cent, 10 are affected by armed conflict (among the 33 c ount ries list edin tab le 2 o n page 27). These include the Sudan (with a wasting rate of 16 per cent),Chad and Sri Lanka (14 per cent) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepal (13 per cent). 282 The lat est data s uggest that maternal and child undernutritioncontributes significantly to child morbidity and mortality in complex emergencies. It dramatically increases fatalities among children and women suffering from common illnesses, such as malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia. And it was one of the primary causes ofdeath in children under five in camps in northern Uganda 283as well as in the Democratic Republic ofthe C ongo. 284 WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID Both the 1996 M achelstudy and the 2001 r eview emphasized the effect of conflic tonchild n utrition as an area that cr iedoutforgreater attention and action. Similarly, both reports specifically advocated for continued access to affected children through 'days of tranquillity' . Negotiatedceasefires during such days provide opportunities for services that include vaccinations and other health interventions, child-based needs assessments, food and nutritional support, and dissemination of information on child rights. CHANGES IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING W orking under the framework of pub lic nutrition. Understanding of malnutrition has deepened since 1996. The focus has moved from the individual to the larger population and fr omanarrowsetof interventions to a broad-based, problem-solving approach known as 'public nutrition' .285 Many of the achievements in managing child maln utrition in conflict have been made under this framework. Public nutrition addresses malnu- trition in complex emergencies by combining an analysis of nutritional risk and v ulne rability with action- oriented strategies involving policies, programmes and capacity develop- ment. This approach, which combines both nutritional and public health interventions, has proved to be especially relevant in complex emergencies, when insecurity and violence have multidimensional effects on child nutrition. Managing malnutrition holistically. Chang es in manag ing maln utrition reflect growing awareness of the importance of gender and child8.4 SAVING LIVES THROUGH SOUND NUTRITION 128 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDMyanmar \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0375/Dean\"Our parents have lost their livelihood, and for us this means that we don't get food every day, that we are hungry sometimes.\" - Boy, 14, Sri Lanka 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 129protection issues; psychosocial support and other care practices;and support for food security andlivelihoods. Using this holistic approach toprevent and treat severe malnutri- tion in conflict has brought a number of improvements: It has enhancedprospects for children, helped protectand develop the self-esteem and carepractices of mothers, and provided astronger link between immediate hungerrelief and long-term strategies for sustainable development. The effectiveness of integrated programmingcan b eseenin Action Contre la Faim's nutritional programmes in Afghanistan, Darfur (the S udan) and S outhern Sudan, which combine therapeutic feeding with a basic package of care practices and mental health activities. Devising new strategies to reach dispersed populations. Reaching internally displaced persons, who are likelyto be dispersed across insecure areas, presents an additional challenge in humanitar ian assistance. Compared to working in a traditional refugee campenvironment, providing services to displaced and dispersed populationsis often logistically difficult becauseof restricted access. The result can below rates of coverage and effectiveness. Insuchsituations,traditional nutrition programmes and protocols may not beappropriate. New strategies may be needed, such as decentralized services, reliance on communityvolunteers and locally based staff, and enhanced operational coordination.Such strategies are now being tried out by GOAL in north-west Sudan andDarfur, among other organizations. 286 But it is clear that further work and experience sharing is needed. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE More reliance on community-based manag ement of malnutrition. For many years the management of severeacutemaln utrition relied on inpatient facilities kno wnas the rapeutic feeding centres. In the 1990s, experience from several humanitarian emergencies demonstrated that this model was largely ineffective. 287NGO f eeding centres established in response to the famine in S outhern Sudan in 1998, for example, were able to reachonly a small proportion of children suffering from this acute form of malnutrition. 288 Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition is an innovative approach to treating the majo rityofthese children at home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods. It has consistently achieved recovery rates of about 75 per cent, which are well within international humanitarian standar ds,and has increased coverage in emergency se ttingsbyas m uch as 70 per cent.289By 2006, more than 25,000 children with severe acute maln utritionand more than 130,000 children with moderate acute malnu- trition were successfully treated using the community-based approach incomplex contexts, including those of Chad and Darfur.290 In these places community-based management of severe acute malnu- tritionis being promoted by district- level ministries of health, which provide a platform for scaling upprogrammes. And UNICEF, incooperation with other organizations,is facilitat ing the d evelopment of national guidelines for managing severe acute malnutrition that include community-based approaches in various countries. or worsen during an emergency. This can happen due to loss o flivelihoods or food crops, interruption of food supplies, diarrhoeal diseases (which cause nutrient losses) and infectious diseases (which suppress the appetite while increasing the ne edfor micronutri- ents to help fight illness). For these reasons, it is essential to ensure that the micronutrient needs of peopleaffected by complex emergencies are adequately met. The World HealthOrganization (WHO), UNICEF andthe World Food Programme (WFP)have issued a joint statement on preventing and c ontrolling micro- nutrient deficiencies in populations affectedbyemergencies through the use of multiple vitamin and mineral supplements for pregnant and lactating women and for children aged 6-59 months. 291130 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDT aking gender into account. Insecu- rity can create risks that have different effects on women, girls, men and boys, so it is crucial to understand how gender issues affect nutritional status and programming. This helps in promoting interventions that enable women to continue to care for theirinfants and young children, and it ensures that children benefit from emergency int erventions. 292Along with othe ragencies and NGOs, WFP has increased its commitment to giving women direct access to andcontrol over food aid. They are also encouraging w omen to participate in all stages of an intervention - fromanalysing a problem and designing a solution to managing and monitoring the resulting action. 293This has improved targeting of aid and appropriate use of it within the household. The 2001 review of the Machel study highlighted sexual violence as a defining characteristic of contempo- raryconflict. This is attributed to the breakdown of social values and community structures, weakened response and p revention mechanisms, and significant population movements that typically accompany conflicts. In planning nutritional assistance, therefore, guidelines have been established to ensure that suchprogrammes do not inadvertently increase r isks f or women and girls. These ar eoutline din a 2005 document prepared by the IASC Task Force on Gender, 'Guidelines forGender-based Violence Interventionsin Humanitarian Emergencies:Focusing on Prevention and Response to Sexual Violence' . 294 Stepping up international coopera- tion. Inter-agency collaboration and development of the Emergency Nutrition Network over the past 10 years have provided a catalyst for advancing the public nutrition approach. This collaboration has also facilitated standardizing procedures and shar ing e xperiences in e mergency response. Most recently, the IASC nutrition cluster, established in 2005, has provided a forum for improvedcoordination and analysis of gaps and c onstraints. It has also developed tools for prevention and care. These include evidence-based toolkits, a 21-mo dule training package and instruments for initial rapid assessment. The latter, along with Save the Children UK'sHousehold Economy Approach, are among the tools now being used to measure malnutrition and analyse vulne rability. Their development was carefully coordinated to minimize bias, ensure valid comparisons and review trends over time. Unfortunately, standardized tools haveyet to be developed for assessing micronutrient deficiency disorders in complex emergencies. The fact that certain staples have been linked with specific disorders (for example, maiz e-base drations have been linked topellagra and rice-based rations with beriberi) 295emphasizes the urgent need for more user-friendly methods and equipment.Other frameworks and tools are improving the quality, accountabilityand effectiveness of nutritional programming in emergencies. These include new standards, such as those in the Sp herehandbook on using multiple micr onutrient supplements in emergencies, as well as technical guid elines o ntreating severe acute malnutrition, 296and on infant and young child feeding practices in emergencies.297 REMAINING GAPS Mounting an integrated, broad- based response. Ineffective responses tonutrition issues in complex emergencies are not surprising, giventhat the ytend to be problematic even under normal circumstances. Along-standing c hallenge is defining where nutrition fits within govern- ment structures. Although it is a multi- sectoral issue, nutrition is often sub-sumed under ministries of health, without the necessary mechanisms tolink it t oothe rsectors. Insufficient efforts to achieve integrated, broad-based programming for nutrition continue to compromise programme quality and impact. In Darfur, for example, malnutrition rates dr oppedsignificantl yafter food aid was provided, but nutrition problems linked to disease remained. This p rovides one example of discon- nected programming that did not adequately meet the needs of children affected by conflict. 2988. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 131In 2007, armed conflicts in Afghanistan, the Central AfricanRepublic, Chad, Darfur (the Sudan),the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, the Occupied Palestinian T erritory and Somalia continued to wreak havoc on children's nutritionalstatus and survival. These crisesresulted in inadequate householdfoodsecurity, poor diet, an unsanitary environment, inadequate maternal and c hild car e,and poor access to health services. For example, preliminary data on Darfur indicatethat g lobal a cute malnutrition increasedfrom 12.9 per cent in 2006 to16.1 p ercent in 2007. While the prevalence has not returned to levels reported in 2004 (21.8 per cent), it has cr ossedthe emergency threshold of 15 per cent. Promoting breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months o flife reduces illness and death from a range of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea. In complex emergencies, where hygiene and carepractices might be compromised and overcrowding is common, the risk of diarrhoea and other infections ishigh. This makes breastfeeding evenmore essential. Adherence to good practiceis often constrained, however, byan absence of institutional memory and fail ureofleadership and coordi- nation. In complex emergencies it is difficult to guarantee the conditionsrequired for safe use of breast-milk substitutes, including clean water,facilities for hygienic preparation and a r egular s upplyofsubstitutes, so the associated risks are higher. During the 2006 crisis in Lebanon, for example, large quantities of breast-milk s ubstitutes and infant formula were widely distributed. The dangers of untargeted formulafeeding were exacerbated by poor hygiene following widespread bombing that d estroyedwater supply and sanitation facilities. The combination of factors resulted in an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases. Addr essing acu temaln utrition in adolescents. Substantial gaps also exist in understanding how to address acute malnutrition in adolescents.Inadequate reference population data and e thnic v ariationin adolesc ent development have hampered efforts to target older children for selective feeding programmes.Counselling traumatized mothers. Anothe rchallengeis ins ufficie nt psychological counselling for mothers traumatized by armed conflict. A majority of these women report having 'not e noug hbreast milk' when taking their infant children (under six months) to therapeutic feedingcentres. In Afghanistan, approxi- mately 40 per cent of admissions to suchcentres ar einfants less than six months old. The major cause of the severe acute malnutrition is insuffi- cient breast milk, with psychosocial stress an underlying issue. Developing early indicators for malnutrition. Rising rates of malnu- trition are usually late indicators of apopulation's deteriorating nutritional status.Developing ear ly indicators of nutritional crisis, therefore, remains an important challenge to timely and effective emergency response. Democratic People' sRepublic of Korea \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0537/Horner132 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDConsistency in the quality and comprehensiveness of needs assessments has also been lacking. One example of this continuing challenge is the finding that only 6 of 67 surveys conducted in Ethiopia in 2000 recorded essential measles imm unizat ionstatus with anthropo- metric data.299 Promoting documenting and dis- seminat ing inf ormation on good practice in infant and young child feeding in emergencies has resulted in misse dopportunities. For instance, many humanitarian agencies continueto include infant formula in food andhealth kits, despite lack of safe waterfor preparing it. This kind of responseconflicts with operational guidanceon infant feeding in emergencies.Moreover, it hinders breastfeeding practices and endangers the health of non-breastfed infants. The lack ofinformation and effective tools tomeasure micronutrient deficiencies and t omeetthe ne eds of children and mothers living with HIV also pose sig nificant obstacles to overall programme effectiveness. RECOMMENDATIONS Nutrition responses have progressed sincethe 1996 M achel study from a focus on a narrow set of interventions to the broad-based approach of public nutrition. Nevertheless, protracted conflicts, such as those in the D emocratic Republic of the Congo,Somalia and the S udan, hamper access to health and other social se rvices. The result is deteriora- tion of children's nutritional status.Recommendations from the 10-year strategic review presented to the General Assembly in 2007 call for anintegrated package of basic services -including nutrition - to be madeavailab le toall,continuously, during emergencies. Priority actions in addressing child nutrition in conflictand emergencies include the following: 1.Support infant feeding in emergencies. Humanitarian actorsshould protect and support early initiation of breastfeeding and e xclusivebreastfeeding in the first six months of life; targeted distributionofinfant f ormula for non-breastfed infants, including education of mothers and families on appropriate use of infant formula and monitoring of its use; and t imely introduction of nutrient-rich complementary foods. The upheaval surrounding complex emergencies may disturb normal breastfeeding patterns and r esult in less frequent feeding. It is critical that mothers receive supporttore-establish breastfeed- ing as an emergency intervention. Women who are infected withHIV should also be supported in making informed decisions about appropriate infant feeding. 2. Apply a three-pronged approach to treating children with acute malnutrition. For children with severeacute malnutrition and medical complications, facility- based (inpatient) management is Liberia \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0632/Pirozzirecommended. For children with severe acute malnutrition without medical complications, community- based management is more appropriate. For children with moderateacute malnutrition, community-based management should b einitiatedand supple- mentary feeding provided.Community-based interventions need more support, since theyreduce the opportunity costs of treatment and enable caregivers to continue their economic activities and family responsibilities,including car ing f or other children. When implementing community- basedinterventions, it is important to inform children, families and communities about them to increase access, coverage and effectiveness of such programmes in conflict situations. 3. Scale up use of multi-vitamins and mine rals.Inemergency situations,efforts should be stepped up to promote daily use of multi- vitamin and mineral supplements tomeetrecommended nutritional requirements and improve the quality of diets. In complex emergencies, all children under five should receive 'Sprinkles' (a blend of micronutrients in powder form), and pregnant andlactating women should receivedaily multi-vitamin and mineralsupplements. Monitoring shouldbe carried out to assess coverage.4. Deliver deworming medication to reduce the burden of disease and enhance nutritional status. In complex emergencies, deworming treatment and vitamin A should be delivered along with measles vaccinations. Treating worm diseases in both women and children through a few simple, single-dose drugs is an essential step to good health, particularly when combined with simple and ine xpensive nutritional interventions, such as providing vitamin and mineralsupplements to promote recovery.5. Strengthen partnerships. Donors, international agencies and NGOs should strengthen partnerships and increase communication and coordi-nation to support an accountable and effective humanitarian response. This can be done through existingcoordination frameworks, such as the humanitarian reform and the IASC Cluster Working Group onNutrition, the Standing Committee on Nutrition, Emergency Nutrition Network, the InternationalNutritional Anemia Consultative Group, the International Vitamin AConsultat ive Group and other nutrition networks. /square6 KEY RESOURCES IASC Nutrition Cluster ,'A Toolkit for Addressing Nutrition in Emergency Situations', 2008, <www.humanitarianreform.org/humanitarianreform/Default.aspx?tabid=74>.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 133134 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are key elements in ensuringthe health, development and welfareof children. Inadequate access to safe waterand sanitat ionservices, coupled with poor hygiene practices, is the cause of at least one quarter of allchild deaths and one fifth of the totalchildhood disease burden globally. 300 Water,sanitation and hygiene are also link edto school attendance and performance (particularly among girls), safety and security of women and girls, and the economic andsocial d evelopment of communities and nat ions. Insituations of instability and conflict, community water and sanitat ion services are among the first tobe disrupted, and facilities are often damaged or destroyed. When conflicts cause population movements, children and their families are cut off from water supplies and fr om hygienic means of excreta disposal. In addition, women and girls become highly vulnerable to attack, rape andkidnap ping b ecause of insecure routes to both water sources andprivate places for defecation. The re-establishment of water and sanitation services is among the hig hest p riorityinterventions during conflict situations in both communities and camps. 301Unless adequate services are quicklyprovided to children and theirfamilies, there is a very high risk of diarrhoea, cholera and otherdiseases with high mortality and morbidity rates. And unless good hygiene practices are effectively promoted in camps and com- munities,the dang er of outbreaks will persist. During the past 10 years, the sectoral framework for water, sanitation and hygiene has evolved in response tostudies and fie ld lesso ns in both the e mergency and the d evelopment arenas. Key changes to programme design include new emphases onbehaviour change related to hygiene and on water quality, greater attention to gender disparities and marginalized groups, more focus on partnership frameworks and collaboration amongsectors, and greater decentralization ofauthority, resources and planning. WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The 1996 Machel study examined water and sanitation from three perspectives: as a determinant of conflict, as a key prerequisite for reducing child mortality, and as a genderissue.These perspectives remain v alid today as a framework for defining the nature of the problemand ap propriate responses. The st udyhighlighted the importance of water as a factor in causing and e xacerbating c onflic t. Sincethen,its imp ortance has become even more pronounced due to increasing competition for dwindling freshwater supplies. The evidence is now clear: Globalwarming is reducing the availability of water, and water-scarce regions in developing countries will suffer disproportionately. 302 Atthe same t ime, population growth, urbanization and intensiveirrigation practices have significantly increasedcompetition for water. This has further marginalized poor and v ulne rable groups. Interruption ofwater,sanitat ionand hygiene services and destruction of facilities are all too common during conflict,in part due to the increasing value of water as it becomes more scarce. The 1996 study noted that both waterand sanitat ion are key inter- ventions for reducing child mortalityin camps and e mergency-affected communities because they are linked to disease and malnutrition. Field manuals now clearly spell out the centrality of WASH interventions in humanitarian response. The lesson is also more frequently applied in practice: The global response to the 2004 Asian tsunami, for example, successfully prevented major diseaseoutbreaks by prioritizing both water and sanitation interventions. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Promoting hygiene. The importance ofhygiene p romotion in emergencies has b ecome incr easing ly clear during recent years. This is in response to new evidence showing that hygiene (and hand washing with soap, in particular) can reduce diarrhoeal disease rates by8.5 THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENEmore than 40 per cent.303As a result, hygiene promotion is seen as anintegral part of emergency response. Impr oving water safety. Similar ly, the growing body of evidence showing the links between waterquality and diarrhoea is prompting anew emphasis on water safety, both in the se ctoras a w hole and in emergency response. 304 T aking gender into account. As the Machel study highlighted, water andsanitat ionis a g ender issue in conflict and camp sit uations. The report specifical ly noted that water and sanitat ion facilities in camps must be carefully designed to avoid creating \"opportunities for gender-based aggression against displaced women and c hildren.\" Although field experience shows that this threat to women and girls continues today, it is now a more widely recognized problem, and the security of facilities is more commonly reflected in design criteria. Enhancing lo cal and g lobal coordi- nation. Both globally and locally, progress towards more effective and equitable emergency responseprogrammes in water, sanitation and hygiene ha vefocused on improved coordination and preparedness planning ,defining and r efining standards, and improving manage- ment and implementation capacities. The 2005 launch of the IASC cluster approach and the establishment of theMAINSTREAMING HYGIENE PROMOTION IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE Promoting the practice of hand washing with soap and water at critical times (immediately after defecation, after handling babies' faeces and before handling food) is key to preventing the spread of diarrhoeal diseases.Evidence shows that this is especially true in conflict and other emergencysituations, where people are often living in cramped conditions and waterand sanitation ser vices are interrupted. Humanitarian agencies are responding accordingly, and hygiene promotion is increasingly mainstreamed into emergency response. InUNICEF-supported programmes alone, examples during the past few yearsillustrate the extent of this effort: /square6In Darfur and neighbouring areas in 2007, a door-to-door hygiene promotion and soap distribution campaign reached more than 1 millionpeople; more than 3 million people had access to radio programmes thatemphasized the impor tance of hygiene. /square6In Somalia in 2007, 3,500 hygiene promoters were trained to encourage hand washing with soap among vulnerable populations. /square6In countries in crisis and transition in eastern and central Africa, the number of reported cholera cases fell significantly from 2006 to 2007, inpart due to continuing prevention programmes, which include hygienepromotion in some countries. Tohelp expand and improve the quality of emergency hygiene promotion efforts, the WASH cluster has identified capacity building for hygiene promotion as one of five key outcomes in its global work plan. In arelated effort, UNICEF completed a comprehensive, multilingual training package for UNICEF staff and partners in 2007. 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 135136 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDWASH cluster represent significant steps forward in coordi-nation, qualityand accountability of humanitarianrelief efforts. The WASH cluster is becoming the principal coordination mechanism among humanitarian response actors in water, sanitationand h ygiene among the United Nations system, the International Red Cross and R edCrescent Movement and the NGO community. The cluster mechanism is also important in its formal recognition ofthe v aluable role played by NGOs in emergency response, ranging from policy formulation at the global levelto field-level action. NGOs also act as 'protection agents' on the ground, working to minimize threats towomen and girls through WASH- related interventions. WASH clusters have been formed in about 20 acute and complex emergencies (conflicts as well as natural disasters) around the world sincethe launch of the cluster approach, helping improve coordi- nation and clarify roles and responsi- bilities. Coordination mechanisms for WASH emergency response need improvement, however, over and abovethe efforts already made through the cluster initiative. Setting minimum standards. For the fir st time, through the Sphere Project, a set of minimum standardshas been defined for water, sanitationand hygiene in emergencies. Thesestandards are increasingly being used by global and local entities for both programme design, andawareness raising and advocacy. The wide use of the Sphere WASH standards by both humanitarian response agencies and governments is he lping imp rove the quality and consistency of interventions. Governme nts and r esponse agencies are also defining their own humanitarian standards and norms, in most cases informed by the Sphere Project. For example, the 2004 UNICEF Core Commitments forChildren in Emergencies include asetofinterventions and standards related to water, sanitation and hygiene that is now the basis for allUNICEF int erventions in the field. Moreover, a growing number ofcountries are revising their own national standards. REMAINING GAPS Applying established standards. Challenges remain in applying standar ds during c onflicts and other emergencies. Due to a variety of constraints, ranging from funding shortfalls to poor access resulting from insecurity, standards are not commonly applied in practice. UNHCR, forexample, estimat es that between 2003 and 2005 standards were not met for water supplyin 40 p ercent of refugee camps and for sanitation in 25 per cent of camps.305These findings are reinforced by the field experiences of other actors, both in camp-based and community-based WASHhumanitarian response efforts. Strengthening emergency preparedness and response. Agencies involved in both development and emergency workareincreasing ly reflecting the importance of emergency preparedness and response in their policies and strategies. A recent UNICEF strategy paper on water, sanitation and hygiene, for example, places a m uch greater emphasis on emergency r esponse than in the past.306At the same time, standard non-emergency references andguid elines - such as the 2006 WHO Guidelines for Drinking WaterQualit y-now specifically address emergency response. 307 Raising the ne cessar yfunds. Mobilizing resources for humani- tarian response in conflict situations continues to be a key challenge for the WASH sector. This is especiallythe case in c onflic t-related complex emergencies not prominently covered by the media, such as the continuing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the C ongo. RECOMMENDATIONS Understanding has g rown during recent years regarding the role of water in conflict; the importance of adequate response in this area is \"There was no food and water. People had to risk their lives to find food.\" - Young man, age not specified, Sierra Leonealso increasingly acknowledged. Recommendations from the 10-year strategic review presented to the General Assembly in 2007 call for acontinuous, integrated package of basic services including water, sanitation and hygiene. They highlight the need to invest more inbuilding international and nationalcapa cities as w ell as knowledge acquisition and management. A furthercallis ma deto give priority to protecting children from gender- based violence, a concern that relates closely to this sector. Priority actions related to water, sanitation andhygiene include the following: 1.Strengthe nWASH preparedness and c oordination for more effective and timely response. WASH c luster members and othe rhumanitar ian actors should continue to improve water, sanitation and hygiene preparedness and coordination throughthe c luster initiative and othe rcollaborative frameworks. This includes developing robust policy and guidance material (including those specific to conflicts), improved informationmanagement, refinement andpromotion of inter-sectoral and inter-agency coordination, and building global emergencystocks and qualified humanresour ces pools. 2.Ens urecompliance with emergency water, sanitation and hygiene standards. Member States and humanitarian actorsshould take steps to ensure that established emergency water,sanitation and hygiene standards are consistently met in conflictsituations through the allocationof sufficient resources, enhancedtechnical support and improved monitoring systems.3. T ake steps for the safety and security of girls and women. WASH cluster members and other humanitarian actors shouldtake steps to ensure that policy instruments, guidelines andresponse efforts stress WASH-related measures to improve thesafety and security of girls and women in conflict situations. /square6 KEY RESOURCES L.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 137138 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDAs the 1996 Machel study pointed out, armed conflict can be devastating to achild's mental health and psychosocialwell-being. Being a victim of violence, witnessing v iolence against others, living in fear and uncertainty, and experiencing extreme hardship, suchaslack of food, shelter and medical services, can cause severe physicaland me ntal s uffering - ranging from feelings of intense sadness to anxiety, loneliness and d espair. In fact, the accumulation of stress over time and the long-termconsequences of distressing events - suchas the r isks associated with growing up without a caring, protective adult or having no access toeducation - may have a more damag ing and last ing impact on a child's well-being and development than the e vents themselves. 308 It should be noted that the reactions of most children in emergencies are normal r esponses to horrific events. They are not pathological in the clinical se nse.309Moreover, in spite of often extreme adversity, mostchildr enshow considerable resilience and ability to cope, provided theirbasic survival needs are met and they have sufficient security andemotional and social support. 310 Yetit is these v erysystems of support that tend to break down in the c haos o fwar.The damag einflic ted upon social, economic and political structures in conflict situations oftenleads to mass population movements; disruption of social services and insti-tutions; loss of livelihoods; tension and divisions within communities;erosion of traditional values andpractices; and the collapse of political authorityand the rule of law. Any of these changes can undermine support systems, including those that reside in families and communities, thatprovide the nurturing and protectiveenvironment children need to develop and thrive. Effective mental health and psychosocial programmes for children have therefore focused onrestoring an environment that protects children from further harm and o ffers caring relationships and opportunities for development. Such programmes are multidimensional and inc lude promotion of family unity and family-based care. They aim tostrengthen children's attachment to caring adults, restore normal routines and structures at the earliest possible stage,and fa cilitate the role of culture, spirituality and social responsibility. This he lps give children a sense of identity and purpose. Such programmesalso e ncourage children's participation and engagement in meaningfulactivities. They advance security and mitigate further harm, enhanceaccess to basic services and reinforce childr en'ssupport networks so they can p rovide care and protection. Evenwithin a car ing e nvironment, children respond differently in the face of extreme adversity. 311Asmall percentage will have severe mental health problems: They will continueto experience emotional and mental distress, and their functioning will be impaired even in a protective family and community context. Severe mental health p roblems appear to result from acombination of factors, including the se verity of the experience, level of supportchildren receive, accumulation of loss and stress, pre-existing mental orphysical illness or disability, and mental il lness in famil ymembers.312 These children require specialized interventions to address their sufferingand help restore normal functioning and development. In addition to care from the child's existing support system, interventions such as com- munity mental health services ortraditional healing are often helpful and should b emadeavailable. 313 WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The 1996 Machel study outlined several aspects of an ethical andeffective psychosocial response for children in armed conflict. These include building on and supporting a community'sresour ces, beliefs and practices; mobilizing the community care network around children; and re-estab lishing a se nse o fnormalcy throughmeaning ful,structured and regular activities. It also warned against sy stematic use o f\"psycho- therapeutic approaches based on western mental health traditions [that] tend to emphasize individual emotional expression.\" This caution reflected the practice, then widespread,8.6 PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL RECOVERY \"We were scared working inside our home; we were scared working outside our homes. We never knew what was going to happen.\" - Girls and young women, 14-18, Nepal8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 139of initiating large-scale psychosocial programmes that focused narrowly on specific clinical issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. This approach failed to help establish a systematic and all-inclusive system ofcare.The study laid out the broad principles o facomprehensive, community-based response to the mental health and psy choso cial needs ofchildr enin ar medconflict. CHANGES IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING At the time of the Machel study, the field of psychosocial and mental health programming for children in emergencies was deeply divided. It was characterized by diverse and often contradictory approaches that left affected populations open to interven- tions that were inappropriate and attimes har mful, though well-meaning. Experience during the past decade has brought a growing consensuswithin the humanitarian community onthe main programmatic strategies that promote mental health and psycho-so cial w ell-being in children - and p revent further harm. At the core of this consensus is recognition of the needtoaddress the imme diateand long-termsocial as w ell as psychological effects of armed conflict on children. 314 Thereis also ag reement onthe important r ole o fprotective factors in mitigating the effect of armedconflict and in promoting mentalhealth. 315As described above, this involves strengthening caring relation-ships, protection and opportunities for children to develop. Another areaof understanding and agreement isthe complementarity of social and psycholo gical supports and the links between protective factors. These call for an integrated, multi-sectoral andmany-layered response. At the same time, recognition is growing o f the thin evidence base forassessing the effectiveness and long-term impact of different kinds of mental health and psychosocial interventions in conflict and post-conflic tsettings. Most of the research has b eenconducted on clinical inter- ventions carried out by well-trained mental health professionals in relatively stable countries. These have limit edrelevance to conflict settings. Assessments of interventions carried outin countries affected by conflict need to be pursued more rigorously and in an ethical and participatory way.Local understanding of distress and well-being must also be better integrated into the evidence base. Furthermore, it is increasinglyacknowledged that capacities and coping skills, not only deficits, needto be considered. Better understanding of the importance of strong evidence amo ng fie ld workers, managers and donors, combined with promising newapproaches and t ools, and more effective partnerships between researchers and practitioners, areamong the most important recent developments.PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Strong recognition of the role of mental health and psychosocial support sincethe 1996 M achelstudyhas led to more consistent implementation of programmes in the field. Psychosocialsupport programmes, for example, have been carried out in Afghanistan, northern Uganda and throughout theMiddle East. Numerous psychosocial guid elines, policies and training work- shops ha vebeendeveloped, many specific to children. Significant levels of funding ha vealso been made available. Increasing inter-agency collabo- ration. There are many examples of collaboration in this field among UN agencies, from production of trainingmanuals to implementation of jointprogrammes. At the global level, thishas inc ludedthe development of inter- agency guidelines on psychosocial support, networking initiatives such as the inter-agency Psychosocial Working Group and joint projects such astraining in psy choso cial s upport for child p rotection actors. At the local and regional levels, inter-agency initiatives have included regional networks, 316 development of local guidelines and standards (such as those developed in Acehbythe Psychosocial Working Group) and joint projects. Providing strong policy guidance. The inter-agency consensus on mental health and psychosocial principles Lebanon \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-1118/Brooks140 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDand practice that has emerged over the years was recently formalized inthe IASC Guidelines on MentalHealth and Psychosocial Support in Eme rgency S ettings, launched in Geneva in September 2007. The guidelines were developed by stafffrom 27 agencies through extensiveconsultation and dialogue. Byproviding strong policy guidanc ein nsionabout 'good practice' , the new IASC guidelines are a significant step forward in protectingand p romoting the mental health and psy choso of populat ions in emergencies. The guid elines recognize that how humanitarian aid is provided has asubstant ial impact on people's mental health and psychosocial well- being, and that protecting this sense of well-being is the responsibility of all sectors at the earliest possible stages ofhumanitarian response. The guidelines reiterate that most people are resilient when given adequate community support andservices. Moreover, the guidelines focus clearly on building upon localresources and social interventionsthat reinforce existing ways thatpeople in the community handle distress in the ir lives.They also include attention to protection and careofthose w ith se veremental disorders, including severe trauma- induced and pre-existing disorders, aswell as access to psychological first aid for those in acute distress.The guidelines acknowledge the complementarity of approaches that focus primarily on strengthening social supports and those that focus on clinical assistanc ein the health se ctor. They therefore encourage establish-ment of a single coordinating body. Indoing so the ytranscend the traditional divide between 'mental health 'and 'psychosocial' actors. REMAINING GAPS Forging consensus on divergent approaches at the country level. Despite significant progress over the past decade, gaps remain. For example, although the IASC guidelines capture the consensus at the global policy level, debate continues at the country level regarding the relative weight to give to social, community-driven approaches versus psychological/clinical ap proaches. This contributes tovarying quality of responses and risks undermining the progress madeso far. Ineffective or harmful practices continue to be used. For this reason, a good deal of work remains to build understanding and o wnership of this newconsensus in the field and to adapt the guidelines to specific realities o nthe g round. Filling gaps in coverage. Major gaps persist in c overagebecause current mental health and psy choso cial programmes reach only a small per- centage of conflict-affected children and their families. In addition, an enormous challenge remains inidentifying and reaching some of the least visible and most-at-risk children,such as sexually abused children,child domestic workers and children explo itedby foster families. More work is required to find appropriate responses to severe mental distressthat can be scaled up and adapted tolocal cultures and capacities. Developing consistently high- qualit yprogrammes. Progress has been made in developing and using inter-agency tools andguid elines sp ecific to psychosocial support for children, but more work is ne eded to ensure consistently high-quality programmes. For example, too little attention has been given to the differing needs and responses required for children at diff erent stages of development. In particular, more work should be carried out to understand the needs and capa cities of very young children (5 years and younger) and adolescents (12 to 18 years). Also needed is greater understanding ofthe impa ct of gender on psycho- social problems and on coping and resilience. In addition, there has been insufficient documentation of programmes and shar ing o f promising practices and approaches and lesso ns lear ned.Peersupport, on-the-job supervision and mentoring of psychosocial and mental health staff should also be strengthened.\"While I was playing football with friends, I heard an explosion. Irushed to the place where the explosion happened and I saw Hassan, our 14-year-old neighbour, who was dead. We collected his scattered body. I could not sleep for nights; I used to dream of people drenched in blood.\" -Boy, 13, SomaliaRECOMMENDATIONS The 10-year review of the Machel study presented to the General Assembly in 2007 noted that aconsensus has been achieved on goodpractice relating to children's mental health and psychosocial well-being. It mentioned that socialsupport systems, along with opportu- nities for play, development and clinical services for specific problems allconstitute important aspects of programming. It also reaffirmed therole that sports, music and drama can pla yin restoring a sense of normalcy and r outine to children whose lives have been altered by the tumult o fwar.Priorities relating to children's mental and psychosocial well-being follow: 1.Imple ment mental health and psychosocial support guidelines. Humanitarian actors should support the implementation of the IASC guidelines, while carefully monitoring and assessing their relevance andimpact in different settings. 2. Build up professional networks and peer support. UN agencies and NGOs should strengthen networking among mental health and psy choso cial a ctors. Aglobal ne twork on psycho- social support in emergencies should be established, and localand regional forums supported inconflict and post-conflict settings.3. Build capacity to implement mental health and psychosocial programmes. Humanitarian actors should strengthen thecapacity of child rights andhumanitarian workers incountries affected by conflict toimple ment effective psychosocial me ntal health p rogrammes forchildr enand the ir families. This on-the-jo bsupervision. 4.Strengthe nthe evidence base toimpr oveprogramming. In partnership w ith relevant research institutions, UN agencies and NGOs should develop a newgeneration of research on impact that is methodologically rigorous, based on the views of affectedchildren and families regarding mental health and psy choso cial well-being, and addresses sources of resilience, functionality andpositive coping. 5. Provide more flexible, longer- term funding. Donors should provide more flexible, longer- term funding for psychosocial/ mental health programming.Implementation of the principlescontained in the IASC guidelines should b eaprerequisite for funding in this field. /square6 KEY RESOURCES Action Without Borders, website at <www.psychosocial.org/>.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 141142 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDIn 2006, 1.8 million people living with HIV were affected by conflict, disasterordisplacement. An estimated 930,000 of them were women, and 150,000were children under age 15. 317 Vulne rabilities and r isks asso ciated with HIV may be heightened in crisis situations. HIV prevention centres and other public services, including education, are usually disrupted, and therefore inaccessible to those whoneedthem.Moreover, whether the crisis is due to conflict or natural disaster, institutions and systems forphysical and so cial p rotection may beweakened or destroyed. Families and communities become separated, resulting in a further breakdown of community support systems andprotection mechanisms. All of these factors may increase young people's risk-taking behaviours and their vul-nerability to HIV . In addition, women and c hildr en, in particular, are often targeted for abuse. They are the most vulnerable to exploitation and violence because of their gender, ageand so cial status. Other factors, however, may actually slow the spread of HIV duringemergencies. These include a decrease in sexual networking because of limited mobility and accessibility,reducedurban mig ration, social or physical isolation, and relative poverty. The ultimate result of the interactionbetween the HIV epidemic and a conflict situation willtherefore be specific to the circumstances. This calls for carefulassessment and understanding of HIV risk and vulnerability in each conflict setting. WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID As the 1996 Machel study highlighted, the sp readofsexually transmitted infections, including HIV , has the potential torise dramatically during conflicts. The study also noted that allhumanitar ian r esponses in conflict situations must emphasize the special reproductive health needs of womenand girls, including prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Generating global commitment and national plans. The Declaration of Commitment that emerged from theGeneral AssemblySpecial Session on HIV/AIDS in 2001 d evotedan entire sectiontothe HIV e pidemic in regions affected by conflict and disaster. Among other things, the Declaration boundsignatories to develop and begin imple- menting national strategies that address HIV and AIDS into programmes oractions that respond to emergenciesand to factor these into international assistance programmes. The UN Security Council also acknowledged the relevance of the HIVepidemic in addressing humanitarian and security issues, as reflected in the adoption of Resolutions 1308 and1325 in 2000.In recent years, the HIV-related needs of populations affected byemergencies have increasingly been considered within national AIDSstrategic plans and other developmentframeworks,thoug hmainly focused on refugees. Funding of HIV proposals within Consolidated and Flash Appeals more than doubled from2002 t o2005, increasing from less than 10 per cent to 19 per cent.Still,HIV p rogrammes in emergency settings are underfunded in relation to overall appeals for humanitarianaid,whose funding has r emaine d stable at ab out 67 per cent. 318 Estab lishing int er-agency guidelines. Guidelines for HIV/AIDS interven- tions in emergency settings have been developed by an IASC task force. The guidelines cover several programmaticissues related to children, such as protection of unaccompanied children and those separated from their families, prevention of and response to sexual violence, and access to education for every child. They also emphasize the importance of information, education and communication programmes foryoung p eople as well as communi- cations programmes targeted at behaviour change. Refining the programmatic response. In2003, UNICEF further refinedthe c oreelements of its response to protecting and assisting childr enand women in conflict and unstable situations. The organi-8.7 LESSENING THE TOLL OF HIV \"When you are a girl, you think you'd [rather] die of a bullet than AIDS. So we go fight next to our brothers.\" -Young woman, 17, Burundi 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 143zation's Core Commitments for Children in Emergencies include key elements of a programmatic response to HIV . For example, the use of drugs to help prevent HIV infection after possible exposure has been shown to be an essential part of a package ofstandar dprecautions for service providers within and outside the health services sector; it is also part ofacomprehensive strategy to address HIV prevention associated with g ender-based violence. Programmes that include post- exposureprophylaxis in services for rape survivors have been imple mentedin a n umb erof complex emergencies, including in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. Interventions to prevent mother- to-child transmission of HIV havealso been successfully carried out in emergency settings, as in northern Uganda. There, good results were achieved, even when compared with non-aff ected areas of the country. Still, many challenges remain, including insufficient skilled assistance during childb irth, complex protocols, lack ofadherence to protocols and fear of stigma. Although the use of antiretroviral therapy in conflict and post-conflict settingshas b een limited in scale, the outcomes achieved compare favourably to those found in non-conflict situations. This suggests thatwith a daptationand r esour ces, it is possible to deliver comprehensivecare for persons living with HIV orAIDS in both post-conflict and chronic-conflict settings. Antiretro- viral therapy has already been admin- isteredduring complex emergencies in the Democratic Republic of theCongo, Haiti and Uganda. Promoting protection and ethical conduct. Within the United Nations, norms are being established with regard to protection issues and ethical conduct. The Secretary- General's2003 'Bulletin on special measures for protection from sexual exploitationand se xual abuse' provides clear d efinitions of these issues. The bulletin, aiming to protect the most vulne rable fromharm, states that sexual exploitation and abuse constitute serious misconduct and are grounds for disciplinary measures, includingsummary dismissal for UN staff. Itcovers specific standards of behaviour, for instance, prohibitingsex with minors and the exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex. REMAINING GAPS Increasing AIDS-related pro- gramming and funding. There is little doubt that HIV and AIDS have received insufficient programming attention in conflict situations: By the end o f2005, only half the proposals submitted to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by count ries w ith significant refugee populations included specific activities addressing HIV or AIDS amongrefugees. And the World Bank's Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program included projects in only 19 of the 28 African countries hosting refugees. AIDS-related programming and funding also remain low in post- conflic tand r ecovery contexts, as suggested by a UNDP review of 85countries affected by emergencies or hosting more than 5,000 refugees. The st udyanalysedavailable Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and found that only 14 of 49 countries (29 per cent) mention increased vulnerabilityto HIV among 'populations of humani- tarian c oncern' . These include refugees, internally displaced persons and othersaffected by armed conflicts or disasters, including children. 319Moreover, only a quarter of UN Development Assistance Frameworks in 74 countries studied included activities aimed at reducing or preventing HIV in thesame population. 320 Impr oving coverage of antiretro- viral therapy. Not surprisingly, coverage of antiretroviral therapy is oftenlowerin areas affected by conflict than nationally. Inadequacy of supply is compounded when paediatric demand is taken into account. Implementing guidelines. Use of the inter-agency 'Guidelines for HIV/AIDS interventions in emergency settings' in the fie ld has b eenuneven. Mainstreaming HIV across sectors. Similarly, although HIV is a cross- cutting issue of the cluster approach Occupied Palestinian Territory \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0779/El Bababeing adopted as part of humanitar- ian reform, experience in recent crises suggests that HIV has too frequentlybeen ignored, along with other issuesthat m ust b eaddressed through multiple sectors. RECOMMENDATIONS Understanding of HIV as a relevant concern for children in conflict has deepened since publication of the five-year review of the Machel studyin 2001. Policy and p rogramming have also advanced. Still, millions of children and young people remain vulne rable to HIV in conflictsituations worldwide. T o address the most urgent needs in this area, anagenda for action should encompasspolicy and programming involving all stakeholders: 1. Increase support to national HIV programming. UN agencies and NGOs should improvesupport and guidance to nationalHIV programming, with theobjective of developing interven- tions that address populations ofhumanitar ian concern. 2. Integrate HIV and AIDS programming in the humani-tarian framework. Humani-tarian actors should integrate HIV and AIDS into programming responses and the humanitarianframework, such as the UN Consolidated Appeals Processes and the UN Central EmergencyResponse Fund. 3. Ensure HIV-related capacity building across clusters. All IASC cluster leads should ensure thatrelevant p ersonnel receive training on HIV and AIDS to build capacity in addressing the epidemic as partof humanitarian reform. 4. Promote inter-agency guidance on HIV programming in conflictsituat ions. Humanitar ian a ctors should a dopt and disseminate inter-agency guidance on HIV programming in conflict situations. They should also develop additional guidance related to emerging pro- grammat ic ar eas as an essential step to ensure a predictable and coherent response to HIV inhumanitarian settings. 5.Ens ure linkages in HIV programming throughout the emergency. UN agencies and NGOs should ensure links in HIV p rogramming thr ough the various phases of an emergency as well as post-conflict recovery, transition and reconstruction.Links must also be established inprogrammes aimed at disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and the return or repatriation of displaced populations. /square6KEY RESOURCES M.

This section, and the three that f ollow, describe an emerging priority among child protection specialists - building national childprotection systems - while maintainingafocus on specific issues. These includethe unla wful recruitment ofchildren, separation of families and g ender-based violence. 321 Child protection systems consist of laws, policies, regulations andservices across all social sectors - especially social welfare, education, health, security and justice - that support prevention and response toprotection-related risks. These systems are an aspect of social protection but extend beyond it. Atthe level of prevention, their aim includes supporting and strengthening families to reduce social exclusion and lo werthe risk of separation, violence and exploitation. Asystems approach to child protection responds to the gapsidentified within 'issue-based' inter- ventions. While such interventionshave achieved coherence on standardsand encouraged rapid, predictableresponses, they have also led to duplicat ionand isolat edprogrammes targeting specific categories of childr en.Asystems ap proach to child protection, on the other hand, aims to reduce the stigmatization oftargeted children and adolescents, strengthen responses to otherimportant categories of vulnerable children, and ensure more equitable attention to various forms of violence,abuse and exploitation. It can buildon synergies with developmentpartners, in particular those workingto improve social protection orstrengthen the rule of law. Responsivechild protection systems should buildon the strengths of issue-specificprogramming by ensuring that distinct forms of vulnerability are addressed, including those related to gender, disability, HIV status andindigenous populations. They shouldalso b eable to measure outcomes for different groups. Asystems approach presents challenges, to be sure, particularly regarding the roles of ministries and sectors. Social welfare ministries, commonly the cornerstone for protection, generally have few resources and often lack the staff tocarryoutevenstatutory respon- sibilities. The justice and security sectors tend to give scant attention tochildren. And despite their important role, the health and education sectors often lack childprotection policies, codes of conductand estab lishe dprocedures. The following sections focus on progress and gaps in specific child protection issues, which are also being addressed within a broader contextby child protection actors seeking todevelop a systems approach that isbetter able to safeguard children, even in the midst of war. /square6 KEY RESOURCES Save the Children, Stolen Futures: The reintegration of children affected by armed conflict, Save the Children UK, London, 2007.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 1458.8 BUILDING CHILD PROTECTION SYSTEMS In all armed conflicts, children are at risk of being separated from theirfamilies, especially when fightingcauses people to flee their homes and eventheir countries en masse. Children separated during war often find themselves in the care ofstrangers and in danger. Having lostthe protection of parents or guardiansat a t ime w hentheymost ne ed it, these childr en are more likely to experience abuse, exploitation and neglect than those who remain with primary caregivers. Children living in child-headedhouseholds are especially at risk,as ar ethose associated with the armedforces or other armed groups. Inbroad terms, children affected byarmed conflict can face two types of separation: involuntary or intentional. Involuntary separations typically occur when children and their parents are fleeing from danger, when parents or primary caregivers die,orwhen children are abducted. Intentional separations, on the other hand, include sending children away to work or to boarding school,aband oning c hildren as a result of family destitution or emotionalexhaustion, and placing children in orphanages or children's homes to access education and material assistanc e.Intimes o fdistress, some families e ntrust children to relatives or non-relatives,althoug hthe designated caregivers may also lack resources to survive wartime conditions. Family separation can occur at any stage of an armed conflict, evenmonths or years after the initial emergency phase - and after years of surviving in urban centres orcamps for refugees and the internally displa ced.It may also happen when protracted conflicts leave families and substitute caregivers so emotionallyor economically expended that theyfeel they can no longer care for their childr en. 'Secondary separation' - when a child loses the f oster family that had been caring for him or her - is also a frequent occurrence. These separationstakeplacewhen refugee or internally displa cedpopulations return home after aprotracted conflict, intentionally or unint entionally leaving behind the unaccompanied or separated children who w ere in their care. Refugee children separated from their families face specific risks. Their families may have escaped to another country, which makes tracing and reunificat ion much more difficult, especially when the family still resides in a c onflict area. Moreover, separated refugee children living with familiesfromthe host c ountry face a heightened risk of exploitation and denial of basicrights, including the right to an identityand to a quality education. Monitoringcare arrangements is particularly difficult in s uchcircumstanc es. Family-base dcareversus inst itution- alization. show that community-based and famil y-based care are preferable to orphanages and other forms ofresidential care. Institutionalization hurts children and communitiesbecause it tends to constrain children'scognitive and emotional development, ultimat elyhindering their social and economic performance as adults. This is true in both emergency andnon-emergency settings. The lengthof stay and a child's age are keyfactors: The longer children spend in orphanages, the more likely their development will be compromised. The experience of orphanage care is most damaging for children underagefive, and especially for children underthree, because it is during those t ender years that children develop physical, psycho-logical and social skills that will be crucial over the c ourse of their lives. Growing up in institutions means that c hildren are denied the experience of family life and the acquisition of skills that children develop within a famil yenvironment. Children in institutional care are also at a higher risk o f violence and abuse from staff, relief workers and other children,especially if they have a disability. But care in a community or familyalso poses risks. Government andchild protection agencies should ensureadequate and regular monitoring and p eriodic r eview of all substitute carearrangements. 322 Itis widelybelieved that many orphanages implicitly encourage separation because they are seen as the o nly venue capable of offering food, shelter and schooling to children8.9 FINDING APPROPRIATE CARE FOR SEPARATED AND UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN 146 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 147from poor families. Indeed, experience has shown that thousands of familieshave tried to have their babies andyoung children accepted into orphanag es because they could not properly care for them on their own. 323Poverty, lack of basic services and poor screening procedures arethe overwhelming reasons forchildr enbeing admitted to orphanages, not lack of family. The p roblem is exacerbated by the fact that orphanages often receive support based on the number ofchildr enthey take in, not the number ofchildren they place out via family reunificat ion or fostering. In the worst cases, unscrupulous orphanage manag ers profit financially while inexperienced relief organizations blindly support orphanages over more appropriate - and sustainable - family-care options. This is especially unfortunate because studies show that supporting children in orphanages is far more expensive than family- base dcare. 324 Emergency residential care will alwaysbe required for some children while family tracing and fosteringefforts are pursued. For children intemporary arrangements, closemonitoring is needed, along with rapid sear ches f oralternative solutions such as safe fostering or smal lgroup ho mes (f oradolescents). Longer-term care may be required for a small number of children whocannot b ereunited or placed in foster care.However, if the focus is on keeping children in families - bypaying school fees, helping to provideshelter or providing cash transfers - fewerchildren will need residential care. Humanitarian attention can then give priority to children infamilies, develop foster-care alterna-tives, establish community-basedmonitoring me chanisms and provide essential services in communities, ratherthan c oncentrating on children in special institutions. Orphanages built during conflict, suchas those estab lished after the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, may continue to operate long after the conflict has subsided. Such institutions compete for limited humanitarian resour ces. They also draw attention away from efforts to establish more appropriate alternatives and invest in child protection systems that seek to strengthen family care and prevent famil ybreakdowns. Care and protection are the most imme diateissues facing separated children, particularly those who areunaccompanied. But it is also crucial to trace their families as early aspossible in an emergency, as thechances of finding family membersdiminishes with time. This is especiallytrue for younger children. The situation of unaccompanied and se paratedchildr enseeking asylum in industrialized countries poses challenges as well. Although reliable statistics are difficult to obtain, up to 30 per cent of the disappearancesin Europe could be linked to human trafficking, according to one 2004 estimate. 325 WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The 1996 Machel study focused on involuntar yseparation on the scale ofwhat t ranspir edin Rwanda, where more than 100,000 children were separated from their families due to the g enocide.The study underscored the importance of alternative family careover institutionalizing children, and it hig hlightedhowinter-agency collaboration led to a remarkably successful family tracing rate during the Rwandan e mergency. CHANGES IN APPROACH AND UNDERSTANDING The past decade has brought new levels of awareness about the complex issues surrounding separated andunaccompanied children. Thisgrowing knowledge base is already being translated globally into more effective emergency responses as well as strategies for prevention. For example, there is now greater awareness of the need to move quicklyto identify and monitor unaccompanied children who are informally fostered by host country nationals in refugee situations and by nationals insituations of internal displacement. This is especially important in the case of unaccompanied and separated girls, who run a higher risk of abuse\"They made some of us orphans, killed some or all of our relatives, made us homeless and some of us disabled. They denied most of us the love of our parents.\" -Young woman, 18, Rwanda148 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDand e xplo itation than boys. There isalso increased understanding of the reasons behind intentionalseparations, which frequently resultfromdestitution and despair induced by conflict, and of the scope of actions possible to protect family unity in themidst of armed conflict. More peoplenow recognize that only a compre- hensive response can fully address the consequences of separation - onethat engages all sectors to supportfamily unity on economic, educational and judicial levels. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Developing inter-agency guidelines and a c oordinated response. Progress has been significant in designing prevention measures and responses to involuntary andvoluntary separations. For example, the Inter-agency Guiding Principles onUnaccompanied and Separated Children (2004), which outline the principles enshrined in international standards and reflect good practice,have been widely disseminated and used.UNHCR has developed guidelines for determining the best interests of the child, including children who are unaccompanied and se parated. 326Draft UN G uidelines onthe Appropriate Use and Conditions of Alternative Care for Children seekto ensure that children do not findthemselves in out-of-home care unnecessarily, and that when they need such care, the type and quality corresponds to the rights and specific needs of the child concerned. Theguid elines are designed to promote and facilitate the progressive imple-mentationofthe C onvention on the Rights of the Child.SEEING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHILDREN THROUGH THEIR EYES Between 2005 and 2007, UNHCR launched an innovative experiment to understand the problems faced by refugee and returnee children, some ofwhom had been separated from their families. These so-called 'participatoryassessments', carried out in sites where UNHCR was operating in southernAfrica, used artwork as a medium to encourage reflection and discussion.The objective was to understand children's views of their own problemsand to give them an opportunity to help solve them. Although situations differed from site to site, many common issues were identified. Among them was that children living without parents are especially vulnerable due to lack of adult protection and economic resources.In Malawi, children pointed to the particular difficulties faced by those livingalone or as foster children. The former are vulnerable to attack, they said,and the latter are badly treated. These children often go hungry, are unableto attend school, are vulnerable to exploitation and are more likely thanothers to turn to prostitution for survival. In Botswana, unaccompaniedchildren were seen as the most likely to exchange sex with older men forfood, cash or other needs. The risk of transactional sex for unaccompaniedor separated children was also identified in camps in Namibia andZimbabwe. In Mozambique, one boy reported that unaccompanied andseparated children in foster-care arrangements \"are treated like slaves.\" These assessments gave children the opportunity to express themselves, which enhanced their confidence and tended to garner respectfrom adults. Other results included the development of standard operatingprocedures and child protection committees to ensure early identification and monitoring of unaccompanied children; training on children' srights for UNHCR personnel, NGOs, government officials, refugees and localcommunities; and the establishment or improvement of facilities for safeparticipation in recreational and learning activities. Findings from the assessments have been integrated into UNHCR' sstrategies and programmes and have encouraged the agency and its partners to give children a larger role in shaping their own futures.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 149In practice, responses have reflected increased coordinationamong all actors, further clarificationof roles and responsibilities within various ag encies, and concrete efforts to develop and use context-specific guidelines and tools collaboratively.For example, under humanitarianreform and the cluster approach,strongerlines of accountability havebeen established among humanitar ian a ctors. These should result in more effective care and protection for children. 327 Building o nsuccessful efforts. Over the y ears,concerted action has been taken to prevent separation in various contexts. There has been a move awayfrom institutionalized care for separated children in emergencies. And coordinated, multi-stakeholder efforts have resulted in positive tracing and family reunification in sho rter periods of time. When efforts to trace and reunify aretimely and sufficient resources are allocated, family tracing hasproved extremely successful, even after several years of separation. InGoma, Zaire (now the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo), the familiesof all but a few hundred very young childr enoutofacaseload of more than 10,000 c hildren were traced between1994 and 1996. More recently in that country, 465 unaccompanied children were reunited with theirfamilies ou tof 561 children who were registered with the help of the RedCross. 328In Guinea, UNICEF and the International Rescue Committeehelped identify and monitor 1,385 refugee children living outside camps; 964 children were reunified with their families, amajo rity of whom were fromSierra Leone. 329The D urable Solutions Committee in Guinea, comprisedof government officials and members of the UN and NGO communities, has filled a serious gap by finding appropriate solutions for each child left behind after large-scale repatriations. This procedure is expected to become standard practice in refugeesituations. The use of modern technology, including print and broadcast media,is also fa cilitating rapid unification. In Albania, radio, newspapers andtelevision were all successfully employed for this purpose. And in Rwanda,where tens of thousands of children werereunited with their family after the genocide, radio was used to inform parents how and where to find the ir missing c hildren. 330 REMAINING GAPS Launching a timely, well-funded response. Concerted efforts to reunite war-affected children with their families o ftenstarttoolate,sometimes many months or even years after the onset of the emergency. In other cases, insufficie nt resour ces ar eset aside for family tracing and reunification efforts. The consequence is that thousands of separated children may never seetheir families again. T o make matters worse, tracing family members in conflict and politically sensitive situations may not always be feasible. Developing and applying the right policies. Significant gaps remain both in the evolving understanding ofhow best to protect separated childrenin conflict and post-conflict settings,and in securing the expertise needed tooverseethe sy stematic application of guidelines and policies. For example, therearesignificant 'pockets' of separated children, particularly in low-int ensity conflicts, who are often neglected by humanitarian assistance. This points to the need for new policy and p ractice. Unsystematic and inadequate monitoring systems for alternative care arrangements mustbereplaced, especially considering the cr itical ne edfordata o nseparated children in informal, unsupervised foster care. This includes adequate identification of separated children, especiallygirls.Finally, there is still only limited understanding of - and inadequate programme and policyguidance on - the long-term impact of conflict on child separation. 331 Investing in family-based care. NGOs, UN agencies and others need to institute an inter-agency agreementto invest in family-based care rather than orphanages. Resources are also required to sustain family reunifica- tion and reintegration programmes.Kenya \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2008-0477/CranstonRECOMMENDATIONS The 10-year strategic review presented to the General Assembly in 2007 stressed that the prevention of and r esponse t othe separation of children from their families must remain a priority at all stages of a crisis. Specific recommendations towards this end follow: 1. Channel investment to children in family-based care. UN agencies and NGOs should c hanne l resour ces to support and monitor separatedand una ccompanied children in substitute family care. New orphanages should not becreated, and priority should be given to establishing formal foster care and other safe, community-based care options. Emergency residential care should only be provided for those with no otherviable alternatives. 2.Develop a practical inter-agency protocol. UN agencies and international NGOs should develop a practical protocolusable by all actors to provideadequate care and protection of separatedchildren. This should includeassessme nts o f legal and regulatory frameworks, pre-positioned agreements on alternative care arrangements and prepared statements on orphanages, if necessary. 3. Ensure more systematic responses and programmeapplication. Member States, UN agencies, international NGOsand others need to ensure more systematic and early application of relevant policies and guidelinesby all actors in conflict and post- conflict settings. This includes working with governments and/ or local NGOs to create and strengthen 'focal points' forseparated children within child protection networks and child welfarecommittees. 4.Organize capacity building at all levels.UN ag encies and NGOs should organize training for relevant actorsat the nat ional, regional and c ommunity levels on all issues related to the separation of childrenin ar med conflict as part of emergency preparedness. Thisincludes organizing grass-roots awareness campaigns about why orphanag es ar ebadfor children. 5. Continue data collection and monitoring. UN ag encies and NGOs should continue to monitor the situation of separated childrenover time. Governments andagencies should t rack the numbers and conditions of children in alternative family care, residential care and child-headed households, and amo ng othe rhigh-risk groups. Monitoring should be linked toresponse, ensuring compliance with internationally acceptedpolicies and p ractice around reunification, foster care, record- keeping and follow-up. /square6KEY RESOURCES Save the Children, 'Facing the Crisis: Supporting children through positive care options', Save the Children UK, London, 2005.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 151During the past decade, children's involvement in armed forces and groups has garnered significant inter-national attention, sparked in part by the 1996 M achel study. The unlawful recruitment of children is a violation of international law and a source ofphysical, emotional, social and psycholo gical harm. 332Yetdespite widespread initiatives to protect children and young people fromrecruitment, gain their release andreintegrate them into society, manycontinue to suffer and die as a directresult of armed conflict. The term'children associated with ar medforces and groups' refers topersons under 18 years of age who have been recruited or used by an armed force or group in any capacity. This includes but is not limited to fighters, cooks, porters, messengers and spies. It also includes children exploited for sexual purposes. 333 Children forced into combat or non-combat roles risk being killed,injured or permanently disabled.They may be forced to witness or participat ein atrocities. They are deprived of their homes and families and, with that, the opportunity todevelopphysically and emotionally in familiar and protective environments. In many contexts, girls associatedwith armed forces or groups aresubjected to gender-based violence,including sexual violence, and riskcontracting sexually transmittedinfections such as HIV . They may become pregnant or give birth during their time with combatants. In such instances, their children are also exposed to the dangers andhardships of military life and face risks t otheir survival, development and w ell-being. As revealed in the Machel study and s ubse quent reports, the causes of recruitment are many and varied. Children are most vulnerable torecruitment when family and community protection systems are weakened, basic services are lackingand livelihood options are limited. Atparticular risk are children living and working on the street, child labourers, children in conflict with the law andchild victims of sexual exploitation. Famil ymembers can become separated when fleeing from conflict. Y et having escaped the perils of combat z ones is no guarantee of a safe and secure environment. Even camps f orrefugees and the displaced have become targets of parties to conflict. If such camps are not securely guarded, child recruitment is likely toincrease. 334Lack of security in and around camps also increases the vulnerability of children to other rights v iolat ions,including sexual violence and abduction. The types ofassistanc eavailable for a child's release from armed groups oftendetermine his or her ability to make the transition from military to civilian life and to securely integrate into society. For this reason, thedisarmament, demobilization andreintegration (DDR) process involves several long and complicated steps. The Paris Principles define child reintegration as a \"process throughwhich children transition into civil society and assume meaningful rolesand identities as civilians who areaccepted by their families andcommunities, for the most part, in a context of local and national reconciliation.\" They go on to say:\"Sustainable reintegration is achieved whenthe political, legal, economic and social conditions needed for childr entomaintain life, livelihood, and dignity have been secured. This process aims to ensure that childrencan benefit from their rights, formaland no n-formal education, family unity, dignified livelihoods, and safety from harm.\" 335 Thousands of children have been assisted by formal and informal DDRprogrammes. Since 1994, 34 formal processes have been carried out, 22 of them in Africa. 336In Liberia alone,morethan 11,000 c hildr en were registered in formal DDR programmes. Hundreds of millions of dollars are allocated to such pro-grammes each year. They cost anaverage of $1,565 per person. 337 Experts caution that the presence of formal DDR programmes should not be a precondition for the releaseand r eintegration of children. In fact,the majo rity of children who are disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into society do sothrough informal processes. Some 8.10 PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO CHILD RECRUITMENT 152 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDofthese ar echildren who escape acombat situation or are left behind and return directly to their communities. Others are forced into hiding and migrate to urban areas or other countries. For many children, recognition and participation in DDR processes can pla yan imp ortant protection role. In Uganda, the security clearanceand document given to children whowere formerly involved with armed groups g ives them a sense of confidence that they can return to their communities without suspicion. Inan inf ormal demobilization process in east ernDemocratic Republic of the Congo, children askedfordemobilization papers as protection from re-recruitment andfrom being charged as deserters. 338 Experience over the past 10 years has continued to demonstrate thatchildren tend to confront enormouschallenges upon returning to theircommunities. These include social stigma, psychosocial distress, and lack of educational and livelihood options. Successful reintegration, therefore, is one of the most important steps inensuring a child's well-being. WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The 1996 Machel study described the participation of adolescents and children in armed forces and groupsas one o fthe most alar ming t rends in contemporary warfare. It also observed that the \"children most likely to become soldie rs are those from impoverished and marg inaliz edbackgrounds and those who have become separated from their families.\" Byurging that c hild r ecruitment become part of the international peace and security agenda, the study provided the impetus for a deeper look at the issue. At the time of the original Machel study, the move awayfrom the term 'child soldiers' was already under way. A consensusdeveloped around a broader and more inclusive definition focused on 'children associated with armed forces and groups' to ensure that it included not only children with gunsbut also those in a variety of non- combat r oles. PROGRESS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE The M achel study emphasized that \"one o f the most urgent priorities is to remove everyone under 18 years of agefromarmed forces.\" Since that time, progress in both policy and practice has e mergedoutof extensive consul- tations involving multiple stakehold- ers and experience on the ground. Key developments at the global level.Among the highlights of international action against child recruitment are the following: /square6The 1997 Cape T own Principles,339 resulting from a symposium coordinated by UNICEF and the NGO Working Group on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, have been indispensable in developing programmes to demobilize children used by armed forces or groups and reintegrate them into society. /square6The O ptional P rotocol to the CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which enteredinto force in 2002, prohibits the Afghanistan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-0654/Brooks8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 153compulsory recruitment of children below age 18 into national armed forces and armed groups. It requires States to take \"all feasible measures\" to prevent children from participating directly in hostilities. The protocol allows governments to set a minimum voluntary recruitmentage of over 15 years but prohibits anyrecruitment of persons under age 18 by armed groups. While recognizing that States determine their owninternational legal obligations forvoluntary recruitment age, many humani- tarian and h uman r ights actors, including UNICEF, have urged States to set a minimum age of18 in all circumstances. 340 /square6In 2006, standards for the disarmament, demobilization and r eintegration of adults and children were presented to the General Assembly and have since become the basis for DDR pro- grammes sponsored by the United Nations. The standards provide a comprehensive set of guidelines, procedures and policies. 341 /square6The 2007 Paris Principles, a commit ment ma deby66 Member States to date, set legal and operational principles and guidelines to protect children against r ecruitment and use in armed conflict. This non-binding document aims to help practioners ensure that processes lead toimproved care for and protection of children. It provides coherence between governmental commit-ments, international obligations,and programme principles andbest practice. /square6In2007, the F renchMinistry of Foreign Affairs partnered with UNICEF to organize a ministerial- level meeting entitled 'Free Children from War' to defineways to honour commitmentsmadethrough the Millennium Declaration. Through a long con- sultative process, it also sought to update the Cape T own Principlesand othe rtechnical guidance. 342 The p rocess is imp ortant because of the endorsement of the Paris Commitments by 66 States. This nowgives States, UN agencies, NGOs and othe rpartners addi- tional leverage to advocate for preventing unlawful recruitment and supporting the unconditionalrelease and sustainable reintegra-tion of affected children. 343 Anumber of lessons and good practices have been useful in promoting reintegration processes, strengthe ning p rotection efforts and facilitating the transition of children affectedbyarmedconflict into civil society. They include: Developing long-term prevention strategies. Efforts by governments, the United Nations, NGOs and civilsociety have achieved some success inpreventing the recruitment and use of children in armed forces and groups.This includes key legislative andpolicy actions at the national level, suchas ratifying and establishing procedures to implement OPAC. But expanded efforts are needed torespond in a more comprehensiveway to this multifaceted problem. Forexample, while a good deal ofattention in recent years was dedicat ed to reintegrating Guinean children associated with fighting forces in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia andSierra Leone, as milit ia Jeunes Volontaires, veryfew prevention initiatives addressed the risk of ongoing child recruitment. In Liberia, a reintegra- tionprogramme for children sponsored by UNICEF and local and international NGOs, in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs, included only one component to prevent recruitment. In Sierra Leone, reintegration activities ended in 2005, despite ongoing cross-border and regional risks. The long-termprevention of recruitment has not been given priority. 344 Success tends to be found where there is collaboration between UNentities, NGOs and communities tomobilizeresour ces and build on existing capacities. This may involve estab lishing c ommunityprotection networks and sensitizing community leaders to the issue. Experience in Angola suggests that some re-recruit- ment was prevented through an\"After I was taken to the front, they gave me blood to drink, which they said was the first test, and will make me more and more brave.\" - Young man, age not specified, Liberiaextensive community-based network whose members accompanied recruitedchildren from demobilization throughfamily reunification. Officials of the UNIT Arebel force have acknowledged that the family reunification effort obstructed their recruitment or re-recruitment strategies. 345 Another essential step in prevention is counterbalancing young p eople's frustration about the widespread lack of economic oppor- tunities and basic services. As a young woman from Haiti said: \"It should beremembered that many of us are involved in crime and in violence to help our families. There are still no alternatives for us.\" 346Addressing the underlying causes of recruitment means p roviding a range of education, skills training and income-generating opportunities as attractive options to alife of violence. Moreover, reintegration programmes should b eclosely linked to child protection activities. For example, attention should be drawn through public information and awareness-raising a ctivities to the vulnerabilities of specific groups of children at riskof recruitment or re-recruitment.

Inthe D emocratic Republic of the Congo, from December 2003 to September 2004 only 23 girls wereformally demobilized, compared to1,718 boys. 348 There are multiple reasons forthe fr equent exclusion of girls from DDR programmes. Girls maybemarg inalized or isolated by their families and the community due to their involvement in an armedgroup. As a consequence, they are oftendifficult to reach. Many young girls areforced into marriage with combatants, often referred to as 'jungle marriages' or 'bush marriages' , and c ommanders may refuse to release them for demobilization. When these relationships result in pregnancies, girls are often shunned or abused by their families and/or communities. Social and economic opportunities remain extremely limit edto them, and they have described themselves as feelingtrapped. It has been documented that some girls faced with these problemsin Sierra Leone, for instance, haveeither returned to the bush or havethreatened to return. 349 Itis esse ntial todevelop broader, more inclusive and comprehensive supportforreintegration programmes that include girls who may have indirectly become the victims ofconflict. These programmes should be outside of formal DDR processes.Amajor challenge in programme delivery is providing confidentialsupport to girls, so that their associa-tions with combatants are not madeknown to the community, whichcould r esult in discrimination and stigma. 351InSierra Leone, for example, recovery programmes have strongly emphasized the social and economicreintegration of girls. Community-based efforts such as conflict mediation and traditionalhealing practices have succeeded in reducing tensions and discriminationin some communities, resulting ingreater acceptance of returnees. Asexplained by one young woman fromEmp basedorganization in the Gulu district ofUganda, \"Because most of us are formerly abducted children, peoplethought we couldn't do anything. But now they recognize that we haveacontribution to make.\" 352FOLLOW-UP IS KEY TO SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION Areintegration programme that links social workers with children formerly involved with armed forces and groups is proving successful in various parts ofSudan, including Transitional Areas, the east and Khartoum state. The social workers help identify needs, resolve conflicts and make referrals to other social services. The pilot programme, implemented by Save theChildren USA, has also established community child protection networks tocomplement the activities of the social workers. The concept has spread toGedarif state, where the Children's Development Foundation and the StateMinistry of Social Welfare have assigned social workers to every childdemobilized from the town of Bentiu. In the Gula district of nor thern Uganda, community follow-up is provided by volunteer counsellors or caregivers through a programme sponsored bythe Gulu Support the Children Organisation. Volunteers receive a bicycle to facilitate their work. Follow-up, which entails a risk assessment, is usually conducted two weeks after the child's return to the family and/or community,then 3, 6 and 12 months later ,as necessary. 'Low risk' children include those having spent only a short period of time (i.e., a few weeks) with an armedforce or group, non-involvement in atrocities, lack of serious health problemsand having one or both parents still alive. 'High-risk' children include girlswho had children while involved with armed groups and abductees withserious health problems. 350 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 155156 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThere is growing recognition that the skills acquired by recruitedchildren, such as organizational andleadership abilities, can be transferred to civilian life. This recognition highlights the p otential of these skills for empowerment, peacebuilding, peer support, and individual resilienceand au tonomy. Specific strategies for girls' protection should ensure that: /square6Girls who are excluded or unable to participate in DDRprogrammes are reached andgiven a choice to receive assistance.Ideally, they should be contactedthrough networks of other girlswho were associated with armedforces or groups; /square6Assistance involves consulting girls on their needs, encouraging active participation and informing girls of their options. Promoting sustainable reintegration. The long-term success of reintegration depends largely on the availability ofsocial and economic opportunities.Current programmes, however, areoften too short in duration and toolimited in scope to achieve this end.The process of identifying durablesolutions in an unstable and econom-ically deprived post-conflict societyshould not be underestimated. Movingfrom demobilization, transitionalcare and reunification to long-termreintegration poses challenges interms of operations and resourceallocation. It also requires clearlydefined strategies in order to be sustainable. Reintegration should therefore be an overarching priorityduring all phases of the DDR process(including planning, development and imple mentation), from the onset ofpeacenegotiations to long-term development strategies. Adecadeofprogramming knowledge has encouraged a turn towards more effective and diverse approaches to reintegration - approaches that are inclusive, flexible,grounded in the community and based on child rights. Follow-up or monitoring activities should beconducted regularly \"to monitor the living c onditions of the demobilized children, the quality of their relation- ship with family members and thelevelof their reintegration into the community, and ... allow mediation of disputes when necessary\" . 353 REMAINING GAPS Despite the widespread ratification of related treaties and commitmentsmadebygovernments, major progress is yet to be seen in preventing the recruitment and use of children inarmed conflict. Significant investmentis urg ently needed in programme assistance for effective reintegrationsupport. Other priorities have beenidentified in numerous programme evaluations and review processes: Extending the age limit for inter- ventions. Most child protection agencies and initiatives are specifi-cally focused on children. Although many young people were recruited and used by armed forces or armed groups when they were children, they may be older than 18 by the time of demobilization. However, they still require assistance in the transition toadulthood. Recently, collaboration has expanded among key UN agencies, including the International Labour Organization (ILO), UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), along with NGOs, to develop more coherent programmes f oryoung men and women aged 15 to 24. A key area is economic support, which continuestobeamajo rchallenge.Recent ILO experience, for example, suggests that bolstering the livelihood skills ofyouth is not enough. Their parents and guardians also need economic assistance to ensure that older children have access to education as part of the reintegration process. 354 Providing 'catch-up' programmes in literacy, life skills and vocational training. Young people who have misse doutonschooling and training opportunities are likely to be unemplo yedand marginalized. This incr eases the ir vulnerability torecruitment and gender-based violence. Those with a limited ability toread and write require skills that can both lead to a livelihood and confer a measure of protection. In fact, both formal and non-formal education, along with skills training, can make a significant difference in\"There are many of us who do not have jobs or anything. Some people in my family still fear me because they still believe I have the 'bush trick' in me; we get the evil eye and are discriminated against. There is nowhere to go.\" - Young man, 22, Sierra Leone 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 157whether a child or young person reintegrates successfully.355 In many contexts, it has been useful to combine literacy and non- formal e ducation programmes with activities devoted to income-generation and life skills. For young people withmore developed skills, promotingopportunities to secure a livelihoodmust b eapriority. For children who havebeen released from armed groups - as w ell as others who have missed out on education because of the conflict - the emphasis needs tobeon'catch-up' programmes in basic literacy and vocational training. Increasing job opportunities for youths. Inmany post-conflict societies, young people have little choice but to remain unemployed oraccept short-term, hazardous or exploitative work.356In Sierra Leone, for example, children formerly associatedwith armed forces or groups have drifted back to mining areas,working as low-paid diamond diggers because they lack education andsafeopportunities to earn income. 357 Support for livelihood development can only partially succeed if it doesnot take into account the realities ofpost-conflict economies or the specific challenges ofurban and rural envi- ronments. Training programmes often meetonlyshort-term needs, including psychosocial needs, but fail to provide afoundation for long-term employ- ment. For example, young people learn skills that are not really marketableand are streamed into saturated markets in particular vocations,such as carpentry or hairdressing. Typically, the biggest obstacle is the barely functional state of local economies. Employment opportuni- ties are virtually non-existent, people havelittle inc ome, and costs are high asaresult of competition for scarceresources. Such conditions make effective programming especiallychallenging, particularly for reinte- gration programmes. For all these reasons, vocational preparation programmes need to offer young people competitive and adaptable skills as well as substantially longer-term training in such fields FARMING AND LIFE SKILLS BOOST CHANCES THAT CHILDREN IN SUDAN WILL REJECT VIOLENCE In South Kordofan (Sudan) a programme sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is teaching agricultural andlife skills to children and young people as an alternative to violence. TheJunior Farmer Field and Life Schools, which complement formal education,teach both traditional and modern agricultural practices. Students learnsowing and transplanting, weeding, irrigation, pest control, and the use andconservation of resources. Life skills are also emphasized, such as HIVawareness and prevention, nutrition education and business skills.Participants also receive psychosocial suppor t. Even students who eventually opt out of farming as their primary livelihood are acquiring practical skills, such as gardening for subsistence, and are demonstratinggreater confidence and self-esteem.

A combination ofeducation, apprenticeships andvocational training in collaborationwith the private sector, if possible,can often be effective. According to a joint UN agency policy paper on the subject, \"There is some evidence that youth inter- ventions have so far relied too heavilyon the supply side (building up skil ls) as o pposed to increasing job opportunities for trained youth.\" 358 Policies involving private-public sector partnerships to encourage job placements are recommended.Moving from targeted to community- based assistance. In the 10-year interval between development of theCape T own Principles and the Paris Principles, there was a marked shift away from targeted assistance to community-based support for childrenassociated with armed conflict. Thisoccurred partly because assistance tospecific g roups o f children tended toperpetuate stigma. The targeted approach also had the unanticipated consequence of stirring up jealousies and social divisions at a time whenunitywas d esperately needed. Moreover, such an approach may haveinadvertently encouraged recruitment and re-recruitment by creating the impression that joining an ar medforce or group could potentially yield rewards. Similarly, cash benefits to returning children are also now widely regarded as inappropriate. Stipends or cash benefits can be viewed as rewarding demobilized soldiers, whichcan divide communities. They can also create incentives for somecommand ers to re-recruit children to benefit from their demobilization.In the case of Liberia, for example, a'transitional allowance' of $300 wasprovided to the parent or guardian ofeachdemobilized child after his orher return to the community. Consequently,the programme quickly drew the attention of children who had not been recruited or taken part in host ilities. Naturally, their families were anxious to join the demobilizationINNOVATIVE JOB PROGRAMMES GENERATE OPTIONS FOR FORMER COMBATANTS IN SRI LANKA High-quality vocational training options are now more widely available to demobilized soldiers in Sri Lanka, thanks to programmes developed by ILO,GTZ, UNICEF and World University Service of Canada, in partnership withthe Ministry of Labour and local groups. The success of these initiatives,which have diminished somewhat due to the escalation of violence in 2007,is attributed to linking courses to government accreditation procedures and employment networks. Other innovative features include attention tologistical challenges faced by aspiring students, such as by offering coursesin rural locations. Also offered are toolkits and help in finding work followingcompletion of a course, such as contacts with potential employers and links to microcredit. In one of the initial GTZ courses, five private-sectorauto-repair garages took on all the graduates for further on-the-job trainingand placement.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 159process in order to receive financial remuneration.359For these and other reasons, current thinking on thesubject emphasizes support to all childr enaffected by armed conflict and their inclusion within strategies for post-conflict recovery. There will always be, however, circumstances in which specializedagencies w illneed to deliver services tocertain segments of the population. Examples inc lude girls who are mothers or people living with HIV . An inclusive approach essentiallymeans that a p rogramme can provide tailo redservices to a group of children with sp ecial circumstances while also r esponding to a wider range of vulnerabilities. This poses many programming challenges, including finding ways to balance support to specific groups with the imperative to build a protective environment for all children affected by armed conflict, particular ly when funding is scarce. In Uganda, several humanitarian organizations have attempted to develop programmes centred on thecauses o fvulnerability rather than focusing on a particular group. Thisis proving to be effective, althoughthe criteria used to identify vulnera-bilities are still being refined. 360 Ensuring that p rogramming meets the needs of all children is intrinsical lylinkedwith funding channels and disbursement. Often, limited funds for DDR processes areearmarked for specific target groups and interventions, whichlimits the flexibility and inclusivity of programmes. Providing long-term funding for formal and informal DDR processes. Reintegration is the most expensive component of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, partly because effective programming requires longer-term solutions. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the resources invested in DDR programmes go to reinsertionand reintegration. 361 Because DDR programmes occur during t ransitional post-conflict periods, funding mechanisms do not necessarily have a long-term horizon.And it has been difficult to obtain funding and a dvocacy support for moreinformal DDR programmes for children, especially while a conflict is ongoing. Fortunately, donors are recognizing the value of release and r eintegration programmes for children in advance of formal peace and DDR p rocesses, including the role that such programmes can play in preventing re-recruitment. Asagreed by the agencies and governments that subscribed to the Paris Principles and Paris Commit- ments, longer-term commitments should last a minimum of three to fiveyearsand aim f orsustainab le integration or reintegration in formal and inf ormal p rogrammes. In addition, there must be better understanding and r ecognition of post-conflict and t ransitional environments that experience low-level, chronic conflict.RECOMMENDATIONS The 10-year review of the Machel study presented to the GeneralAssembly in 2007 called attention tothe fa ctthat the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of children requires programming outsideofformal DDR processes. It emphasized that reintegration has \"wide-ranging aims, different for each boy and girl involved, including building emotional trust andreconciling with family and com- munity, providing access to education and developing a means of livelihood.\" Among other recommendations, the report stressed that reintegration programmes should include all children affected by conflict. It also said that s uch programmes must be comprehensive and long term if they aretosucceed in preventing future recruitment. Additional recommen- dations follow: 1.Ens ureadequatefinancial support to prevent child recruitment. Donors should significantly increase the amountof flexible, long-term funding availab le forpreventing child recruitment and r e-recruitment. UN agencies and international NGOs should advocate forfunding commitments to last a minim um o fthree years and to includeabiann ual r eview by the follow-up forum established by the Paris Principles. This will ensure that programme targets\"If the organization doesn't provide machines after training, [the training] is as good as useless. It's like teaching someone to hunt without giving them a spear.\" -Young men, 18, Ugandaare met and programming gaps funded. 2. Provide technical assistance to develop appropriate policies and strategies. Humanitarian agencies should provide Stateswith coordinated assistance todevelop policies to prevent recruitment, as well as for the release, demobilization and rein- tegration of children and youngpeople associated with armedforces or groups. Additionally, States, UN agencies and NGOsshould formalize a technicalgroup with a mandate and budgetto monitor technical implementa-tionand t oshareknowledge and experiences on good practice - both globally and nationally.3. Develop a stronger base of evidence on which to devise future strategies. Donors and protection agencies should invest more on research and evaluation to enhance the knowledge base onreintegration support and informal and formal DDR processes. Particular attention should begiven to children who do notparticipate in a formal demobi- lizationprocess. Multiple lessons and assessments from formal DDR exercises in Africa need to be cross-analysedwith those fr om Asia and othe rregions and in contexts outside of peace accords and formalmechanisms. Expanded research collaborationwith academic institutions could augment the rigour of methodologies.4. Ensure that reintegration strategies do not discriminate and do align with international standards. UN agencies, inter- national organizations and NGOsshould ensure that reintegrationstrategies are consistent with the Paris Principles and the UN Integrated Disarmament, Demo-bilizat ionand R eintegration Standards. They should cover all children affected by conflict, not only those associated witharmedforces or groups. Strategies should adhere to rights-based and inclusive community-based approaches and should involve allsectors.Support should be sensitive to the child's gender and appropriate for his or her age. 5. Focus on livelihood support. Member States, UN agencies and NGOs must better integrate reintegration concerns for childr en into broader national strategies and socio-economic frameworks. They should heavily emphasize links between education, skills training and socio-economic development as an imp ortant goal for peace- building and a st rategy to prevent recruitment and re-recruitment. They should also promote safe private-sector initiatives to create an economically viable environment for the reintegration of children and youth. /square6KEY RESOURCES Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, <www.child-soldiers.org/home>.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 161Gender-based violence is a broad term for violence directed at an individual because of his or her gender. It includes domestic physical abuse, sexual violence, harmful traditional practices (such as female genital mutilation/cutting and childhood marriage) and sex trafficking. Gender-based violence is funda- mentally rooted in gender inequality and discr iminat ion,affecting women and g irls disproportionately. Nearly one third of adolescent girls worldwide report that their first sexual experiencewas forced. 362Almost half of all sexual assaults ar eagainst g irls 15 years or age of younger.363One out of three women has been physically or sexually abused at some point in her lifetime.364 But the peacetime reality of gender-based violence pales in com- parison with what occurs during warand its aftermath. Although clearly prohibited under international law, systematic violence against women and girls is often employed to achieve military or political objectives. It may includesuchactions as terrorizing and displacing communities, providing incentives for irregularly paid rebels to bear arms and using torture during interrogations. Sexual violence has become an increasingly common aspect of contemporary warfare, although its full scopeis difficult t oquant ify b ecause of under-reporting and data-collectionchallenges. It is well known that boysare victimized by sexual violence aswell as girls. However, it is also clearthat adolescent girls tend to be the first to be victimized during armedconflict and in conditions of severeeconomic hardship. The consequences can be grave. Sexual violence can have lifelong implications for a child'swell-being and physical and emotionaldevelopment. Apart from serious psychological effects, sexual violencecan cause severe physical harm,including genital lesions, traumaticfistula and other wounds. Additionaleffects are unwanted pregnancies andthe danger of contracting HIV andother sexually transmitted infections. Rape victims 365and children born of rape often experience rejection,stigma, fear and increased povertyupon their return home. In Burundi, survivors revealed that \"they had been mocked, humiliated and rejected bywomen relatives, classmates, friendsand neighbours because of the abuse theyhadsuffered.\" 366 In both emergency and post- conflic tcontexts, high rates of unemployment, lack of basic services, and the breakdown in community infrastructure and social structure limit economic opportunities and social protection. Poverty and a lack of options for earning a livelihood make young girls especially vulne- rable, leading to a high risk of sexual exploitation. Such children may migrate in sear chofsaferenvironments or to gain access to shelter and basic services. Subsistence income is frequentlysought through dangerous and illegal activities such as the sex trade. This isparticularly prevalent in capitals and big cities. In camp settings, girls may engage in sex as a means to obtain food, protection and/or basic necessities suchas plast ic sheeting for shelter. Explo itationcan be exacerbated when assistance to camp populations is decreased, either as a means to encourage repatriation or due totechnical or funding difficulties. Trafficking for sexual exploitation continues to be at the forefront ofrisks to children - girls as well as boys. Conflict zones are often the point of origin and the transit routes fortrafficking as well as destination areas.Warlords and armed forces regularly seek to profit from criminal activities and are in a position to exploit children who may be displaced. Trafficking that leads to enslave- ment,prostitution and rape can constitute a war crime. In most countries, it is a violation of domestic penal law. Nevertheless, it appears tobeflour ishing , with international organized crime gangs and mafias/ cartels playing a significant role. Frequently, trafficked children do not return to their community or country of origin for fear of furtherhuman rights violations, such asretribution by traffickers, stigma by their communityorthe r isk o f being trafficked again. And they often face difficult ies w henapplying for refugee status because asylum countries are oftenreluctant to recognize the need forinternational protection on these grounds alone.8.11 ENDING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL EXPLOITATION WHAT THE MACHEL STUDY SAID The Machel study raised several issues involving the dangers faced by women and girls in times of war. \"Rape poses acontinual threat to women and girls during armed conflict, as do otherforms of gender-based violenceincluding prostitution, sexualhumiliation, mutilation, traffickingand d omestic violence,\" the study said. \"While ab uses such as murder and torture have long been denounced as war cr imes, rape has been down- playedas an unf ortunat ebut inevitable side effect of war.\" The study emphasized that acts of violence, particularly rape,committed directly against civilianpopulations during armed conflicts constitute a violation of international law. It also noted the significant challenges associated in applyinginternational humanitarian law and human rights law. The recom-mendations called for appropriatelegal remedies to reflect the nature of the crime. The study highlighted the interaction of military and lawenforcement personnel and humani- tarian aid workers with children, articulating the importance of holding the maccountable for their actions as an int egral part of preventing gender-based violence.GETTING TO THE REALITY OFGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE The Columbia University Program on Forced Migration and Health is developing a novel methodology - the 'neighbourhood' method - tocapture incidence rates of gender-based violence in places where reportingmechanisms are suspected to significantly underestimate the magnitude of the problem. Using this method, a relatively small sample of women is interviewed about domestic and sexual violence experienced by them, their neighboursand other specified 'universes' of women and girls. For example, in fourcamps for internally displaced persons across one district in northernUganda in late 2006 and early 2007, 204 respondents reported on theexperiences of 268 sisters and 1,206 neighbours. The method revealedalarming rates of domestic violence and rape. An appalling 42 per cent ofwomen had been beaten in family violence during the preceding year alone. The rates are much higher when viewed across multiple years. The neighbourhood method gathers multiple estimates, rather than relying on a single source of data, to determine the incidence of gender - based violence. It also provides a practical, efficient means of collecting information vital for programming. The method provides information on the magnitude and nature of physical violence against women and girls that is relevant for both programme development and advocacy .It also reveals reporting and disclosure trends and provides a baseline against which to measure change over time.

The need to increase protection from sexual and gender-based violence hasbeenreceiving heightened attention in Member States, non-governmental organizations and the United Nations system itself. However, tangible progress has been incremental. In 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court recognized that acts of sexual violence committed in a situation of armedconflict can constitute a war crime. Wars in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda le dtostrong provisions on sexual v iolencein the I nternational Criminal Court and resulted in important p rosecutions. More recently, arrest warrants have been issuedagainst p erpetrators of gender- base dviolence and other crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and Uganda. In October 2000, Security Council Resolution 1325, a non-bindingpolicy fr amework, called on parties in armed conflict to implement special measures to protect women and girls fromgender-based violence. The Security Council has also begun to examine the issue of systematicviolence against women as a threat tointernational peace and security. Thiswas evidenced by the specific call forreporting on efforts taken to protectwomen in some mandate renewals.And in July 2005, Security CouncilResolution 1612 called for systems to monitorand report certain violations ofchild r ights perpetrated by armed groups o rforces in armed-conflict settings.These inc luderape and sexual v iolenceagainst c hildr en. InJune 2008, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1820, which recognizes the new role sexual violence has taken on in contemporary conflict and post-conflict settings. The resolution reiterates that sexual violence is a war crime, a crime against humanityand a constituent act of genocide. Itadvances efforts to sanction perpetra- tors and raise the political, military and economic costs of such violence. Increasingly, stakeholders are working together to ensure systematicand comprehensive responses at theglobal, regional, national and local Liberia \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-0664/Pirozzi164 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDlevels.One of the mechanisms for partnerships has been the cluster approach, which was developed as a way to strengthen the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance. Establishing rules of conduct for national and international personnel. Much attention has been drawn to the role sometimes played bypeacekeepers and humanitarian workers in perpetrating sexualviolence and exploitation. At the time of the 1996 Machel study,discussion of the issue was mostlykeptbehind closed doors. Although evidence of abuse continues, the problem is now openly acknowledged, and measures such as codes of conduct and reporting systems havebeenputin pla ce. During the past decade, the United Nations and other international organizations have issued standards of conduct tostaff, provided training to personnel 367 and p romulgated zero-tolerance policies along with terms for impunities and jurisdictions of military and civilian employees.368 Most recently, in December 2007the General Assembly adopted Resolution 62/214, the United Nations Comprehensive Strategy onAssistance and Support to Victims ofSexual Exploitation and Abuse by United Nations Staff and Related Personnel. The strategy reaffirms theSecretary-General's zero-tolerancepolicy on sexual exploitation andsupports implementation of a comprehensive approach throughout the UN sy stemto assist victims of such abuse by UN staff and related personnel. Strengthening the United Nations' response. Anewinter-agency initiative, UN Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict (UN Action), is committed to scaling up the UN response to sexual violence during and imme diately after conflict. UN Action builds upon and reinforces the efforts of 12 UN system entities toprotect women from rape during war and respond to the needs of survivors. It aims to align the United Nations' work more effectively behindnational e fforts (both government and NGO) to address sexual violence. The need for concerted action is clear: Despite international andnational legislation to prevent and redress g ender-based violence, enforcement still faces extensive challenges.Forone, national and international conflicts undermine legal systems; in some cases, legislation is disregarded or circumvented procedurally. 369SETTING AN EXAMPLE: CODES OF CONDUCT FOR UN AND NON-UN PERSONNEL In an effort to put an end to sexual violence by aid workers and others, dozens of United Nations entities and other organizations have signed the Statement of Commitment on Eliminating Sexual Exploitation and AbusebyUN and Non-UN Personnel, issued in December 2006. The principles contained within it are addressed to all those involved in programmedelivery, including international and national UN staff as well as employees of national partner organizations. The statement is just one of a series of similar actions, prompted by reports of sexual abuse. The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, for example, has instituted specific conduct-related measures for each peacekeepingmission. These measures include designating areas where prostitution is suspected or known to occur as off-limits to mission personnel and requiring personnel to wear their uniforms at all times when outside theirbarracks. The department is also piloting a comprehensive data trackingand repor ting system on misconduct allegations for all categories of personnel in UN peacekeeping missions. Once completed, the system willprovide an important means for monitoring misconduct. It will also helpensure that prior offenders are not rehired or deployed.Further complicating matters is that man yStates deny the existence of sexual violence and use harassment,intimidation and the closing oftreatment facilities to preventhumanitar ian ag encies from treating abused children and young people. Insome so cieties, girls who have reported rape have been charged with a dultery. In others, a rape victim may be forced to marry the rapist, or the p erpetrator may be required to pay a small fine, often given to the family rather than the survivor. Under some legal systems, proving rape is almost impossible and has traditionally exposed victims tohumiliating and traumatic lines of questioning. Consequently,perpetrators are not penalized andsurvivors are doubly victimized. It can be especially difficult ENDING THE ATROCITIES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 'Stop Raping our Greatest Resource: Power to W omen and Girls of the Democratic Republic of the Congo' is a global campaign to call attention to systematic rape and other atrocities being committed against women and girls in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It also demands an end to impunity for perpetrators of such violence. The campaign, initiatedby local women, the NGO 'V-Day' and UNICEF (representing UN Action),encourages collaboration with local par tners and sur vivors. It is sponsoring social mobilization activities such as educational workshops, and outreach via a website, music, theatre, radio and print materials. 8.

During the past d ecade, a number of manuals, guidelines and training kitshave been produced to improve the efficiency and quality of responses togender-based violence. The develop-ment of these tools demonstrates greaterinter-agency cooperation and partnership. Some of the most widely consulted guidelines currentlyinclude the IASC's Guidelines forGender-based Violence Interventionsin H umanitar ian S ettings: Focusing onPrevention of and Response to Sexual Violence in Emergencies and UNHCR's 2003 Sexual and Gender-Based Violence againstRefugees, Returnees and Internally Displa ced Persons: Guidelines for Prevention and Response. The IASC guidelines were developed so that communities, governments and humanitarian actors could establish and coordinate asetof minimum interventions in each sector to prevent and respond to sexual violence during the early phase o fan emergency. Similarly, the UNHCR guidelines provide a framework for preventing and responding to gender-based violencein displa cement contexts. They include special considerations forrefugee children. In 2007, an inter-agency task force was created to focus on the specific v ulne rabilities of women and c hildren who collect firewood in camps and othe remergency settings. The aim is to identify ways to enhance protection and ease burdens for those responsible for this task, while also developing strategiesMITIGATING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FIREWOOD COLLECTION370 In many developing countries, gathering firewood is the primary responsi- bility of women and girls. Wood is often essential for cooking and heating,and its sale can provide income to meet a family's basic needs. But thesafety risks associated with firewood collection have been well documentedover the past decade, and very few strategies to overcome them have beenimplemented. Exceptions are those devised by the Women's Commissionfor Refugee Women and Children, which is working to reduce the vulnera-bility of girls and women to violence while carrying out this task in andaround camps for refugees and displaced persons. The project is assessingalternative fuel options, firewood collection techniques and protectionmechanisms. It advocates a multifaceted approach to the problem,including physical protection, alternative sources of cooking fuel and moreefficient technologies, as well as the provision of ser vices. Exper ts caution, however, that alternative income-generating activities are needed if the strategies are to succeed.\"Young boys faced different types of physical abuse, whereas young women were raped during the war and they were traumatized. Because of the mentality in Kosovo, these women do not talk much about what they have experienced.\" -Young men, 16-19, Kosovo 8. THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 167to reduce the harmful environmental impact of energy production. Forging an integrated, multi- sectoral approach. While it is cr itical to improve security in camps andothe remergency settings to protect girls fromexploitation and abuse, these measures are unlikely to be effective without assistance that meets the ir real ne eds,including a viable means of earning a livelihood. Good practice in programming andstrategies to end gender-based violence therefore rely increasingly on multi-sectoral, integrated approaches. They include legal support, provision of security,psychosocial and health care, prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV , emergency contraception, and educational and livelihood support. Gender-based violence is deeply rooted in structural and systemic inequalit y, so initiatives have also been undertaken to advance the overall status of girls. Experiencesuggests that, whenever possible, interventions should build on existing structures and networks within nat ional minist ries or departments to ensure sustainability. REMAINING GAPS Morethan a d ecade after the 1996 Machel study, abusive and exploita-tive conditions continue to endangerchildren and their families. Theultimate goal - ending gender-basedviolence against civilians during and in the wak eof war - remains elusive. The need for more effective prevention mechanisms and protection strategies is stronger than ever. In addition, greater attention should be paid to the lo ng-termimpact of gender- based violence. More effort and resources are also required to address impunit yfor perpetrators and to assist survivors, particularly through child-specific responses. Building better prevention mechanisms. Without advances in the status of girls and equal opportunities, eliminating violence against g irls willbedifficult at b est. More effort is required to target discr iminat ionand violent behaviour on the part of men and boys, instil in them a respect for human rights, and e nlist the mas protectors of women and girls. The emphasisshould be on behaviour change throughcommunication and dissemination of public information onunacceptable behaviours. The aim is to foster attitudes that promote gender equality. Ending impunity for perpetrators and creating integrated systems ofprotection. Althoug hagrowing number of countries have laws to address gender-based violence,enforcement is generally weak. Additional national legislation and enforcement are required to protectchildren from the specific criminalnatureofsexual violence during conflic t.This m ust b ecoupled with efforts to ensure that survivors are able toaccess effective justice mechanisms. At the same time, the need for broader, more holistic systems of child protection must be acknowledged and acted upon.SENSITIZING THE POLICE TO GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE In Sierra Leone, special police units have been established to address gender-based violence and sexual assault. Since 2001, 143 of these FamilySupport Units have been created around the country, developing a close working relationship with the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs. A training programme for unit officers has been expandedto include aspects of child protection, and it is demonstrating how tocollaborate effectively with social workers during investigations.

Typically there are insufficient trained health and social servicesstaff, weak implementation of guidelines, and a lack of minimum standar ds in p rogramming, particu- larly with regard to responses specifically directed to children. This was c onfirmedbyarecent rapid assessment in Kenya. It revealed that in virtually all settings, including camps and communities, efforts to address g ender-based violence were restrictedby lack of resources and inadequate capacity across all service- delivery sectors. Mobilizing the ne cessary funds. In 2006, a study of projects addressingsexual violence analysed fundingthrough the Consolidated Appeals Process (the h umanitar ian se ctor's main funding body for emergencies). The study showed that these projects received significantly less fundingthan other thematic areas of humani-tarian intervention during complexemergencies. Projects focusing specif- ically on sexual violence receivedapproximately 21 per cent of funding requested, whereas all other areas ofhumanitarian work received approxi-mately59 p ercent of emergency funding requested. 371 RECOMMENDATIONS The 10-year review of the Machel study presented to the GeneralAssembly in 2007 stressed the protection of children from gender- based conflict as well as the specific needs of child survivors \"as distinct from those of women.\" It called forcommunity awareness campaigns and education initiatives that reach out to boys and men as well as measures to enhance the livelihood options for women and girls. In addition, it urged stronger efforts on the part of Member States and the UN system to investigate and address allegations of abuse. Other, morespecific recommendations follow: 1. Collaborate for comprehensive and direct service provision. UN agencies, relevant ministries and NGOs should collaboratethrough the UN Action against Sexual Violencein Conflict initiativetoscale up assistanc efor child s urvivors. This multi-sectoral to child- specific, gender-sensitive and age-appropriate approaches; andintegration of free services for survivors into existing institutions. 2.Ens ure access to justice for children. Governments should protect children from gender- base dviolence, and UN agencies and NGOs should support and encouragegovernments as they adopt and apply appropriate legislation.Systematic, child- sensitive and timely investigation and p rosecution of violations should be ensured while taking intoaccount the well-being and safety of survivors, including those in camps f orrefugees and internally displaced persons. Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2005-0944/Haviv3. Implement non-negotiable and systematic codes of conduct. UN agencies and international NGOs should implement stan-dardized and systematic codes ofconduct regarding sexual violence and e xplo itationthat should include a unified zero-tolerance policy for all humanitarian staff,peacekeepers, and international and national partners. Specifically, this should include trainingpeacekeepers, and law enforce-ment officers to address the needs ofgirls and t orespond to allegations; providing progress reports to the UN Secretary-General oncombating sexual exploitation and abuse from staff of UN agencies and NGOs; and preparing child-friendly complaint mechanisms. 4.Programme for education and livelihood support. UN agencies, international partnersand NGOs should supportaccessible education and liveli- hood measures based on compre- hensive analyses that focus ongirls and their families for prevention of exploitation and abuse, empowerment of women and g irls, and social protection. Specifical ly,this inc ludes par tner- ships with the private long-term and apprenticeshipopportunities; vocational andskills training; participatorymarket assessments; and micro-loans and credit. In addition, these measures should adhere to international labour standards, such as ILO Conventions 182, which calls for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, and 138, whichestab lishes a minim um ag e for employment. 5.Invest in changing attitudes and behaviours. T o challenge the social, cultural, economic and political determinants of violence,UN ag encies and NGOs should ensure adequate resources are investedin pub lic inf ormation and e ducation strategies thataddress men and boys. This implies promotion of gender-equitable attitudes and behaviours in communities, and participation of youth in developing key messages and campaigns. 6. Provide substantial and long- termfunding t odevelop comprehensive strategies. Overall, funds are inadequate to address the extent of theproblem and meet the needs of survivors. Increased, predictableand s ustaine dfunding by donors is a necessity, while diversion of funding fr omothe rareas m ust beavoided. /square6 KEY RESOURCES Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 'Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Guidelines for prevention and response', UNHCR, May 2003, <www.rhrc.org/pdf/gl_sgbv03.pdf>.

THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 169Uganda \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2004-1176/LeMoynePREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE9172 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDMore than a decade ago, Gra\u00e7a Machel challenged us to moveforward, not just by mitigating theeffects of war on children but bypreventing it in the first place. Preventing conflict and building peace are long-term processes that need to be sustainable. Establishing afoundation for peace means creating the sy stems and st ructures that allow for the full functioning of society, and creating the capa cities that can he lp people resolve conflicts non-violently. Childr enand y oung p eople must play a key role in this process -not only because peace and securityare basic ingredients for the fullrealization of children's rights butbecause children are such a large proportion of the world's people.In many countries, more than halfthe population is under the age of25, and often under age 18. 372 All too often, children are seen as victims and youth are belittled as asource of problems. If their energy is channelled creatively, however, childr enand y oung people can become powerful forces for peace. Allconflic tprevention strategies and interventions, both on the ground and at the p olicy le vel,should b e pursued with the active participation of children and young people - in away that is inclusive and matches their evolving capacities.GIVING FORM TO CONCEPT Conflict prevention does not seek to end conflict per se but to replace violence or armed conflict with non-violent responses and resolution. Althoug hconflicts are not always rational, finding ways to avoid them makes good sense. As some analysts argue, it is far less costly to prevent armed conflicts than to respond to themoncethey have started. 373Itis estimated that every dollar spent on prevention can potentially save the international community more than four dollars.374 Conflict prevention has come to mean taking a dist inctlyproactive stance in response to volatile situations. Since conflicts result from numerous influences at many levels, preventing themrequires action at the local, national, regional and inter-regional levels. At the same time, a 'culture of peace' must be promoted, based on the principles of tolerance, rights, responsibilities, reconciliation and coexistence. Inthe w ords of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, preventing conflicts requires that we \"understand their origins and seek to make violence a less reasonable option. We must also take care that preventive action does not ignore the underlying injustices or motivations that caused people to take up arms.\"375 Inapassag emorespecific to children, the following statement, adopted at the 2000 International Conference on War-Affected Children in Winnipeg as a follow-up to the United Nations Headquar ters \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2002-0105/Markisz9. PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 173Machel study, also drew attention to root causes as well as practicalmeasures to prevent conflict: States, international and regional organizat ions, NGOs, community leaders, the private sector and youthmust address, in concrete terms, the root causes of conflict, includinginequity, poverty, racism, ineffective governance and impunity, which leadtothe d enial o f children's economic, social, cultural, civil and p olitical r ights.Wecommit to practical and comprehensive conflict prevention measures, including conflict prevention initiatives, mediation,child p rotection networks, early warning and response systems, alternatives for adolescents at risk, and the promotion of conflict resolutionskills and e ducation. 376 Both conflict prevention and peace- building require the willingness and capacity of the population to resolveconflict by non-violent means, which must be sustained through generations. Y et sadly, one of the best predictors of future conflict ishaving r ecently emerged from one: About half the countries transitioning from war will likely slip back into conflict within a decade. 377According toone assessme nt, all 'new' conflicts in 2005 and 2006 were actually post-conflict relapses. 378 In response, and in order to drawinternational attention and resour ces to the 'transition gap' between humanitarian and develop-ment operations, the United Nations established a Peacebuilding Commis- sion in 2005. It now refers to 'peace- building' as a specific set of activities designedtoassist post-accord countries in moving from war tosustainable peace. However, there are inherent complexities in defining and meas uring p eace and conflict prevention.Despite the creation of the commission, no clearly articulated peacebuilding paradigmor timeline has emerged. A 2006 United Nations Capacity in Peace- building Inventory highlighted this as one o fthe greatest challenges in operationalizing peacebuilding and in determining what constitutes a 'successful' peace. 379The same ambiguity remains today. That said, two points are clear: First, peacebuilding and conflict prevention involve many of the same actions on the ground because they aim f orthe same ou tcome. Second, children and young people need to be an integral part of any peacebuilding orconflic tprevention strategy or intervention, in any sector, for the results to be durable. In addition, child-sp ecific indicat ors should be developed to measure peace. WHA TTHE MACHEL STUDY SAID Gra\u00e7a Machel was very clear in 1996: We can spend a lot of energy and resources protecting children from the impact of war, but the mosteffective form of protection is to prevent war in the first place while promoting peace and reconciliation.\"The International Community must shatt erthe p olitical inertia that allows circumstances to escalate into armedconflict and destroy children's lives,\" the Machel study urged. \"This the root sustainable and equitablepatterns of human development.\" Butthe Machel study went beyond this, recognizing the fundamental nature of children's contributions to building a lasting peace in their societies. Mrs. Machel wrote that \"partofputting children at the centre means using y outh as a resource.\" In 2007, the Machel review presented to the General Assembly emphasized the centrality of childrento conflict prevention and peace-building by stating that all efforts should b emade to integrate and mainstream children's concerns intosuchprocesses. PROGRESS AND GAPS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE Sincethe mid-1990s, the international community, including the United Nations, regional organizations and NGOs, has made some progress inbuilding a foundation for peace. Linking global and local efforts. In 2006, then Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted that a \"culture ofprevention\" was taking root at theUnited Nations. 380Policymakers \"I believe that a change can occur. War can be stopped.\" -Young woman, 15, Pakistan174 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDand studies, including the World Report on Violence against Children, increasingly cite prevention as thewayforward in terms of protecting children and young people and addressing their concerns. 381The 2007 World Programme of Action for Y outh pointed to peace and securityas the c hief elements necessary to achieve the goals it laid out. 382And on 12 February 2008, the President of the Security Council said in a written statement: \"The Security Council stresses ... the need to adopt a broad strategy of conflict prevention, whichaddresses the r oot causes o farmed conflict in a comprehensive manner, in order to enhance the protection of children on a long-term basis.\" 383 Creating a culture of prevention and a cult ure of peace require building institutions and capacities at all levels.Although some progress has been made at the global level (partic- ularlyin policy making) and at the country level, the links are few and far b etween. Country-level interven- tions are still not as strategic, system- atized,well documented or supported as they should be. The opposite is also t rue - g lobal policymaking is often not fully informed by country- level experiences. Local knowledge and networks, linkedinternationally, are essential for effective strategies both to protectthe rights of children and to enablethemtocontribute meaningfully. One noteworthy example is the GlobalPartnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict, a network of morethan 1,000 civil society organizations formed in 2005. As stated in its Global Action Agenda, effective strategies combine 'bottom-up' and 'top-down'action, but local ownership is essential. 384 While few child-focused or youth organizations have yet to become partof the network, the Global Partnershiphas se lected peace education and conflict resolution in schools as the first pilot project for its Knowledge Generationand Shar ing N etwork. 385 The Alliance of Civilizations, created in 2005 under the auspices of the United Nations, also identified youthas a priority for its work. In seekingtointegrate a youth perspective into all its projects, including cross- cultural and inter-religious dialogues,the Alliance collaborates with broadnetworks of youth organizationsaround the world. 386 Creating effective early warning systems. Conflict prevention, like any risk management strategy, alsorequires careful diagnosis and 'upst ream'action, well before a crisis breaks out. T owards this end, effective earlywarning systems are essential. Agrowing number of institutions, both within and outside the UNsystem, now regularly monitor andanalyse conflicts. A good deal of workhas b eendone to develop indicators. But no systematic approach has yet evolved to bring together the diverseperspectives needed to identify situations in a way that will spark preventive action. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is workingtowards this end. Comprised of UN and non-UN humanitarian groups focusing on disasters and conflict,the Committee regularly puts out an Ear lyWarning/Early Action reportthroughone of its working groups. But the influence of such reports on political decision-makingis debatable. 387 In addition, few organizations haveintegrated the impact on children and children's involvement into their criteria for predicting conflict. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms such as thoseimplemented with Security CouncilResolution 1612 can be useful in sounding the alarm to prevent further recruitment of children. Butfor a response to be truly preventive,action must take place at a much earlier stage. 388 Earlywarning constitutes an important area of work only if it leads toearlyaction. Such action remains rare,largely due to lack of political will and consensus. In fact, while a culture of prevention may be taking root conceptually, in many senses a 'culture of reaction' still prevails. Within the UN system there are a number ofbodies, some bringing together variousparts of the system, that can reviewsituations and make decisions when aconflict is imminent. But makingsimilar d ecisions earlier in the conflict cycle continues to be a challenge. The ear lystage is when prevention can b emost e ffective, and when children and young people have the\"We the children should raise our voices so more people listen to us. Some kids like me have the passion, but we just don't know how to do it.\" - Boy, 14, Democratic People's Republic of Korea9. PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 175greatest role to play. T o the extent that their participation can involvethem in creating stability and positivelife options as alternatives to violence, so m uchthe b etter. In Nepal, for example, schools were frequently caught in the crossfire between thearmy and non-state combatants.As part of a larger advocacy effort,childr enand c hildr en's clubs declared themselves to be 'zones of peace' and effectively spread the message that no one was allowed to enter school grounds with arms (see box on page181). 389InSriLanka, mothers came together to force those attempting torecruit children into combat outof their villages. And in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, thousands of children participate in local recreation centres; as a result, few were drawn into the country's recent conflict.390Such early action needs to be strengthened, based on additional research and docume ntation. The key question is this: Just as childr en's concerns are increasingly incorporated into peace agreementsand ne gotiations, how can they be built into multilateral processes andnational strategies to prevent conflict? Developing mechanisms for post-c onflict p eacebuilding. The Peacebuilding Commission could be one entrypoint foraddressing the concerns of children and young people as part of a peacebuildingstrategy. Since its inception in 2005, the Commission has helped developpilot programmes in Burundi, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.In Burundi and Sierra Leone, 391 youth have been identified as priorities, and relevant programmes have been recommended. This attention to youth is important,but it should not overshadow the rights of younger children.In-count ryUN lea ders should ensure that children's concerns are incorporated and given priority. At the same time, such efforts as the Peacebuilding Commission arelimit edin sc ope. Governments have primar yresponsibility to ensure integration of children's issues into allnational and subnational peace- building strategies and frameworks, and t oplace these on the Commission's agenda. Donors must support these efforts financially, and the UN system must support them through its mandate, expertise and on-the-ground capacityfor implementation. Adopting conflict-sensitive approaches. Aid as well as develop- ment and h umanitar ian assistance can have unintended consequenceson the dynamics of conflict. And alltoo often they are negative. The non-neutrality of aid is becoming mo rewidely understood bythe international community and aid ag encies. Asaresult,the use o f conflict analysis tools and method- ologies, such as peace and conflict impa ct assessments and 'do no harm' analyses, have gained traction indevelopment and humanitarian practice since 1999. They have helpedorganizations design programmesthat, at the very least, do not exacerbate tensions and, at best, contribute to prevention. 392In March 2007, the UN Development Group's WorkingGroup on Post-Crisis and Transitionadopted a guidance tool on integratingprevention into UN country strategies. UN c onflict analyses have also informed post-conflict needs assess- ments in Haiti, Somalia and the Sudan, among other countries, aswellas a number of UN country strategies. Their use needs to be more systematic, however, and thus far, issues affecting children have been largely excluded. Donors are increasingly identify- ing the need to look at peacebuilding and c onflict prevention through this lens. But there has been little synergy in the way that peacebuilding agents engagewith sector specialists working in related areas. And few agencies have developed sector-specific or cross- sectoral frameworks geared towardspreventing conflict and building peace. In terms of programming focused onchildren, an early attempt to makethese links was a matrix of indicatorsto identify the relationship between educationand conflict, developed by the C anadian International Develop- ment Agency in 1999. 393Organizat ions such as Save the Children have alsobegun to look at the impact of education onconflict and peace in their Rewrite the Future Campaign. 394Resear chfollowing the 2004 tsunami in Aceh (Indonesia) and Sri Lanka showed that, despite more use of analytic tools, conflictsensitivity is not yet a systematiccomponent of aid programming. In Sri Lanka, for example, the huge influx of aid favouring populations displaced by the disaster over those who remained displaced by conflictbecame a flashpoint in an attempt to consolidate a fragile peace. 398But studies that aim to understand the consequences of aid and humanitarianassistanc eremain rare. This, in turn, limits the evidence base to inform development of conflict-sensitiveapproaches. Analysis that examines both the positive and negative impa cts of aid on conflict needs to be more consistently conducted,at both the macro level and the projectlevel, and at all stages. In addition, many people still perceive that conflict sensitivity is only necessary in times of armedconflict, failing to recognize that aid can e xacerbate tensions at any time and can also undermine effortstoprevent conflict. Similarly, just because an intervention is labelled as'peacebuilding' does not necessarily mean it will have a positive impact on conflict. 399 BUILDING A CULTURE OF PEACE The Machel study recommended that all sectors of society come together tobuild 'ethical frameworks' . These should incorporate traditional values ofcooperation among religious and community leaders with international legal obligations, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Peace education is an important aspect of this. The M achel study recognized that peace education may not always be successful, nor enough on its own.EDUCATION AS A ROAD TO PEACE Research commissioned by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that well-managed, high-quality education systems can help prevent civil unrest andencourage conflict resolution, tolerance and reconciliation. They can also reduce both poverty and inequality, and lay the foundations for goodgovernance and effective institutions. 395 But while education can build bridges, education systems also have the potential to entrench or exacerbate existing inequalities and prejudices.\"Schools are almost always complicit in conflict,\" a World Bank study pointed out. \"They can reproduce skills, values, attitudes and social relations of dominant groups in society; accordingly they are usually a contributory factor in conflict.\" 396 As witnessed in Germany during the 1930s, for example, a government may intentionally manipulate teachers to enhance its power base. The content of both formal and informaleducational materials can also be used to instil a logic and culture ofviolence and an unquestioning hatred of others. Unhappily ,education is still a scarce commodity in many countries, and competition for it can be a source of tension. In Burundi, for example,access to education was unequal along ethnic lines, prompting one scholarto caution, \"If access to education remains unequal to Hutu, Tutsi and Twa,and if the glaring disparities in education provision between differentprovinces persist, the exclusion that is at the root of Burundi's conflict willremain and any peace agreement will be shor t-lived.\" 397 Quality education that is free, safe and accessible to all children and young people is not only a basic right before, during and after conflict but anecessary component of prevention and sustainable peacebuilding. The 2008 global debate initiated by Save the Children on the critical linksbetween education and peace has prompted calls for education to be systematically included in peace agreements. It has also led to recommen-dations to adopt children' ssafe access to and completion of quality education as criteria for measuring sustainable peace. 176 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD9. PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 177But the study emphasized that laying such groundwork is \"indispensable to rebuilding shattered societies\" andto conflict prevention. Progress can b eseen in terms of the global frameworks that have been estab lishe dand in the b urgeoning numb erof peace education initiatives. In 1998, the United Nations declared 2001-2010 t obethe International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. The designation was described as an att empt to inspire a global move- ment to foster peace by promoting\"the principles of freedom, justiceand d emocracy,allhuman rights, tolerance and solidarity.\" 400 Teaching peace and non-violence. Peace education programmes aim tobuild capacity by developing knowledge, and cognitive, interper- sonal and self-management skills,attitudes and values that preventconflict and contribute to a culture of peace. 401Such programmes often seek to reinforce empathy and toleranceand an appreciation of diversity,cooperation and respect. Others takealife-skil ls ap proach, emphasizing social and emotional development and HIV prevention as well as peermediation and dispute resolution. Such programmes target both formal and inf ormal e ducation and take diverse forms, from developing school curricula and material to campaigns for peaceful coexistenceusing art, theatre or sports.Peace education has been applied in a r angeof contexts. In areas with ongoing conflict, programmes tend to respond to the effects of such conflict on children. In Aceh, for example,UNICEF collaborated with local education experts to build conflict resolution and non-violence into the curricula of public and private schools. Peace education is offered PROMOTING PEACE EDUCATION AMONG REFUGEES IN AFRICA Since 1998 the Peace Education Programme has been carried out in camps and refugee settlements in 13 African countries, jointly implemented byINEE and UNHCR. It has now been incorporated into the education curriculaof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Liberia - a testament to the programme's effectiveness. It covers both formal and non-formalcommunity education for adults and out-of-school youth, based on theconcept that peace is everyone' sresponsibility . The programme methodology is rights-based. It centres on children's psychological and ethical development and is designed to promote skillsthat build positive and constructive behaviour. Many graduates have formedpeace committees to minimize conflicts within and among communities;some youth groups have initiated sports and cultural events promoting non-violence. The programme has had a major ,though unplanned, benefit on women's empowerment and power sharing within communities. One lesson already learned is that success depends on adults in the communityreinforcing the skills and values children learn in school - and vice versa. 402 to refugees and internally displaced persons and in schools in returneeareas so that returning children andthose who have remained can learn to livetogether again. Other programmes focus on building a culture of peace in post-conflict settings or other contexts that may be at risk of violence. T oreduceviolence and reliance on arms amo ng children and young people, forexample, the Hague Appeal for Peace and the UN Department for Disarmament Affairs have developedinitiatives for peace and disarmament in suchpost-conflict countries as Camb odia and Peru, and in countries such as Albania, where weapons still proliferate. Such programmes havereached out to children, educators, communities and government leaders in formal and informal education settings. Special peace education projects forregions in transition, for example in Eastern Europe, include components suchas human rights and democratic citizenship as well as anti-discrimina-tionprogramming that promotes inclusion of children from minoritygroups, including the Roma. 'Citizeneducation' is included in manycurricula around the world, whether thereis openconflict or not, as a move towards conflict prevention. T aking a critical look at peace education. While an impressive array of programmes can be cited, more effort is needed to understandtheir impact, both short term and long term. Also needed is moreattention to monitoring andevaluating the components of these programmes to support an evidence base for their effectiveness. Peace education for children and young people can sometimes beof questionable value, particularly inthe midd le ofan int ractable conflict, whenadult role models still base their behaviour around conflict. 403 Entrenched attitudes towards the hostilities may be \"deep-seated,\"according to a recent study, with \"unchang eable convictions consti- tuting the backbone of a group's collective narrative.\" 404 Research conducted in the Occupie dPalestinian T erritory and Sri Lanka suggests that entrenched attitudes cannot be altered without taking into account everyday experiences of economic struggle or political unr est.405Insituations of extreme hardship, peace education programmes may be out of sync with the harsh realities of daily life.Moreover, such programmes may detract from activities that childrenview as more pressing, such asacquiring food, water and other basic necessities. Anothe rapproach to building aculture of peace is sponsoring exchang eprogrammes for young people on opposite sides of a conflict. This could include, for example, exchanges between Palestinian and Israeli children or Greek and Turkish \"There is an Icelandic word, frekja ,which has no direct translation in the English language, but applies to pushiness, greed, cheek and nerve.

PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 179Cypriots, in politically neutral locations outside contested areas or areas of hostilities. But caution is necessary. Although they can be valuable,exchange programmes have sometimes resulted in questionableoutcomes, especially when children areplacedface to face with peers who may not have experienced the same har dships r esulting from war. Resear chhas sho wnthis can incr ease frustration and alienation and, at worst, be counterproductive. 406 ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES OF CONFLICT Since children and young people are integral to successful peacebuilding, they must also be part of any attempt to address the structural and more immediate causes of conflict. Many observers think of politicalagreements, security, economic development or good governance as key to peacebuilding and prevention.What they often fail to see is the role that c hildren can play in these processes. There are implications for childr enundereachof these categories, not o nlyin terms of their potentially positive - or negative, if neglected - impa ct,butalso in t erms of how 'getting it r ight' will enhance children's contributions to peacebuilding in their communities foryearsto come. Anumb erofsectors require new thinking and holistic approaches toaddress long-standing problems andprevent future flashpoints. Forexample, disparities in access toeducation can affect future employ- ment opportunities and become the seeds of conflict. Similarly, education without the possibility of employ- ment can also breed dissent. It is clear that many international organizations and NGOs committed to working for children's rights now see peacebuilding and conflict preventionas imp ortant c omponents Christian Children's Savethe C hildren, UNICEF and War Child H olland, for example, all have peacebuilding programmes that actively engage children. But for peace to last, these interventions need to bestrategic, systematized, supported, and linked to national and internationalmechanisms. In addition, improved programming requires assembling and sharing a body of evidence on children and peacebuilding.AsUNICEF's post-crisis strategy points out, it is not about doing more during this time, it is about doing more things differently. Below is a brief discussion of the sectors that should be addressed: Promoting good governance. The development of good governance is keytoaddressing e quity and accountab ility. It covers a range of activities, including strengthening public administ ration, and requires the estab lishme nt of government systems that reflect the needs of the whole population, includingchildren and young people. Post-conflict situations offer a window of opportunity for changing systems of governance: Constitutions can be rewritten or new legislation devised, including laws that relateDRAWING YOUTH INTO PEACEBUILDING IN LIBERIA It is a widely held view in Liberia that the country's conflict was fuelled by disenfranchised youth. As part of the peacebuilding process, therefore,the country carried out extensive consultations nationwide and hosted aNational Youth Conference in 2005, all of which fed into the development of a National Youth Policy. The policy has been generally well received. It raised the profile of youth issues and empowered youth organizations to take part, actively andformally, in high-level processes, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Electoral Commission. However, awareness of the policy still needs to be raised, especially in rural districts. Anotherpositive outcome appears to be improved perceptions of youth by adults,many of whom previously held condescending views of the youngergeneration's potential. 407180 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDspecifically to children. Electoral democracy often receives high priority in post-conflict contexts, but it often excludes adolescents atthe v ery point when it is strategically important to give them politicalalternatives to violence. This, too, needs to be addressed by supporting young people to participate in certainaspects ofthe p olitical process. The failureto do so in South Africa, for example, led many young people to feel alienated and betrayed - after having fought actively in the struggleagainst apartheid. 408 Programming options include youth organizations, youth participa- tionin community decision-making and media made by young people for young people, as well as non- traditional forms of expression, suchas music and theatre, that give youngpeople a public voice. 'Golden Kids News' , a popular Sierra Leone radio programme 'by kids and for kids' , is an example o f how young people can get their opinions heard andkick-start debate on issues importantto them. 409 Developing national youth policies is another way to ensure that youthcan c ontribute to democratic governance. These policies should be drafted with the active participationof youth representatives, reflectingtheir diverse regions, ages, gender and social strata, especially includingthose w ho ar emarginalized. This approachcan p romoteaccountability to young people, place them on thepolitical agenda and ensure they are not excluded from the political process. Such policies and processes should define the role of youth in society, and the r esponsibility of society to youth. Their purpose should be threefold: to enable youth to identifymajo rissues that aff ect them; to promote the establishment of services and structures to meet their needs;and to encourage youth to participate in decision-making processes. 410 Reforming the security sector. Children and youth routinely talk about the need for safety and security as a primary concern.411Asecure environment is vital for their develop-ment and f oraccessing basic services. Without it they cannot participate meaningfully in building peace in their communities. Girls, moreover, have specific security requirements. Security sector reform is now recognized as a core peacebuilding activity. It comprises strengthening government strategic planning, justice systems, accountability mechanisms and civilian oversight of the military. Just as peacekeeping missio ns ha vestandar ds and p olicies specific to children, they must not be overlookedwhen supporting States in developing or reforming their securitysectors. This is true both from a human security standpoint (i.e., ensuring children's safety) and as a measure to prevent conflict. Post-conflict countries such as El Salvadorand Guatemala have high rates of criminality in part because of poor demilitarization and security sectorreform. Furthermore, repressive policies that routinely violate the rights of young people have become the norm to combat criminality in anumb erofcountries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. 412 Itis vital to listen to how children themselves perceive their security and to consider their priorities when designing policy and programmes.While this is incr easing ly recognized, children's ability to play active roles in creating safe spaces in which theycan g rowand flour ish is o ften overlooked. One arena in which children can have a big impact is atthe c ommunity level. In Zambia, for example, children were instrumental in creating school councils that are helping curb violence in educationalinstitutions; in Angola, children are reporting on violations of their rights. 413 Such actions can also place children in stronger positions to negotiate with adults to prevent unacceptable behaviour or violence.414 Creating well-functioning judicial systems. Well-functioning judicial systems, including those for juvenile justice,are essential to protect childr enand fulfil the ir rights.Doing this correctly means respecting human rights: Because children in conflict with the law often suffer from social and economic hardships and are denied their basic rights,\"I volunteer my time because I want the community to know someone cares about them.\" -Young man, age not specified, Uganda9. PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 181good justice systems go hand in hand with equitable development. In post-conflict countries, achieving a balance between recon- ciliat ionand j ustice is all-important. Research has shown that to restore respect for the rule of law and children'ssense of justice it is important thatperpetrators be held accountable fortheir actions. When they are not, a lingering sense of injustice can contribute to the desire for revenge and ongoing social tensions. Children and young people also needtohave a role in reconciliation efforts. Not only have they been victimized by war, many have been perpetrators as well: those children and y oung people who have been associated with armed groups also need a chance to heal and be accepted back into their communities. Children have contributed to national recon- ciliation processes in a number of count ries, including Guatemala and South Africa. But what stands out most is the ir role in Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission(seeboxin chapter 6, 'Children's participation in truth and recon-ciliation commissions'). The key is to ensure that children's contribu-tions to such processes are not mere tokenism b utaretruly meaningful and w ill lead to genuine reform. Asignificant c hallengetobuilding peace is ensuring that communities receive the attention they deserve.Communities bear the brunt of war but can often feel detached frombroader national reconciliation efforts. Effective reconciliation at the community level lies at the heart of converting societies from cultures of war to cultures of peace. It is also atthe local level where children and young p eople often play the most effective and powerful roles. InRwanda, children and young people have come together to create CHILDREN AS ZONES OF PEACE415 The idea that a gathering of children should constitute a 'zone of peace' - that is, a place where children are safeguarded and have access to essential services - first emerged during the 1980s. Agreements were negotiated between warring parties to stop the bloodshed during what were called 'days of tranquillity' or 'corridors of peace', the first of which was an immu-nization campaign in El Salvador . 416The idea has transformed considerably since the early days. It is now being implemented more systematically toprevent some of the harmful effects of war on children and to promote theirparticipation in peacebuilding. During the conflict in Nepal, for example, children put the concept into practice in partnership with government officials. They began by cultivatingthe idea that schools, which had sometimes been used as recruitinggrounds for children, should be safe havens. The concept caught on and led to formation of a national coalition as well as public commitment ofsuppor tby five major political par ties. Child protection guidelines for security forces were subsequently circulated by the Office of the Prime Minister .When the Government declared schools to be zones of peace, the edict was respected by both warring parties. 417 Now, in a post-conflict environment, the Children as Zones of Peace initiative suppor ts government efforts to set up comprehensive child protection systems at all levels. Child representatives now attend village protection committees - one clear signthat the programme is on the right track. 182 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDatheat refestival that explores an aspect of their history that is yet to be taught in schools. As an informal educationprogramme, the plays offer anew way for audiences to reflect onthe the me of reconciliation as it relates to the recent genocide and to build solutions for the future.418 Creating employment, supporting livelihoods and delivering basic services. In the post-war context, securing alternative livelihoods for youth going through a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process often depends on wider economic growth and on creatinginstitutional capa cityto support ex-combatants in society. 419Manycurrent and former child soldiers express fear o f going back to situations where they had no schools, no skills and no prospects. They often citepoverty as a factor driving them to join armed groups in the first place. 420 \"The term reintegration of ex- combatants is somehow a peculiar one,\" says one expert, reflecting onthe sit uationinSierra Leone. \"It suggests that the e x-combatants need tobesupported and equipped to mak etheir re-entry to peaceful society successful, but does not ask if there is still something into whichto reintegrate.\" 421 For long-term peacebuilding to succeed, sustainable economicdevelopment must take root.Recognizing that employment creation, income generation and reintegration are key to peacebuilding, anew UN system-wide policy paper will present guiding principles toimprove coherence and strategy formulation, and to help scale up and coordinate efforts. Deliveryof basic services is equally important, and particular care must be taken to ensure that they are available during post-conflict reconstruction and recovery. This requires adequate levels of education, health car eand n utrition, along with construction or reconstruction of infrastructure to allow delivery of services. Special attention must bepaid t oreaching women, children and young people. Asdiscussed in depth in earlier chapters, a critical factor in peace-building and conflict prevention is ensuring that p eople have access to basic services - including but not limited to displaced persons or returning refugees. Inequitable distribution of services can increasegeographical and social disparities and reinforce simmering grievances. RECOMMENDATIONS The p rimar yrecomme ndation of this strategic review echoes the emphasis of the Machel study in 1996: The best waytoprotect children and young people from armed conflict is to prevent wars and to build peace. Recommendations that speak speci- Sudan \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2006-2191/Cranstonfically to engaging children and young people in peacebuilding and conflict prevention follow: 1. Invest more heavily in conflict prevention. Governments have the primary responsibility for preventing structural and more imme diate causes of armed conflict. The international community and the UnitedNations play a supporting role, and they should invest in strengthe ning nat ional capa cities forpeace and conflict prevention. This involves both government and civil society, includingchildr enand young people. 2. Promote the links between child rights and conflict prevention/ peacebuilding. Governments, the United Nations, and local and international civil society mustsystematically build the links between the rights of children andtheir involvement in conflict prevention and peacebuilding -both vertically, from the local to the international level, and 'side- ways' , in on-the-ground operationsand p eacebuilding processes. 3.Empower children and young people t obe forces for peace and conflict prevention. Children and y oung people are an integral partofsuccessful efforts to prevent conflict and build peace. It followsthat the ymust be specifically included in any attempt to addressthe structural and more immediatecauses of conflict. Programming should be designed to enable their participation and be appropriate to their evolving capacities, and itshould r eflecttheir contributions and perspectives. This must not beatoken exercise; rather, it should be followed by concrete action. 4.Ensure that all development and humanitarian programming is sensitive to conflicts. Humanitarian and development actors, UNMember States, UN agencies andNGOs should assess the impa ctof their programmes and strategies on conflict and peace. The goal istobetterunderstand potential risk factors, underlying tensions, and the capacities of children and youth to both prevent conflict and build peace. This includesimproved integration of issuesaffecting children into broader conflict resolution and peace- building interventions. All pro- gramming for children should bemoreconflic t-sensitive. 5. Assemble and share a body of evidence on children and peace-building and conflict prevention. All actors, including Member States, UN agencies and civil society, should monitor andevaluate peacebuilding program- ming to assess the capacities of children and young people in this role. A body of evidence should b eestab lishe d,which could then provide guidance in applying conflict-sensitive approaches to development, post-conflict transition and emergency phases of programming. /square6 KEY RESOURCES 'Children and Security Sector Reform', Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), <www.dcaf.ch/children-security/_publications.cfm>.

PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE 183United Nations Headquarters \u00a9UNICEF/NYHQ2007-1548/MarkiszYOUNG PEOPLE DEMAND ACTION10186 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDDuring preparation of this 10-year review of the Machel study, the views of 1,700 children in 92 countries were sought to help pave the way forward.The material was gathered in a 'Voicesof Y outh' companion booklet andlaunched as part of the presentationto the General Assembly in 2007.The booklet highlighted eight specificrequests - or 'demands' , in the wordsofthe children - that they would like to see implemented in theircommunities and a cross the g lobe: /square6We want our rights to be respected. /square6We want justice and to be safe from violence. /square6Wewant to learn. /square6Wewant to be healthy. /square6We want jobs and a means to survive. /square6We want more support and care for the excluded and forgotten. /square6We just want to be children. /square6We want to participate. Since the focus of this report is on action, a follow-up survey was subse- quently undertaken among youth-ledorganizations to seek ways to satisfythese demands. Y outh organizationsare often even better positioned thanthose headed by adults to understandand connect with other children andyoung people. And because of theirexperience, many of these organiza-tions can provide practical suggestionsabout the resources and support needed to be effective at the grass roots. Theenergy, insight and creativity withwhich children responded were strongevidence that they are determined and capable of being positive forces for change in their societies. Althoug hthe t ime and r esour ces availab le forthe f ollow-up survey allowed only limited outreach, positive responses came from youth organiza-tions in Afghanistan, Camb odia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Iraq, Somalia and Timor-Leste. The organizations were asked to review the eight demands listed above,consult with members of their organizat ions and c ommunities, and answ er the following questions: 1.What are the three most urgent demands in your community? 2. What needs to be done to realize those demands? 3. What support do children, young people and their organizations need to contribute to this change? The participating organizations, which work at the community level onissues ranging from the protection ofchild r ights to media training to conflict resolution, included: /square6Health and Development Centre for Afghan W omen (Kabul, Afghanistan): Itimple ments projects related to women's rights and gender-based violence againstgirls and women in Afghanistanthrough work in the areas ofhealth, education, vocational training and capacity building. /square6People's Health Development Association (Phnom Penh, Cambodia): It offers life skills training and health services, ayouth centre and counselling foryoung p eople Paix (Goma, DemocraticRepublic of the Congo): It advocates for human rights and forprotection of marginalized children and youth. It also provides training and safe spacesfor peaceful dispute resolution. /square6Concelho Nacional Juventude de Timor-Leste (Timor-Leste): It enhances the capacity of youth organizations through facilitationand bridging with government anddonor agencies. It also facilitates community reintegration through dialo gue and p eacecampaig the creation of local youth groups and provides materials and training oneducation, health care, human rights and the environment. /square6Iraqi D emocratic Coalition for Y outh Empowerment (Baghdad, Iraq): It improves opportunities for young people by providing literacy and leadership training, and a dvocates for children's and women's rights.\"Above all, children who have survived conflict must tell their stories, while the rest of us must listen and act upon what we hear.\" - Young woman, 17, United Kingdom/square6Y outh Development Organiza- tion (Bosaso, Somalia): It offers youth programmesin sports, education, health andjob creation and trains youngpeople in using the media toreach out to their communities. CALLS FOR ACTION The most urgent call made by these youth-led organizations is to be freeto grow into adulthood safe fromviolenceof any kind. They made it clear that w henarmedconflic tcom- promises children's security, wholesale violat ions of child rights follow. Without security, children and young people are denied the right toattend school, to play and compete with each other, and to learn theskills necessary for future jobs. Theyaredeniedthe right to participate in decision-making that affects their lives, their communities, theircountries and the world. The role of the community is paramount. In their recommendations,children and young people emphasize the importance of looking for solutions through dialogue with parents and local e lders. Families and communities are seen as best equipped to respond to children's educational, health andpsychoso cial needs, and to foster peaceand t olerance. Most of the recommendations recognize that the State bears principalresponsibility for protecting and caringfor children, especially those who are abused and exploited. But youth- led organizations also pressed theircase f or change in their communities, noting the obligation of govern-ments to help foster changes throughbetterimple mentation and moni- toring of policies already in place. Theconcerns raised most frequently follow, along with examples of more specific recommendations: Security and justice Y oung people ask for stronger legislationand b etterenforcement of the rule of law, especially in rural areas.Theyseeclear links between security and peacebuilding, peace education, and constructive dialogue between youth and authorities. Intheir responses, they emphasize preventive measures that foster peace and tolerance within their communities.More specifically, they suggest: /square6Providing educational opportuni- ties on the topics of peace and tolerance as an alternative to 'hate campaigns' (the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo); /square6Training police forces, judicial officials and those in volvedin custodial care on issues related to justice for children (Somalia); /square6Organizing training courses for parents o npeaceful coexistence and no n-violent conflict resolution (Iraq).Access to basic services Y oung people see education, health care and nutritious food as vital totheir development. They suggest thatNGOs and humanitarian organizationsfocus on reaching areas wheregovernments are unable or unwillingtoprovide basic services. Where education is not available for all orfamilies cannot aff ordto send children to school, they want more support forhome schooling and financial incentives for parents. Y oung people also ask f oryouth-fr iendly information about health, diseases and nutrition, and the ypush f oryouth-fr iendly services in health centres. Morespecifical ly, youth organi- zations suggest: /square6Offering home schooling as an alternative in communities where schooling for girls remains achallenge (Afghanistan); /square6Improving the quality of com- munity health services andprotecting the rights of young clients (Cambodia); /square6Supporting young people in providing information to their peersontopics that are relevant totheir lives, for example, through youth magazines (Somalia). Cultural and recreational opportunities Y oung people ask for safe spaces and community centres where children can play, interact and develop freely. 10. YOUNG PEOPLE DEMAND ACTION 187188 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDThey suggest that these places be managed in partnership with young people and community leaders. Theyalso ask f or more opportunities to engage in cultural and artistic eventswhere they can express themselves.Morespecifical ly, they suggest: /square6Building playgrounds recre- ational facilities in schools, andmaking saf e,child-fr iendly spaces available at beaches, libraries and museums (Timor-Leste); /square6Encouraging schools to organize cultural and artistic activities suchas theatre and music (Iraq); /square6Creating public places and sponsoring activities that canreduce idleness and stress amongchildren and youth (Haiti). Employment opportunities Y oung people ask for vocational training and skills development programmes matched to the local labour mar ket. They also propose that incentives be provided to encourage young people to become entrepreneurs in a wide variety of areas, including tackling environmental degradation.Governments can use public work schemes t oofferemplo yment to young people, but young people also recognize that there are opportunitiesin war-torn countries where theprivatesector is often a step ahead in supporting livelihoods. More specifically, they suggest:/square6Ensuring that vocational pro- grammes reach out to both femaleand male st udents (Afghanistan); /square6Cooperating with local youth councils to provide technical and vocational training for young people in their communities (Cambodia); /square6Providing microcredit to poor families (esp ecially women) and young people to enable them to earn a living and to fight off hunger (Haiti and Iraq); /square6Promoting y outh employment and economic opportunities as a mechanism t ocombat marginaliza- tion, neglect and socio-economic violence against children and young people (the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Engagement and participation Y oung people ask for genuine oppor- tunities to participate and to engage in dialogue with communities and governments. The surveys cite theimportanceof various mechanisms for this engagement, ranging from development of national youth policies, representation in government decision-making bodies and youth structures in schools or local NGOs.In short, young people recognize that there are ample opportunities for their involvement because all of these bodies initiate programmes andactivities that affect their lives. However, they would like to see amore diverse group of youth repre- senting their needs, a group thatextends beyond the urban and more fortunate young people who often sit on national youth committees andcouncils. More specifically, youthorganizations suggest: /square6Increasing the participation ofyouth w ho ar esocially and economically marginalized and giving them the skills to participate effectively (the Democratic Republic of the Congo); /square6Creating youth councils and networks that can d evelop policies and p rogrammes, with support from and in collaboration withcommunities, NGOs, the govern- ment and donors (Cambodia); /square6Facilitat ing the creation of groups and networks that enable youngpeople to organize themselves and a ddress problems in their communities (Haiti). WHAT DO YOUNG PEOPLE NEED? Throughout the consultation process for this review, children andyoung p eople e xpressed a strong desire to participate in decisions that directly and indirectly affectthem. Y outh organizations - and by extension, young people at large - need support for legitimate and effective participation. The biggest constraint for many youth organizations is lack of funding.Although young people can accomplish great things through volunteering andthe creative use of their own (oftenlimited) resources, funding is required tobuild st rong organizations and create programmes that reach and involve marginalized youth. Many young people are well aware of the needs in their communities,buttheyoften lack management experience and the knowledge of how towork within 'the system' . Y oung people need skills training on such issues as project management andgrant w riting as well as technical training in a dvocacy and policy work. Young p eople want to work hand in hand w ith adults to find solutions for problems in their communities and c ount ries. They have the creativity and energy to make a difference, but theybenefit from the experience and guidance of adults. The youth-led organizations consulted also had a clear vision of their potential contributions through childr en's parliaments, councils and other mechanisms. Although theyexpect their governments to provide them with the necessary space tooperate, they want to maintain theirindependence, make their own deci-sions, undertake awareness campaigns onkeyissues, mobilize their peers, and se rve as a link between their communities and g overnments. Finally, those consulted want to be supported as they reach out toothe ryouth organizations, young people and children living in similarcircumstances. These networks provide them with a sense of solidarity and shared understanding. T ogether they can identify ideas and activities that have worked and can learn from each other. MOVING FORW ARD The youth-led organizations that were consultedemphasized that solutions need to be rooted in their communities. Nevertheless, they also recognizedthat governments and the internationalcommunityhave an important role to play in ensuring that the right policies are in place and are implemented. Inordertomove towards full and effective implementation of the demands expressed by children andyoung people, youth organizationsproposed the following priorities: /square6Improved security in their com- munities brought about by child- friendly judicial procedures and a greater focus on prevention andpeacebuilding measures;/square6Alternative approaches to ensure that they receive basic services, including improved access to health-related information and context-appropriate educational opportunities as well as stronger outreach to rural areas; /square6Spaces to engage with their peers and to express themselves through various mediums, including culture, music and sports; /square6Opportunities to develop liveli- hood skills and greater support for emplo yment sc hemes that reflect the needs of their communities; /square6Institutionalized channels for their active and sustained participation so they can help shape the decisions that affect their lives; /square6Greater resources and guidance as they organize themselves toworkwith their peers, adults and others in tackling the challenges in their communities. /square6 KEY RESOURCE Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Global Youth Action Network, UNFPA, UNICEF and Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, \"Will Y ou Listen?\" Young voices from conflict zones, companion booklet to the 10-year Machel Strategic Review, UNICEF, New York, October 2007. 10.

As demonstrated throughout this publication, we must re-galvanize our political will, moral resolve and actions in the field to maintain progressand fulfil the vision and recommen- dations of Gra\u00e7a Machel's 1996 study. InadditiontoMrs.Machel's detailed recommendations, the commitments adoptedduring the past decade by Member States through the General Assembly - especially the principles outlined in A World Fit for Children - the Security Council, regional bodies and other mechanisms provide the benchmar ks for our next steps. RECOMMENDATIONS A. ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND END IMPUNITY Recommendation 1: Achieve universal adherence to inter- national standards and norms (a) Member States must uphold existing int ernational standards and operationalize thoseobligations through acceleratednational legislative reform andsystematic implementation and monitoring: /square6Member States and UN agencies should establish procedures toensurethat c onclusions and recommendations of the Security Council Working Group on Childr enand Armed Conflict, the Committee on the Rights ofthe Child, the Human Rights Council and othe rbodies ar e strategically disseminated to groups inc luding civil society, childr en,the pub lic,non-state armed actors and professionals working in related areas, such as me mbersofthe police, the judiciary and the military as well as medical, immigration and refugee authorities. /square6Civil society actors such as national human rights institu-tions and NGOs should besupported to elaborate andsubmit independent reports on the implementation of treaties including the Convention onthe R ights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children inArmed Conflict to relevant treaty bodies. /square6T o establish benchmarks by which to measure furtherimple mentation, civil society actors should be supported atthe national level in providingsustaine dfollow-up to the recommendations of relevanttreaty bodies, including monitoring. (b) Member States and the United Nations system should continue to review the need forfurtherlegal instruments and mechanisms for compliance: /square6The Human Rights Council should e nsure that concluding observations and recommen-dations by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on reports submitted by States parties o nthe imple mentation of the Optional Protocol on Children and Armed Conflictformthe basis of the Universal Periodic Review. /square6The U niversal Periodic Review mechanism of the Human Rights Council should integrate information on grave violationsagainst children in situations of conflict, in accordance with Member States' compliancewith the ir obligations under international human rights and humanitarian institutions. (c) All Member States and other stakehold ers should formally endorse relevant standards and guidelines that enhance the protection of children and ensure their systematic implementation: /square6MemberStates,civil society organizations, UN agencies and international NGOs shouldfurther incorporate legal and11. LOOKING AHEAD: A PLATFORM OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND KEY ACTIONS 193programme standards on children and armed conflict in organizational policy and operational documents, such as standard operating procedures, manuals and strategic plans. In this regard, it will be useful for the Committee on the Rights ofthe C hild t oconsider the imple mentation of these standards and guidelines in their recommendations onMember States' efforts to translate international law into domestic law. /square6Progress towards harmonization of inter-agency, government and d onorstandards should be systematically monitoredthrough a standard framework ofindicators and benchmarks. /square6The Inter-Agency Standing Committee should ensure that standar ds pertaining to conflict- affected children are incorpo- rated in new cluster guidelinesand assessment tools. In particular, the Common Humanitarian Action Plan guid elines should r equire clear articulation of child-related strategic objectives. Recommendation 2: End impunity for violationsagainst children (a) Member States must ensure systematic and timely investigationand prosecution of crimes against children in the context of armed conflict and provide assistance to victims. (b)Member States should apply targetedmeasures, including sanctions where appropriate, against indi viduals, parties to conflict and other entities within their jurisdic tion,including the private sector, that persistently commit or are complicit in the commissio nofgrave violations against children in situations of armedconflic t: /square6The SecurityCouncil should estab lish me chanisms that make it possible to take sanction meas ures in all situations of concern regarding the children and armed conflict agenda, including the exploration of establishing a sanctions com- mittee. The Security Council should give equal priority to all categories of grave violations and all relevant situations of concern. /square6All Member States should adopt specific measures towards ending impunity for violationsagainst children in armed conflict. Such measures may include, inter alia, adoptingextraterritorial provisions for relevant crimes; ensuringnational p rovisions are in compliance with rules and provisions of the InternationalCriminal Court; applying the universality principle whererelevant; ensuring that domesticlegislation criminalizes armstrade to countries with a recordofillegally recruiting and using child soldiers; and adopting provisions that address money laundering and permit freezing the assets of persons or legalentities accused of grave violations against children in armed conflict.

Specifically, this includes part- nerships with the private sector forlong-term employment strategies and opportunities; vocational andskills training; participatory assessments; and micro-loans Member States, especially troop- contributing countries, and theUnited Nations system should enhance current efforts and ensure that rigorous systems are in place topromptly investigate and address allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, including systematic training, specialized investigation capacity, stronger sanctions againstperpetrators, mechanisms forreferral to child protection actors,and the adoption and implemen-tation of a comprehensive, child-friendly policy on assistance andsupport for survivors: /square6UN agencies and international NGOs should implement stan- dardized and systematic codes of conduct for sexual violence and exploitation, including a unifie dzero-tolerance policy for all humanitarian staff and peacekeepers, and child-friendlycomplaint mechanisms. C. STRENGTHENING CAPACITY, KNOWLEDGE AND PARTNERSHIP Recommendation 9: Improve capacity and knowledge for quality care and protection of children T o address insufficiencies in the base ofexpertise and programme learning, Member States and other stakeholders should invest more across all sectors in building, strengthening andexpanding international and national capacities for knowledge acquisition and management. Research should be more aligned with needs in the fieldand should be documented, dissemi- nated and applied. /square6Keystakeholders, such as Member States,regional o rganizations and UN entities, should invest significant r esour ces in b uilding the base of expertise on child protection, including training of local service providers and capacity building of national institutions. Evaluations of the impact of training should be routinelyundertaken through such methods as knowledge assessment. /square6The United Nations should establish a global information management system. This systemshould build on existing datacollection systems; work withspecializ ed research dology to on conflict-affected children; andestab lish agreed-upon indicators that are relevant to the pro- gramme context. /square6As part of humanitarian reform and the c luster approach, expanded cooperation is needed to developindicators that examine the multifaceted experiences ofchildren and young people in conflict settings.198 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLDRecommendation 10: Ensure complementarity among key actors and mainstream children and armed conflict concerns (a) All stakeholders, including UN entities, donors and non-govern- mental organizations, must continuetoimprovecomple mentarity and cooperation across intersecting mandates.

(b)The work of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict has demon- strated a continuous need for ahigh-level Special Representativetoadvocate for children affected by armed conflict. This role should strengthen that of Member Statesthemselves, complementing UNsystem partners, such as UNICEF,peacekeeping and political leadership and other child protection actors.Recommendation 11: Operationalize the engage - ment of regional bodies (a) Regional and intergovernmental bodies must more proactivelyaddress children and armedconflict concerns, includingthrough the establishment of ahigh-level mechanism for advocacy,the development of action planstoimple ment declarations, and capa citybuilding fchild r ights expertise in the ir secretariats: /square6In order to more specifically translate commitments and declarations into action, regional bodies should: (i) review previous commitments,including through peer review mechanisms; (ii) include an agenda item dedicated to childr en affected by armed conflict in annual summit meetings; (iii) seize opportuni-ties, such as through regional follow-up to A World Fit for Children; and (iv) establish a high-level advocate and child rights expertise in their peace and security structures. (b)Regional intergovernmental bodies should ensure that childr enand ar medconflict considerations are built into their peacemaking ,peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities, with the supportofthe United Nations when necessary.11. LOOKING AHEAD: A PLATFORM OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND KEY ACTIONS 199Recommendation 12: Ensure that funding matches chil- dren's needs and priorities (a) Donors should individually and collectively ensure early, multi-year, flexible and thematic funding as cal ledforby, inter alia, the principles of the Good Humanitar ian Donorship initiative. Donors should prioritize child-focused programming, taking intoaccount the need for a long- term approach: /square6Donors and implementing agencies should identify ways in which funding can be better manag ed to ensure continuity and sustainability of criticalprogrammes from conflict to post-conflict situations and from an emergency to adevelopmental phase. (b) In appeals for conflict-related emergencies and post-conflictreconstruction, the UN system, governments and non-govern- mental organizations should child-focused objectives and disaggregated needs: Inter-Agency Standing Committ ee should ensure that Humanitarian Action Plan guidelines requireclear ar ticulat ionof child- related strategic objectives.D. PREVENTING CONFLICT AND BUILDING PEACE Recommendation 13: Consolidate the role of United Nations peacekeepinginchild protection: (a) The Security Council should continue to include child protection provisions in the mandates of peacekeeping operations: /square6T o facilitate fulfilment of child protectionobligations, the UN Secretariat should adopt a mechanism t oensurethat peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding take intoaccount the needs and problems of children affected by armed conflict.

(b) Increased technical and financial investment should includefocused support for youth organizations, centres andactivities, secondary and tertiaryeducation, livelihood schemes and leadership opportunities:\"Teaching others and giving awareness of the importance of sharing and living together in one country, sharing one culture can help. But the adults don't come to our meetings, and we can't tell adults what to do.\" -Young man, 17, Sri Lanka200 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD/square6Donors, Member States, UN entities, and international andlocal non-governmental organi-zations should seek to make participatory processes sustainable, ensuring continua-tion of donor support andintegration into local andnational systems. Recommendation 15: Integrate children' srights in peacemaking, peacebuildingand preventive actions (a) All peacemaking and peace- building processes should bechild-sensitive, including through specific provisions in peace agreements, the participation of children in those processes andthe p rioritization of resources: /square6The int ernational community should ensure that the protection ofchildr enand their concerns are systematically and clearly incorporated in all peace processes at the earliest stages, irrespective of the mediating parties and w hetherthe ini- tiative is led by the United Nations,aregional body or anational government./square6Provisions on children in peace agreements should address pro-tection of children from all forms of grave violations; accounta- bilityforchild rights violations, including through truth and reconciliation initiatives; the establishment of institutional and le gal reforms that protect children from exploitation; and implementation of child-friendlydisar mame nt,demobilization and r eintegration procedures that e nsuretheir ful land successful reintegration in post-conflict structures. (b)Member States, UN entities and r egional intergovernmental bodies are urged to elaborate preventive approaches including, inter alia, early warning systemsand community conflict resolutionand reconciliation: /square6Humanitarian and development actors, Member States, UNagencies and NGOs should assess the impa ctof their programmes and strategies on conflict and peace. The goal is to better understandpotential risk fa ctors, underlying tensions,and the capa cities of children and youth to both prevent conflict and buildpeace. This includes improved integration of issues affecting children into broader conflict resolution and peacebuilding interventions. (c)Private sector entities must be cognizant o f the impact their activities and investments have onchildr en in countries affected by conflict and take measures that include regulating trade and joining corporate responsi- bility initiatives. CONCLUSION This milest one pub lication has been prepared to serve as a reference, advocacy and policy tool for Member States,humanitar ian a ctors and civil society groups involved in the issue of children affected by armed conflict. It is also intended to provide the momentum needed to accelerate accountability and operationalize legislation, policy and action at alllevels and across all sectors to improve the care and protection of children. The most important challenge ahead for all actors is translating international standards into national action that can make a tangible difference in the lives of children affected by war. /square6ENDNOTES 2011.

The analysis is based on 2008 UNICEF research (by A. Donahue and E. Loaiza) undertaken for this report. It representsan initial attempt to review data drawnfrom Demographic and Health Surveysand Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveysand organize it by MDG indicator .It is expected that further review andrefinement of the process will deepenthe results.85. Armed conflict databases used to identify countries included: (1) the Uppsala Conflict Database, maintained by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program at Uppsala University; (2) the Conflict Barometer of the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research; and (3) Project Ploughshares' Armed Conflict Report. For each database, a list was compiled of countries engaged in armed conflict on their own soil during the period 2002-2006. The three listswere then compared, and any country that appeared on two of the three lists was included in the final list of conflict- affected countries used for this research. 86. Of the 60 million children out of school in conflict-affected countries, 19 million are in India. A substantial portion of this number may not be included in the count iffurther analysis is able to determine whether certain regions/states/provinces of a country are affected by conflict and whether the data available are similarly broken down.

Donahue and E.Loaiza, 'Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Conflict Affected Countries', UNICEF Strategic Information Section, Department of Policy & Planning, February 2008 (unpublished). 87.

The gender parity index (GPI) is obtained by dividing the net enrolment/attendancerates for girls by the rates for boys. GPIof 0.96 to 1.04 means that the percent - ages of boys and girls in school areroughly equal. GPI of more than 1.04means that the percentage of girls inschool is higher than the percentage ofboys. GPI of less than 0.96 means thatthe percentage of boys is higher thanthe percentage of girls in school. 89. The under-five mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per1,000 live births) of a child born in aspecified year dying before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. 90. For further analysis, it would be helpful to determine whether certain regions/ states/provinces of a country are affected by conflict and use data from thoseareas specifically . 91. Debt service is expressed as a percent - age of exported goods and services, not including workers' remittances. Thedebt referred to here includes only long-term public and publicly guaran- teed debt and repayments to theInternational Monetary Fund. 92. See, for example: J. Hart and B.

Although not addressed in this chapter, international criminal law is also a relevant body of law. It is occasionally referred to in regard to the (international) criminalization of certain violations of children's rights. 122. The four guiding principles underpinning the Convention on the Rights of the Child are: non-discrimination (article 2); the best interests of the child (article 3); the right to be heard, often referred toas the right to participation (article 12);and the right to life, survival and devel-opment (article 6). 123. Article 1 of the CRC further specifies that achild is anyone under 18 years of age, \"unless under the law applicable to the child, the majority is attained earlier.\" 124. A General Comment is an interpretation byatreaty body of the content of human rights provisions, either related to a specific article or to a broader thematic issue. General Comments often seek to clarify the reporting duties of States parties with respect to certain provisions and suggest approaches to implementingtreaty provisions. They are also referred to as 'general recommendations'. 125. See, respectively, the following Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comments: No. 1 - 'The Aims of Education', UN document CRC/GC/2001/1, New Y ork, 17 April 2001, para. 16; No. 3 -'HIV/AIDS and the Rights of the Child', UN document CRC/GC/2003/3, New York, 17 March 2003, para. 38; and No. 9 - 'The Rights of Children withDisabilities', UN document CRC/C/GC/9, New Y ork, 29 September 2006, para. 55. 126. United Nations Children' sFund, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child , third edition, UNICEF, New York,September 2007, p. 660. 127. According to article 39, States parties are to take all appropriate measures to promote the \"physical and psycho- logical recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts.\" Moreover, the recovery and reintegration process is to take place in an environment that promotes the child' shealth, self-respect and dignity . 128. Revised guidelines regarding initial reports to be submitted by States parties under article 8, para. 1, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention onthe Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, September 2007 (United Nations, 'Revised Guide- lines Regarding Initial Reports to be Submitted by States Parties ...', UN document CRC/C/OPAC/2, New York, 19 October 2007).ENDNOTES 205129. Once this initial reporting round is completed, further reporting on the implementation of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) by the State party is done byincorporating it into its reporting obligation under the CRC (every five years). As such, the first report under OPAC is a key opportunity for States andcivil society more broadly (including national human rights institutions andNGOs) to take stock of the implementation process and existing gaps in meetingobligations. Civil society actors can, for example, provide independent reportsonnational implementation as well as additional information to the Committee onthe Rights of the Child so that their views are taken into account during consideration of the reports. States and civil society must also follow up on therecommendations of the Committee at the national level, since these constitute the benchmarks by which to measure future progress in implementation. See: J. Connors, 'How the International Community has Responded to Children and Armed Conflict: What still needs to be done?', OHCHR, Geneva, 28March 2006, p. 7. 130. The Paris Commitments to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups had been endorsed by 58 governments as of February 2007. See also: United Nations Children' sFund, The Paris Principles: Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups ,UNICEF, February 2007. 131. Further complementing this legal frame- work, the related issue of trafficking was addressed by the Palermo Protocolto Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which enteredinto force December 2003. 132. Security Council resolutions related to children and armed conflict include:Resolutions 1261 (1999), 1314 (2000), 1379 (2001), 1612 (2005). 133. See, for example: Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, with regard to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, CEDAW/C/ COD/CO/5, 2006, and the Committee against T orture, with regard to its con - clusions on Sri Lanka (CAT/C/LKA/CO/2) and Nepal (CAT/C/NPL/CO/20), both adopted in 2005. 134.

International refugee protection includes some fundamental rights and principles, including granting of access to the territory to seek asylum, the principle of non-refoulement (no forced return) and access to fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures or prima facie status. 137. In addition to these, other Executive Committee Conclusions relating to refugee children include: No. 47 (1987) and No. 59 (1989) on Refugee Children; No. 84 on Children and Adolescents (1999); and No. 88 on Protection of the Refugee's Family (1999). 138. In particular, see the UNHCR Guidelines onPolicies and Procedure in Dealing with Unaccompanied Children Seeking Asylum (1997). Other guidelines on this topic include: UNHCR, Procedural Standards for Refugee Status Determi- nation under UNHCR's Mandate , November 2003; and UNHCR SocialServices Section, Guidelines for Interviewing Unaccompanied Minors and Preparing Social Histories ,October 1985. In addition to the right to seek asylum and international protection based on their own claims under the 1951 Convention, children may also be granted derivative refugee status as dependants if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian, based on the principle of family unity. 139. Although the Guiding Principles are not technically binding as such, they have been drawn from existing norms in international human rights and humanitarian law and are gaining increasing international recognition. 140. The Convention had 156 ratifications and two signatories as of 1 March 2008. 141.

The full document is available online at Geneva Call, <www.geneva- call.org/home.htm>. 142. As of end 2007, 38 countries had ceased production of anti-personnel mines, including four States not party to the Mine Ban Convention (Egypt, Finland, Israel and Poland). The international trade of this weapon has virtually ceased, with a significant number of non-States parties having exportmoratoriums in place. See: InternationalCampaign to Ban Landmines, Landmine Monitor Report 2007 .143. China (estimated 110 million), Russian Federation (26.5 million), United States of America (10.4 million), Pakistan (estimated 6 million) and India (estimated 4-5 million).

As of 1 March 2008, 40 countries had ratified the protocol. 146. Records show that between 12 July and 14 August 2006, Lebanon was littered with an estimated 1 million unexploded submunitions and unexploded ordnance, aggravating an already serious problem of anti-personnel landmines and explo- sive remnants of war. See: InternationalCampaign to Ban Landmines, Landmine Monitor Report 2006 ;and Cambodia Mine/ UXO Victims Information System, Casualty Reports ,2000 and December 2006. 147. More specifically, the Committee has requested States parties to abolish arms trade to countries where persons who have not reached the age of 18 may take a direct part in hostilities asmembers of their State armed forces ornon-state armed groups. For exam - ple, the Committee on the Rights of the Child considers state practices andlegislation with regard to arms trade,whether arms are sold to countriesusing child soldiers (in contravention of the Optional Protocol on theInvolvement of Children in ArmedConflict) and their response more generally to the proliferation of smallcalibre weapons, in the following:Switzerland 21; Canada CRC/C/OPAC/CAN/CO/1, paras. 14, 15. 148.

For example, Norway has recently amended its General Civil Penal Code, incorporating a provision stipulatingthat a person who, in connection withan armed conflict, conscripts or enlists children under the age of 18 into armed forces or uses them to participateactively in hostilities may be punishedfor war crimes. This provision applies to acts committed abroad if the act is considered a war crime under inter - national law. The provision entered into force 7 March 2008. 206 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD151.

In addition to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, other treaty body procedures can also promote national implementation, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which establishes international and national mechanisms for visits to places of detention, including where children affected by armed conflict may be held. The universal periodic review mechanisms of the Human Rights Council (and its special proceduresmandate holders) can play an important role as well by highlighting issues of particular concern to children affected byarmed conflict and mainstreaming child rights.

Ad hoc international criminal tribunals were established by the Security Council as subsidiary organs of the United Nations. 159. The nature and structure of mixed tribunals vary, and they can be estab- lished as a treaty-based court, e.g., Sierra Leone, a court that complies with atreaty but is established under national law, e.g., Cambodia, or as a special chamber within a State Court, e.g., Bosnia and Herzegovina. 160.

In August 2007, the Special Court for Sierra Leone also convicted Allieu Kondewa of the Civil Defense Forces militia. 164. In June 2006, Charles Ghankay Taylor was transferred from the Special Court of Sierra Leone to The Hague and now faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. These includeconscription or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces or groups and using them to participate actively in hostilities. 165.

In October 2005, the ICC issued arrest warrants for five seniormembers of the Lord's Resistance Army, including leader Joseph Kony, who was charged with 33 counts of war crime and crimes against humanity, including the forcible enlistment and active use of children under 15 years ofage in hostilities. In March 2006, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, founder and leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots in Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo, was indicted by the ICC for war crimes, conscription and enlistment ofchildren under 15 and having them participate actively in hostilities. Germain Katanga, commander of the Patriotic Resistance Force in Ituri, was transferred to the ICC in October 2007 and charged with three counts of crimes against humanity as well as six counts of war crime, which include the illegal recruitment and use of children in active hostilities. 172.

The Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed these concerns inseveral instances. With regard to the failure to provide compensation to children, it did so in the cases of Croatia and Israel (CRC/C/15/Add. 243, paras. 64, 84-85, and CRC/C/15/Add.195, paras. 58, 59, respectively); on the need to prosecute those who have violated children's rights during conflict, in the case of Indonesia (CRC/C/15/Add. 223, paras. 67, 243); and on the long pretrial detentions in poor conditions and the lack of proper rehabilitation services, in the case of Rwanda (CRC/C15/Add. 234, paras. 70, 71). See: United Nations Children' sFund, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child ,revised third edition, UNICEF, Geneva, September 2007, p. 585. 175. With regard to informal traditions of justice and national human rights commissions, see: UN Security Council, 'The Rule of Law and TransitionalJustice in Conflict and Post-conflictSocieties: Report of the Secretary- General', UN document S/2004/616, New York, 23 August 2004, para. 36; and 'Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions', endorsed by GA Resolution 48/134, specifically , the section on 'Additional Principles Concerning the Status of Commissions with Quasi Jurisdictional Competence'. 176. For example, in the General Assembly Report of the Committee on the Rights of the Child A/61/41 of 2006, the Committee encourages States parties to consider assuming extraterritorial jurisdiction (para. 22) and undertakes to develop its own position with regard to whether the obligation to take all measures to implement OP AC - article 6(1) - requires the application of universal jurisdiction (para. 23).ENDNOTES 207177. The universality principle is an element of international law holding that some crimes are so grave that all countries have an interest in prosecuting them. Itis rooted in international law and codified in United Nations instruments. Itis only used when the justice system of the country where the violations occurred is unable or unwilling to prosecute. See: UN Security Council, 'The Rule of Law and Transitional Justice in Conflict and Post-conflict Societies: Report of the Secretary- General', UN document S/2004/616, 23August 2004, para. 48. 178.

For example, as part of their 'Children and Transitional Justice Series', theUNICEF Innocenti Research Centre isinitiating documentation on childrenand transitional justice processes inColombia, Liberia, Peru, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Uganda(forthcoming publication expected 2008). The International Center for Transitional Justice has also undertaken aresearch project (report forthcoming) ontransitional justice, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) that analyses the relationship between transitional justice mechanisms (e.g., truth and reconciliation commissions) and DDR for children, including both the positive and negative effects. 190.

General Assembly Resolution 60/147 of 16 December 2005, adopting the BasicPrinciples and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International HumanRights Law and Serious V iolations of International Humanitarian Law. The Principles adopt a victim-oriented perspective, clarify the scope of the rightto a remedy ,and in their guidelines, out - line what can be done to realize it. Theydo not limit the concept of reparation tomonetary compensation but provide as well for other forms of redress, such as restitution, rehabilitation, satisfactionand guarantees of non-repetition. GAResolution 60/147 recommended that \"States take the Basic Principles andGuidelines into account, promote respectthereof and bring them to the attention of members of the executive bodies of the government, in particular law enforce-ment officials and military and security forces, legislative bodies, the judiciary, victims and their representatives, human rights defenders and lawyers, the media and the public in general.\" 194.

Another key challenge is ensuring that implementation of reparations programmes is guided by the best interests of the child as well as a rights-based and community-based approach.197. UN Security Council, 'The Rule of Law and Transitional Justice in Conflict and Post-conflict Societies: Report of the Secretary-General', UN document S/2004/616, New York, 23 August 2004, paras. 54-55. 198.

For example, article 37 of the CRC bars the death penalty and life imprisonment without possibility of release. 201. These include, among others: the United Nations Standard Minimum Rule for the Administration of Juvenile Justice ('Beijing Rules'), 1985; the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (Riyadh Guidelines), 1990; and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, 1990. Other guidelines specifically referred to by the Committee on theRights of the Child have included the 'Guidelines for Action on Children inthe Criminal Justice System' (Economic and Social Council Resolution 1997/30, Annex). 202. For example, the Committee has expressed concern that national practices are not compatible with arti- cles 37, 39 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and international guidelines, that there is no adequate and distinct juvenile justice system in place and that training focused on children's rights is needed.

More comprehensive data collection is required, however, tounderstand these links. 332. The Paris Principles refer to the term 'recruitment' as the compulsory, forcedand voluntary conscription or enlist- ment of children into any kind of armed force or armed group. 'Unlawful recruit- ment or use' is recruitment or use ofchildren under the age stipulated in the international treaties applicable to the armed force or armed group in question or under applicable national law.

The 2005 IASC guidelines indicate (p. 8) that the terms 'victim' and 'survivor'can be used interchangeably. Most often, 'victim' is used in the legal and medical sectors. 'Survivor' is generally preferred in the psychological and social support sectors because it implies resiliency. 212 MACHEL STUDY 10-YEAR STRATEGIC REVIEW: CHILDREN AND CONFLICT IN A CHANGING WORLD366.
