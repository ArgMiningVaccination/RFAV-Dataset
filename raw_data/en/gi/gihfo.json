The most useful x-ray energies fordiagnostic purposes were achieved early andbythetime ofWorld War I, andthereafter, x-rays with peak energies ranging from 30to150kiloelectronvolts were readily available.

Program goals, legal re- quirements, andfiscal restrictions within an individual state make itsuch that there may never beanabsolutely uniform setofregu- lations regarding ionizing radiation across theUnited States.

(High energy x-ray radiotherapy machine; Mixed photon-neutron field dosimetry; Neutron leakage) Introduction High-energy x-ray radiotherapy machines in thesuper-mega voltage region also generate neutrons byphotonuclear reactions inthetarget, field- filter, andperipheral areas. Thephoto- cross sections formost materials filters, maybeproduced inaccelerators with photon energies above 10MeV. These neutrons present additional shielding problems forradiation protection andmaylead to significant neutron dose topatients. Several recent biological andepidemiological studies (2,3,4) indicate that therelative biological effectiveness offast neutrons maybehigher than thecurrently accepted values. Someofthe Investigators have suggested quality factors in therange of30-50 forlowlevel neutron Irradiation. These high values oftheneutron quality factors necessitate accurate measurements ofsmall amounts offast from thesmall amount ofneutron contamination must bedetermined. Accurate neutron dose measurements have generally been more difficult than x-ray measure- ments forseveral reasons. isconverted toabsorbed dose using appropriate flux-to-dose conversion factors. These factors depend strongly on neutron energy andhence, theneutron energy spectrum must beknown orapproximated. Even fordetectors which measure absorbed dose directly, such itisnecessary because theneutron quality factors vary from about 2to11astheneutron energy changes from thermal energies to 1MeV (5,6). Inmany reported, the source. Since Pu-Be and Am-Be have higher effective neutron energy, their usecanlead tosystematic uncertainties. Itiswell known that the spectrum approximates atypical photoneutron spectrum, andthat theshape ofaphotoneutron spectrum is rather independent oftheincident electron energy (7). However, when heavy metal shielding Isplaced around aphotoneutron source, asis thecase spectrum. McCall, Jenkins, andShore (8), andMcCall (9)have obtained quantitative information about this effect andhave shown that assuming afission spectrum maylead tosignificant errors in evaluating experimental results, especially outside oftheprimary photon treatment beam. 87 Considerable attention ofthecase ofsmall neutron contamination ofphoton beams ofhigh energy itisstill instructive to review employed. Inorder toseparate absorbed response toneutrons. Since photons contribute asmall fraction ofthetotal dose, this combination results inonedosimeter responding predominantly toneutrons andthe other tophotons. Ithasbeen shown (10) that with this combination even avery large uncertainty indetermining theneutron sensitivity ofthephoton-sensitive dosimeter contributes only sensitivity would contribute asmall amount totheoverall uncertainty. Another problem which arises with mixed field measurements isthat thehigh energy photon beam results inphotoneutron production neutrons produced inthe detector areindistinguishable from theexternal neutrons, this leads toaserious problem in measuring thedose from neutrons inthebeam. Kushelevsky andShani (11) have reported order ofmagnitude calculations ofthephotoneutron yield pergram forSi,0,Alandcarbon irradiated bybremsstrahlung beams with theestimation ofneutron flux will result. McCall, Jenkins andTochlin (12) have reported similar calculations foramoderated neutron detector, anInfoil inapolyethylene cylinder. Also, McCall, Jenkins andOliver ofthe while thephotoneutron production depends onthemass, detectors with large surface-to-mass ratio, i.e., small detectors, would have lesser interference from internal photoneutron production. Also, detectors made from hydrocarbon material have lesser photo- neutron production within them because the threshold photon energy forphotoneutron pro- duction incarbon Investigatedatvarious centers formany years. Neutron dose levels outside thetreatment room for radiation protection, neutron dose inthephoton beam tothepatient, andwhole-body neutron dose tothepatient have been extensively reported in theliterature. Moderated neutron detectors have been used byLauqhlin (15), Pohlit (40), Axton andBardell (16), Holeman, Price, Friedman andNath (19) ;fast neutron activation detectors by Ernst andOvadia (22), Frost andMichel (41), Adams andPaluch tocompare these methods quantitatively because ofdiffering experimental conditions and radiation Holeman, Price, Friedman andNath ofthetreatment roomof theSagittaire accelerator isshown infigure 1.

In theusage ofthemulti sphere spectrometer, maximum values offlux-to-dose equivalent con- version factors were employed.

Marbach's diode data outside thex-ray beam areslightly larger than theactivation results, butthis difference canbeattributed almost entirely to hischoice ofaquality factor of10which is most arethemultisphere data. Itshould bepointed outthat themultisphere results represent the total neutron dose equivalent from thermal to fast neutrons. Atdistances greater than 50cm themultisphere data agree quite well with the P2O5activation detector results. Itappears that theP2OK data, when areapplied yield agood estimate ofthetotal neutron dose equivalent. Thiswould indicate that the contribution from neutrons less than 0.5MeV arenotsignificant inthedose equivalent determination.

Similar measurements equivalent tothepatient from externally generated neutrons,although atStLuke's Guildford, to determine whether asignificant whole body neutron dose-equivalent would bereceived bya patient undergoing radiotherapy with either X-rays orelectrons. Further measurements were made on aprototype M.E.L. curves^^^ giving theshapes ofthe response foreach sphere andthese normalised forthebetatron intheelectron mode being a detailed knowledge ofthesphere Iresponses and 'theuseofmore attheAddenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, England, thehigher energy machines being available only intheelectron mode. Theresults obtained with theCambridge accelerator which aredescribed below, tend to confirm theearlier measurements. TheDetection System Thedetectors consist ofasetofsixpoly- ethylene ofagold foil 1cm^inarea and100mg-cm~2 in thickness. Gold foils were chosen rather than a dynamic counting device asthey arecompletely stable andreproducible, Above this threshold photoneutron production leads predominantly to^96au which is easily separated from the^98au produced by(n,Y) reactions cm(2,3,5,8,10and 12 inches ),* *Asthespheres were constructed to exact inch diameters, reference tothese spheres inthis paper will begiven in inches. 109 Sphere efficiencies have been calculated tya Monte Carlo technique inwhich theenergy scale bins eight toadecade, thehydrogen andcarbon neutron from data centre inT9T2. Theefficiencies were computed for energies atlogarithmic intervals five toadecade. records, enable thermal detectors areplaced atthecentres ofthe spheres, provided that they arenot'black'. The Monte Carlo calculations didnotextend above 5MeVbecause thecomputing power available was insufficient tocater fortheinelastic scattering reactions inthecarbon. There arenowseveral sets ofsphere response computations published in theliterature which showgeneral agreement inthe shape above 5MeV, although there arewide differences atlower energies. Theshapes of (2)reference 6.3MeVand smaller spheres were calibrated intheNPLthermal column, andthefour smaller spheres were also calibrated with astand- ardSb-Be neutron source (mean energy 22.8 KeV). These calibrations were inagreement within afew percent with theMonte Carlo calculation. However, thecalibrations referred tointheintroduction indicated that important that thedetector efficiencies should notbeover-estimated since this would eventually lead toanunder-estimation oftheneutron radiation levels. Accordingly efficiencies above 25keVwere adjusted therad, hasbeen retained inthis paper forease ofcomp- arison ofdose-equivalent, thesievert, thetype ofneutron spectrum likely tobeencountered. From theoretical considerations theprimary is likely assembly, beam-flattening filter etc., andthedegraded beam will then interact with thedetectors. Thedegraded beam with thedetectors sothat theoverall spectrum interacting with the detectors will look something like thesolid line infigure 1, Although most ofthecontribution todose- equivalent andtissue kerma will come from neutrons above, asignificant pro- portion ofthefluence will beinthelower thedetectors ina cadmium box. Inthepresent situation this would notbewise because photoneutron production in thecadmium would interfere with Nocorrection hasbeen applied spheres notbeing irradiated, however, since these regions only contribute a small percentage tothegold foil activities produced, nocorrections were made forthis effect. Allspheres were supported onexpanded polystyrene foam above thetreatment table which wasnot exposed tothedirect beam ineither case. A oftheLandRresults a programme inthetime available, introduces some small partially self-compensating aberrations. When there isalarge sphere nearby itcanshield another sphere from part ofthe scattered radiation, butatthesame time itcan actasanadditional source ofscattered neutrons. Thelatter effect important when an out-of-beam small sphere varied from mode from 0.1to2s~1intheelectron mode. Interference from ^^dau waseasily separated out byhalf life.

There were four studies using silicon diodes which, because oftheir response tohigh energy photons, cannot beused directly inthephoton beam.

Some oftheunits areused some arenot. Discussion Review ofallthedata inacomprehensive way isdifficult because different detectors were used with different experiment arrangements, the data waspresented differently andconversions factors varied.

The scattered component accounts forapproximately 25%ofthetotal dose. 4)Theneutron dose becomes fairly constant at30to50cmfrom thebeam edge. The \"in-beam\" data is4to5times higher than this value. At5cmwhich isoften reported, ratio edge isplotted since this tends torepresent auniform dose levels. However, some data areonly using andconversion factor contained inthe papers, except fortwopoints where Q.F.'s were used thatwere consistent with Q.F. used by other authors forthesame energy range.

This agrees with themeasurements maximum ataround 25MVx-rays andthen remains relatively constant with energy.

Asexpected, itshows exactly theoutofbeam except theneutron dose levels areseveral factors higher. Conclusions Itisvery apparent from doing this study that some form ofstandardization isrequired for neutron leakage measurements. Just asdose calibration procedures have been standardized interms ofequipment, technique, experimental setupanddose calculations, sothesame approach must might well beagood starting point forthis. __ Recently recommendations were made totheNCRPl^U that this subject should receive their consider- ation anditishopeful that inthenottoo distant future andHolmes: \"Relative Measurements offast Beams from two linear accelerators and abetatron\".

(Photon beam exit, beam quality, neutron production) Introduction From theviewpoint ofreliability andbeam quality thedesign oftheX-ray exit for medical linear accelerators should fulfill several main requirements. 1. Themajor components affecting the design should beuncomplicated andeasy tomanufacture. Long assembly times caused bycomplicated Parts which bytwo considerations. a. Theenergy distribution over the whole possible radiation volume should beasuniform aspossible andthevariation insignificant for different field sizes. b. Theratio between thetumor dose andthetotal delivered dose should beashigh aspossible. This also demands alowlevel of that kind cancontribute tothetotal dose body ofthephoton These thebeam stopper, the flattening filter, andthefixed andmovable beam collimators. 139 Fig. 1 MEVATRON 20,Upper Defining Head, X-Ray Exit Window 1.TheTarget. Since there wasnoconclusive answer in 'theliterature fortheright target material for a15MVphoton beam, central ^axis depth dose curves were measured for \\thedifferent target materials and \\target thicknesses. These curves allow \\sufficient relative comparison ofthe energy spectrum produced inthetarget. Nosignificant difference inthecentral axis depth dose curves could befound between targets with high andlowatomic charge number. Nochange inthebeam quality could also befound for targets with ticknesses between .015 radiation length and .4radiation length. Fig. 2shows thedepth dose curve fora rather thin aluminium- target and a thicker tungsten target. Ftg. 3shows three depth dose inthe changes only slightly with thetarget thickness, approaching assymptoticly amaximum angle. Thehalf value angle foraluminum is considerably smaller andalso thetotal output about 20%lower. Comparing the same flattened field size thealuminum target would require about '50%more beam current than thetungsten target.7 10 12 15 DEPTH INWATER tcm) FIGURE 2 Central Axis Depth Dose 15 DEPTH INWATER (cm) FIGURE 3 Central Axis Depth Dose sources inthedefining head.

Both neutron detectors were calibrated with a Pu-Be neutron source. Thermal neutron fluences were estimated with bare indium foils, butthe results arenotreported here because thedose equivalents were generally negligible.
