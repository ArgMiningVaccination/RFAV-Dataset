Navigating an event with the scope of the Annual Meeting can be a bit of a learning curve . But with this friendly guide, you will feel the warmth and support of AACAP just as if you were sipping hot chocolate by a crack - ling Northwest fire . AACAP is a large organization with a very explicit focus on supporting trainees . This exists in many structures that are in place throughout the year, including the Committee on Medical Students and Residents (MSR), and\u2014coming soon\u2014the Mentorship Network . The Committee on MSR (which includes fellows) advocates for the needs of AACAP's trainee members, including planning Annual Meeting programming; hence, you will find a particularly strong emphasis on mentorship at the Annual Meeting . Right from the get-go, you can network with AACAP luminaries at Meet the Life Member Mentors . Many of these Life Members, known as Owls, have served in AACAP leadership roles and pioneered significant developments in child and adolescent psychiatry; they are eager to meet you and share their decades of wisdom . Just as you are encouraged to approach these child and adolescent psychiatry legends, this same ethos applies to everyone you encoun - ter at the meeting . Feel free to walk up and introduce yourself! Continue meeting your colleagues at the Medical Students and Residents Networking Hour . Next, attend the Medical Student and Residents Breakfast, where you will hear perspectives on the trainee experi - ence from three inspirational speakers at various career stages . We offer two mentorship-focused events: the Career Development Forum brings together groups focused on specific topics (advocacy, diversity, academic psychia - try, research, etc .), and the Mentorship Program for Trainees provides a home base from which trainees can explore the field, with free-form groups to dis - cuss topics ranging from planning your Annual Meeting experience to planning your career . Also consider joining the Committee on MSR's meeting, which is a great way to get more involved with our work . There are several other trainee-specific presentations, including Residents as Teachers and Resiliency in Residency and Beyond . On the logistical side, stay in the confer - ence hotels if you can (book early), or at least share a room with another trainee . The Committee on MSR maintains a list of people interested in sharing a room . Visit https://tinyurl.com/AACAP-MSR- housing to access this list and various other trainee-specific documents . For more updates and information, you can also join AACAP's unofficial MSR mem - bers' Facebook group . Once you are at the meeting, visit the Medical Student Resource Center for a casual meet and greet with AACAP leaders . When you register at the meeting, you will receive a badge with what may seem to be an embarrassingly large number of ribbons - wear them! These help people learn about you and are great conversation-starters . Speaking COLUMNS214 AACAP NEWSAACAP in the Rainy City continued from page 213 of starting conversations, if there is someone you are hoping to meet, poster sessions are a particularly good time to do so . People may be available after pre - sentations, but typically there is a long line, and conversations are kept brief . At a poster session, however, they are standing there ready and waiting to talk! You can identify people you want to meet even before the conference begins using the schedule or AACAP's App; they will be impressed if you shoot them an email beforehand to set up a time to meet . Also be ready to give your \"tell me about yourself\" elevator pitch! Lastly, you are encouraged to attend various institutions' receptions (on Thursday evening); the schedule is listed in the conference program . There are many events going on simul - taneously, and there is no way you can attend them all, so choose what seems the most appealing . It is alright to slip out to hit two presentations during the same time slot, but try to sit near the side or back if you plan to do so . You are encouraged to sign up to be a monitor . This involves minimal added effort on your part and gets you free registration and many other perks . Lastly, for future AACAP meetings, we strongly encourage you to apply for AACAP's various trainee awards . These provide invaluable support for attending the Annual Meeting and, for many members of the Committee on MSR, have had tremendous impacts on our decisions to pursue careers in child and adolescent psychiatry . Finally, take some time to enjoy the city! Of course, Seattle has the Space Needle and Pike Place Market, but consider getting a bit off the beaten path: visit the zany Museum of Pop Culture, ride a ferryboat around Puget Sound, sample delicious treats at Theo Chocolate Factory, or take a literally less beaten path with a walk around one of Seattle's beautiful parks (Volunteer Park, Discovery Park, Seward Park) . And while Seattle's reputation for rain is something of a misconception\u2014it is usually more of a mist, so Seattle actually gets less annual rainfall than recent host cities, New York and Washington, DC\u2014we do still recommend a raincoat . m Dr. Petrites is a fourth year general psychiatry resident at University of Washington and a member of the Committee on Medical Students and Residents.

COLUMNS SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 215DIVERSITY AND CULTURE COLUMN Suicide in African Americans Tracy Asamoah, MD In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report that showed that the overall suicide rate in adolescents con - tinues to increase . This alarming decade long trend signals a need for improved recognition and treatment of mental illness in youth . The increase in suicide rates for African-American youth were particularly concerning . While the rates of suicide in African-American youth have historically been lower than other groups, these data revealed a greater increase in suicides in African-American youth than in their white counterparts . A 2015 study published in JAMA Pediatrics 1 examined suicide trends from 1993 to 2012 . The authors found that the overall suicide rate in children 5 to 11 years old was stable from 1993 to 1997 and from 2008 to 2012 . However, this study also showed that while the rates of suicide in white children in the 5 to 11 age group had decreased during the study period, the rate of suicide in this age group had in-creased for African-American children . Mental illness is likely an important and a poorly addressed issue in the African- American community . Being African American is correlated with greater unmet need of mental health services . 2 A fear of stigma related to mental illness, reluctance to trust authority figures, reliance on church and community for help, and the belief that mental illness does not affect the African-American community have all been factors in the reluctance for African Americans to access mental health services . This is confounded by limited mental health resources and poor identification or misidentification of mental illness in African Americans . Further compli - cating treatment, studies have shown that when present, mental illnesses often manifest with greater severity in African Americans . Similar to adults, mental illness in Africa- American youth has not been adequately addressed . Historically, suicide in African-American youth was not seen as significant a problem as it was in same-age non-African-American youth . However, the CDC Data & Statistics Fatal Injury Report for 2016 shows that in the preceding decade while the overall rate of suicides in black youth was less than the rate in white youth, the overall rate of increase in suicide in black youth was greater than the increase in white youth . Several factors have been suggested to explain the increase in suicide in black youth . Some of these factors, such as poverty, exposure to violence, substance abuse in the home, and unstable home environments are universal to all at-risk individuals . However, some factors are unique to the experience of being African American in the United States . Data have shown that mental illnesses are often unrecognized or under-recognized in African-American youth . Problematic behaviors are of-ten penal - ized in African-American youth rather than treated with appropriate psycholog - ically sensitive interventions . In general, preventative resources and screening tools are not as available in underserved communities that have greater numbers of minority residents . In a nation experiencing greater racial turmoil, it is crucial that we also consider the effects of racial discrimination on the mental health of African-American youth . A 2017 study 3 looked at the effect of racial discrimination on death ideation in African-American youth . The study revealed that experiencing racial \"While factors such as family dysfunction, exposure to environmental violence or trauma, exposure to substance abuse, and poverty affect all communities at risk, additional factors such as racial discrimination and disenfranchisement must be considered in African-American youth. These unique factors are relevant across all socioeconomic and regional groups of African-American youth.\" continued on page 216 COLUMNS 216 AACAP NEWSSuicide in African Americans continued from page 215 discrimination was positively linked to death ideation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms . While greater changes need to be made in how mental health is accessed in all communities, there are some impor - tant considerations for mental health providers when working with African-American youth . Most important of all is being aware of the change in the statistics related to suicide with a greater recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of African-American youth . While fac - tors such as family dysfunction, exposure to environmental violence or trauma, exposure to substance abuse, and poverty affect all communities at risk, additional factors such as racial discrimi - nation and disenfranchisement must be considered in African-American youth . These unique factors are relevant across all socioeconomic and regional groups of African-American youth . Mental health providers should also maintain an awareness of the data that shows that African-American youth are often misdiagnosed with behavioral problems rather than mood or anxiety disorders which can result in incorrect and often harmful interventions . Incorporating some of the protective factors into the management of these youth in mental health settings can be invaluable . Utilizing the support from immediate and extended family ad churches, and helping support a strong ethnic identity can be valuable tools in conjunction with traditional mental health interventions . Above all, offering education to families and communities can assist in both treatment and preven - tion of those conditions that may lead to suicide . With the CDC releasing the most recent statistics on suicide in June of 2018, it behooves us to be proactive in our efforts at addressing these disturb - ing trends . m References 1 .

McGee, MD, MPH Check out the updated Ethics website on www.aacap.org with more visuals and live links . The Ethics website can be accessed under Member Resources, Resources for Primary Care, and Families and Youth tabs . AACAP's Ethics Committee developed the content for the website and worked closely with Paul Hou, Director of Information Systems & Web Services, on the redesign . All materials are open to the public except for Ask Ethics ( askethics@aacap.org ), a service reserved for AACAP members . The changes to the website were made to make it more user-friendly and curriculum-oriented . There are seven quick links: Codes of Ethics, Training and Education, Clinical Practice, Legal and Forensic Issues, State and Federal Resources, Research/Scholarly Activities, Related Ethics Links, and Ask Ethics . The Clinical Practice section includes articles organized by topic, including abuse and neglect reporting, boundary issues, confidentiality, foster care, gender dysphoria, involuntary commitment, and more . State and Federal Resources is a new quick link that includes several website links providing state specific information, such as child abuse and neglect reporting contact information, child custody laws, and civil commitment criteria and procedures . The Related Ethics Links provide links to other professional medical organizations and to a number of ethical societies . We hope AACAP members and the public find the new look and content of the Ethics Website helpful . Please spread the word to your colleagues inside and outside of child and adolescent psychiatry as well as to family members . We welcome your feedback and suggestions . If you have a recent or classic article you think should be included on the Ethics website, please feel free to email the reference to the Ethics Committee Co-Chairs, Gail A.

The Ethics Committee offers Ask Ethics (askethics@aacap.org ) as a service to all AACAP members seeking a consultation on ethics . Once the consult request is received, an Ethics Committee member responds promptly to the consultee via email and telephone with a focus on practical considerations and identification of underlying ethical principles . Members seeking consultations are asked for permission to use their de-identified scenarios as a springboard for a future AACAP News Ethics Column . The consultation does not require members to permit their case to be used more broadly for an educational purpose . Consultation requests that involve legal advice, malpractice concerns, licensure actions, or complaints about members' behaviors are beyond the scope of the Ethics Committee's charge . We are pleased to provide consultation to AACAP members . We encourage residency and fellowship program directors to consider Ask Ethics as a resource for their trainees . SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 219 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYADVOCACY COMMITTEE Juvenile Justice and Advocacy William Arroyo, MD As has been well documented, the prevalence of mental disorders among youth in the juvenile justice system is remarkably higher than that of their counterparts in the general population . Estimates reveal that approx - imately 50-70% of the two million youth entering the juvenile justice system have a mental disorder . 1 The opportunities for advocacy are numerous . AACAP has issued many position statements in the recent past that have direct relevance to juvenile justice . As with many other areas in which child and adolescent psychiatrists are involved, one must take into account the current landscape in which these prob - lems present primarily for the purpose of determining the level of resources which may be accessible to one's advocacy strategic planning . Unlike the general health arena, juvenile justice is an area in which other human service sectors, beyond those traditionally found in healthcare, must collaborate in order to meet the needs of youth in the juvenile justice system . The differ - ent array of professional staff often does not have any substantial health related training or expertise; many may have a background in the area of public safety . The mandates of the juvenile justice and health sectors are different . These mandates and composition of staff pose both opportunities and challenges for child and adolescent psychiatrists . In addition, certain services such as mental health services, including in institutions of juvenile detention and confinement, are a federal requirement to which all youth must have access; this is in con - trast to the general community where such services are not a federal require - ment . State standards and accreditation standards 2 of detention facilities include access to mental health services . Child and adolescent psychiatrists should understand that both state and federal laws and regulations govern the juvenile justice sector and, as such, should inform advocacy planning . There are several oversight bodies at local, state, and federal levels, which monitor certain aspects of juvenile detention facilities . For example, in California, every county Probation department reports quarterly data on suicide attempts, completed suicides, number of youth in detention who receive mental health services, and the use of psychotropics among youth detainees to the state agency, Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) . 3 These reports are posted on the state agency for the general public . The BSCC is charged with ensuring that all facilities adhere to state laws and regulations . It is advisable that a child and adoles - cent psychiatrist work within medical organizations of which one is a member, such as a regional organization and/or with multiple organizations that share common interests . There are many local, state, and/or national private nonprofit legal advocacy firms, such as the National Center for Youth Law and the Burns Institute, which have juvenile justice issues as a priority and often seek partnership with medical profes - sionals and/or medical professional organizations for purposes of advocacy . In addition, the MacArthur Foundation offers grants for improving juvenile justice systems and has publications on model programs . AACAP has also pub - lished monographs on juvenile justice reform . 4 An advocacy effort at the regional organization level may involve its leadership to meet with local or state authorities regarding certain concerns, which directly relate to juvenile justice and mental health . For example, several years ago, the Council of the Southern California was very concerned about the additional administrative burden for child and adolescent psychiatrists when new state regulations were issued in regard to the prescribing of psychotropic agents to all children who were dependents of the state . More specifically, the burden on child and adolescent psychiatrists was the requirement to submit to the juvenile court judge a five-page form, which detailed the child's psychiatric his - tory and proposed medication regimen, among other information . This form served as the basis by which the juvenile court judge would issue an order to have proposed medication regimen dispensed; such an order was issued after an initial review and recommenda - tion by a medical team, which assisted the juvenile court for this purpose . These children were adjudicated in either delinquency or dependency courts . The council believed the burden was extraordinary and that child and ado - lescent psychiatrists who worked with this population were being identified as the culprits in the emerging statewide concern of \"overprescribing\" to children who were dependents of the state . The Council contacted the chief of the state child and family court system, who at that time was also the presiding judge of the juvenile court of Los Angeles County . The Council leadership arranged to have a meeting at the home of one of the child and adolescent psychiatrists with the judge . The judge indicated that he would be willing to provide a sample of the completed forms so that the coun - cil could give a summary opinion on the use of such a form . Upon review of approximately 70 forms, the council opined that, in fact, there were a sub - stantial number of proposed medication regimens that did not appear to comply with general acceptable standards of care and, therefore, did not make any substantial request to change the review process at that time . Advocacy on a statewide level might entail a discussion by a state council of continued on page 220220 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYpending bills in the state legislature, e .g ., the termination of Medicaid benefits for a youth upon entry to a state or local detention facility . Although health - care is an entitlement in all detention and confinement facilities during post adjudication by federal law, the fact that a youth with mental illness will have to re-enroll in Medicaid upon release from the detention facility could result in adverse mental health outcomes as a result of not having health insurance, e .g ., Medicaid in this instance . Councils could review bills pending in state legislature that affect treatment of mental illness in the juvenile justice population and offer opinions to the author (state legislator) of the bill . A regional organi - zation could pursue technical assistance from AACAP's Advocacy Committee in conjunction with the regional organiza - tion designated state legislative liaison . In some instances, an opportunity may arise for a regional organization to sign onto an amicus brief regarding a hearing that may take place in state court . On a national level, a state council may want to communicate in writing with its congressional representatives on a bill that is pending either in the U .S . House of Representatives or U .S . Senate related to juvenile justice and mental health . Such was done by the California Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in response to some of the recent \"repeal and replace\" efforts by the two houses of Congress . AACAP staff for the Advocacy Committee assisted with this effort . Another pos - sibility may present itself when the reauthorization of the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act 5 is set to expire, as it must be reautho - rized periodically by Congress . In summary, there are multiple oppor - tunities for child and adolescent psychiatrists to advocate in the area of juvenile justice and mental health .

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 221 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYADVOCACY COMMITTEE Exploring Mental Health Parity Laura Willing, MD T he Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) mandates equal cover - age for mental health and substance use treatment similar to medical and surgical care . However, ten years later, many of our patients still struggle to find afford - able mental health care . Quantitative treatment limits (QTLs) are one way to measure parity . This means that a health plan must not have more restrictive deductibles, co-pays, visit limits, or days covered for mental health and substance use treatment than it does for medical and surgical care . For example, if a plan would cover up to 12 visits a year for a surgical specialist, it must cover up to 12 visits a year with a psychiatrist . Likewise, if the co-pay is $30 for a visit to the cardiologist, the co- pay for a psychiatrist cannot be $60 . The same logic applies to inpatient coverage . If an insurance plan will cover 28 days on a medical floor, they cannot limit coverage for mental health reasons to fewer days . Of course, the plan can still limit coverage based on \"medical neces - sity,\" but they cannot limit care based solely on the number of covered days in the insurance policy . QTLs are measur - able by definition . In general, since 2008, insurance companies have made more progress in creating equity with regard to quantifiable measures such as co-pays and visit limitations . However, there are also non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs), which are more difficult to measure, identify, and enforce when there is a parity violation . NQTLs include prior authorizations, for - mularies for prescription drugs, medical management standards for determining medical necessity, and standards for determining provider participation in a network, including reimbursement rates for those providers . For example, if an insurance plan requires preauthorization for all mental health and substance use disorder treatment, but not medical and surgical treatment, that may represent a parity violation . Furthermore, if an insur - ance plan more stringently requires prior authorizations for stimulants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as compared to asthma or cardiac medica - tions, that may also represent a parity violation . One area of particular concern for parity in our field is network adequacy and access to care . If an insurance plan does not have an adequate network of psychiatrists and therapists (across the continuum of care), causing patients to be unable to find care or causing patients to have to pay higher co-pays for out-of-network providers, this likely represents parity violation . However, this is difficult to quantify, measure, and prove because it involves comparing the adequacy of the plan's mental health network to the ade - quacy of their physical health network . In addition, it is important to note that in MHPAEA, mental health parity applies only if the insurance plan covers both mental health and substance use disorders as well as medical and surgi - cal care . When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010, MHPAEA was amended and strengthened . Because the ACA includes mental health and sub - stance use treatment as essential health benefits, all insurance plans must now meet the requirements of mental health parity . Should the ACA be weakened or altered in the future, mental health parity would only apply to those plans that include both mental health care and physical health care . Knowing how to report parity violations can be confusing because it depends on the type of insurance plan . Usually your state Department of Insurance or the federal Department of Labor are good places to start .This Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) website will help you, or your patients, determine where to report a suspected parity violation: www.hhs.gov/programs/topic-sites/mental-health-parity/mental-health-and-addiction-insurance-help/index.html .

LOUIS COUNCIL OF CHILD PSYCHIATRY New Grant Seeks to Expand and Improve Access to Behavioral Health Care for Children in Missouri Ginger E. Nicol, MD, Laine Young-Walker, MD, Ujjwal Ramtekkar, Ramtekkar, MD , (co-PI, consultant), are the co-founding directors of an exciting new collaborative care project in Missouri . The Missouri Foundation for Health has partnered with The University of Missouri in funding a $3M, three-year statewide initiative to expand Primary Care Provider (PCP) access to child and adolescent psychiatrists . The Missouri Child Psychiatry Access Project (MO-CPAP) is modeled after similar CPAP initiatives implemented in more than 20 states across the United States, supported by the National Network for CPAPs (NNCPAP), which promotes the development, sustainability, and quality of CPAP programs nationwide . As many as 25% of the nation's youth suffer from clinically significant behavioral health problems, with 75% or more receiv - ing behavioral health care from a PCP . In the state of Missouri, many children living in rural communities in particular have no access to behavioral health professionals, thereby significantly decreasing the likeli - hood of receiving treatment . MO-CPAP has been specifically adapted to fit children's mental health needs in Missouri by targeting consultation and educational outreach efforts to PCPs . The purpose of this pilot project is to develop a network of PCP users and child and adolescent psychiatrist consultants, with the overarch - ing goals being to 1) create a telephonic consultation service for PCPs, 2) develop educational outreach and support services for PCPs, and 3) link patients and families to behavioral health care coordination and community resources .Beginning in January, MO-CPAP began the six-month planning phase of the project, which will initially be piloted in Eastern Missouri beginning in the second half of 2018, with expansion to the Central Region in Year 2 . PCP support services include timely telephonic consultations with a child and adolescent psychiatrist regarding screening, diagnosis, and management of behavioral health conditions, linkage and referral services to connect patients to community-based behavioral health care and other resources for treatment, as well as ongoing education and training oppor - tunities for participating PCPs . MO-CPAP benefits from committed part - nerships with key stakeholders, including the Behavioral Health Network, National Alliance on Mental Illness-St . Louis (NAMI-St . Louis), Assessment Resource Center (ARC), Washington University Pediatric & Adolescent Ambulatory Research Consortium (WU PAARC), Behavioral Health Response (BHR), and the Greater St . Louis Council for Child & Adolescent Psychiatry . Each organization is represented on the MO-CPAP steer - ing committee, which will meet monthly during the first year of funding to assist with problem-solving, development, and meeting of project milestones . MO-CPAP is currently in the process of recruiting both PCP and CAP participants . PCPs who are eligible for enrollment in MO-CPAP include pediatricians, family medicine physicians, physician assistants, and advanced nurse practitioners in the state of Missouri . Requirements for child and adolescent psychiatrist consultants include board certification in child and adolescent psychiatry, licensed in the state of Missouri, with at least five years of clinical practice experience . Enrollment of MO PCPs and child and adolescent psychiatrist consultants will begin this spring with a target service initiation date of July 1, 2018 .

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 223 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYNEW MEXICO CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS A Tale of Two Borders Shawn Sidhu, MD On Monday, May 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered a speech to the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies out - lining new immigration policies . In this speech, Sessions stated, \"Last month, I put in place a 'zero tolerance' policy for illegal entries on our Southwest border referred by the Department of Homeland Security,\" and added \"if you are smug - gling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law . If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border . \" 1 In the weeks and months that followed, stories, images, and sounds emerged that shook our nation to its core . The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the government in a class action lawsuit on the grounds that the separation of families is a violation of constitutional and due process rights . 2 The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of a Congolese woman who was separated from her 7-year-old daughter for five months after seeking asylum at a San Diego border crossing, and another Brazilian asylum-seeker who has been separated from her 14-year-old son since an arrest ten months ago . The Congolese woman reports she could hear her daughter in the next room, screaming \"Mommy, don't let them take me!\" 3 The mother was detained in San Diego while her daughter was placed at a youth shel - ter in Chicago 2,000 miles away with intermittent phone contact . On February 20, 2018, a 20-year-old female named Mirian arrived at the Texas border with an 18-month-old son after fleeing persecution in Honduras . 4 She reports that agents ordered her to place her son in the back seat of a government vehicle and that both of them cried as he was driven away . She reports that she was never told why her son was being taken away from her . A case manager told her that her son asked about her and \"cried all the time\" in the days after he arrived at a separate facility . Mirian stated to reporters, \"I had no idea that I would be separated from my child for seeking help... I am so anxious to be reunited with him .\" Esteban Pastor, a 28-year-old Guatemalan male, was also separated from his 18-month-old son last summer . 5 He states, \"I cried . I begged . No one could tell me anything .\" He reports that border agents replied, \"Your kid is going to a shelter . You're going to a jail .\" He reports pleading to no avail, \"Let me go back to Guatemala . Don't separate us . I want to go back to my country with my son .\" Pastor was deported to Guatemala months later, but his child remained in the United States for two months . The father and son were united after being separated for four months after Pastor made two dozen phone calls to authori - ties, and Pastor reports, \"I didn't know if I would see him again .\" While many Americans were shocked that we had come to this point as a nation, the national response to this policy has been heartwarming and inspiring . On Friday, June 1, thousands of individuals across the country partici - pated in the Families Belong Together National Day of Action . Similarly, on Friday, June 30, thousands across the United States joined in \"Keep Families Together\" protests to end family separa - tion . These peaceful protests were organized in opposition to the separa - tion of families at the border, and took place in more than 24 cities across the country . 6 The response from the medical com - munity, including AACAP, has been strong and swift . On June 20, 2018, 17 mental health organizations sent a letter to the U .S . Department of Justice, the U .S . Department of Health and Human Services, and the U .S . Department of Homeland Security with a position state - ment completely against the separation of children from their parents at the border . AACAP President Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD , issued a President's Statement on Separating Children from Families in which she highlighted that \"children who experience sudden separation from one or both parents, especially under frightening, unpredict - able, and chaotic circumstances, are at higher risk for developing illnesses such as anxiety, depression, post - traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and other trauma-induced reactions .\" She went on to state that parental sup - port is a \"proven protective factor that substantially reduces risk for adverse health and developmental outcomes for children . Separating these children from their families in times of stress creates unnecessary and high-risk trauma at the very time they need care and support the most .\" As a result, AACAP strongly opposes any policy or legislation that separates children and families in stress - ful situations, especially in the case of those fleeing war, violence, and other traumatic situations in their home coun - tries . Shortly following this President's Statement, AACAP released an offi - cial Policy Statement on Separating Immigrant Children from Their Families on June 26, 2018 . Public pressure resulted in an unforeseen reversal by the current administration on June 20, effectively ending mandatory parental separation . This was a great victory for child and family advocates across the nation, despite the fact that thousands of children remain separated from their parents . Here in the Southwest, the response has also been overwhelming from men - tal health providers and community members who want to get involved in helping immigrant families who are fleeing torture and persecution . New continued on page 224224 AACAP NEWSCOMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY Mexico Child Psychiatrists (NMCP), the regional organization representing New Mexico in AACAP's Assembly, received an AACAP Advocacy and Collaboration Grant this year to host an asylum evalua - tion training for local providers . The goal was to train approximately 15 mental health providers in providing evaluations for the purpose of supporting the asylum claims of individuals fleeing persecution . Our ultimate goal is to establish a broad network of mental health providers who are willing and able to provide evaluations for families fleeing torture and persecution . Thanks to AACAP's Advocacy and Collaboration Grant, we are well on our way with more momen - tum than we could have imagined . Most inspiring is that this movement has resulted in real-life changes for individu - als seeking asylum, as the majority of individuals who have received mental health evaluations in New Mexico have gone on to win their asylum cases and gain freedom from torture and persecution! There is an incredible amount of grass - roots energy nationwide at this time, and we must all harness this energy as a catalyst for real change in the lives of our patients . m References 1 .

Currently, three caucuses are active in AACAP - Black Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, and International Medical Graduate (IMG) Caucus . Historically, after receiving support from the Diversity and Culture committee, the Black Caucus and Hispanic Caucus were inaugurated in 2010 with two-year trial periods, with the initial goals of providing support to diverse minority members, foster - ing inclusiveness within AACAP, and offering ways for minority members to be more involved . The IMG Caucus was added in 2012, and finally, the Asian Caucus was recently approved by AACAP and will be having its inaugural meeting during the 65th Annual Meeting in Seattle . This article will highlight goals and functions of each caucus for a more in-depth understanding of their purpose and objectives . The Black Caucus was inaugurated in 2010 with the intention of providing a space where attendees who are African-American or of African descent to be able to connect, network, and support each other in their careers and become more involved in AACAP activities . Since its inauguration, the Black Caucus has identified goals of expanding submis - sions for events related to the needs of African-American children on AACAP's agenda, such as youth in the child welfare system and identity issues in biracial and multiracial children . It also has worked on expanding networking for career purposes for its members and has emphasized the importance of recruiting more psychiatrists of color into child and adolescent psychiatry . The Hispanic Caucus was also inau - gurated in 2010 to provide a space for attendees who are Hispanic or interested in Hispanic issues to network, share difficult clinical scenarios, or brainstorm ideas to improve access to mental health care and care in general for Hispanic children and their families . Since its inauguration, the Hispanic Caucus has been active in promoting advocacy for Hispanic children, and providing mentorship to its members, and work - ing on providing linguistic resources for families and clinicians . The members of the Hispanic Caucus also have aspired to reach out to colleagues in Latin America and to establish a working relationship with other national Latino groups . The IMG Caucus was started in 2012 with the goal of supporting IMGs within AACAP . Approximately 30% of U .S . child and adolescent psychiatrists are IMGs, representing over 100 countries, variable cultures, and many languages . Since its inception, the IMG Caucus has been working to provide sup - port for unique challenges these IMG child and adolescent psychiatrists face by advocating for IMG-related issues through AACAP, including topics such as professional development, career pathways, faculty and peer mentoring, and visa issues . The need for an Asian Caucus has been voiced in the past, but the demand has never been this high in recent years . Despite the fact that Asian Americans recently have been noted as the fast - est growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, there has not been much recognition of mental health needs for Asian-American children . As the Asian Caucus will have its inaugural meet - ing during AACAP's Annual Meeting in October this year, the goal of this estab - lishment would be to promote awareness and advocacy to reduce stigma, and to support members of AACAP to further advance much needed clinical practice guidelines, scholarship, advocacy, and research in Asian-American mental health in children and adolescents in addition to providing forums for the members to discuss career development . An overarching theme among all the caucuses is that many of the minority child psychiatrists have difficulty becom - ing involved in AACAP due to feeling marginalized within the organization, and each caucus works towards lowering these barriers for its members . Although each caucus is unique in targeting dif - ferent minority groups, they all aspire to achieve similar goals of: \"The need for an Asian Caucus has been voiced in the past, but the demand has never been this high in recent years. Despite the fact that Asian Americans recently have been noted as the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, there has not been much recognition of mental health needs for Asian-American children.\" continued on page 226 226 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY1 . Providing a forum for attendees from diverse cultures and attendees of color to be able to promote inclusive - ness within AACAP, and helping the members to be more involved in the Annual Meeting 2 . Providing networking opportuni - ties for the members to be able to mutually support each other in their professional development and to discuss unique challenges members face in their daily professional lives 3 . Establish mentorship that extends to greater AACAP and encourages recruitment of diverse members into AACAP to reduce service disparities 4 . Supporting research and advocacy work to recognize the mental health needs of minority population and to develop guidelines to help other psychiatrists be more culturally competentThe caucuses are not only established and supported by the Diversity and Culture Committee as a way to reach out to a diverse population of child psychia - trists but also their activities are reported to the committee as a way of being connected to the leadership of AACAP . Consistent and dynamic activities of each caucus will ensure the promotion of diversity within the organization, and further along, will chip away on the dis - parities in mental health care for diverse minority children . m Dr. Cho works at Yakima Valley Farm Workers' Clinic in Yakima, WA.

For instance, the dachshund, bred in Germany to hunt badgers, took a hundred years to develop . However, manipulating the human genome had remained largely in the realm of fiction until 1990, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) con - ducted the first approved gene therapy trial . It successfully\u2014albeit transiently\u2014 re-introduced a functional adenosine deaminase gene into the T cells of a 4-year-old female with Adenosine deaminase deficiency Severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) . The future looked promising . However, in 1999, Jesse Gelsinger died following a catastrophic immune response to an injected adenoviral vector carrying the orornithine transcarbamylase gene, of which he was deficient . Gelsinger's death stalled the nascent field for the better part of a decade, at least until Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) arrived . CRISPR adapts a naturally occurring bac - terial anti-viral defense system to permit rapid gene editing . It has given scientists the ability to edit DNA - in essence, to direct the evolution of all species, includ - ing our own . CRISPR is relatively simple, requiring only two components\u2014a guide RNA and a Cas9 (CRISPR associated system) enzyme . The guide RNA directs Cas9 to a specific region in the genome via complementation, where the enzyme, acting as \"molecular scissors,\" introduces double strand breaks, allowing for ran - dom insertions or deletions of the gene (\"knock out\") or substitution of a sup - plied DNA template . Prior gene editing systems had been laborious and expen - sive; CRISPR is relatively cheaper and fast, which led Hank Greely of Stanford to dub it the Model T of genome engi - neering\u2014not the first but transformative due to cost and accessibility . From the onset, CRISPR/Cas9, appeared to hold near limitless promise as well as peril in clinical gene editing applica - tions . It can be delivered into animal or human cells through an in vivo approach in which components are introduced by injection using viral or non-viral vectors . In the ex vivo approach, somatic or pluripotent cells are extracted, modified by CRISPR/Cas9, then infused back into the organism . If genetic alterations occur in somatic cells, the impact is limited to the lifespan of the cell; when germline precursors are edited, the edited gene can be transmitted by heredity to prog - eny . Ex vivo gene therapy holds a distinct advantage in that modified cells are easily screened prior to reintroduction to ensure successful editing . While powerful and versatile, CRISPR/ Cas9 is not a perfect gene editing machine . Precision in editing is not guaranteed, although subsequent refine - ments of the guide RNA and Ca9 have improved fidelity . In addition, there is potential for off-target effects which may result from poor quality guide RNAs that bind indiscriminately, resulting in \"genomic vandalism\" and the poten - tial mutation of genes outside of the intended target . Thus far, CRISPR has held the highest promise for the more than 7,000 human diseases caused by single gene mutations . Research is look - ing for cures at breakneck speed . The first clinical trials of CRISPR in humans started in 2016 in China with ex vivo treatment of T cells from patients with treatment-resistant cancer to block a checkpoint inhibitor, increasing the chances for cancer cells to be attacked by immune response . The first ex vivo U .S . trial, organized by the University of Pennsylvania, will soon test the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of using modified T cells in multiple myeloma, melanoma, and sarcoma . As vast sums of venture capital money are pouring into CRISPR companies, the technology is likely to improve dramatically in the future . In this post-genomic era, hundreds of risk loci have been isolated for psychiatric disorders, although with frequent overlap between conditions . Understanding of the gene x gene SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 231 FEATURESand gene x environment interactions driving clinical phenotypes remains extremely limited, largely owing to a lack of appropriate model organisms that capture the known complexity of these illnesses . With CRISPR, researchers can introduce more than one mutation into a single cell or embryo, permitting a closer approximation of genetic disease architecture than previously available in a fraction of the time . The technique can be employed to rapidly accelerate screening and functional characteriza - tion of candidate genes and non-coding RNAs in cultured cells . Guoping Feng of the McGovern Institute has utilized CRISPR to generate a mouse lacking a negative regulator of Wnt signaling with strong association to ASD, resulting in mice with characteristic autistic behav - iors, macrocephaly, and craniofacial abnormalities highly similar to clinical phenotypes . Feng has reported that work is underway to generate models with more than one genetic alteration as well as CRISPR-generated primate models . A group from Brigham and Women's Hospital coupled three-dimensional culture methods with CRISPR-mediated DISC1 (Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 ) knock-out pluripotent stems create cerebral organoids, or \"mini-brains,\" to study morphological and gene expression changes simul - taneously . CRISPR may also expand the repertoire of organisms available for studying psychiatric illnesses, as illustrated by CRISPR knock-out of orco in ants with significant reduction in socialization . While crossing the blood- brain barrier poses technical limitations for applications in adult model organ - isms, recent advances in delivery vectors and inducible systems may alleviate these, permitting knock-out of discrete populations of neurons in adult organ - isms to mimic the effects of addiction and other illnesses . Even considering using CRISPR to treat psychiatric illness raises unique ethical questions . Genes and non-coding RNAs rarely possess a single, discrete function, and particular functions may only reveal themselves under pressure . The collec - tive knowledge regarding the specific genetic determinants underpinning personality and intelligence also remains rudimentary at best . The link between psychiatric illness and creativity has been widely hypothesized and concep - tualized by the \"inverted-U\" hypothesis of creativity and psychopathology, in which mild-to-moderate levels of genetic risk variants may increase creativity, but more severe risk burden interferes with cognitive output . Alternatively, mild-to-moderate stress may increase creativity and productivity in genetically- predisposed individuals while significant stress yields acute decompensation . The connections are complex: Bipolar disorder can intermingle with creativity and John Nash's schizophrenia existed in the same person as his Nobel Prize winning creativity . As Edvard Munch once said, \"[My troubles] are part of me and my art . They are indistinguishable from me, and [treatment] would destroy my art .\" CRISPR-mediated alteration of a collection of risk-conferring polymor - phisms may alleviate suffering but at the sacrifice of personality or creativ - ity - a debatable psychosocial cost . Furthermore, as CRISPR is currently under patent and regulated as a drug by the FDA, the costs associated with CRISPR-based therapies could prove sig - nificant, raising potential equity issues . Germline engineering remains among the most tantalizing and controversial of CRISPR applications . In 2017, the National Academy of Sciences published preliminary guidelines for gene-editing research, stating that germline editing trials should be approached cautiously to assist in treating severe monogenic illnesses, such as Huntington's chorea and beta-thalassemia, with prohibition against germline editing for trait selection or \"enhancement .\" Designer babies, a staple of fiction about dystopian futures, are a long way off but may eventually confront child and adolescent psychia - trists with serious ethical dilemmas . m Recommended reading: \"A Crack in Creation\" by Jennifer and \"Modern Editing the Human Genome with Crispr-Cas9\" by Jim Kozubek Dr. Grzenda is currently a fourth year (research track) and chief resident in adult psychiatry at UCLA/Semel Institute.

It does, however, have quite a few cloudy days and days with light precipitation, particularly in the wintertime.232 AACAP NEWS FEATURESMechanisms Matter: Why Child/Adolescent Psychiatrists Should Care About Neuroimaging (and Not Be Afraid) Daniel P. Dickstein, MD Borrowing from Charles Dickens (no relation), as a child and adolescent psychiatrist who both sees outpatients and does research, I believe it is the best of times and the worst of times . \"Best\" because research using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advancing what is known about the brain as well as behavioral mechanisms underlying both typical development and child and adolescent psychiatric disorders . It is the \"worst\" because child and adolescent physicians and trainees often feel left out of these discoveries, as they strain to penetrate the many barriers to reading and understanding neuro - imaging articles . Trainees and faculty tell me they struggle with: \"coronal\"), (2) laundry lists of brain regions, (3) how almost everything can involve the amygdala, and (4) how it is relevant to my patients now . I find myself summa - rizing their concerns in one of my least published (but perhaps most important) ideas that I have named \"Dickstein's Paradox,\" which states that: \"All too often, child and adolescent psychiatrists' and trainees' brains are paradoxically turned off\u2014rather than being turned on\u2014when looking at brain imaging research and articles .\" Addressing Dickstein's paradox by increasing child and adolescent psychia - trists' comfort with neuroimaging is crucial because understanding these brain mechanisms increases our ability to diagnose, treat, predict, and prevent child psychiatric disorders, resulting in better patient care . The best example of better understanding of illness mechanisms transforming care comes from childhood cancer\u2014specifi - cally acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) . Until the 1980s, ALL was a death sentence for most children . Now, the five-year survival rate is over 95%! What happened? Clinicians, researchers, parents, and payers got together and ensured that every child with cancer was part of research\u2014so that their illness experience became data . In turn, advances in the underlying mechanisms were not just discovered, but got translated into diagnostic and treatment biomarkers and mechanism-driven treatment . These mechanisms did not replace clinical care; they augmented it . Thus, when an astute physician or parent makes a clinical observation that the child is less active, has a swollen belly, or has easy/excessive bruising, a biomarker is more likely to be ordered\u2014 an ultrasound or complete blood count . Cancer is diagnosed or ruled out, and\u2014if necessary\u2014a specific treatment protocol is assigned . We desperately need such mechanism-driven biomarkers in child psychiatry . Without them, suicide has become the second leading killer in the United States starting at age 10, all the way to age 33 years old, whereas cancer is not even in the top three . Every week sees a new article about increasing rates of children and adolescents suffering from autism to ADHD . Despite our best efforts, we have not increased access to outpatient child and adolescent psychiatric care, even for those with insurance and especially for those not on the extreme coasts of the United States . How will these mechanisms matter in addressing these problems for our field? As highlighted by an article titled \"On being a circuit psychiatrist\" by Joshua Gordon, MD, PhD, current Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), psychiatrists are uniquely trained\u2014from medical school, through residency/fellowship, and beyond\u2014to integrate information from blades of grass (e .g ., information about dendritic spines on neurons, methylation of DNA, etc .) to 30,000 feet in the sky (e .g ., information about a patient's social context, relationships, and work environment) . 1 That extensive training can improve our diagnostic formulation about a patient and thus our treatment . Being a \"Circuit Psychiatrist\" is not easy, as it requires courage to make \"life-long learning\" not just a slogan, but a regular occurrence . Currently, studies are testing how neuroimaging might ultimately augment our approach to patient care . For example, studies are evaluating how structural, functional activity, and connectivity alterations observed in MRI SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 233 FEATURESscans differentiate youth with common child and adolescent psychiatric illnesses from typically-developing controls . Other studies are seeing if these findings replicate and thus might be useful as an imaging biomarker of that illness . Some studies are even taking the next step to see if computers trained with those imaging biomarkers can correctly identify which children do or do not have an illness . Neuroimaging is setting the stage for mechanism-guided treatments . Having shown that certain illnesses involve alterations in brain/behavior interactions, several groups are working on translating these findings into novel treatments . For example, studies are testing to see if playing videogames designed to build up specific cognitive or emotional skills that are deficient in certain conditions can result not only in improvements in those skills, but also in improvements in the underlying brain circuitry . This tech - nique, \"computer assisted cognitive remediation,\" seeks to use these games to \"retrain the brain .\" If effective, this could increase access to care\u2014innumer - able children could simultaneously undergo such a program, even from their own homes, while being monitored by a child and adolescent psychiatry faculty at a distance . Thus, the future looks bright, and will clearly need child and adolescent psychiatry physicians and trainees to be informed consumers of neuroimaging and neuroscience literature . However, we must also be mindful that as of today, there are no replicated, well validated, and clinically applicable uses of neuroimaging\u2014a fact highlighted by an in press consensus statement from the American Psychiatriac Association . 2 How we break down the barriers for all child and adolescent psychiatry physi - cians and trainees to better access neuroimaging and other mechanism- based research is critical to our field\u2014now and in the future . One important new resource is the National Neuroscience Curriculum Initiative (NNCI) ( www.NNCIONLINE.org ), a collaboration between psychiatric educators/training directors and neuro - scientists whose goal is to provide shared resources to help psychiatrists integrate a modern neuroscience perspective into every facet of their clinical work . It helps provide tools to help our patients, trainees, and one another understand the bio-behavioral mechanisms underlying the psychiatric diagnoses and treatments . NNCI is regularly testing and refining new learning modules that break down the barriers to neuroimaging, genetics, and other neuroscience-related areas while harnessing the latest in educational innovations\u2014so that people learn and retain this information . NNCI provides materials for self-study, clinical settings, and in the classroom . The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (JAACAP ) also has resources for child and adolescent psychiatry faculty and trainees seeking to break through these learning barriers . For example, JAACA P's \"Translations\" feature, which is available online, seeks to bridge the gap between child and adolescent psychiatry and other professional and scientific disci - plines . JAACAP Connect , the online extension of JAACAP , aims to emphasize the translation of research findings into clinical practice . AACAP itself is another useful resource to break down these barriers . The recent Douglas B . Hansen, MD, Annual Review Course provided material to facilitate understanding of neuroimaging . AACAP's Annual Meeting often features opportunities for all child and adolescent psychiatry physicians and trainees to interact with those presenting neuroim - aging and other neuroscience data .In short, the time is ripe for child and adolescent psychiatry physicians and trainees to embrace their unique role harnessing the latest neuroscience to the benefit of our patients . Bolstered by resources to break through associated barriers, perhaps they will even become involved in such research\u2014if not hands-on, then by referring patients to ongoing studies . Together, we can do for our specialty what has been done for ALL . m References 1 . Gordon JA . On being a circuit psychiatrist .

As the role of child and ado - lescent psychiatrists (CAPs) increasingly includes the care of children with AID, CAPs must be aware of the complex systems of care and the emerging advances for serving these youth . In this day long program, we present innovative approaches to mental health needs, educational planning, cultural barriers, and transition to adulthood in addition to the evidence-based practices that are unique to this population . Participants learn about the system of care that youth with AID and their families must navigate and how collaboration among mental health providers, developmental disability service systems, and other medical providers can best meet the needs of youth with AID and their families . This special program highlights exist - ing resources that can be directly applied by CAPs for treating those with AID and for addressing the existing system gaps . Whether a clinician, policy maker, administrator, or researcher, a CAP is well-served by participating in this special program .

He is the Director of the University of Washington Center for Drug Addiction Research and a fellow of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology . He received a PhD in pharmacology from Stanford University, and conducted postdoctoral work at Salk Institute and Scripps Clinic in neurophysiology . Throughout his career, Dr . Chavkin's research program has been focused on understanding the functioning of the endogenous dynorphin opioid neuropeptides and their kappa opioid receptors . Dr . Chavkin's research effort in his laboratory continues to be focused on 1) the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain; 2) the molecular mechanisms regulat - ing opioid receptor functioning; and 3) the role of the endogenous dynorphin opioids in the regulation of mood and drug addiction risk . They use a combination of electrophysi - ological, anatomical, and molecular approaches to understand the role of opioid neuropeptides as neurotransmitters in the brain with the ultimate goal of gaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of drug addiction, a malleable form of motivated behavior .

NOSHPITZ CLINE HISTORY LECTURE What Has Happened to Fifty Years of Child Abuse Reporting Laws? The One-Hundred-Forty Million Dollar Mistake Wednesday, October 24 11:15 am-12:45 pm ( open) Chair: David W. MD Lenore C. Terr, MD , practices child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry in San Francisco and serves on the clinical faculty of the University of California at San Francisco . For many years, she has taught part-time in the law schools of Case Western Reserve University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Davis . Her practice and research career has focused on defining, characterizing, treating, testifying, as well as the follow-up of childhood trauma in infancy throughout late adulthood . Her most well-known research project was a one- and five-year follow-up study of the children kidnapped from their school bus in Chowchilla, CA, including a comparative study of normal children from McFarland, CA, and Porterville, CA . Dr . Terr is a graduate of the University of Michigan Medical School and its psychiatry fellowship programs . She has served as a Director of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology as well as on AACAP's Council, and as a section editor of JAACAP . She is the author of four books on childhood trauma, memory, play, and psychotherapy, in addition to numerous publications in the scientific literature . She has received major awards for child psychiatric research (the Ittleson Award, APA), psychodynamic treatment (the Rieger Award, AACAP), and career achieve - ments (the McGavin Award, APA) among others, and has delivered numerous distinguished lectureships . Fifty years before this talk, every state in the U .S . had legislated a child abuse act . The federal government had also enacted a reporting program . As the years went by, not only were doc - tors and mental health professionals required to turn in cases of suspected abuse to their local crime and child-protective authorities, but all educational, babysitting, photo-developing, camp counseling, church-related, and nursery school person - nel were mandated to do the same . There could be no lawsuits in retaliation for a report . And a report was to be immediate, not after \"investigation .\" In Los Angeles, officials at Miramonte School had heard of a number of strange incidents, largely involving Hispanic-American 8- and 9-year-olds . The children did not know what was happening to them at the hands of their male third-grade teacher . When it became apparent that over many years the school had failed to report abusive behavior and that the school system had destroyed their files, Dr . Terr was asked to interview three girls as representative examples . In this talk, she explains how trauma presents in people too na\u00efve to know at the time that they are being traumatized, and why failing to take 50 years of legislation into account became a 140-million-dollar mistake . Sponsored by AACAP's History and Archives Committee and supported by David W. Cline, MD KARL MENNINGER, MD, PLENARY Saving Holden Caulfield Wednesday, October 24 4:15 pm-5:45 pm (open) Chair: Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD, AACAP President, presiding Speaker: David A. Brent, MD David A. Brent, MD , is the Academic Chief of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and holds an endowed chair in Suicide Studies at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he also directs Services for Teens at Risk (STAR), a clinical and research program for the treatment of depressed and suicidal adolescents . Dr . Brent has been active as a clinician and researcher focusing on adolescent depression and suicidal behavior for more than three decades, and his work has helped to establish standards of care for these vulnerable youth . He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and has been recognized for his research by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Program Highlights continued from page 237 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 239 65TH ANNUAL MEETING OCT 22-27, 2018 SEATTLE, WAthe International Association for Suicide Research, the Institute of Living, and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation . The adolescent suicide rate has increased over the past decade . While further research on how to prevent adolescent suicide is still needed, there are strategies that, if widely implemented, could result in a reversal in this disturbing trend, which will be addressed in this plenary speech . The title of the classic novel about adolescent angst, The Catcher in the Rye , comes from a passage in which the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, describes a wish to catch kids who are playing in a field of rye before they fall off a cliff . Holden's predicament is not dissimilar to mental health professionals who are struggling to come up with a coherent plan to reverse the rise in adolescent suicide . Instead of standing by the cliff, when it is too late to effectively intervene, we should: lead kids away from the cliff (preven - tion); embed ourselves in the field (improve access to care); put a fence around the cliff (restrict access to lethal agents); and change the rules of the game in the field (systemic quality improvement to reduce the risk of suicide in mental health patients) . Each of these strategies has evidence-based interven - tions that are currently not fully utilized . If we have the will to direct resources to these strategies, we can achieve reduction in the adolescent suicide rate now, even as we are awaiting future research advances .

HARRIS, MD, DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHIATRY FORUM Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Understanding Neuropsychiatric Outcomes and Psychotherapeutic Treatments Thursday, October 25 8:30 am-11:00 am (open) Chairs: Roma A. Vasa, MD, Natasha Marrus, MD, PhD Speakers: Jeffrey E. Max, MD, and Brian Brooks, PhD In this Forum, two leaders in the field of developmental neu - ropsychiatry of pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) present their findings on mTBI or concussion . The first speaker, Jeffrey E. Max, MD , is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and leader in developmental neuropsychiatry research on pediatric TBI . He is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego and Director, Neuropsychiatric Research at Rady Children's Hospital . His work includes prospective studies of psychiatric outcomes in children and adolescents with mild to severe TBI . The thrust of Dr . Max's research is to identify brain imaging characteristics including microstructural white matter integrity, magnetoencephalography detection of brain injury, and lesion location as well as psychosocial (e .g ., family function, family psychiatric history, child's pre-injury function) predictors of varied psychiatric disorders that develop after brain injury . Dr . Max leads a 5-year National Institutes of Health study \"Magnetoencephalography and Neurobehavioral Outcome of Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury\" . He has received an award from the Big Blue Sky Foundation to study the long- term outcome of pediatric traumatic brain injury . The second speaker, Brian Brooks, PhD , is a clinician-scientist studying concussion in children and adolescents . He is a pediatric neuropsychologist at the Alberta Children's Hospital (Calgary, Alberta, Canada), an adjunct faculty member with the Departments of Pediatrics, Clinical Neurosciences, and Psychology at the University of Calgary, a full member with the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI), and an associate member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI) . His research focuses on neuropsychological outcomes from concussion, including early diagnosis, prognostication of outcome, potential treatment options, and long-term effects . He has more than 200 journal publications, book chapters, and presentations in the field of neuropsychology . He has been rec - ognized with several distinctions from the National Academy of Neuropsychology, including twice receiving the Nelson Butters award for best publication, receiving the early career award in 2014, and being elected a fellow in 2015 . He is currently supported by a four-year CIHR Embedded Clinician Researcher award that focuses on neuropsychological outcomes from pediatric concussion . Dr . Max places biopsychosocial risk for psychiatric and behav - ioral complications of TBI in a historical and clinical context . He acknowledges the methodological model of studying TBI introduced by Sir Michael Rutter and his group in the 1970's . He attempts to identify and demystify the phenomenology and treatment of psychiatric syndromes that may be complications of TBI . He presents a selection of his findings on mTBI that underscore not only brain variables but also psychosocial vari - ables . This sets the stage for Dr . Brooks, and his presentation of a psychological treatment for sleep disruption in pediatric mTBI . He presents the newest findings from his studies on sleep disruption and focuses on results of his randomized controlled trial investigating the use of CBT-i in adolescents with refractory symptoms following concussion . The James C . Harris, MD, Developmental Neuropsychiatry Forum is an annual event thanks to a generous donation from AACAP Distinguished Fellow James C . Harris, MD, and his wife Catherine DeAngelis, MD, MPH . The Forum provides the opportunity for Annual Meeting attendees to learn about cutting-edge science in this evolving subspecialty area of child and adolescent psychiatry . continued on page 240240 AACAP NEWS 65TH ANNUAL MEETING OCT 22-27, 2018 SEATTLE, WA 65TH ANNUAL MEETING OCT 22-27, 2018 SEATTLE, WATOWN MEETING The Crisis in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residency Recruitment Thursday, October 25 11:45 am-1:15 pm (open to all AACAP members) Chair: Lisa M. Cullins, MD AACAP President, presiding Speakers: Victor Fornari, MD, MS, James J. Hudziak, MD, Paramjit T. Joshi, MD An increasing shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists is occurring as demand for services increase . The national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists has prompted efforts not only to address concerns about how we, as a spe - cialty, help with recruitment efforts but how AACAP can help improve access to treatment . Child and adolescent psychiatrists are essential because of our medical training and our ability and expertise in treating patients . Yet, child and adolescent psychiatry residency slots remained unfilled . The Town Meeting is the perfect opportunity to highlight the workforce shortage, provide a dialogue from different perspec - tives on the concerns surrounding recruitment efforts, and explore next steps in addressing this critical topic .

Kraft's work in early childhood and population health seeks to translate the goals of health equity into medical practice . As president of the AAP, Dr . Kraft's focus is in Advancing Child Health through the practice of pediatrics .Dr . Kraft's presentation outlines current and future strategies that align child psychiatry and pediatrics in building mental wellness . Advances in developmental science and under - standing of stress modulators in early childhood have led to targeted efforts toward actions that can build mental wellness and prevent toxic stress . The American Academy of Pediatrics, through its Agenda for Children priority of Early Brain and Child Development, have brought the understanding of toxic stress to pediatricians and the general public . Interventions including home visiting, maternal depression screening and treatment, and partnerships between child psychiatrists and pediatricians can effectively change the paradigm to implement strate - gies that build mental wellness in our children, adolescents, and families . PRESIDENTIAL INTERVIEW Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD, Interviews Joan Luby, MD Saturday, October 27 11:45 am-1:15 pm (open) Joan Luby, MD , is the Samuel and Mae S . Ludwig Professor of Psychiatry (Child) at Washington University School of Medicine in St . Louis . She is the founder and director of the Washington University School of Medicine Early Emotional Development Program (EEDP) . Dr . Luby's research has focused on the characterization of early childhood psychopathology, early behavioral and biological markers of risk, and associated alterations in brain and emotional develop - ment in early childhood . In addition, her program of research has informed the influence of the psychosocial environment on brain development, sensitive periods for these effects, and implications for risk and early intervention for mental disorders . Dr . Luby's contributions include establishing the criteria for identification, validation, and early intervention in depressive syndromes in the preschool age group, as well as studies in humans showing the effect of parental nurturance and early experiences of poverty on brain development .

JobSource FEATURES&246 AACAP NEWS OPINIONSMissing the Mark in the Face of School Shootings: Rolling Back Reforms to Reduce the School to Prison Pipeline Aims at Wrong Target Nicole Sussman, MD, and Eraka Bath, MD Since the devastating school shoot - ing at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018, renewed attention has been brought to the Obama-era legislative reforms, known as \"Rethink Discipline .\" These legisla - tive reforms focused efforts on reduc - ing the school to prison pipeline which disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minority students by target - ing overly punitive school disciplinary practices through increased contact with law enforcement . On March 5, 2018, U .S . Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) wrote a letter addressed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and U .S . Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos linking Obama's federal reforms to the actions of Nikolas Cruz, who has confessed to the Parkland school shooting . Rubio claimed that the federal pressure to minimize referrals to law enforcement has influenced school policies such that there has been underreporting of dan - gerous students . 1 Later, in March 2018, President Trump then created the Federal Commission on School Safety, led by DeVos, which was tasked with making recommendations to keep students safe at school . Throughout the summer the commission has made field visits and heard from experts on topics such as positive behavioral interventions, mental health and counseling, school climate and culture, and school building safety . 2 As of yet, no formal recommendations have been made . Nationally, educa - tors, including the superintendent of the Broward County Schools, which includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and numerous civil rights groups have expressed concerns about the repercus - sions of rolling back efforts to decrease school discipline disparities, highlighting the efforts to reduce racial disparities in disciplining students and keeping schools safe through fair disciplinary policies are not mutually exclusive . 3 Conflating the Parkland school shooting with important reforms on zero toler - ance provides an alternative facts-based narrative that distorts the true issues at hand . The school to prison pipeline has been identified as one of the primary entry points of the mass incarcera - tion epidemic, which predominantly affects African-American and Latino youth . Thirty six percent of youth who are expelled from school each year are Black . 4 Students suspended or expelled from school are nearly three times more likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system the following year .5 To address these disparities, many of which have lifelong adverse sequelae in 2014 under former President Obama, the federal government created guidelines for schools to improve efforts to offer fair and equal disciplinary actions to all students . 4 This legislation remains a necessary pillar of equal protection in response to unfair treatment of students of color . A school shooting, regard - less of the race of the shooter, is not grounds to dismantle efforts to treat all students fairly . While systemic changes are in order, we must not lose sight of seeing individuals as unique and tailoring treatments for each situation and family . While there have been successful efforts to move from \"zero tolerance\" policies to those that curate sanctions and treatments based on individual students' needs, gaps persist in these policies despite increasing efforts to identify students with serious mental health problems and connect them with mental health treatment . Ensuring follow-through of recommendations and connect - ing families with social services, when appropriate, must also be a priority . Assessing the risk of an individual for school violence, however, is an ongo - ing and imprecise endeavor, and it can be difficult to discern whether a person warrants help or hospitalization . Nikolas Cruz reportedly struggled with mental illness and had exhibited warning signs before his deadly actions but was never formally reported to law enforcement officials by his school . If an individual as concerning as he evaded this referral process, then surely something is amiss . It would be prudent to evaluate the cir - cumstances of his case and why no such referral was made so that future gaps in policies created to help students do not occur again . In 2016, the American Bar Association Joint Take Force on Reducing the School to Prison Pipeline made recommendations for implicit bias trainings, which included trainings for school resource officers, restorative justice practices, and specific guidelines for when to contact law enforcement . 6 Overall, the shared goals of safe schools and equal protection from exces - sive punitive policies for all youth are not out of reach as long as conscious efforts are made to uphold both of these priorities . Through continuously examining systemic disparities, schools can tailor procedures to ensure all youth are treated fairly . Ongoing individual assessments of students' educational and emotional wellbeing will be the back - bone of identifying youth with learning disabilities, mental illnesses, and other SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 247 OPINIONSrisks factors for violence . Though schools and law enforcement inherently have different missions, a shared priority of safety still unites them . Efforts to main - tain safety in schools must be sensitive enough to identify dangerous students without interfering with individual civil liberties . m References 1 . Rubio M . Press release .

He had repeatedly tried to flee . He had flung himself on the sidewalk, refusing to get up . He had talked to a door address - ing it as his uncle and called an umbrella his aunt . He said that other children holding pencils had machetes . \"No quiero morir! No quiero morir! pierced by rhythmic wails . \"Mami! \" We knew the mother's name . The agency estimated it would take at least a week and a half to learn her detention site . Then they would need to coordinate with U .S . Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to gain the ability to speak with her . On interview, Juan did not answer any questions even by native Spanish speak - ers . No matter what we said, he repeated his screams . We offered cookies and juice, but he did not even turn to look . He stood, pumping his sneakered feet in an agitated bounce . He trembled . His face was tense, brows drawn together and mouth agape and\u2014like the Greek mask of tragedy\u2014fixed and inconsol - able . He clung to a seated police officer who had escorted him to the ED . Rather than leaving soon upon arrival as usual, the officer stayed for hours trying to comfort the boy . When the officer eventually left, Juan protested, \" Policia! Policia! No quiero morir! \" Soon, Juan similarly clung to the woman providing him one-to-one observation . His counselor from the agency pleaded for admission . \"He's psychotic! We can't manage him!\" The agency had started a process of seeking to place the child in a more secure facility to address his elopement risk but did not know how long the placement process would take . With similar children, the process had taken anywhere from three days to several weeks . My supervising attending said that since April 2018, multiple migrant children were brought in distress to our ED . One presented with flashbacks of prior domestic violence . Another in acute dis - tress believed her parents were or would be killed . We evaluated these migrant children weeks before our mayor even knew they were in the city . \"So,\" I asked, \"what should we do with this kid?\" Should we release him and risk him getting hurt running away to let him serve as a martyr, a spectacle to stain the social conscience? Or should we offer the best crude approximation of a safe home that a psychiatric unit could provide? When we confront social sys - tems that make us sick, must we choose between complicity with the mental illness and complicity with the social ill? How to proceed?Let us first assess the problem . Public officials separated this family under the color of the law . It inflicted severe trauma to this likely already trauma - tized child . The government is morally obligated to eliminate family separation and institute safe guards to forbid this practice from ever resuming . We must build effective collaborations to care for these children and advocate for speedy family re-unification and justice for these young trauma victims . Four main ways we can help are through treatment, research, forensic evaluations, and advocacy . Treatment Assessment should begin with determining whether the child's basic needs are met, like the needs for family re-unification, legal represen - tation for immigration proceedings, housing, and food security, among other things . Children should be evaluated by pediatricians for possible medical consequences of common refugee experiences like injury, malnutrition, and sexual abuse . As child psychiatrists, our com - prehensive psychiatric evaluations should include assessing how much the child can now depend on an emotionally available attachment figure . In addition to minding AACAP's Practice Parameters, we should develop culturally tailored evalu - ation and treatment methods in collaboration with people from the same countries and ethnic groups as our patients . We could recruit immigrants who have social ser - vice experience like teachers and train them to collaborate with us as bicultural workers . A bicultural worker serves not only as a language interpreter but also collaborates with the clinical team in developing and delivering culturally tailored assess - ment and treatment .

MD, and Adam Louis Shrier, D.Eng, JDResearch Researchers should also develop vali - dated psychological instruments for the assessment of migrant children in Spanish and in the indigenous languages of Central America . Research should investigate best practices in caring for these migrant children . Forensic Evaluations We can help children fleeing from persecution by conducting forensic evaluations for asylum affidavits . We can do these evaluations through organizations like Physicians for Human Rights and human rights clinics based at medical schools . These organizations offer training on conducting psychological evaluations for asylum affidavits . Human rights clinics based at medi - cal schools provide trainees who assist with writing the affidavit . Collaborating with trainees lessens the time burden of this work and offers opportunities to teach and to recruit into child psychiatry . Advocacy As individuals and through organiza - tions like AACAP, we can educate the public and advocate for specific public policies . We can continue to educate the pub - lic on the traumatic effects of family separation to help build widespread support for humane policies for migrant children . We can advocate for faster family re-unification, sound immigration policy, and justice for those victim - ized while in detention, as well as financial and administrative support to ensure that these children's needs are met . All such efforts will doubtlessly meet numerous obstacles . We should develop forums where we give each other practi - cal and emotional support in facing these obstacles .Every day as child psychiatrists, we develop partnerships in caring and advo - cating for children .

Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth 256 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONNo. 125; Updated June 2018 Chores and Children Chores are routine but necessary tasks, such as washing the dishes or folding laundry. Research suggests there are benefits to including chores in a child's routine as early as age 3. Children who do chores may exhibit higher self-esteem, be more responsible, and be better equipped to deal with frustration, adversity, and delayed gratification. These skills can lead to greater success in school, work, and relationships. Attitudes toward chores vary considerably. Some children are eager to help, while others are not. However, there are many benefits from involving your child in age appropriate chores including: Learning time management skills Developing organizational skills Accepting responsibility in the family Providing an opportunity for success (especially for a child struggling in other ways) Learning to balance work and play from a young age Setting a good foundation for functioning independently Here are some tips to help you start introducing chores to your child: Set clear and reasonable expectations. Let your child know exactly what needs to be done. For example, \"please take out the trash from the kitchen after breakfast.\" Establish regular routines. For example, \"Clean up before dinner.\" Be consistent. Changing rules and expectations can create confusion and frustration. For younger children, focus on small, manageable tasks. Make longer jobs fun and cooperative. Use songs or games if you can. Set up a star chart or reward system with specific goals to monitor progress and encourage good behavior. Be a good role model. Children will more easily learn to pick things up and keep their rooms neat if they see others in the family doing the same. Don't forget to give positive feedback and reinforcement and join in a child's pride when a chore is done. For example, \"Great job on the toys!\" Pick your battles. At the end of the day, a messy room is not the end of the world. Remember these are skills and may require a learning process. It may seem faster to do the chores yourself, however, helping your child to learn these will be helpful in the long run. If you need to loop back to help them complete a task correctly, it may mean they are still learning. Picking a chore that is appropriate for your child will increase likelihood of success. Suggestions by age include: 2 to 3-year-olds can put toys and groceries away and dress themselves with help. 4 to 5-year-olds can help feed pets, make their beds (maybe not perfectly), and help clear the table after dinner. 6 to 7-year-olds can wipe tables and counters, put laundry away, and sweep floors. 7 to 9-year-olds can load and unload the dishwasher, help with meal preparation, and pack their own lunch for school. 10 to 11-year-olds can change their sheets, clean the kitchen or bathrooms, and do yard work. SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 257 FOR YOUR INFORMATION Those 12 and above can wash the car and help out with younger siblings. Teens can help with grocery shopping and running errands. Sometimes it can be challenging to get your child to do chores. If your child is unable or unwilling to do chores, it can be frustrating. Try to understand the reasons why. If struggles continue or get worse, it may be a sign of other conflicts or issues that need attention. Talk to your pediatrician or family physician. Ask for a referral to a qualified mental health professional. # # # If you find Facts for Families\u00a9 helpful and would like to make good mental health a reality, consider donating to the Campaign for America's Kids .

Copyright \u00a9 2018 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.258 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONNo. 126; Updated July 2018 What is a Psychiatric Emergency? Most families know when to call an ambulance or bring their child to the emergency room when they seem physically ill. Families may have a hard time identifying a psychiatric or mental health emergency. A psychiatric emergency is a dangerous or life-threatening situation in which a child needs immediate attention. If you are reading this because your child has overdosed on medication or drugs, swallowed something dangerous, or attempted suicide, this is an emergency. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. Reasons to bring your child for an emergency mental health evaluation include:Risk of harm to self, such as: Saying in person or online that they want to kill themselves Searching online about how to kill themselves Taking steps to kill themselves like stockpiling pills, making a noose, or getting a gun or other weapons Writing a suicide note Giving away favorite belongings or making a will Cutting or hurting themselves in order to die or not talking about why Risk of harm to others, such as: Saying in person or online that they plan to kill a person or large groups of people Becoming more violent towards others Starting fires, destroying property, or harming animals Threatening a person with a weapon Changes in behavior or thinking, such as: Acting strangely or not making sense Losing touch with reality Seeing or hearing things that are not there Becoming paranoid In these cases, an emergency evaluation may be required. Contact your child's doctor or mental health provider to find out the best way to get help. If your child is in immediate danger, call 911 or your local emergency number, or head straight to the nearest emergency room. If you're not sure you can transport your child safely, call an ambulance. If available, bring the following to the emergency room, but only if it does not delay getting there: A suicide note or social media post that your child has written Medication bottles if your child may have taken an overdose Current medications prescribed to your child Contact information for the pediatrician and mental health providers SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 259 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONSome issues are concerning but are not psychiatric emergencies and can be handled by a pediatrician or mental health provider during regular business hours. These include: Routine medication changes or non-urgent medication refills Non-emergent full diagnostic evaluations Chronic or longstanding problems that are not dangerous or life threatening, such as anxiety, trouble sleeping, defiant behaviors, or tantrums. Psychiatric emergencies are life-threatening events that require immediate attention. They can be frightening, but medical staff can help keep your child safe and make sure they get the help they need.

Copyright \u00a9 2018 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.260 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONAACAP Policy Statement Delivery of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Services Through Telepsychiatry Approved by Council June 2017 The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) is a professional organization dedicated to representing the welfare and mental health needs of children and adolescents. AACAP recognizes that due to health care reform, more youth have become eligible for mental health services. 1 However, the ratio of eligible youth to available child and adolescent psychiatrists, as well as other child-trained therapists, continues to increase 2 and most states experience severe shortages of child and adolescent psychiatrists.3 This gap between the demand for mental health services and the supply of qualified providers is projected to increase into the foreseeable future. 4 Youth with mental health conditions will be unable to obtain needed evidence-based mental health services, raising their risk of poor outcomes such as suicidality, violence, and school failure. While youth living in small towns and rural areas are the most underserved, there is growing concern for youth living in urban and suburban areas. New models of care and service delivery are needed to meet the needs of the nation's youth. Telemedicine refers to the use of interactive, real-time videoconferencing to deliver health care that is usually delivered in person. 5 When that care involves psychiatric, mental health, or behavioral health services, the term telepsychiatry is commonly used. Telepsychiatry is not a new treatment but a venue for the delivery of evidence-based psychiatric care. It has the potential to increase access to quality mental health services in at least three major ways. First, it allows psychiatrists to deliver care directly to youth and their families over geographic distance and settings. 6 Second, it improves the quality of care by disseminating psychiatric expertise for specific disorders.7 Third, telepsychiatry offers collaboration with primary care physicians8 to support their skills in providing mental health care, particularly in evolving integrated care models such as the pediatric medical home.9 Telepsychiatry has been used with patients across diverse groups6 and in multiple settings including primary care,8 schools,10 correctional settings,11 and the home.12 An evolving evidence-base has established that telepsychiatry is feasible, acceptable, and as effective as care delivered in person.13 It may be superior to mental healthcare provided in the primary care setting for selected populations such as children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 14 or for children with developmental disabilities who do not tolerate the clinic setting well.15 Psychotherapy,16 behavior training,17 and pharmacotherapy18 services have all been provided successfully using telepsychiatry. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have expanded their criteria for telemedicine coverage 5 and individual states are increasingly allowing and reimbursing services delivered through telemedicine.19, 20 In view of these facts, AACAP recommends that each State pass legislation allowing the delivery of psychiatric services through videoconferencing by child and adolescent psychiatrists and other physicians licensed in the state in which a patient is receiving care. AACAP further recommends that each State mandates third-party payers to reimburse telepsychiatry services on par with psychiatric services delivered in person.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists obtain a four-year medical education with a focus on anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. During the subsequent five years of residency training, child and adolescent psychiatrists receive extensive clinical supervision in evidence-based treatments and management of medications and side effects. We oppose psychologists prescribing medication because psychologists do not have a medical education that is essential for the appropriate and safe prescription of medications. For more information or to review AACAP's Policy Statements visit www.aacap.org . SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2018 263 FOR YOUR INFORMATION Procedures for Developing AACAP Policy Statements 1. An individual AACAP member or body interested in creating a policy statement submits to the Executive Committee a \"letter of intent\" to create a policy prior to developing a draft policy statement. (This allows Executive Committee input of the desirability,appropriateness, etc. of the policy - without constituting any form of approval prior to the substantial work of creating a final draft policy statement.) 2. A final draft policy statement is submitted to the Policy Statement Advisory Group(PSAG) (to ensure that the language, tone, format, etc. conform to AACAP policy standards). 3. The author responds to the suggestions made by the PSAG and resubmits the edited draft until PSAG approval is achieved. 4. The Executive Committee receives the PSAG-approved policy statement and decides whether or not to forward it to Council. Feedback on this decision is given to the author,and resolution of problematic issues is undertaken. 5. The Executive Committee-approved policy is emailed to Council members, who have a two-week discussion period to convey concerns and ask questions followed by a one-week voting period to approve or disapprove the policy. (A simple majority determines the outcome). 6. A policy draft that is disapproved by Council vote may be re-written and resubmitted to the PSAG, with an explanation of what was changed; The process begins again with steps 2-5. 7. Upon Council approval, the new policy is printed in AACAP News, distributed/publicized as recommended, and placed on the AACAP website. 8. The expectation is for policy statements to be reviewed as needed, but no longer than 5 years, with the decision to renew, update, or sunset. Updated policy statements will be sent to the PSAG, Executive Committee, and Council for approval. 9. Committees are encouraged to collaborate with and get feedback from other relevant committees when drafting or updating a policy statement.POLICY STATEMENTS AACAP Policy Statement Requirements Policies should: 1) Help shape and articulate AACAP's position on important policy issues 2) Be clear, concise, and as brief as possible (no more than 500 words, excluding references) 3) Cite current and credible references (5 or less) 4) Be updated at least every 5 years Format for Policy Statements: 1) Background: A summary of the information that provides the rationale for the position taken, including: a.
