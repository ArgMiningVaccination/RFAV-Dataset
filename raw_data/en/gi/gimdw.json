[7500] CHIP A nnual Repor t Template - FFY 2019 11 Section II Program 's Performance Meas urement and Progress This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures your enrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. S ection IIB captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Undu plicated Number Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollmen t Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these c hanges (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in automatically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you compl ete this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and then refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data. Program FFY 201 8 FFY 201 9 Percent change FFY 2018-2019 CHIP Medicaid Expansion Program 107142 118307 10.42 Separate Child Health Program 114930 115690 0.66 A. Please explain any factors that may account for enrollment increases or decreases exceeding 10 percent. [7500] Enrollment in the CHIP Medicaid Expansion P rogram slightly exceeded an increase of over 10%. The AL Medicaid Agency believes that the difference may be accounted for by the fact that they are more accurately capturing those that fall within the criteria since the online and worker portal in the El igibility and Enrollment system is now capturing them. This has enabled Medicaid to be less reliant on caseworkers making the calculations and coding appropriately. 2. The tables below show trends in the number and rate of uninsured children in your state. Three year averages in Table 1 are based on the Current Population Survey. The single year estimates i n Table 2 are based on the American Community Survey (ACS). CARTS will fill in the single year estimates automatically, and significant changes are denote d with an asterisk (*).If your state uses an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring ch ange in the number and/or rate of uninsured children, please explain in Question #3.

What are the limitatio ns of the data or estimation methodology? [7500] D. How does your state use this alternate data source in CHIP program planning? [7500] Enter any Narrative te xt related to Section IIA below. [7500] CHIP A nnual Repor t Template - FFY 2019 14 Section IIB: State Strategic Objectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcil e these differences). The format of this section provides your state with an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related t o: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollm ent Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data a re available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two colum ns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2017 and FFY 201 8) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two p revious years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter t hat data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most rec ent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report ( FFY 2019 ). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference at tachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this section is to captu re goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migrated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available fo r viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the ta ble are provided below. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are report ing within a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direc tion and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepatitis B vaccinat ions and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Repor t Template - FFY 2019 15 New/revised : Check this box if you have revised or added a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing : Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued : Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. C. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this bo x if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way befor e you finalize them for FFY 2019 . Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Re ported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify wh y the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: Check this box if the data you are reporting a re considered final for FFY 2019 . Same data as reported i n a previous year's annual report: Check this box if the data you ar e reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the data. D. Measurement Specific ation: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measuremen t speci fication. In this section, for each goal, please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be completed . HEDIS \u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2016). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, pl ease co mplete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The c ategori es provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the surv ey used ), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data used), hybrid data (cla ims and medical records) (specify how the two were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please explain the source. CHIP A nnual Repor t Template - FFY 2019 16 F. Definition of Populat ion Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please in dicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please Check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or in clude b oth CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combined), please further define the de nominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report information on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the states and over time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specifi cation For the measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviati on para llel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different a ge grou ps, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment o r utilization of services. H. Date Range: available for 201 9 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization to ok place and please report the \"To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the m easure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The tem plate provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Repor t Template - FFY 2019 17 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. I f the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a si ngle state -level rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delive ry systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your state to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activit y is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rates. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 20 20, 202 1 and 202 2. Based on your recent performan ce on the measure (from FFY 2017 through 201 9), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time . If the rate has been fluctuating over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recen t rates, with slight increases in subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to the objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet future objectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measu res reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] The Core Set of Children's Health Care Q uality Measures (Child Core Set) provides national and state -level snapshots of the quality of care provided to children in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It is also used as a tool for driving improvements in quality by ident ifying best practices and lessons learned for sharing across states. For FFY 2018 reporting, Alabama reported 26 out of 27 Child Core Set measures and continues to develop the capacity to develop the capacity to report on all of them. For more informatio n on outcomes and key characteristics, please refer to the following website: https://www.medicaid.gov/state - overviews/stat eprofile.html?state=alabama. 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] Through reports from the Healt h Services Initiative providers, data on prenatal care, WIC usage, infant birthweight, infant death, and infant sleeping practices in selected counties will be obtained. Data availability is to be determined. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studi es on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emergin g health care needs? What have you found? [7500] Each year, AL CHIP contracts with the University of Alabama Birmingham ( UAB) for special studies on All Kids' population. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outr each, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance. Please include any analyses or descriptions of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives.

You will not be able to enter responses with characters greater than the limit indicated in the brackets. Section IIIA: Outre ach 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach strategies during the reporting period? [7500] Outreach strategies remained the same this reporting period as they were the previous reporting period. Alabama CHIP participated in professional association conferences within the state to provide education to our partners and communities regarding Alabama CHIP. Throughout the year, Alabama CHIP also sent applications and brochures to schools, agencies, community partners and families in Alabama. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word -of-mouth)? How have you measured effectiveness? [7500] As in previous reporting periods, word of mouth remains the best method for many families t o learn about Alabama CHIP. Many of Alabama CHIP's partners continue to be a good resource in assisting in reaching low -income and uninsured children in Alabama. No formal evaluation of outreach methods has been conducted. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 would you consider a best practice(s)? [7500] Word of mouth and community partners remain the best methods in reaching low income, underinsured children in Alabama. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorities, im migrants, and children living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have you measured effectiveness? [7500] 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those programs? [5] 95.1 (Identify the data source used).

Medicaid e xpansion states should complete applicable responses and indicate those questions that are non -applicable with N/A. Please include percent calculations in your responses when applicable and requested. 1. Does your separate CHIP program requi re a child to be uninsured for a minimum amount of time prior to enrollment (waiting period)? No Yes N/A If no, skip to question 5. If yes, answer questions 2 -4: 2. How many months does your program require a child to be uninsured prior to enrollment? 3. To which groups (including FPL levels) does the period of uninsurance apply? [1000] 4. List all exemptions to imposing the period of uninsurance [1000] Please answer qu estions 5, 7, 8 (and 6 and 9 if applicable) regar dless of the response the state provid ed to question 1. 5. Does your program match prospective enrollees to a database that details private insurance status? No Yes N/A 6. If answered yes to question 5, what database? [1000] Enrollees are matched to a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama enrollme nt file. 7. What percent of individuals screened for CHIP eligibility cannot be enrolled because they have group health plan coverage? [5] a. Of those found to have had employer sponsored insurance and have been uninsured for only a portion of the state's w aiting period, what percent meet the state's exemptions and federally required exemptions to the waiting period [(# individuals subjec t to the waiting period that meet an exemption/total # of individuals subject to the waiting period)*100]? [5] 8. Do you tra ck the number of individuals who have access to private insurance? Yes No 9. If yes to question 8, what percent of individuals that e nrolled in CHIP had access to private health insurance at the time of application during the last federal fiscal year [(# of individuals that had access to private health insurance/total # of individuals enrolled in CHIP)*100]? [5] Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIIB below. [7500] Alabama is not yet able to report the percent of individuals screened for CHIP el igibility but not enrolled due to other group health plan coverage but will continue to work on this capability as the eligibility and enrollment system continues to be improved and refined. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 58 Section IIIC: Eligibility This subsection should be completed by all states. Medicaid Expansion states should complete applicable responses and indicate those questions that ar e non -applicable with N/A. Section IIIC: Subpart A: Eligibility Renewal and Retention 1. Do you have authority in your CHIP state plan to provide for presumptive eligibility, and have you implemented this? Yes No If yes, a. What percent of children are pres umptively enrolled in CHIP pending a full eligibility determination? [5] b. Of those children who are presumptively enrolled, what percent of thos e children are determined eligible and enrolled upon completion of the full eligibility determination? [5] 2. Select the measures from those below that your state employs to simplify an el igibility renewal and retain eligible children in CHIP. Conducts fol low-up with clients through caseworkers/outreach workers Sends renewal reminder notices to all families How many notices are sent to the family prior to disenrolling the child from the program? [500] 2 At what intervals are reminder notices sent to fami lies (e.g., how many weeks before the end of the current eligibility period is a follow -up letter sent if the renewal has not been received by the state?) [500] ALL Kids families receiv e a renewal packet two months prior to the date of renewal as well as an additional reminder letter 30 days prior to the renewal date. Other, please explain: [500] In addition to mailing renewal applications, families have the option to renew online or by fax. Additionally, a 3. Which of the above strategies appear to be th e most effective? Have you evaluated the effectiveness of any strategies? If so, please describe the evaluation, including data sources and methodology. [7500] While CHIP has not conducted an evaluation to determine which strategy is the most effective, implementation of the automated redetermination process (RRV) is likely the most effective retention strategy employed by our state. Anecdotal information shows that offering famil ies the option to pay ALL Kids premiums at anytime during the coverage per iod is also effective. The online application is also a convenient method for completing renewals. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 59 Section IIIC: Subpart B: Eligibility Data Table 1.

Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . The measure is designed to capture continu ity of coverage for a cohort of children in title XIX and title XXI for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years, with enrollment status at 6 months being reported in the first reporting ye ar, and 12 and 18 month enrollment status report ed in the second reporting year. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, February, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CA RTS report. This same cohort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newly identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrol lees over time, an additional \" flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2019 CARTS report is the second year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identif ied in the second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report, States only report ed on lines 1 -4a of the tables. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will be made to lines 1-4a. For the FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2020 (January, Februar y and March of 2020). Instructions : For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in both title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolle d in January 2018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Simil arly, children enroll ed in February 2018 must have b irthdates after August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must have birthdates after September 2001. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be track ed over time. If your eligibil ity system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollm ent (e.g., the child's age at e nrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month time span) Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2019 report you will enter dat a on lines 5 -7a related to the 12-month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. You will also enter data on lines 8 -10a related to the 18 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known t o be zero. If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and move to the next page . The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" co lumn for that row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the tot al in r ow 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 must sum to row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a child's enrollment status over time, so when data are added or modified at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total nu mber of children accounted for in line 1 \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" over the entire 18 month period. Rows numbered with an \"a\" (e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective ro ws. The system will not move to the next section of the report until all applicable sections of the table for the reporting year are complete and sum correctly to line 1.

For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low inc ome, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] Due to full federal funding in previous years, FY 2020 will be the first year in several years that the state legislature has had to allocate funds for CHIP. Although th e AL Legislature has limited general funds available with many competing priorities, it awarded CHIP its full requ ested budget amount. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] CHIP experience d quite a bit of turnover in staffing during FY 2019 due to retirements and transfers. Stabilizing staffing so th at services and leadership remained steady was probably the biggest challenge. Other challenges included: Continuing to build the join t CHIP -Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system. This system interacts with the Federally Facilitated Marketplac e and the Federal Data Hub. To ensure \"no wrong door\" application processing, eligibility determinations for both ALL Kids and Medicaid contin ued to be performed by staff in both agencies. Developing CHIP's Reducing Infant Mortality SPAs. 3. During the rep orting period, what accomplishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] Two SPAs were developed and approved which aim to decrease infant mortality in a pilot 3 - county area. The program continued to add greater functionality to the joint C HIP-Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system and improve reporting of renewal statistics.
