One reason to treat the signs of photodamage is to reduce wrinkling. The mechanism of action is the enhanced synthesis of new collagen in the dermis, particularly type I collagen. 1-3 There also is evidence that it may increase type VII collagen, the anchoring fibers at the dermal-epidermal junction. 3 Topical application of retinoids can lead to wrinkle reduction within a few months. 4 There is variability in response to treatment and those that do not see improvement within 6 months likely are nonresponders. 4 In addition to decreasing wrinkles, retinoids are able to ameliorate roughness and mottled hyperpigmentation. 4 Hyperpigmentation is reduced because retinoids are able to decrease epidermal melanin content. 1-3 Aside from their therapeutic effects, retinoids also seem to have a preventive property . A theory of the mechanism of action of retinoids is the inhibition of AP1, thereby decreasing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Studies have shown that pretreatment with tretinoin acid) can inhibit MMP induction by 70% to 80%. 5 It was found to block the expression and activity of collagenase, gelatinase, and stromelysin in the epidermis and dermis. 5 Interestingly , the down-regulation of AP1 did not decrease the production of the tissue inhibitors of MMPs. 5 Tretinoin actually was found to induce the production of tissue inhibitors of MMP through a different mechanism. 6,7 There is a combination containing fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, and tretinoin 0.05% treat melasma, which is uneven pigmenta-tion. 8 Hydroquinone is used as a bleaching agent to correct dark spots and unevenness.8 /H9251-Hydroxy acids are organic compounds with the abil- ity to disrupt the stratum corneum of the skin, thereby stimulating cell proliferation. 8 The end result is the genera- tion of new, younger-appearing skin. Common /H9251 -hydroxy acids used are lactic acid, malic acid, and glycolic acid. These acids initially damage the stratum corneum, which leads to decreased corneocyte cohesion. Reduced cohesion translates into desquamation or complete severance in sheetlike pieces. This continuous insult leads to epidermal thickening and an increase in dermal glycosaminoglycans content. 9 Transient side effects are erythema and burning after application.8 Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one of the main contributors to photodamage, it is logical that antioxidants are a viable approach to treating these changes. However, t here is controversy about whether Drs. Choudhary and Nouri, Ms. Tang, and Mr . Leiva are from the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Florida. The authors report no conflict of interest in relation to this article.

The advantages of topi-cal application lie in greater concentration of the antioxidant in the skin and the extended protection of lasting a few days without concern of rubbing off. 10 The controversial issue that arises is the inherent instabil-ity of antioxidants, which make formulating a stable cosmetic compound more difficult. Three major topical antioxidants used today are vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium (Table 1).

Various constituents of green tea have potent effects on preventing DNA damage and decreasing alteration of collagen. Green tea phe-nols (GTP) have been found to prevent UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation. 20 Topical GTP particularly its most chemopreven-tive agent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), protects against both local and systemic immune suppression from UVB rays. 21 Katiyar et al20 also found decreased erythema with GTP application, which they relate to decreased cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation as well. EGCG has additional anticancer properties such as inhibiting nitric oxide synthase 21 and tumor necrosis factor /H9251.22 Song et al23 found an additional benefit of EGCG is that it decreases the expression of Jun protein, a transcrip-tion factor of MMP-1. There appears to be a protective effect of EGCG on fibroblasts, which decreases collagen degradation. An additional green tea epicatechin derivative, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), decreases oxidative stress by inhibiting UVA-induced hydrogen peroxide production, rendering a protective effect on keratinocytes. 24 Huang et al24 also found reversal of hydrogen peroxide induced cell dam- age with ECG treatment on a cell model. /H9252-Carotene is a potent dietary antioxidant known as a ROS quencher, particularly oxygen.25 Another photoprotective effect includes strengthened immunity through heightened macrophage and B-cell and T-cell activities. 26 /H9252-Carotene is more effective in preventing UVA-induced rather than UVB-induced damage.27 It has been found to offer protection from UVA damage such as decreasing extracellular matrix degradation, reducing oxidative stress, reducing MMP-10 expression, and promoting protease inhibitor expression. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials evaluating the effectiveness of /H9252 -carotene in decreasing cancer risk determined that it does not decrease the incidence of skin cancer. 28 Statistical sig- nificance was not achieved and additional randomized control trials are needed to arrive at a conclusion. MECHANICAL EXFOLIATION Mechanical exfoliation using microdermabrasion has been used as a minimally invasive treatment of pho-todamage as well as to improve absorption of topical agents. Phonophoresis, a method of electrically assisted percutaneous delivery of macromolecules, relies on ultra-sonic waves that produce alterations within the stratum corneum resulting in increased absorption of topically applied drugs.LASER AND LIGHT DEVICES Different types of lasers are used for resurfacing and col-lagen remodeling in cutaneous laser surgery . These laser and light devices will be discussed in this review under ablative lasers, nonablative lasers, fractional lasers, radio-frequency (RF) Ablative Laser Resurfacing for Photorejuvenation Ablative lasers remain the gold standard for the treat-ment of photoaging. They work by creating a controlled thermal injury in the dermis that induces new collagen formation. It is important to confine the ablation to a thin surface layer (20-50 m) and deliver enough energy to vaporize tissue (5 J/cm 2) in a time shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the skin (1 ms). Epidermal vaporization with minimal thermal damage to the pap-illary dermis was first achieved by 2 different types of CO 2 lasers: the superpulsed laser, whereby the laser tube is pumped electronically to produce high-power, repetitive, short pulses, and a laser controlled with an optomechanical flash scanner. However, because of the associated epidermal ablation with loss of barrier func-tion, these ablative lasers were associated with a long recovery period and adverse effects such as prolonged erythema, substantial downtime, skin discomfort, pig-mentary changes, infection, and scarring. 29 The newer superpulsed lasers cause pure steam vapor- ization with minimal thermal injury diffusing into adja-cent tissue, and deliver pulse energies 5 to 7 times higher than conventional lasers. This therapy follows the principle of selective photothermolysis and maxi-mizes tissue vaporization and pulse duration of less than 1 ms. 30 The newer generation of ablative lasers include the high-energy pulsed or scanned CO2 lasers, which emit a wavelength 10,600 nm, and single- or variable-pulse or erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) lasers, which emit a wavelength of 2940 nm and have a dual ablation and coagulation mode. These lasers allow for precise skin vaporization with minimal postoperative complications due to accurately adjustable parameters. In the histologic analysis of the effect of CO 2 lasers, it has been found that granulation tissue is formed at day 30 and new collagen is formed at day 100 posttreatment, and is dependent on the depth of the zone of thermal damage. 31,23 Patient selection for these laser procedures is the most important aspect to be considered for the success of treat-ment and avoidance of complications. Facial rhytides and perioral and periorbital areas seem to respond best to therapy , while nasolabial folds do not seem to respond adequately . Complications from skin pigmentation arise more often in darker skin types, making it necessary to provide pretreatment and posttreatment care, though COS DERM Do Not Copy Copyright Cosmetic Dermatology 2010.

The clinical experience emphasizes the use of a hydroquinone cream or tretinoin cream nightly or /H9251-hydroxy acid and broad-spectrum sunscreen during the day in darker-skinned individuals. However, evidence demonstrates there is no usefulness of this pretreatment. 33 Additionally , antiviral therapy starting 2 days prior to the procedure and continued until reepithelization occurs approximately 10 to 14 days later is standard practice as prophylaxis against herpes infection. The short-term complications associated with CO 2 laser resurfacing are transient erythema, pruritus, milia formation, acneiform pustules, scarring. may be hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and permanent scarring. Hypopig-mentation is a late complication that may worsen with time and generally is seen in areas that previously were abraded with other modalities that lead to injury to deep follicular melanocytes and permanent pigment loss. Hyperpigmentation is a postinflammatory phenomenon that can be avoided with pretreatment. 29 The pulsed Er:YAG laser is in the infrared spectrum (2940 nm) and, like the CO2 laser, uses water as its chromophore, though its water absorption coefficient is 16 times greater than the CO 2 laser. The penetration depth is 5 m per pulse with an energy of 2.8 J/cm2. These properties endow this laser with precise ablation with high selectivity to tissue water and negligible ther-mal damage. 34-36 The advantages of the Er:YAG laser over the CO2 laser are the reduced thermal damage, shorter downtime, less erythema, and fewer anesthesia require-ments. Pinpoint bleeding appears after 4 to 5 passes of the Er:YAG laser, which is a problem with this laser when treating deep wrinkles. It is the clinical end point with the Er:YAG laser. Ross et al 37 compared a short-pulsed CO2 laser and an Er:YAG laser over a range of param- eters intended to produce equivalent microscopic and clinical injuries. They observed no substanial differences between the lasers for hyperpigmentation and wrinkle reduction. Less erythema was noted at the CO 2 laser- treated sites 2 weeks after treatment; the differences had resolved by 6 weeks after treatment. Histologic examina-tion demonstrated equivalent dermal thermal injury on immediate postoperative biopsy results and equivalent fibroplasia on subsequent biopsy results. Both CO 2 and Er:YAG laser-treated sites showed overall modest wrinkle improvement. The best candidates for Er:YAG laser resurfacing are patients with moderate to severe photodamaged skin, acne scars, and postsurgical and hypertrophic scars. 38-40 Photodamaged skin of nonfacial areas also can be treated with the Er:YAG laser, while the CO 2 laser is avoided. Darker skin types also can be treated safely with this laser. 36,38,39 Perioral and periorbital wrinkling, facial and neck keratoses also respond substantially to Er:YAG laser resurfacing. The complications encountered with the Er:YAG laser are similar to those with the CO 2 laser but generally are less common and less severe. Certain novel systems delivering simultaneous irradia- tion from a combined 2940-nm Er:YAG and continuous-wave 10,600-nm CO 2 laser with low power densities and millisecond exposures have been developed. Also, variable-pulse Er:YAG and dual mode ablation and coagulation Er:YAG lasers have been designed with the purpose of achieving great clinical improvement and minimal morbidity . Nonablative Laser Resurfacing for Photorejuvenation Nonablative laser skin rejuvenation was developed to improve different aspects of skin aging. This alternative to ablative laser resurfacing, which was a comparatively invasive procedure associated with various complications, was established by Zelickson et al 41 who found that the purpurogenic doses of the pulsed dye laser (PDL)induced fibroblast proliferation neocollagenesis dermis. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, split-face study on 58 individuals was conducted by Hsu et al 42 where 585-nm PDL was used in the treatment of periorbital rhytides. They concluded that the nonablative lasers induced selective dermal injury while keeping the overlying epidermis intact. The healing process begins after the dermal injury , followed by the production of new type I collagen that aligns in parallel arrays, bringing about the clinical improvement in rhytides, pore size, and scars. Various devices are available to achieve nonablative rejuvenation. They can be subclassified as infrared lasers, visible light lasers, broadband light sources, low-intensity sources, and photodynamic therapy . Infrared Lasers These lasers target and heat tissue water without epi-dermal sparing. With the use of concomitant cooling, the epidermis is protected. 1320-nm Pulsed Nd:YAG Laser\u2014The first of the CoolTouch laser, was a 1320-nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser delivering energy through a 10-mm spot size and protecting the epidermis with a cryogen dynamic cooling spray . This laser was found to be efficacious in nonablative improvement in wrinkles mainly after 5 or 6 treatments. The higher the fluence used without causing blistering, the greater the degree COS DERM Do Not Copy Copyright Cosmetic Dermatology 2010.

While investigating the clini-cal and microscopic changes produced by a midinfrared laser coupled with a contact cooling device, Ross et al 47 observed immediate epidermal necrosis and subsequent scarring for larger pulse energy pulse number combina- tions. At sites with epidermal preservation, biopsy results showed immediate dermal thermal damage in a bandlike pattern. The deep boundaries of this band were dependent on pulse energy and pulse number. After 8 weeks, biopsy results showed dermal fibroplasia approximately correlat-ing to the band of immediate dermal thermal damage. In this study , the range of fibroplasia and lack of clinically substantial cosmetic enhancement suggested that the der-mal thermal damage achieved may be too deep and that the injury should be confined to more superficial levels to alter the most severely photodamaged dermis. Interestingly , histology noted sebaceous gland shrinkage, which raised the possibility of the use of this laser for treatment of acne. Subsequent to this, several studies showed the efficacy of this laser in acne treatment. 48-50 Regarding photorejuvenation, the 1450-nm diode laser uses a cryogen spray similar to the 1350-nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser to cool the epidermis, and it delivers energy through a 4- or 6-mm spot size. Goldberg et al 51 evaluated the efficacy and complication rate of a 1450-nm diode laser and compared the clinical effect when the laser was used in conjunction with cryo-gen cooling compared with the use of cryogen. Thirteen participants showed clinical improvement on the laser and cryogen treated side of the face. No participants were noted to have any improvement on the side of the face treated with cryogen alone. 1540-nm Erbium:Glass Laser\u2014The 1540-nm Erbium (Er):glas s spot size to deliver energy .

They reported subjective improvement in the quality and visual aspect of the skin of all participants. Using ultra-sound imaging, a 17% increase in dermis thickness was demonstrated and a biopsy specimen showed evidence of new collagen formation. Dahan et al 53 demonstrated similar findings on neck lines and forehead rhytides and concluded that irradiation with a 1540-nm Er:glass laser emitting in a pulsed mode and coupled with an efficient contact cooling system increases dermal thickness and firmness, leading to a clinical improvement of neck lines and forehead rhytides. The efficacy and safety of 1540-nm Er:glass laser also has been studied. Results of these studies showed the laser to be an effective treatment of rhytides and scars. 54,55 Also, unlike with 1320- and 1450-nm devices, treatments with the 1540-nm laser are relatively comfortable because of the smaller spot size and lower energies delivered. Q-Switched Nanosecond and Domain 1064-nm Nd:YAG Laser\u2014Although originally developed and used for the treatment of lentigines, dermal pigmentations, and tattoos, the Q-switched laser has been found to be modestly effective in the treatment of wrinkles and scarring. 56 In a pilot study by Goldberg and Whitworth,57 the rhytide resurfacing capability of the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm was compared with that of the char-free CO 2 laser at 10,600 nm. All of the 11 participants treated with the char-free CO2 laser improved while only 9 of 11 participants treated with the 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser improved. Healing (complete reepithelization) was noted to occur 3 to 6 days earlier in the sites treated with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser than in the sites treated with the char-free CO 2 laser. Also, erythema was observed at 1 month posttreatment in all areas treated with the char-free CO 2 laser, but only 3 participants treated with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser exhibited erythema. In another study , Dayan et al 58 evaluated the use of the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser for rejuvenating the aging face. Thirty-four of 51 participants completed at least 7 treatments and had posttreatment photographs taken. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 months. No adverse effects were noted. Although improvements in photodamaged skin were subtle and gradual, the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser was well-tolerated by participants of all skin types. 58 Recently , Koh et al59 evaluated the submillisecond 1064-nm long-pulse Nd:YAG laser in the rejuvenation of photodam-aged skin in 12 Korean women and demonstrated substantial improvement in skin roughness, texture, pigmentation, and pore size as confirmed by Mexameter and Visiometer.The 1540-nm Er:glass has been used \"laser ing\" full-face procedure to improve photoaging associated with dyspigmentation, improved skin tone, and texture. 60 Visible Light Lasers Long-Pulsed 532-nm Potassium Titanyl Phosphate Laser\u2014The 532-nm potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser beam is obtained by using a double crystal to halve the 1064-nm wavelength. The KTP laser contains a green light wavelength suitable for treating facial telangiectasias and pigment because it is absorbed by both hemoglobin and melanin. If larger areas such as the entire face are treated with this laser, other benefits of skin texture improvement can be obtained, though not to the same extent as the spot treatment for pigmentary lesions. It is best used for patients with facial telangiectasias and/or UV-induced nonmelasma pigmentation with or without wrinkles. 61,62 Lee61 studied a combination technique using a long-pulsed KTP laser and a long-pulsed 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser, both alone and combined, for noninvasive photorejuvenation, skin toning, collagen enhancement, and to establish efficacy and degree of success. After 3 to 6 treatments, 50 patients treated with the 532-nm KTP laser alone showed improvements of 70% to 80% in redness and pigmentation, 30% to 50% in skin tone/tightening, 30% to 40% in skin texture, and 20% to 30% in rhytides. Another 50 patients treated with the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser alone showed improvements of 10% to 20% redness, 0% to in skin texture, and 10% to 30% in rhytides. The third group of 50 patients were treated with a combination of both KTP and Nd:YAG lasers and showed improvements of 70% to 80% in redness and pigmentation, 40% to 60% in skin tone/tightening, 40% to texture, and 30% to 40% in rhytides. Skin biopsy specimens taken at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-month intervals demonstrated new collagen formation. The KTP laser used alone produced results superior to those of the Nd:YAG laser. Results from combination treatment with both KTP and Nd:YAG lasers were slightly superior to those achieved with either laser alone. Pulsed Dye Laser\u2014 Originally developed to treat vascular lesions, the 585- and 595-nm PDLs were found to directly affect the adjacent dermis to alter the collagen. 63,64 In a randomized, controlled, split- face trial to evaluate efficacy and adverse effects from rejuvenation with long-pulsed dye laser versus intense pulsed light (IPL), it was found that long-pulsed dye laser rejuvenation is advantageous to IPL rejuvenation because of superior vessel clearance and less pain, though improvement in telangiectasia, irregular pigmentation, and skin texture were seen with both lasers. 65 COS DERM Do Not Copy Copyright Cosmetic Dermatology 2010.

On the other hand, a polychro-matic source, such as an IPL system, has wavelengths ranging from near infrared to approximately 550 nm delivered simultaneously . This concept led to combin-ing modalities. The combination of a 595-nm PDL with a 1450-nm diode laser applied sequentially , with the diode laser being applied immediately after the PDL, produced better results. 67 This can be attributed to the individual properties of the 2 lasers. The 595-nm subpurpuric PDL targets hemoglobin, melanin, and cytochrome c oxidase in the redox chain in the mitochondria of fibroblasts; the 1450-nm infrared wave-length targets the molecules constituting the cellular membrane of dermal cells as well as water. The combi-nation of the 2 wavelengths, coupled with the epidermal cooling systems used in both lasers, gives a controlled and enhanced buildup of upper dermal heat under an intact, cooled epidermis, which results in a high level of controlled accumulative heat damage. This leads to enhanced collagenesis, elastogenesis, and angiogenesis in the superficial and upper reticular dermis during the COS DERM Do Not Copy Copyright Cosmetic Dermatology 2010.

Histologic evaluation revealed wound healing within 10 days and substantial neocollagenesis at 3 months Cohen et al 93To investigate postprocedure patient satisfaction after FP with the Fraxel SR laserFifty-nine participants underwent Fraxel SR laser resurfacing and completed the survey. A total of 202 treatments were performed. Of all participants, 75% were very satisfied (4 or 5 rating) with treatment. Of the participants, 75% with dyschromia, 74% with texture abnormalities, and 100% with scarring had a satisfaction score of 4 or 5. Multivariate analysis found scarring, 4 or more treatments, and age 56 years and older to be associated with a score of 4 or 5. The odds of giving a satisfaction score of 4 or 5 increased ~2-fold for each additional treatment a patient received Abbreviation: FP , fractional photothermolysis. devices.68 Spectral jitter refers to variation in the beam of the IPL as the pulse progresses. This caused the light emitted at the beginning and end of the pulse to be more in the red to infrared range, and during the center of the pulse to be in the shorter blue part of the spectrum. Intense pulsed light devices emit a broad spectrum of light with wavelengths between 515 and 1200 nm. Intense pulsed light can improve telangiectasia, redness, lentigines, dyspigmenta-tion, and fine wrinkling. It has the advantages of larger spot size and ease of use. If used by experienced hands, there is minimal downtime for the patient. The concept of photore-juvenation using IPL was proposed by Bitter et al 69 (Table 2).

At week 1, Demodex organisms appeared coagulated. Thus, the clinical improvement that was noted was attributed to clearing of Demodex organisms and reduction of associated lymphocytic infiltrate. Low-Intensity Sources Light-Emitting Diode\u2014Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are complex semiconductors that convert electrical cur-rent into incoherent narrow spectrum lights ranging from UV to the visible and infrared wavelengths. 77-79 Light-emitting diodes operate using the principle of photomodulation, wherein they modulate the biologic activity of keratinocytes and fibroblasts by affecting the mitochondria, without inducing a thermal effect. Light-emitting diode photomodulation reverses signs of photoaging using a new nonthermal mechanism. Studies have shown the usefulness of LED in photorejuvena-tion. Weiss et al 80 investigated the use of a nonthermal low-dose LED array for improving the appearance of a wide range of photoaged skin in a random cohort of 90 participants. The participants were treated by LED photomodulation using a full-panel, 590-nm, nonther-mal, full-face LED array delivering 0.1 J/cm 2 with a spe- cific sequence of pulsing. Digital imaging data showed a reduction in the signs of photoaging in 90% of par-ticipants, with smoother skin texture and a reduction in periorbital rhytides, erythema, and pigmentation. His-tologic data showed markedly the papillary dermis of 100% of posttreatment specimens. Staining with anticollagen type I antibodies demon-strated a 28% average increase in density while staining with anti-MMP-1 showed an average reduction of 4%. No side effects or pain were noted. In a study by Lee at al, 81 the clinical efficacy of LED phototherapy for skin rejuvenation through the comparison of 3 different treatment parameters and a control, and the LED-induced histologic, ultra-structural, and biochemical changes, were investi-gated. Seventy-six participants with facial wrinkles were divided into 4 groups treated with either 830 nm, 633 nm, a combination of 830 and 633 nm,or a placebo, in a split-face manner twice a week for 4 weeks. Histologically , a marked increase in the amount of collagen and elastic fibers in all treatment groups was observed. Ultrastructural examination dem-onstrated highly activated fibroblasts surrounded by abundant elastic and collagen fibers. Immunohisto-chemistry showed an increase of tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 and MMP-2. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results showed the messenger RNA levels of IL-1ss, tumor necrosis factor /H9251 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and connexin 43 increased LED pho- totherapy whereas that of IL-6 decreased. PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY Photodynamic therapy consists of the application of a photosensitizing agent on the skin followed by an incu-bation period and then exposure to a light source. The photosensitizers are metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria. The maximum absorption of PpIX is at 410, 630, and 690 nm. When this PpIX is exposed to light, a photochemical reaction is set off, generating cytotoxic ROS that brings about cell dam-age. The photosensitizers localize themselves mostly in proliferating cells such as neoplastic cells rather than in healthy tissue, thus making photodynamic therapy a useful modality for treating precancerous lesions and certain cancers. Photodynamic therapy with aminolevu-linic acid and blue light as the light source, and methyl-aminolevulinic acid with red light, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of actinic keratoses. Photodynamic therapy also has been used for photorejuvenation because it has been shown to improve signs of photoaging (Table 3). RADIOFREQUENCY Radiofrequency devices work on the principle of Ohm law and are different from that of the photothermal effect produced by optical lasers. 85 Radiofrequency leads to generation of heat due to natural resistance or imped-ance of the tissue to the movement of electrons within an RF field. The impedance varies with depth as well as with the type of tissue, such as skin, fat, and muscle. 85 The effect of RF is 2-fold: initial immediate collagen contraction and a secondary wound-healing response, which involves collagen deposition and remodeling with tightening over time. Radiofrequency technology may be monopolar or bipolar. Monopolar RF application produces nonablative tissue tightening of the skin by volumetric heating of the deep dermis. Bipolar devices pass electrical currents between 2 positioned electrodes applied to the skin. It is believed that bipolar RF cannot produce uniform volu-metric heating comparable with monopolar RF . 85 Table 4 highlights an investigation of RF for the treatment of photodamage. Because RF is a new entry in the armamentar- ium of photoaging management, more research and experience are needed. Although not equivalent to results achieved by cosmetic surgeries, RF does offer a nonablative, noninvasive method of photorejuvena-tion with the advantages of very low downtime and potential complications.

FRACTIONAL LASER RESURFACING FOR PHOTOREJUVENATION To overcome the complete epidermal ablation achieved by ablative lasers, a recent interest has grown in frac-tional photothermolysis. This technique was introduced by Huzaira et al 89 in 2003 and uses a midinfrared laser with a sophisticated optical tracking device to create microscopic columns of thermal injury to produce localized epidermal necrosis and collagen denaturation. The healing is reaped from the residual viable epidermal and dermal cells. The stratum corneum remains intact during this pro-cess and maintains epidermal barrier function. Fractional laser resurfacing has bridged the gap between ablative and nonablative laser modalities for photorejuvenation, and many studies have demonstrated its use (Table 5). PRECANCEROUS AND CANCEROUS SKIN LESIONS Photodamage can manifest as precancerous lesions and skin cancers (melanoma and nonmelanoma). The discussion of these cancers and their management is beyond the scope of this review; therefore, Table 6 lists the therapeutic options for precancerous lesions and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Management of Melanoma\u2014Modalities Enlisted Adjuvant interferon-/H9251 -2b is the only adjuvant therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for high-risk melanoma (defined as stages IIB, IIC, and III), which is associated with a 40% to 80% relapse rate. Surgical margins of 5 mm currently are recommended for melanoma in situ and margins of 1 cm are recommended for melanomas up to 1 mm in depth. 94 In some settings, tissue sparing may be critical and Mohs margin-controlled excision may be appropriate. Margins of 2 cm are recom-mended for cutaneous melanomas greater than 4 mm in thickness (high-risk primaries) to prevent potential local recurrence in or around the scar site. CONCLUSION Various ablative lasers such as CO2 and Er:YAG; nonab- lative lasers such as infrared, visible light, broadband light, LEDs, light devices, and fractional lasers have been studied and applied for photorejuvenation with the aim of clinical improvement with the least downtime and adverse events. Newer RF devices have nonablative tis-sue tightening effects. The prevention of photodamage is substantial and should be emphasized through the education of people of all ages. The future of photodam-age management lies in improving our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect the skin and lead to aging. This understanding will help us to enhance the preventive and treatment options for dealing with photodamaged skin. REFERENCES 1. Gilchrest BA.
