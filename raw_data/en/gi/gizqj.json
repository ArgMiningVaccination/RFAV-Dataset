RMERT members may perform the following procedures after successfully completing training, testing and certification. Physicians will perform some of the advanced procedures. The procedures are discussed in detail to allow for materials and supplies planning/stocking, and to provide a description for non-physicians to provide assistance on scene. Technical Rescue/Urban Search and Rescue (USAR): One of the indications for Region 2 RMERT activation is to provide assistance at the site of a collapsed building or other structure entrapping victims. Medical responders who work inside or near a USAR site must have proper protection and training. Not all RMERT members are trained in technical rescue. In most situations, the local fire department rescue team extricates the victim(s) and transports them to the RMERT medical treatment area. Rarely, RMERT medical personnel (who have been trained in USAR/technical rescue) may be asked accompany the fire department technical rescue members to the scene or inside the structure to provide direct patient care and support. The types of technical rescue may include the following: USAR/ building collapse/confined space High angle/rope rescue Trench collapse and deep well rescue Region 2 RMERT team leaders will discuss each rescue situation and decide which RMERT members will participate and their extent of involvement in technical rescue operations. If RMERT members are uncomfortable or feel their safety is unnecessary at risk, immediately inform RMERT team leaders. Safety is our number one priority. Overview: Responding to a scene where the injured victim cannot be immediately rescued can be dangerous. This may include a prehospital situation where victims are entrapped in a damaged or collapsed building, grain elevator, trench collapse, deep well, steep terrain, or other environmental/structural hazard. Prolonged care in the field is sometimes unavoidable if unable to extricate the victim in a timely manner. The priority in these situations is scene safety for the involved rescue/medical team members. All rescues involve risk. Take steps to minimize risk, making the scene as safe as possible or to an acceptable level where the benefits outweigh the risks. Before entering a dangerous scene, RMERT personnel will wear and utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), take steps to maximize scene safety and work as a team to approach the patient in a safe manner. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 6 Technical Rescue/Urban Search and Rescue (USAR): In general, the following guidelines and principles should be followed: 1. Only properly trained and appropriately protected RMERT rescue team members should enter the inner perimeter of a potentially dangerous incident location (e.g., building collapse). Scene safety takes priority. Rescuers must assess, communicate, prepare and execute a plan to stabilize the scene in an efficient and practical manner. Taking unnecessary risks is highly discouraged. 2. Work with on-scene technical rescue personnel to stabilize the immediate surroundings of the victim to prevent further injury. When approaching the patient(s), be aware that the scene may deteriorate and rescue personnel may be ordered to back out immediately. Take only medical equipment necessary to the situation. Utilize other personnel to bring additional medical supplies. 3. Assess rapidly whether the patient is dead or alive. If death is certain, notify the rescue crew discretely (maintaining professionalism and respect for patients and families). On determination that the victim is dead, the rescue becomes a body recovery operation with different tactics, urgency and approach. 4. In patient(s) found alive, stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation as best as the situation allows. Treat bleeding and shock appropriately. Reassure the conscious patient and provide ongoing psychological support. Initiate care according to the PAEMS Routine Patient Care and Trauma Care Protocols. IV access should not be attempted in an injured extremity unless no other alternative exists. OXYGEN: Warning \u2014some rescue situations require use of metal cutting tools, torches, grinders, and saws, which produce sparks and can cause an explosion. Do NOT use oxygen unless it is absolutely certain there are no risks of a spark or fire. If critically ill, use 15 L/min by NRB mask. If the patient does not tolerate a NRB mask, administer 6 L/min by nasal cannula. 5. Control external bleeding: a. If there is significant extremity hemorrhage, apply a tourniquet properly and confirm that bleeding has stopped. Note the time of tourniquet placement, and lock the tourniquet securely in place. Do NOT waste time applying local pressure in cases of moderate or severe bleeding. b. If there is mild bleeding and the site can be visualized and monitored, apply direct pressure and secure an appropriate pressure dressing. Do NOT use pressure points in rescue situations. 6. If a victim has sustained a crushed or compressed extremity for > 10-15 minutes, the circulation to that extremity should be occluded to prevent the release of toxic chemicals and potassium into the central circulation after heavy item removal. Tourniquets should be strongly considered for use in crush injuries and entrapment. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 7 Advanced Airway Procedures: Oral Endotracheal Intubation Oral endotracheal intubation is the best method of securing an airway and ventilating a patient in situations that warrant aggressive airway and respiratory management. Indicatio ns: 1. Apnea 2. Agonal respirations 3. Potential for airway compromise 4. Low SaO 2 5. Head injuries with GCS < 8 Relative Contraindications : 1. Epiglottitis 2. Laryngeal trauma 3. Significant oral maxillofacial trauma Equipment : Personal protective equipment Suction equipment Laryngoscope handle and blades End tidal CO 2 detector/waveform capnography Endotracheal tube/stylet/lubricant Ambu bag 10 mL syringe Tape or commercial tube holder Procedure: 1. Pre-oxygenate while assembling equipment. Maintain C-spine immobilization. 2. Apply cardiac monitor, pulse oximetry, and establish IV access. 3. Select proper size ET tube {tube size = [(age/4) + 4]}. Use 10 mL syringe to check for air leaks in the cuff . If patient is <8 years old, use uncuffed tube. 4. Insert stylet into tube if desired. Conform tube to fit natural curvature of pharynx. 5. Insert laryngoscope blade into right side of mouth moving tongue to the left until the glottic opening is visualized. a. Straight blade \u2014Insert until the epiglottis is in view. With the tip of the blade, lift the epiglottis until the vocal cords are visualized. b. Curved blade \u2014Insert into the vallecula and lift to facilitate visualization of the vocal cords. c. Time limit is no more than 30 seconds. 6. Insert ET tube through the vocal cords. Tube depth is determined by [(12+age)/2] and generally men=23 cm, women=21 cm. Remove stylet . Inflate cuff with 10 mL air. Ventilate the patient. 7. Confirm tube placement. If sounds are auscultated over the epigastrium, deflate cuff and remove the tube. If lung sounds are auscultated over the right chest, withdraw tube 1 cm at a time until lung sounds are equal bilaterally. 8. Secure tube with tape or commercially available tube holder noting location of tube (# in cm) at upper lip. 9. If intubation is unsuccessful after 2 attempts, use King LTS- D. 10. Documentation of the procedure should include: a. Indication for intubation b. Number of attempts and by whom c. Size of tube, # cm at lip, end tidal CO 2 color change or CO 2 value on waveform capnography, lung sounds, chest expansion d. Any complications encountered during the procedure. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 8 Advanced Airway Procedures: RSI - Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) Endotracheal intubation may be used to establish a patent, secure airway to prevent aspiration, provide adequate ventilation, or improve oxygenation. Indicati ons: 1. Inability to maintain airway patency. 2. Inability to protect the airway against aspiration. 3. Ventilatory compromise. 4. Failure to adequately oxygenate pulmonary capillary blood. 5. Risk of impending airway edema and/or need for airway protection. Contraindications: 1. Total upper airway obstruction, which requires a surgical airway. 2. Total loss of facial/oropharyngeal landmarks, which requires a surgical airway. Equipment: Laryngoscope and blades Endotracheal (ET) tube Stylet Syringe, 10 mL (to inflate ET tube balloon) Suction catheter (e.g., Yankauer) Carbon dioxide detector (e.g., Easycap) or Waveform Capnography Oral and nasal airways Ambu bag and mask attached to oxygen source Procedure: 1. PRE-OXYGENATE: Position the patient and pre-oxygenate with high flow oxygen by NRB mask or BVM for 2-5 minutes. Do not manually ventilate the patient unless ventilatory assistance is needed. 2. PREPARE: Assemble the required equipment and medications, including labeling the contents of the syringes. Ensure patency of IV access. Continuously monitor the cardiac rhythm, pulse oximetry, and waveform capnography. 3. PLAN: Plan for a failed endotracheal intubation attempt. Ensure alternate airway equipment is immediately available (i.e. King LTS-D airway, emergency cricothyrotomy kit, translaryngeal jet ventilation equipment). 4. PRE-MEDICATION: Give in the following order over 1-3 minutes. a. Atropine: 0.02 mg/kg IV (used for all children age <5 or pulse <120, or in bradycardic adults; minimum dose 0.1 mg and maximum dose 0.5 mg) b. Pre-paralytic dose: i. Succinylcholine : 0.15 mg/kg pre-paralytic IV Contraindications to Succinylcholine: >5 days after major trauma or burn, history of paralysis, malignant hyperthermia, known pseudocholinesterase deficiency, or neuromuscular disorder (i.e., multiple sclerosis). ii. Vecuronium (Norcuron) : 0.01 pre-paralytic IV iii. Rocuronium mg/kg pre-paralytic (omit < 5 c. SEDATION: Consider i. Midazolam: ii. Ketamine: 1-2 mg/kg IV (status asthmaticus in infants, children and young adults only) iii. Fentanyl: 1-2 mcg/kg IV over several minutes OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 9 iv. Etomidate: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (will not increase ICP, minimal CV effect) may not be used in patients <12 y/o. d. NOTE: Continue pre-oxygenation for 2-3 minutes. Consider removing the C-collar (if present) while maintaining in-line manual stabilization of the head and neck. 5. PARALYTIC MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, then INTUBATE: a. Succinylcholine: 1.5-2 mg/kg IV i. Apnea, jaw relaxation, and decreased resistance to BVM ventilations indicate the patient is ready to proceed with intubation. b. Intubate, check tube placement, secure tube, and continue to assist ventilations. 6. CONTINUED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE : After (3-5 mg in 15-30 min as needed. b. Fentanyl: 1-2 mcg/kg IV over 2 minutes as needed. c. Ketamine: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg every 5-10 minutes as needed. 8. UNSUCCESSFUL PLA CEMENT: If endotracheal intubation fails after 2 attempts, and the patient is unable to be ventilated with BVM, consider attempting to gain airway control using one of the following techniques: a. King LTS-D Supraglottic Airway b. Surgical Airway NOTE: If intubation is unsuccessful and additional paralytics are needed, Succinylcholine should NOT be repeated in children < 5 y/o due to potential for marked bradycardia. A non-depolarizing agent should be considered only after confirming ease of bagging and airway back up is readily available. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 10 Advanced Airway Procedures: Chest Decompression/Needle Thoracostomy Needle chest decompression is an emergent, life-saving procedure utilized when air has entered the pleural space and becomes trapped without means of escape .

Any complications OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 11 Advanced Airway Procedures: Percutaneous Translaryngeal Jet Ventilation (PTJV)/Needle Cricothyrotomy An alternative method of temporarily securing an airway in patients with acute respiratory distress needing immediate intervention. An over-the-needle plastic catheter is inserted through the cricothyroid membrane puncture. The catheter is attached to special tubing that supplies 100% oxygen allowing for adequate ventilation of the patient. Indications: PTJV is indicated when intubation is contraindicated or cannot be performed. 1. Obstructions at or above the vocal cords 2. Massive facial trauma 3. Acute respiratory distress and need for immediate airway management and advanced airway control was not achieved after multiple attempts. 4. Pediatric patient < 8 y/o not able to be orotracheally intubated. Absolute contraindications: 1. The ability to accomplish endotracheal intubation easily and rapidly. 2. Retraction of the distal trachea into the mediastinum after tracheal transsection. 3. Occurrence of known significant damage to the cricoid cartilage or larynx. Relative contraindications: 1. Patients with known coagulopathy 2. Tumor/pathologic condition of larynx Equipment : 12 mL syringe Transtracheal catheter kit or 14 gauge over-the-needle catheter Manual transtracheal jet ventilation device (air hose and valve) Oxygen source: adjustable 50 psi for adults, 30 psi for children <12 years Appropriate skin cleansing prep Gauze pad Procedure : 1.

Maintain C-spine immobilization. 2. Cleanse the anterior neck with appropriate skin prep. 3. Connect transtracheal jet ventilation device to 50 psi oxygen source. Adjust oxygen flow to 30 psi for pediatric (<12 years) patients. 4. Initiate several bursts of oxygen into the air prior to connecting to the catheter. 5. Select transtracheal catheter (14g for children and 13g for adults). Attach catheter to 12 mL syringe. 6. No anesthetic is needed in unconscious patient. If conscious, 1% Lidocaine anesthetic injected locally, and 1-2 mL may be injected into the larynx to prevent coughing when the needle/cannula enters the larynx. 7. Locate the cricothyroid membrane below the prominence of the thryoid cartilage and above the cricoid cartilage. 8. Firmly grasp the larynx with the non-operating hand. 9. Puncture cricothyroid membrane with the needle pointed 45o caudally. A small nick in the skin may facilitate passage of the catheter. 10. Advance the needle while withdrawing the syringe plunger until air is seen and felt coming back freely into the syringe, signifying intratracheal location. 11. Advance the catheter off the needle into the trachea, until the tabs are level with the skin. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 12 12. Secure the proximal end of the cannula firmly against the skin to minimize localized subcutaneous emphysema and to prevent dislodgment. 13. Reattach the syringe to the catheter device and aspirate air to verify correct placement. If air is not freely aspirated, remove the catheter and re-attempt. 14. Attach leur-lock end of the manual transtracheal jet ventilation device to the catheter hub and initiate ventilation by depressing the manual valve button. Airflow should be continued until the chest rises adequately. a. Inhalation: initiate ventilation for 1-2 seconds. b. Exhalation: release the valve, and allow the patient to exhale completely, which may take 4 to 9 seconds. 15. Continued ventilation is performed with a 1:4 ratio of inhalation to exhalation. Inhalation should last one second and exhalation three to four seconds. 16. Auscultate lung sounds during inhalation to confirm adequate ventilation. 17. Attach pulse oximetry and measure O 2 saturation. 18. Place the patient on waveform capnography, if available. 19. Monitor for high inflation pressures or massive subcutaneous air build up, which may indicate malposition of the catheter. 20. Documentation of the procedure should include: a. Indication for the procedure b. Number of attempts and by whom c. Verification of placement to include aspiration of air, absence of subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral chest expansion, and pulse oximetry OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 13 Advanced Airway Procedures: Surgical Cricothyrotomy \u2014Me lker Cricothyrotomy Catheter An emergent procedure for patients > 12 y/o in acute respiratory distress with upper airway obstruction or in whom oral intubation was unsuccessful or contraindicated.

Complications may include asphyxia , the esophagus or trachea. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 14 Advanced Airway Procedures: Surgical Open Cricothyrotomy (all RMERT 2 paramedics, nurses, physicians) An emergent procedure for patients >10 y/o in acute respiratory distress with upper airway obstruction or in whom oral intubation was unsuccessful or contraindicated. The most experienced provider, preferably a physician, will perform this procedure. If a physician is unavailable, properly trained RMERT team members may contact Medical Control for permission to perform the procedure. If hazardous or extreme conditions preclude communications or mandate immediate airway provision, good judgment by the RMERT team will determine optimal airway management or intervention. Indications: 1. Unable to orally intubate 2. BVM cannot maintain adequat e oxygen saturation. Relative contraindications: 1. Distorted neck anatomy 2. Pre-existing infection 3. Coagulopathy Equipment : Personal protection equipment #6 or #6.5 endotracheal tube #10 blade scalpel Tape or commercial tube holder Appropriate skin cleansing prep BVM and oxygen source Procedure : 1. Place the patient in a supine position with the neck in a neutral position. Palpate the thyroid notch, cricothyroid interval, and the sternal notch for orientation. Assemble the necessary equipment. 2. Cleanse the skin and anesthetize the area locally in a conscious patient. 3. Stabilize the thyroid cartilage with the non-dominant hand and maintain stabilization until the trachea is intubated. 4. Use the scalpel to incise a horizontal incision 2-3 cm. In obese patients, a vertical 4-5 cm incision should be made, using several light strokes of the scalpel to cut down to the level of the trachea/cricoid cartilage. Do not incise too deeply. 5. Using a finger, locate the cricothyroid membrane, and incise this with the scalpel horizontally, perforating this membrane (blade goes in approximately half its length). Remove and reverse the scalpel and place the scalpel handle into the incision to widen the opening to accept the endotracheal tube. 6. In obese patients, consider using the tracheal hook to grasp the inferior portion of the cricoid cartilage and maintain control of the trachea structures. 7. Place the endotracheal tube into the trachea directed towards the lungs approximately 2 cm. Inflate the cuff of the ET tube. 8. Secure the tube and connect to BVM for ventilation. Confirm ET tube placement. 9. Dressing and stabilization: Cut a slit down a 4x4 dressing and place it under the tracheostomy tube. Secure with tape. Transport with caution as the tube is easily displaced. 10. Document the procedure. 11. The PAEMS Medical Director must be notified 12 hrs of surgical airway. Note: Bleeding is often profuse, and the procedure should be performed without relying on direct visualization of deep structures (i.e. significant bleeding or low-light conditions). OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 15 Advanced Airway Procedures: Chest Tube Thoracostomy: (physicians, assisted by RMERT members) Physicians will perform this procedure; although it is helpful to have RMERT members pass instruments and assist during placement of a chest tube. Indications : 1. Pneumothorax ( tension , open or simple ) 2. Hemothorax 3. Traumatic Arrest (bilateral ) Relative Indications: 1. Rib fractures and positive pressure ventilation 2. Profound hypoxia/hypotension and blunt or penetrating chest injury Contraindications: 1. Infection over insertion site 2. Uncontrolled bleeding diathesis 3. Coagulopathy 4. Pulmonary bullae 5. Pulmonary, skin cleansing prep, scalpel, large hemostats, 4x4 gauze, appropriate chest tube, rubber tubing and Pleurevac, 2-0 silk suture on a straight needle, suction device, tape and dressing. Procedure: 1. Obtain and prepare all PPE, instruments, and supplies needed. 2. Anesthetize the skin by injection of local anesthetic and possible nerve block 3. Apply appropriate skin cleansing prep. 4. Use a scalpel (#10 blade) to make an incision over the mid-axillary 5th rib. 5. Use the hemostats to spread and enlarge the passageway into the chest. 6. Pierce gently inside the thoracic wall, spread hemostats, and remove. 7. Use index finger to probe inside chest wall to ensure proper entry into chest cavity. 8. Use finger or hemostats to guide chest tube inside chest wall, guiding upwards towards the apex of the lung. 9. Insert chest tube so that the drainage holes are completely below the surface of the skin. 10. Attach the rubber hose from the Pleurevac, and begin continuous suction at 30mmHg. 11. Secure the chest tube in place with silk 2-0 or larger suture. 12. Place Vaseline gauze around the chest tube at insertion site. 13. Secure the chest tube and place additional dressings around the tube. 14. Consider placing long-acting anesthetic \u2014perform rib nerve block. 15. Transport to hospital as soon as practical, and obtain confirmatory chest X-ray. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 16 Alternate Airway Procedures: Digital Intubation: Securing the airway using blind insertion to direct the ET tube into the larynx. This technique should only be performed in a deeply unconscious patient. Indications : 1. Secretions, vomitus or blood cannot be removed with suction (vision obscured). 2. When equipment, such as the laryngoscope, is lacking or has failed. 3. Situation makes it difficult or impossible to intubate via the normal methods. Contraindications: 1. Digital intubation should not be attempted on any patient with risk of biting. Equipme nt: See oral endotracheal intubation equipment list Procedure: 1. Pre-oxygenate while assembling equipment. Maintain C-spine immobilization. 2. Apply cardiac monitor, pulse oximetry and establish IV access. 3. Select proper size ET tube. Attach 10 mL syringe and inflate cuff observing for any air leaks. Deflate cuff. Place a stylet inside the tube, and bend it in the shape of an \"L\", or hockey stick, with a 90\u00b0 angle ~8 cm from distal end. 4. Face the patient and re-assess mental status. If bite injury is unlikely , proceed with the digital intubation. Insert middle and index fingers of the non-dominant hand along the patient's tongue, drawing the tongue forward as the fingers \"walk down\" the tongue to palpate the epiglottis with the middle finger. The epiglottis should feel like a \"wet earlobe\" at the base of the tongue; if unable to palpate the epiglottis, pull forward on the tongue and jaw, which usually corrects the problem. 5. Insert the lubricated ET tube along the side of the mouth and place alongside the middle finger that remains in contact with the epiglottis. The index finger directs the tube from the top, keeping the tube tip in contact with the middle finger and directing it toward the epiglottis. 6. Advance the ET tube between these two fingers, keeping it against the epiglottis with the index finger. When the tip of the tube reaches the end of the middle finger, lift the middle finger and press the tube tip against the tongue in this position. Anterior pressure is applied against the epiglottis as the tube is advanced further and directed toward the vocal cords. The index finger supports the tube from behind. Keep the tube tip or side-hole in constant contact with the middle finger in order to identify the position of the tip. Resistance is common as the tube enters the larynx. As the resistance increases, hold tube firmly in place. 7. Advance ET tube through vocal cords and remove the stylet. Inflate cuff with 10 mL of air. Ventilate the patient. Confirm tube placement. If sounds are auscultated over the epigastrium, deflate cuff and remove the tube. If lung sounds are auscultated greater over the right side of the chest, withdraw the tube 1 cm at a time until lung sounds are equal bilaterally. 8. Secure the tube with tape or commercially available tube holder noting location of the tube (# of cm) at the upper lip. 9. Documentation of the procedure should include: a. Indication for digital intubation b. Number of attempts and by whom c. Size of tube, # cm at lip, end tidal CO 2 detector color change or waveform capnography, lung sounds, chest expansion d. Any complications encountered during the procedure OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 17 Advanced Cardiac/Vascular Access : Advanced IV access techniques are available for use by RMERT physicians and include central venous catheterization and rapid infusion large-bore IV catheter exchange kit. Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Placement Physicians only : The triple-lumen CVC kit is available in the RMERT crash cart. If a seriously injured or ill patient has poor peripheral vein IV access, an alternate vascular access device is indicated. Intraosseous (IO) access should be considered before placing a CVC if no contraindications to IO placement. The location of the CVC placement includes the following: internal jugular (IJ) vein, subclavian (SC) vein or femoral vein. A trauma patient sustaining a pelvic fracture or penetrating trauma to the abdomen or lower back will likely have compromised venous return to the heart which warrants CVC placement in the IJ or SC vein. In this situation, avoid using the femoral vein. Indications: A need for IV access in a patient with multiple failed peripheral vein cannulation attempts. Contraindications: If significant pelvis trauma/fracture or penetrating trauma to the abdomen or lower back is identified, the CVC should preferentially be placed in the IJ or SC vein. Materials: Triple-lumen CVC kit, local anesthetic, sterile towels, sterile gloves, gown, mask, goggles (standard PPE), and sterile saline flushes. Consider preparing IV fluids/necessary medications planned for use after successful placement of the CVC. Ultrasound guidance may be utilized to assist placement of the CVC if available. Procedure: 1. Inform the patient/family of the risk/benefits/alternatives of the procedure and obtain verbal consent from the patient/family if possible. 2. Use antiseptic skin prep and assemble the material and supplies necessary. 3. Wash hands thoroughly and don the sterile PPE. 4. Use syringe and needle to inject local anesthetic at the site of the central line to maximize patient comfort. 5. Place the patient body in Trendelenburg position (head down) for IJ and SC vein lines, or reverse Trendelenburg (feet down) for femoral vein access. Use towels or other materials to position the patient. 6. Proceed using the Seldinger technique to place the central line. a. Insert the large hollow needle to find the central vein, place the guidewire into the needle and thread the wire into the vein 6-10 cm. b. Use the scalpel to incise the skin where the wire enters the skin. c. Insert the plastic dilator. d. Following dilation of skin and tissues, remove the dilator, and place the central line over the guidewire and advance into the vein. e. Remove the guidewire while holding the central line in the place. 7. Aspirate all ports with saline flushes to verify blood return and flush line . 8. Suture the CVC in place, place an occlusive dressing, and check X-ray placement as soon as available. Use once placement has been confirmed. Complications: Bleeding, hematoma, accidental placement into an artery with subsequent loss of limb, infection, pneumothorax, intra-abdominal puncture injury, pseudoaneurysm formation, and extravasation of medication/fluid in an improperly placed CVC. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 18 Advanced Cardiac/Vascular Access : Rapid Infusion IV Catheter Exchange: The Rapid Infusion Large-bore (7 French) IV exchange kit can be used to replace a smaller gauge IV. Indications : The rapid exchange catheter is utilized in patients displaying hypovolemic shock who require rapid volume of crystalloid or blood product infusion. This technique exchanges a 20g or larger peripheral IV catheter to a 7 French IV for rapid volume infusion. Contraindications : Do not perform if patient has only one peripheral IV access site. Equipment : Commercial Rapid Infusion Large-bore (7 French) IV exchange kit with large gauge catheter, dilator, guidewire and scalpel. Procedure: 1. Maintain sterile technique. 2. Cleanse IV indwelling catheter and tubing connector with antiseptic skin prep. 3. Disconnect the tubing from the indwelling catheter. 4. Place the exchange kit guide wire into the small gauge IV catheter using Seldinger technique. CAUTION: Maintain a firm grip on the guidewire at all times. If resistance is encountered while advancing the guidewire, hold the catheter in place and carefully withdraw the guide wire. Attempt to reinsert the guide wire. If resistance is encountered again, abort the procedure. 5. Leave the guide wire in place and remove the IV catheter in sterile fashion. 6. Incise the cutaneous puncture site with a scalpel to advance the dilator and 7F rapid bore infuser. Do NOT cut the guidewire. 7. Remove the clear plastic guard from the sheath dilator assembly. 8. Thread tapered tip of dilator over the guidewire. Grasping near skin, advance the dilator and sheath into the vessel with a slight twisting motion. 9. Once the 7F IV is in place, remove the IV dilator and guidewire. 10. Secure the 7F catheter, and aspirate to ensure blood return and flush, prior to infusing fluids and medications . 11. To avoid disconnection, use only luer-lock connecting tubing. CAUTION: Vessel rupture is possible if the diameter of the sheath used is too large in comparison to the vessel diameter at the peripheral exchange site. Discretion must be used in choosing the size of a sheath appropriate for the intended exchange site. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 19 Advanced Cardiac/Vascular Access : Pericardiocentesis: An emergent procedure to relieve acute cardiac tamponade by evacuating fluid accumulated in the pericardial space. A pericardial effusion is a fairly large collection of fluid outside the heart \u2014inside the pericardial sac. As pericardial fluid increases, the increased pressure is compresses the myocardial wall and can collapse the atria, vena cava and pulmonary veins. This decreases right ventricular filling in diastole, resulting in lower stroke volume and cardiac output. Cardiac tamponade can be rapidly fatal. It is difficult to diagnose by physical exam. Maintain a high index of suspicion in chest trauma and utilize ultrasound, if available. Signs and symptoms: 1. Muffled heart sounds 2. Distended neck veins 3. Hypotension 4. Pulsus Paradoxus 5. Narrowed pulse pressure Equipment : 35-50 mL syringe Appropriate skin cleansing prep #18 or #20 gauge spinal needle or a central line/introducer kit Cardiac monitor and defibrillator Procedure : 1. Assemble equipment including a crash-cart with ACLS medications, cardiac monitor and pacing patches. Monitor closely throughout the procedure. 2. Prep the xyphoid and subxyphoid areas with appropriate skin prep. 3. Insert the spinal needle with 50 mL syringe through the subxyphoid space. Direct the needle at a 45\u00b0 angle to the chest aiming toward the left shoulder. 4. Maintain traction on the plunger as the needle is advanced. 5. Stop needle advancement when blood appears in the syringe. 6. The needle may touch the myocardium and cause v. tach or v. fib . In event of dysrhythmia, remove as much fluid as possible within 10 seconds and remove the needle. Proceed with standard ACLS care as indicated. 7. In the absence of cardiac dysrhythmia or arrest, withdraw 50 mL of blood/fluid. 8. Withdraw the needle at the same angle as it was introduced (save blood/fluid). 9. Reassess often for the redevelopment of cardiac tamponade or pneumothorax. 10. Attach Luer-lock administration tubing to sheath hub. Use large diameter trauma fluid administration tubing. To avoid disconnection, only Luer-lock connecting tubing is used. Secure sheath to the patient. 11. Apply antibiotic ointment and cover site with dressing. 12. Document of the procedure should include: a. Indication for the procedure b. Number of attempts and by whom c. Amount of fluid aspirated d. Presence of non-clotting blood in syringe e. Patient's tolerance to the procedure f. Any complications encountered during the procedure g. Assessment of site before and after procedure. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 20 Intraosseous Access: Intraosseous Placement: Intraosseous (IO) access is a reliable method of achieving a route for administration of drugs and fluids by placing a needle into the medullary cavity of bone. This procedure is performed on critically ill patients in whom intravascular access is not rapidly accessible or feasible. Indications : Multi-system trauma, severe dehydration with vascular collapse, loss of consciousness , and cardiac arrest; it may be utilized in any pediatric patient who is unresponsive and in need of immediate drug or fluid administration. Contraindications: Fracture above the access site , infection at the access site, and prior attempt at IO access at same location. Equipment : #16 or #18 gauge intraosseous needles (or commercial IO kit) 10 mL syringe IV fluid with attached tubing Pressure infusion bag Appropriate skin cleansing prep Tape Procedure: 1. Assemble and prepare all equipment. 2. Locate the landmarks of the insertion site. Palpate the tibial tuberosity. The insertion site is 1-3 cm below this and slightly medial. Avoid the joint itself as well as the epiphyseal plate. 3. Cleanse the area with appropriate skin prep. 4. Stabilize the leg and place the IO while maintaining a 90\u00b0 angle during the insertion process. 5. Remove the inner stylet and attach the 10mL syringe. 6. Aspirate for bone marrow contents and flush. 7. Observe for signs of infiltration or leakage. If observed, discontinue the line. 8. Connect IV line with pressure bag attached. 9. Secure line with tape and/or dressing. 10. Administer fluids and/or drugs per protocol. 11. Document the procedure: a. Number of attempts, by whom and location b. Successful insertion location, gauge IO placed and verification procedure c. Fluid and drugs administered d. Complications OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 21 Extremity Injuries and Management : Crush Injury: Result from objects that have fallen on the patient or from the patient's own body weight. Crush Injury Treatme nt: 1. Before any weight is lifted off the victim's extremity, a secure tourniquet or inflated blood pressure cuff should be placed to occlude arterial and venous flow to the victim's crushed/entrapped extremity. a. The goal on limiting circulation, including the amount of time the extremity is entrapped and time the tourniquet is in place is <2 hours. i. Check that no pulses are detected distal to the tourniquet. b. If >2 hours total of entrapment plus tourniquet time occurs, the victim should be moved to a safe place where the victim can be managed using a cardiac monitor, pulse oximetry, and IV access. i. Supervision of this ideally would include trained physicians. ii. ALS medications (including sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate) need to be immediately available before the tourniquet is released. iii. When released, the tourniquet or blood pressure cuff should be loosened slightly, allowing for brief blood flow to the extremity for 15 seconds. iv. The tourniquet/blood pressure cuff is tightened again, while observing th e cardiac monitor rhythm for elevated or peaked \"T\" waves, which may represent hyperkalemia or other tissue toxic factors. v. If lethal arrhythmias or hyperkalemia occurs, treat as per ACLS guidelines and ensure the tourniquet remains tightly in place until the patient is stabilized. 2. Proceed with extrication and rapid transportation to a hospital. 3. If there is severe tissue damage or near-amputation with bleeding blood vessels exposed, do NOT use clamps or hemostats to stop bleeding. These cause unnecessary nerve and tissue damage. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 22 Extremity Injuries and Management: Extremity Injuries \u2014General Considerations: 1. Examine and document the presence or absence of distal pulses, motor and sensory function. 2. Splint injured extremities (musculoskeletal joint injuries) a. Use a rigid splint for long bones, immobilizing the joints above and below the deformity. b. If using a soft splint/pillow, ensure the extremity is sufficiently stabilized. c. If no distal pulse is present and the extremity is angulated, consider administering pain medication and reducing the fracture by applying manual traction until pulses return. d. Splint in position to maintain distal pulse. 3. Frequently recheck and record distal pulse, motor and sensory functions. Muscle Strains: 1. Use standard RICE treatment for the first 24-48 hours: Rest, Ice, Compression (elastic bandage) and Elevation. 2. Remove elastic bandages at night; swelling can turn them into tourniquets. 3. After 36-48 hours, apply heat, to bring more blood to the area and speed healing. 4. For spasms, cramps or stiffness, use gentle stretching after applying heat. Sprains: 1. Minor injuries that appear to be sprains, and do not interfere with use of the extremity, should be treated with RICE treatment for the first 24-48 hours: Rest, Ice, Compression (elastic bandage) and Elevation. 2. Remove elastic bandages at night; swelling can turn them into tourniquets. 3. After 36-48 hours, apply heat, to bring more blood to the area and speed healing. 4. For more significant sprains, consider splinting and evacuating . Closed Fractures: 1. Indications to reduce a deformed long bone fracture (including open fractures): a. To correct or improve a sensory or vascular deficit secondary to the fracture (if numbness, tingling, weakness, or lack of pulse beyond fracture). b. To align severely deformed long bone fractures to allow splinting with adequate immobilization. 2. Grasp the extremity distal to the fracture firmly. Pull traction along the normal axis of the injured extremity. Do not release traction until the limb is splinted. 3. Have an assistant apply countertraction, holding the extremity proximal to the fracture. Use the least amount of force needed to align the extremity. The initial pull will usually cause discomfort as the fragments move, but quickly subside. If the patient strongly resists traction, or if it causes markedly increased pain, stop, and splint in the deformed position. 4. Attempt realignment of a long bone fracture only twice, unless there is a sensory or vascular deficit. If unsuccessful after two attempts, or resistance during realignment, splint the extremity as is. In these circumstances there is a greater risk of making the injury worse. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 23 Extremity Injuries and Management: Open Fractures: 1. Realign open fractures for the same reasons as for long bone fractures as described above. 2. Open fractures deserve special consideration. Arrange immediate evacuation for any patient with an open fracture. These fractures require irrigation, debridement, and open surgical reduction in the operating room, ideally within 2 -4 hours. Assume that any fracture (or suspected fracture) with a nearby laceration or wound is an open fracture. Care of open fractures in the wilderness environment depends upon evacuation time. 3. If evacuation can be completed within six hours, limit cleansing to brushing off dirt and other contaminants with clean gauze or a cloth and apply a moistened saline, sterile dressing, leaving the protruding bone fracture in place (as long as there is a good pulse distally). Control hemorrhage by a carefully applying a pressure dressing and immobilize the extremity by splinting. 4. If evacuation time will exceed 6 hours, clean the wound, perform limited debridement (trim away any obviously dead tissue), and irrigate before applying a sterile dressing. Control hemorrhage with a pressure dressing, and immobilize. If evidence of nerve or vascular compromise in a deformed extremity, clean bone fragments and local tissue as best possible. Realign the fracture and reevaluate before and after splinting and frequently during evacuation. Femur Fractures: For the initial management of a femur fracture, use a traction splint. Even with the best- padded ankle hitches, traction splints tend to cause pressure necrosis when used for a long period of time. Monitor carefully for signs of pressure necrosis, and readjust or remove the traction splint if the ankle shows signs of skin breakdown. Dislocations: Attempt reduction of all dislocations if numbness or no pulse is palpated distal to the dislocation. Attempt reduction of the following dislocations: jaw, finger or toe, elbow, shoulder, patella, knee, ankle. Attempt hip dislocation reduction only if needed to evacuate patient. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 24 Extremity Injuries and Management: Amputation injuries: Amputation injuries may occur as a result of trauma. Alternatively, field amputation may need to be performed in the event of patient entrapment in which all resources have failed to successfully extricate the patient, or the patient's life is in immediate da nger with prolonged extrication. Note: The most skilled medical person on scene, preferably a physician , will perform this procedure. If a physician is unavailable, the RMERT technical rescue paramedic or nurse should perform this procedure only if absolutely indicated . If no other practical alternative is available, and emergent extrication is warranted, proceed with the field amputation procedure. Field Amputation Procedure: 1. Stabilize the site as best possible and wear appropriate PPE. 2. Control external bleeding. Use appropriate bandage or tourniquet to stop bleeding. Place a second tourniquet if bleeding continues. As a last resort, direct clamping of the bleeding artery should be considered (physician level) . 3. Obtain IV access if possible and practical. Apply oxygen by NRB mask. 4. Inform the patient of the situation and the need for amputation. If the patient is alert and able to make a decision, get verbal consent before the procedure. 5. If vital signs are stable, administer narcotic pain medication. 6. Determine the incision/amputation site, and irrigate the wound to remove mud and debris. 7. Apply an appropriate tourniquet above the amputation site. 8. If time and conditions allow, inject 1% Lidocaine or other local anesthetic via into the subcutaneous, deeper muscle and periosteal tissues in a circumferential manner at the amputation site. Consider a proximal nerve block. 9. Use a scalpel, knife, saw, or other appropriate tool(s) to perform the amputation. 10. Work rapidly, optimize hemorrhage control, place a sterile or clean dressing over the amputation site, and extricate the patient quickly and safely. 11. If the severed body part is retrieved, irrigate it briefly, place it in a cool, appropriate container, and transport to the patient's destination hospital. 12. Provide psychological support to the conscious patient. Care of Severed / Amputated Body Part: It is important to properly cleanse and transport an amputated body part for possible reimplantation. 1. Use saline or tap water to irrigate the body part of debris and other contaminants. 2. Wrap the body part in sterile gauze, a clean towel or sheet dampened with sterile water or lactated ringers. 3. Place part in waterproof bag or container and seal. Do NOT immerse amputated part in any solutions. 4. Place this container into a larger container filled with ice and enough water to almost cover the ice. Do NOT place the extremity in direct contact with ice, as it may cause freezing injury/frostbite. 5. Transport the body part with the patient, discretely out of sight of the patient. 6. Provide pain medication. 7. Contact MedComm to discuss the specific amputation. Certain amputations may warrant diversion to an appropriate regional surgical specialty center. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 25 Extremity Injuries and Management: Compartment Syndrome: Thick layers of tissue, called fascia, separate groups of muscles in the arms and legs. Inside each layer of fascia is a confined space, called a compartment that includes muscle tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. Fascia surrounds these compartments, similar to the way insulation covers wires. Fascia does not expand. Any swelling in a compartment will lead to increased pressure in that area, which compresses the muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. With accumulating pressure, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked and can permanently injure the muscle and nerves. In prolonged compartment syndrome, the muscles may die and the limb may need amputation. Swelling that leads to compartment syndrome occurs from trauma such as a motor vehicle crash, crush injury, significant fracture or soft tissue injuries. Compartment syndrome is most common in the lower leg and forearm, although it can occur in the hand, foot, thigh, and upper arm. Signs and Symptoms: 1. Pain is almost universal and described as severe, deep, constant, poorly localized , and may be out of proportion for the extent of injury. The pain is aggravated by stretching the muscle and not relieved by narcotic medication. 2. Paresthesia (e.g., \"pins and needles\") in the nerves of the affected compartment. 3. Paralysis of the limb is a late finding and the compartment feels tense and firm. 4. Pulselessness rarely occurs, as pressures that cause compartment syndrome are below arterial pressures and pulse is affected only if the artery travels through the affected compartment. If compartment syndrome is suspected and an extended evacuation situation is expected, attempt to have a surgeon brought in to operate on the leg. Treatment: Minimizing the lethal effect of compartment syndrome includes: 1. Ensure scene safety prior to initiating patient care. 2. Place the patient on a portable cardiac monitor, observe the cardiac rhythm for T- wave size and perform frequent ongoing exams. 3. Initiate oxygen therapy and IV access. 4. Infuse IV normal saline and sodium bicarbonate. Consider calcium gluconate in severe cases or if hyperacute T-waves are seen. 5. Prior to removing the heavy object off the extremity, place a tourniquet just proximal to the crush site (as far distally on the extremity as possible). This will minimize the sudden release of acids and potassium from the injured extremity. The tourniquet should remain in place until the patient arrives at the hospital, provided the transport time is <1 hour. 6. Observe the patient for signs of compartment syndrome after compression injury of an extremity or prolonged position lying on a hard surface. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 26 Wound Care Management: Contusions: Use standard RICE treatment for first 24-48 hours: rest, ice, compression (elastic bandage) and elevation. Do not let people sleep with elastic bandages; swelling may turn them into tourniquets overnight. After 36-48 hours, apply heat, to bring more blood to the area and speed healing. Subungual Hematoma (blood trapped under fingernail): Clean the nail with appropriate cleansing prep and trephine the nail (make a hole in it). The preferred method is to heat tip of a safety pin in a flame to sterilize and make it red- hot, then apply firmly to nail. An alternative is to use a #11 scalpel blade or 18g needle to drill a hole in the nail. Open Soft-Tissue Wounds: Examine the wound and classify it as either low-risk or high-risk for complications. High-risk wounds include: open fractures, (bone or tendons exposed), human or animal bites, deep punctures, grossly contaminated wound or severe crush injuries. Note: Never put alcohol, Merthiolate, mercurochrome, or peroxide into an open wound. Povidone-iodine may be used around but not in wounds; the only exception is diluted povi done-iodine for high-risk wounds as described below. High-Risk Wounds 1. Control bleeding. 2. Irrigate the wound (see below). 3. Leave the wound open, and pack and cover it with gauze soaked in povidone- iodine (e.g., Betadine\u00ae) diluted with 10 parts water. 4. Change the dressing every six hours; wash hands and wear gloves before changing dressings. 5. Evacuate the patient. Low-Risk Wounds 1. Control bleeding. 2. Irrigate the wound if deep enough to require it. 3. Apply antibiotic ointment and a clean dry dressing. 4. Clean the wound with drinking water and soap twice a day. Irrigation: 1. Use a 30 mL syringe and 18 gauge plastic intravenous catheters, or a zipper plastic bag with small hole to provide a small forceful stream. 2. Use 100 mL of irrigation fluid per inch of wound. 3. Aim the irrigation fluid away, wear glasses/goggles and keep mouth closed to prevent splashing into eyes or mouth. 4. Check Tetanus Status \u2014if no tetanus immunization within the past 10 years, have the team member return to Base to obtain tetanus immunization. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 27 Friction Blisters: 1. Leave the blister intact unless it is in a place where it will obviously rupture (e.g., the sole of the foot). 2. If in area that it is likely to rupture, make a small hole at the edge of the blister with a sterilized pin, needle, or #11 scalpel blade. Press gently to remove the fluid. 3. If the top of the blister is partially ripped off, trim it away neatly; clean the area and cover it with some povidone-iodine or antibiotic ointment and a self-adhesive dressing (e.g., a Band-Aid\u00ae) or other dressing. 4. Instruct the person to keep the blister clean, since it is susceptible to infection. Splinters: Attempt removal with a #18 gauge needle, or a #11 scalpel blade. Fishhooks: The barbs make removing them backwards difficult. Push the hook through and clip off the barbed tip, allowing easy removal. If the tip is deeply embedded, it may be better to clip off the external part of the hook, and stabilize it in place for removal by a physician on-scene, or in the Emergency Department once the person reaches civilization. Impaled Objects: Whenever possible, discuss this with a Medical Control Physician; the most experienced medic at the scene must decide whether to attempt to stabilize or to remove the object. Most large impaled objects cannot be \"stabilized\" during an evacuation, so remove an impaled object before transport. When removing an impaled object, remove it slowly and gently but firmly, pulling out along the line the object entered. Stop the attempt if any significant resistance is encountered or causes the patient significant pain. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 28 Environmental Illness Management : Heat Illness: It is important for RMERT staff to stay well hydrated and coo l to prevent heat-related illness. In addition, rescuers, victims and others at the disaster site are at risk in moderate to high temperatures and should be monitored. Heat Cramps: Brief, intermittent and often severe muscular cramps occurring in muscles that are fatigued by heavy work. Heat cramps appear to be related to salt deficiency and commonly occur during the first days of work in a hot environment in persons who produce large amounts of sweat and drink copious amounts of hypotonic fluid (water). Treatment: Provide oral rehydration of salt and electrolyte fluids. Heat Syncope (Fainting, Passing Out): Syncope may be a sign of serious medical problems (i.e., seizure disorder, heart valve problem, arrhythmia, or stroke) . Fainting may also be due to minor problems, such as dehydration, a sudden psychological shock, prolonged standing, or forgetting to eat breakfast. People who are exposed to hot conditions are at increased risk for heat syncope. Signs and Symptoms: Visual scotomata, tunnel vision, vertigo, nausea, diaphoresis and weakness Treatment: Check for orthostatic changes in blood pressure or pulse, a nd continue rehydration and sugar replenishment until the person is no longer orthostatic. When assessing a team member after a syncopal or near-syncopal episode (passing out or nearly passing out), allow the team member who meets the following criteria to resume duties after rest, rehydration and electrolyte replenishment. 1. Lightheadedness or nausea prior to the episode 2. Loss of consciousness for only a few seconds 3. No history of heart disease, no chest pain/pressure associated with the episode 4. No focal neurological symptoms 5. No seizure activity/sign of seizure (tongue biting, bowel or bladder incontinence) 6. No significant injury from falling 7. No heart murmur, no rapid/slow/irregular pulse Note: Use the above protocol with caution; anything about the episode that is suspicious for an etiology other than heat syncope (even if the team member meets all the above criteria), should be cause to terminate the task and head back to Base. A physician should examine any team member with syncope when the team returns to Base, even if initially cleared to continue with the duties . Prevention: Encourage team members to move often, flex leg muscles repeatedly when standing stationary, avoid protracted standing in hot environments and encourage them to sit or lie down if symptoms start.OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 29 Environmental Illness Management : Heat Exhaustion: A clinical syndrome characterized by volume depletion that occurs under conditions of heat stress. Two types of heat exhaustion are described: Water depletion \u2014inadequate fluid replacement by individuals working in hot environment and limited access to free water ( \"voluntary dehydration\"). Salt depletion \u2014takes longer to develop and occurs when large volumes of thermal sweat are replaced by water with too little salt/electrolytes. In contrast to heat cramps, systemic symptoms are present in heat exhaustion. Signs and Symptoms: Weakness, fatigue, frontal headache, impaired judgment, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally muscle cramps. Orthostatic dizziness or syncope can occur. Sweating persists and may be profuse. The core temperature is only moderately elevated (<104 \u00b0F or 40\u00b0C) and signs of severe CNS dysfunction are NOT present. Treatment : 1. Provide oral and IV fluids, since heat exhaustion is primarily a volume depletion problem. a. Young, otherwise healthy individuals who respond rapidly to hydration do not require transport to a hospital, but should not participate in duties for 24-48 hours. b. Older individuals, especially those with cardiovascular disease, require more cautious fluid and electrolyte replacement, frequent serum electrolyte measurements and should be urgently transported to an appropriate hospital for management. Heat Stroke: A catastrophic, life-threatening emergency occurring when thermoregulatory mechanisms fail. This results in elevation of body temperature to extreme levels, usually >105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C) producing multisystem tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Patients who present to the hospital with heat stroke have mortality rates ranging from 21-63%. Signs and Symptoms: The onset of heat stroke is sudden with altered level of consciousness. Prodromal symptoms lasting minutes to hours occur in ~20% of cases. These are nonspecific and may include weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, frontal headache, confusion, drowsiness, disorientation, muscle twitching, ataxia and psychiatric symptoms ranging from anxiety and irritability to psychosis. Treatment: 1. Immediate cooling is the priority. Mortality increases when cooling is delayed. 2. Remove from the hot environment and place in cool area. 3. Dampen the patient's clothes with water (preferably tepid or mildly warm fluid) and use a fan to facilitate evaporative heat loss. 4. Place cold packs at sides of the neck, in armpits, and in groin. 5. Place the patient on a cardiac monitor for identification of arrhythmias. 6. Aspiration and seizures are common in heat stroke and airway control is essential. Fluid requirements are modest and pulmonary edema can occur with overzealous fluid administration. 7. Emergent evacuation and transport to appropriate hospital with ICU capability. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 30 Environmental Illness Management : Cold Illness and Injuries: Superficial Frostbite (Frostnip): Frostnip commonly affects fingers, toes, ear lobes, and noses; it can be recognized by a sudden blanching of the nose, ear, or fingertip. Although the body part is pale or yellowish, it is soft to the touch. Numbness is not a useful symptom for diagnosing frostnip. Treatment : Re-warm by a placing a warm hand over the nose or ear, or by placing a frostni pped finger in the mouth, armpit, or in a warm pocket. On re-warming, the affected part turns red, painful, and swollen, although no permanent damage results. Deep Frostbite: In deep frostbite, the subcutaneous tissues are frozen solid, and the affected part feels hard\u2014like a piece of wood. Check for life-threatening hypothermia before treating frostbite. Treat frostbite and hypothermia at the same time. Treatment: Arrange for emergent transport to a hospital where definitive re-warming can occur. However, for delayed transport capabilities, or long transport times (>1 hour), re- warming should be initiated on scene and continued en route . 1. If hypothermic, re-warm the core and protect the patient from further cold exposure before worrying about frostbite. However, there is no justification for keeping the frostbitten part cold during transportation. 2. Rapid re-warming is the gold standard for deep frostbite, but slow re-warming (e.g., room temperature air or a warm sleeping bag) is preferable to alleviate more extensive damage of an area kept cold. 3. The best practice is rapid re-warming in 105-110\u00b0F (41- 43\u00b0C ) water . Water can be quickly heated on a stove while preparing for evacuation. 4. Avoid smoking, due to the vasoconstricting effect of tobacco. Caffeine also has a vasoconstrictor effect, and should be avoided (coffee, tea, or cola drinks). 5. Frostbitten limbs are numb , so avoid submersion in hot water and avoid thermal burns re-warming near a fire. If no thermometer is available, place an elbow in the water. It should feel very warm but not painful. 6. Frostbite in Litter Patients: Wrap the frostbitten extremities in towels or thick pieces of clothing soaked with warm 105-110\u00b0F (41- 43\u00b0C) water. Wrap waterproof plastic and pieces of closed-cell foam around the towel-wrapped extremity, and place the patient in the litter. 7. Discontinue warming measures once the frostbitten part is thawed. Remove wet towels after several hours and allow the skin to dry. 8. Heat packs and heating pads cause burns during re-warming, even to areas not frostbitten. Heat packs can be used to prevent wet towels from cooling. 9. Treating frostbite in a patient who is also hypothermic is controversial. Re- warming of the periphery should be avoided in hypothermia, but the hands and feet (not the arms and legs) have direct venous connections to the core. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 31 Environmental Illness Management : Hypothermia: Severity Core Temperature Physiologic Response Mild 90\u00b0F to 95\u00b0F to 90\u00b0F (28\u00b0C to 32.2\u00b0C) Loss of shivering, altered LOC Severe <82.4\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) Loss of reflexes, c oma, v. fib Mild hypothermia: o Patients with mild hypothermia and no medical problems can be re- warmed using any method, as the ability to 'shiver' is intact and will increase body temperature. o Patients and team members with mild hypothermia may return to duty or be discharged after re-warming, ensuring adequate food and drink and documenting a normal physical exam. Moderate and severe hypothermia: <90\u00b0F (32.2\u00b0C) o These patients will need extensive medical care due to risk for significant complications including death. Treatment: Add as much heat as possible, using any method available. Attempt to re-warm the core first. Acceptable methods include warm IV fluid infusion, warm fluids by mouth if tolerated, hot packs at lateral neck, armpits, and groin, warm humidified air or oxygen, and re-warming devices (i.e., charcoal vest). Evacuation should NOT be delayed to re- warm the patient. Provide fluids and food if tolerated. Handling Hypothermic Patients: 1. Do not let hypothermic patients exert themselves during rescue. 2. Transport hypothermic patients flat or in a slightly head-down position. 3. Subacute hypothermic patients (exhaustion, mountain, or cave) are often fluid depleted and require fluid resuscitation. 4. Patients who have been hypothermic for days may not tolerate large fluid loads, because of \"stiffness\" of the heart. In these cases, monitor frequently for signs of fluid overload when giving fluids (lung congestion, ankle or lower back swelling). Hypothermia and Cardiac Arrest: 1. If rescue personnel find a cold and unresponsive person with no signs of life, start artificial ventilation. a. Do NOT start external cardiac compression if there are any signs of life. 2. Evaluate the patient for three (3) minutes to detect a pulse, heartbeat, and spontaneous respiration. a. Use normal rates for artificial ventilation and external cardiac compression (if asystole and pulseless after 3 minutes). 3. Check for a rhythm with a cardiac monitor. If there is any organized rhythm, even if 20bpm, start artificial ventilation WITHOUT external cardiac compression. 4. Provide oxygen. Severely hypothermic patients in cardiac arrest may survive long periods without cardio- pulmonary resuscitation, if necessary for extrication and rescue. If CPR must be interrupted during rescue (e.g., during evacuation through a small crawlway in a cave), resume CPR when the situation permits. For hypothermic patients without detectable signs of life, consider transport to a facility that can perform bypass re-warming. Call ahead to alert the facility. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 32 Special Hypothermia ACLS Notes 1) ACLS management of a cardiac arrest due to hypothermia focuses on aggressive active core re-warming techniques as the primary therapeutic intervention. a. The hypothermic heart may be unresponsive to cardiovascular drugs, transcutaneous cardiac pacing, and defibrillation. b. Drug metabolism is reduced. In a severely hypothermic victim, cardioactive medications can accumulate to toxic levels in the peripheral circulation. i. IV drugs are often withheld if victim's core body tempera ture is <30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). ii. If core temperature is >30 \u00b0C, IV medications may be administered with increased time intervals between doses. 2) The criteria for endotracheal intubation are the same for normothermic and hypothermic patients. Intubation does not put hypothermic patients at any more risk of ventricular fibrillation than normothermic patients. 3) Do NOT treat atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, PVCs, or atrioventricular block in a hypothermic patient. Specifically, avoid atropine and avoid transcutaneous pacing . Submersion (Near-Drowning): Cold-water submersion (near-drowning) is not the same as acute (immersion) hypothermia. Do NOT re-warm victims of cold water submersion \u2014keep them cold. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 33 Environmental Illness Management : Lightning Strikes: A particularly important point about lightning strikes is the patient may have respiratory paralysis, unconsciousness, and vasospasm with undetectable pulses; even in this scenario, prolonged artificial respiration may allow the patient to recover with no neurological deficit. (Vasospasm is a \"cramp\" of blood vessel muscles that may make a pulse impossible to feel.) Coma may last for days or weeks, but patients may still make a full recovery. 1. Each lightning strike victim needs immediate ABC's, with careful attention to protecting the C-spine. Lightning strike victims have an excellent chance of full recovery through basic life support. 2. If a patient is found in or near a thunderstorm with confusion or coma, dendritic burns, or ruptured eardrums, lightning strike treatment should be initiated. 3. Check for a pulse (remember the possibility of vasospasm) and measure the BP. Perform a trauma exam. If an otoscope is available, check for tympanic membrane/eardrum perforations. Although these patients are generally stable and recover without incident, evacuate the patient after placing on a cardiac monitor (if available). 4. When triaging a group of people hit by lightning, the rule is \" resuscitate the dead ,\" since those showing some signs of life are likely to recover. Bee Stings: 1. Apply ice to the sting to reduce pain. 2. Ensure the stinger is removed. 3. Patient may use Tylenol and Benadryl to treat local symptoms, but use caution when administering Benedryl as it causes drowsiness. 4. If patient is unstable or having severe symptoms, treat accordingly with PAEMS Anaphylactic/Allergic Reaction protocol . Animal Bites/Rabies: For any person who sustains a bite by a mammal (other than rodents, squirrels, or rabbits) that may have rabies virus-contaminated saliva, attempt to capture or kill the mammal without risking additional bites . Do not damage the brain since it is test ed for rabies. Arrange for the head to be taken to a public health service laboratory. 1. Reduce the amount of virus in a bite wound, and decrease the possibility of infection, by scrubbing the wound briskly with a scrub brush. Use alcohol and soap if available. Traditionally strong antiseptics or alcohol are avoided in wound care\u2014mammal bites are an exception. Alcohol has been shown to kill the virus, and soaps help remove the virus. 2. After scrubbing the wound, immediately evacuate the patient for possible post exposure vaccination. If the patient has already been vaccinated for rabies, the need for evacuation depends on the wound severity and need for treatment. 3. For high-risk bites, the patient should be given the rabies antigen vaccine series and rabies immune globulin (RIG). Inject half of the RIG at the bite site (infiltrated locally subcutaneously) and the other half intramuscularly. Further rabies antigen vaccine shots will need to be given on a fixed schedule during the next 4 weeks. Arrange for follow up wound care and vaccine administration . OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 34 Management of Common Complaints - Rehab Station: The following is general description of common medical complaints that may be seen at a rehab or first aid station. It is important to differentiate minor versus serious causes of symptoms, and exam findings that may represent a serious or potentially life-threatening problem. Concerns for serious illness or injury warrant transport and evaluation at an appropriate hospital. Over the Counter (OTC) Medicines: During activation of RMERT, it is intended the paramedics, nurses, and physicians may allow patients and fellow rescue workers at the rehab station to utilize these medicines for common complaints. Prior to dispersing medicines, the patient must have an appropriate screening history and limited physical exam. If the complaint is straightforward and the history and physical suggest a benign cause, the medicine may be dispersed per protocol. If a patient presents with a potentially serious complaint, a thorough history, physical, and advanced treatment may be required (e.g., chest pain, lower abdomen pain, or severe headache). OTC Medications: 1. Tylenol/acetaminophen a. Adult dose: 1000 mg oral dose every 6 hrs as needed for pain or fever. b. Pediatric dose: 15 mg/kg oral or rectal dose every 6 hrs as needed for pain or fever. 2. Motrin/ibuprofen a. Adult dose: 600mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain or fever. b. Pediatric dose: 10 mg/kg oral every 6 hrs as needed for pain or fever. 3. Pseudoephedrine/cold tablets: use as per box label (for adults). 4. Robitussin or Mucinex/guaifenesin: use as per box label (for adults and children ). 5. Antacids: Maalox or Mylanta 30- 60 mL oral every 6 hrs as needed. 6. Benadryl/diphenhydramine ( caution : sedation and decreased reflexes) a. Adult dose: 50 mg oral every 6 hrs as needed b. Pediatric dose: 1 mg/kg oral every 6 hrs as needed 7. Imodium/ loperamide: use for mild diarrhea without fever or abdominal pain. Dosing as per box label. 8. Dramamine/Meclizine: for treatment of nausea or vertigo/motion sickness. Dosing as per box label. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 35 Management of Common Complaints - Rehab Station: HEENT Headache: For patients complaining of a severe headache, obtain a detailed history and exam including the head and neck, and neurologic exam. In the presence of neurological symptoms (confusion, visual disturbances, weakness, numbness, or tingling in an arm or a leg, stiff neck, or fever), or complaints of the worst headache of their life, arrange for urgent transport to a hospital. Eye Irritation: 1. Obtain visual acuity. 2. Examine the eye, by inverting the eyelid (if trained), and gently removing any foreign bodies seen on the eyelid or conjunctiva (white part of the eye) with a cotton-tipped applicator or improvised equivalent. 3. Irrigate with clean water to remove foreign bodies from the cornea (clear part of eye). 4. Arrange transport at a pace determined by the patient's discomfort level. Epistaxis/Nosebleed: 1. Use direct pressure to pinch the nostrils together firmly (proximally on the bridge of the nose). 2. Apply uninterrupted pressure for 10 minutes then recheck. Hold for another 10 minutes if still bleeding. Have the patient sit forward during pressure. 3. For persistent bleeding , pack the nose with gauze. Roll up a small gauze pad (not tissue or paper towel that will partially dissolve) and place it inside the affected nostril to aid in applying pressure. Double-compressed nasal tampons or commercial epistaxis products may be used instead of gauze. To avoid infections, leave gauze pads in place for no more than 1-2 days. Examine the posterior pharynx to ensure no persistent bleeding behind the packing . Dental Injury: For an avulsed tooth (completely out of the socket) , rinse the dirt off. Do NOT scrub the tooth. It destroys the delicate layer of cells that will allow for reattachment. Further treatment depends on the time until transport to a dentist or oral surgeon. 1. Within 1-2 hours of a dentist or oral surgeon, keep the tooth moist so for re- implantation. Keeping the tooth in the patient's cheek is ideal, since the patient's own saliva is the best fluid medium . 2. If evacuation will exceed 1-2 hours, promptly replace the tooth in the socket. Apply dental splinting material to keep the tooth in place. Chewing gum works well. Ensure the patient doesn't aspirate the tooth. If the evacuation route involves difficult climbing, or if the patient has altered level of consciousness, do NOT replace the tooth in the mouth. Instead, place it in a gauze pad moistened with the patient's saliva and clean water or saline, then place it in a plastic bag. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 36 Management of Common Complaints - Rehab Station: Chest/Abdomen Chest Pain: Chest pain warrants a detailed history and physical exam, taking into consideration the person's medical history, vital signs and appearance. 1. If an episode of chest pain is clearly identified to result from the following etiologies, the person may choose to be evaluated at a hospital or to continue performing duties. a. Minor trauma or muscle strain b. Gastroesophageal reflux/heartburn c. Bronchitis 2. If there is any concern for more serious etiology, initiate cardiac monitoring, oxygen, IV access and arrange for evacuation. Any team member with chest pain in the field, who was not transported to a hospital, should be evaluated by a physician on return to civilization. Vomiting and Diarrhea: History should focus on identifying the possible etiology. In most cases it is viral, but could also be food poisoning, bacterial diarrhea (recent trip to Mexico or known outbreak), intestine obstruction, migraine headache, or other cause. Treatment: 1. Determine severity of the illness. a. If the illness is thought to be benign and the patient does not appear ill, ensure his/her hydration status is adequate (give oral and/or IV fluids) and monitor. b. The most serious consequence of vomiting and diarrhea is dehydration, which may progress to hypovolemic shock. If the patient is unstable or appears ill, arrange for evacuation and transport to appropriate hospital. 2. After infectious diarrhea, advance diet as tolerated. a. Start with clear fluids, which are rapidly absorbed and leave no residue to form stool and prompt an unwanted bowel movement. b. Once clear liquids are tolerated, eating food will stimulate regeneration of intestinal enzymes, and will increase water absorption. Easy- to-digest starches will decrease the diarrhea. Bread, toast, crackers, rice, potatoes, and cooked vegetables are preferred. Urinary Tract Infection: Signs and symptoms: Dysuria (burning on urination) Frequency of urination Urgency of urination (having to go right now ) Incontinence of urine (dribbling of urine, especially with coughing or sneezing) Blood in the urine (\"hemorrhagic cystitis\") Treatment: 1. Encourage oral hydration with plenty of fluids. 2. Consider cranberry/cranberry juice, which prevents adherence of bacteria to the ureter and urinary epithelium. 3. Evacuation is not necessary unless the patient has significant discomfort. In cases of fever or significant back pain, evacuate immediately . OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 37 Management of Common Complaints - Rehab Station: Miscellaneous Complaints Motion Sickness: Instruct person to fix vision on the horizon or a distant object. For significant symptoms, consider OTC anti-nausea or anti-vertigo medications such as Dramamine or meclizine. Diabetic Complaints: Standard first aid training teaches that any sick diabetic should be given sugar, because it will make insulin shock better and will not harm someone who is hyperosmolar or in ketoacidosis. If a diabetic does not improve with sugar, start oral rehydration, preferably with WHO Oral Rehydration Solution. Deep Venous Thrombosis: A deep venous thrombosis (DVT ) or blood clot in the leg is characterized by swelling in one leg, with mild redness and warmth. The calf is swollen compared to the unaffected side and is tender to deep palpation. If the foot is forcibly dorsiflexed (pushed up), the resulting traction on the calf may cause pain. Sometimes the tense, clotted veins can be palpated behind the knee or in the upper calf or posterior thigh (\"cords\"). 1. If there is any suggestion the patient might have a deep venous thrombosis, don't allow the to patient walk . Walking could lead to embolism of a clot and resultant pulmonary embolism. Evacuate with the leg elevated and keep it warm with heat packs. 2. Prevention of deep venous thrombosis in litter patients (who are at risk due to trauma, immobilization, and/or dehydration) is important. a. If the patient is conscious, prompt him/her to alternately tighten and relax the legs. If the rigging isn't ready, and the patient doesn't have a suspected spine injury, untie the patient and let him/her move around . 3. Hydrate the patient. 4. Be careful of the leg tie- in\u2014anything tight around the leg or ankle will decrease venous flow and promote clotting. Leave room for the patient to wiggle his/her legs. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 38 Disaster Stress Management: Pain Management: Pain has a significant impact on patient's psychological well -being. Studies have shown that failure to recognize and appropriately treat acute pain may result in increased incidence of chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The degree to which a person experiences pain is a complex and subjective interaction between the physical stimulus and the patient's cognitive and emotional state. The degree of pain a patient perceives is not directly determined by the degree of the physiologic injury. Communication Strategies: 1. Apprehension and uncertainty of the extent o f injuries may accentuate pain . A clear statement of the patient's injuries may dispel fear and reduce apprehension and pain. 2. Distraction can greatly diminish the perception of pain, and engaging interest in a discussion may help. 3. Invoke imagination to distance a patient from his/her pain. Ask the patient to imagine a favorite place or event and describe it in detail. Imagery in this way can provide powerful pain relief. 4. If appropriately trained and the patient has the ability, a light state of hypnosis may serve as outstanding pain control. Critical Incident Stress Management: A critical incident is any crisis situation or event with sufficient impact to overwhelm the usual coping skills of an individual or group . In general, the longer the delay betwe en exposure to the critical incident and subsequent psychological intervention, the smaller the chance for a successful outcome. Examples of critical incidents: Serious injury or death of an emergency services worker in the line of duty Serious injury or death of a bystander from an emergency services operation Multiple deaths or serious injuries Serious injury or death of a child or infant Any situation that attracts an unusual amount of attention from the media Any loss of life after extraordinary and prolonged search and rescue efforts Any situation that is charged with emotion and that causes an emotional response that is beyond the normal coping mechanisms of emergency services workers. The immediate stress reaction may include physical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components. Any of these signs and symptoms may be present. It generally occurs at the time of the incident or within 24 hours. Note: An immediate stress reaction is the response of a normal person to an abnormal situation, and NOT a sign of any psychological weakness or chronic psychiatric problems. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 39 Disaster Stress Management: Physical symptoms include: 1. Profound fatigue and weakness 2. Fine tremor or muscle twitches 3. Diaphoresis 4. Orthostatic hypotension or vasovagal syncope (simple fainting) 5. Lightheadedness 6. Headache 7. Difficulty focusing one's eyes 8. Difficulty hearing 9. Palpitations 10. Dyspnea and chest pain with or without hyperventilation 11. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain 12. Sensation of a lump in the throat (globus hystericus) Emotional symptoms include: 1. Anticipatory or generalized anxiety (anxiety about the future, or unconnected with any present danger or fear) 2. Strong fear or even panic reactions 3. Psychological shock (described later) 4. Survivor guilt uncertainty (guilt over surviving when others have died) 5. Acute grief reactions 6. Depression 7. Intensified or inappropriate emotional reactions to normal occurrences Cognitive symptoms include: 1. Blaming others (even those who are logically blameless) for the critical incident 2. Generalized confusion 3. Inability to concentrate 4. Inability to perform simple calculations 5. Poor attention span 6. Memory lapses 7. Anomia (inability to find the right words) 8. Inability to distinguish the difference between serious and trivial concerns 9. Inability to make decisions 10. Greatly increased (or greatly decreased) alertness and awareness of surroundings Behavioral symptoms are relative to normal behavior patterns, which vary between individuals and include: 1. Changes in speech patterns 2. Withdrawal 3. Angry outbursts 4. Hypervigilance (increased suspicion and attention to one's environment or outright paranoia) 5. Changes in interactions with others (i.e., wife, friends, team members) 6. Increase or decrease in appetite or alcohol consumption 7. Sleep disturbances including early morning awakening, insomnia, hypersomnia, and generalized fatigue 8. Visits to health professionals for seemingly minor or nonexistent problems. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 40 Disaster Stress Management: Be vigilant in identifying individuals exhibiting signs of stress and, once identified, initiate psychological support and management. On-scene psychological support should be conducted one- on-on. Groups of people may overwhelm the individual. The goal is to assist the individual in regaining emotional control by facilitating communication of feelings and reactions through listening and support. 1. Arrange for frequent breaks to rest from duties. 2. If possible, remove the individual from the sights, sounds and smells of the incident. a. Face away from the incident b. Get into a vehicle in a position away from the incident c. Move upwind of the smells of the incident d. If the individual cannot be moved, place an object to block the person's view 3. Engage the person in discussion, starting with factual information. 4. Once rapport has been established, emotions and feelings can be discussed. 5. Validate the person's feelings 6. Stay with the individual or arrange for someone to stay and continue to provide psychological support. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 41 Extended Field Patient Care Protocols: These protocols discuss those circumstances when RMERT medical providers provide extended field medical care. In most circumstances, any criticality ill or injured patient will be assessed, triaged, stabilized as best possible, and rapidly transported to an appropriate hospital for further care. However, this may not always be possible or indicated. Severe weather conditions, overwhelming numbers of patients (either in the field or at nearby hospitals) may preclude or delay patient transportation. Some patients may be treated and released on-scene after providing care. Since Region 2 RMERT is capable of functioning for 4 days, these protocols will discuss the first 96 hours of in-field prehospital medical care. General patient care considerations: RMERT administrators and medical professionals will determine patient care decisions after considering the following variables: Weather Patient's condition Personnel Transportation limitations Medical supplies Status of nearby hospitals Projected needs Other identified issues Emergent evacuations: 1. Seriously ill or injured patient will receive triage and stabilizing medical car e appropriate for circumstances. 2. Arrange safe and appropriate transportation, including appropriately trained and equipped medical staff to care for the patient during transportation. Note: RMERT does not have vehicles for transport but will arrange and provide personnel for transport if needed. Patient categorization: Patients who arrive at the RMERT medical facility will be categorized after evaluation. 1. Ambulatory: Treatment is provided 3 hours, resulting in a stable patient and released. 2. Transport by private vehicle: Treatment is provided, resulting in a stable patient, and referred to a nearby hospital or specialist's office (i.e. , plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon). 3. Transport by EMS: Treatment is provided in seriously ill or injured patient requiring transfer to appropriate hospital by ambulance or helicopter. 4. Patient expired (DOA or died in field). 5. Delayed Transport: Treatment is provided in seriously ill or injured patient requiring transfer to appropriate hospital, but no transportation is available. 6. Extended Treatment and Release: Treatment provided to exceed 3 hours and expected to result in a stable patient within 24 hours of treatment and/or observation. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 42 Extended Field Patient Care Protocols: Transportation Decisions: RMERT administrators and medical professionals will determine transportation priorities after considering the patients' condition, and resources available for transport (vehicle s, equipment, personnel and hospital capacity to receive patients). These decisions consider the risks and benefits of transport versus the risks and benefits of keeping the patient at the RMERT facility. 1. In general, any criticality ill or injured patien t should be transferred to a hospital with the capacity and capability of providing the medical care needed. 2. In a disaster or mass casualty incident (MCI), the designated medical transportation officer maintains contact with the vehicle-staging officer in order to maximize the availability of ambulances or other modes of transportation (e.g., buses). 3. In other scenarios, a designated RMERT administer will be responsible for arranging appropriate transportation and communication with the accepting hospital or emergency department. Medical Discharge Decisions: Patient care provided in the RMERT facility >3 hours warrants a discussion regarding the anticipated course of treatment. The physician and/or nurse caring for the patient will determine whether The patient warrants further medical care and transport to a hospital The patient needs further outpatient medical follow up The patient is expected to be stable for discharge (released to the care of family/friends) The RMERT medical team will make the appropriate arrangements as indicated. Note: Patients DOA or dying at the RMERT medical facility are coroner cases and will be processed in a coordinated fashion. Documentation: It is important to accurately and thoroughly document the history, physical exam, vital signs, care provided, medications administered, interventions performed and instructions given in each patient care encounter. The provider caring for the patient is responsible for completion of the documentation. Examples of appropriate documentation: 1. Simple patient treat and release \u2014Simple patient encounter registration form, which is a single page with space to document treatment and disposition. 2. Complex patient/seriously ill or injured \u2014Document on the appropriate T-sheet. These will be completed and copied, and accompany the patient or be faxed to the destination hospital or emergency department. 3. Extended patient care chart \u2014Document for patient care exceeding 3 hours to include serial vitals sign measurements, fluids in and out, medication and treatments rendered, response to treatment, and medical decision-making. 4. Peoria Area EMS (PAEMS) Short Form \u2014Document for patient care provided during transport to the hospital. These documents should eventually be transferred electronically into the IDPH EMS database. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 43 Extended Field Patient Care Protocols: Vital Sign Measurements: 1. The patients who arrive at the RMERT tent or medical facility will have a complete set of vitals signs taken including : a. Heart rate b. Blood pressure c. Respiratory rate d. Temperature (or al-rectal) e. Pulse oximetry. 2. Depending on the seriousness of the injury or illness, the physician or nurse in charge of the patient's care will then direct the medical support staff to check the patient's vitals signs on a routine basis according to appropriate time scale to detect any signif icant change in patient's status. 3. On initial evaluation, the patient's vitals should be measured every 15 minutes, and if stable and demonstrate a positive response to resuscitation efforts, the time interval may be extended to hourly or other appropriate time interval. 4. No patient with abnormal vital signs should be released until after specific risks and benefits of release are discussed with the patient and on-scene or Medical Control physician approves patient release. Fluid intake and Output: Document fluid intake and output on every extended care patient chart. 1. Water/fluid intake (amount, type) 2. Intravenous fluid administration (type of IV fluid, rate, total amount infused) 3. Urine output 4. Bowel movement \u2014in cases of diarrhea, the fluid amount should be approximated, recorded, and considered for replacement with IV or oral fluids. Food/Nutrition: RMERT responses are equipped to provide adequate food and water for staff for the first 96 hours. Additional resources for food and water will be needed if the RMERT field hospital is providing care for multiple patients. Options for additional resources include the following: American Red Cross Local restaurants Local grocery stores Local community members If these sources are not available or exhausted, RMERT has pre -packaged Heater Meals which are stored at RMERT headquarters. Once these are consumed the team will need to be resourceful and obtain the food and water from other sources. Water/Oral Hydration : RMERT will bring or arrange for water provisions for staff and patients. Water filtration is an option from nearby water resources, in the event the community does not or cannot supply reliable potable dinking water. Nearby grocery stores will be a source of juices, soda, and other non-water hydration. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 44 Extended Field Patient Care Protocols: Wound care and dressing changes: RMERT members will provide wound care according to general guidelines. Wound care ranges from simple wound cleansing and dressing to extensive tissue debridement, and multi -level sutured wound closure. All wounds will be promptly inspected, receive gross decontamination/cleansing (taking into account pain tolerance) and dressed. For delayed transport (>3 hours) of significant wounds, open fractures, or high-risk wounds, consider administration of IV or oral antibiotics. Respiratory Care: The liquid oxygen dispenser can provide oxygen for multiple patients, and distribution lines allow for utilization in the field hospital. For stable patients with normal respirations and adequate room air pulse oximetry, oxygen therapy will not be necessary. Critically ill and mechanical ventilator- dependent patients will be provided oxygen therapy. The medical staff caring for the patient will determine the concentration of oxygen and delivery modality. Pain Control: All patients will have their pain assessed and treated as deemed appropriate by RMERT staff. Pain scores will be documented prior to and after pain medications are given to demonstrate effect. The on-scene physician or Medical Control physician will be consulted on narcotic pain management decisions. If a painful condition is readily apparent and easily diagnosed (e.g., ankle sprain, contusion), RMERT staff can administer OTC medications. 1. Stable patient with mild to moderate pain and able to tolerate oral medications a. Tylenol (acetaminophen) b. Ibuprofen c. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen d. Other available oral pain medications 2. Stable patient with acute injury or severe pain a. Consider initial dose of IV narcotic pain medication b. Continued pain control with oral pain medications 3. Stable/Unstable patient without the ability to swallow a. IV narcotic pain medication Medication Administration: All other medications, including antibiotics, will be administered at the direction of the on- scene nurse or physician or via telephone contact with a Medical Control physician. Prior to medication administration, all patients will have their identity/name verified, and medication allergies verified. Patient privacy and sleep considerations : Extended care patients will have their personal privacy maintained. Privacy curtains will be utilized between beds to provide the most privacy possible given the conditions. Patients will be given time and conditions to sleep/rest with as few interruptions as their condition warrants. For patients with stable medical conditions and vitals signs, the vital sign measurements can be extended to every 4 hours. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 45 Mechanical Ventilation Set-up and Management: Basics of Mechanical Ventilation Modes There are several modes available for use in mechanical ventilation of patients. 1. Continuous mandatory ventilation \"CMV\"\u2014 Ventilators set to CMV will cause breaths (ventilations) to be delivered at preset intervals, regardless of the patient effort. This mode is used most often in the paralyzed or apneic patient. A person receiving CMV can neither trigger a breath nor inspire gas spontaneously through the ventilator circuit, which makes this mode only appropriate for apneic, pharmacologically paralyzed, deeply sedated patients. 2. Assist-control ventilation \u2014The assist control (A/C) mode on the ventilator delivers a minimum number of preset breaths in coordination with the respiratory effort of the patient. With each inspiratory effort, the ventilator assists by delivering the full tidal volume. If an A/C ventilator is set to deliver 12 breaths per minute, a breath is provided every 5 seconds. Should the patient initiate a breath, an additional breath is provided and the ventilator's timer resets for another 5 seconds . This mode is well tolerated by patients. 3. Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) \u2014Like CMV and A/C ventilation, IMV can be either pressure or volume-controlled. In this mode the ventilator delivers a preset rate, tidal volume (or inspiratory pressure) and FiO 2. The patient may also draw spontaneous breaths in-between mandatory breaths. Unlike A/C, breaths that the patient takes spontaneously do NOT trigger or cycle the ventilator. Patient-initiated breaths are completely spontaneous, neither assisted nor supported by the ventilator. 4. Synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) \u2014This mode delivers a preset number of breaths in coordination with the respiratory effort of the patient. Spontaneous breathing is allowed between breaths. This is well tolerated, and the synchronization limits barotrauma. Choosing the Mechanical Ventilation Mode: The initial choice of the ventilation mode (e.g., SIMV, A/C) is institution and practitioner dependent. A/C ventilation, as in CMV, is a full support mode where the ventilato r performs most, if not all, the work of breathing. Both modes are beneficial for patients who require high minute ventilation. Full support reduces the patient's oxygen consumption and CO 2 production of the respiratory muscles. A potential drawback of A/C ventilation in the patient with obstructive airway disease or asthma is worsening of air trapping and breath stacking. When full respiratory support is necessary for the paralyzed patient following neuromuscular blockade, no difference exists in minute ventilation or airway pressures with any of the above modes of ventilation. In the apneic patient, A/C with a respiratory rate (RR) of 10 and a TV of 500 mL deliver the same minute ventilation as SIMV with the same parameters. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 46 Mechanical Ventilation S et-up and Management: Ventilator Settings for Spontaneously Breathing Patients: 1. Pressure support ventilation \u2014Pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been advocated to limit barotrauma and to decrease the work of breathing. Breathing is controlled by the patient and peak pressures are controlled by the ventilator. The primary goal of PSV is to support the patient's spontaneous breathing effort while providing satisfactory oxygenation. Airway pressure support is maintained until the patient's inspiratory flow falls below a certain cutoff (e.g., 25% of peak flow). With some ventilators, there is the ability to set a back-up IMV rate should spontaneous respirations cease. PSV is the mode of choice in patients whose respiratory failure is not severe and who have an adequate respiratory drive. It can result in improved patient comfort, reduced cardiovascular effects, reduced risk of barotrauma, and improved distribution of gas. 2. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) \u2014Includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and is applied with a facemask instead of an endotracheal tube. Consider this mode for patients with mild to moderate respiratory failure. The patient must be alert enough to follow commands. Clinical situations in which it has proven useful include: a. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) b. Acute exacerbation of asthma c. Decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) d. Pulmonary edema from hypervolemia. BiPAP is commonly misunderstood to be a form of pressure support ventilation triggered by patient breaths ; in actuality, BiPAP is a form of CPAP that alternates between high and low positive airway pressures, permitting inspiration (and expiration) throughout. Indications for Mechanical Ventilation The principal indications for mechanical ventilation are airway protection and respiratory failure. The decision to intubate and mechanically ventilate or to institute noninvasive ventilation support is generally made on clinical grounds without delay for laboratory evaluation. Obtaining a PaCO 2 is useful to confirm respiratory failure when broader differential diagnoses exist (e.g., hypercarbic obtunded patient might have a reversible metabolic or toxicological etiology), but adequate stabilization and ventilation of these patients should not be delayed. Laboratory Criteria: 1. Blood gases: a. PaO 2 <55 mm Hg b. PaCO 2 >50 mmHg and pH < 7.32 2. Pulmonary function tests a. Vital capacity < 10 ml/kg b. Negative inspiratory force <25 cm H 2 O c. FEV 1 <10 ml/kg Clinical Criteria: Apnea or lack of adequate respirations or effective ventilations Respiratory distress with altered mentation Clinically apparent increasing work of breathing unrelieved by other interventions Obtundation (altered mental status) and need for airway protection OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 47 Mechanical Ventilation Set-up and Management: Mechanical Ventilator Setting Guidelines: 1. Mode of ventilation : The mode of ventilation should be tailored to the needs of the patient. In the emergent situation, the RMERT member may need to order initial setting quickly. SIMV and A/C are versatile modes that can be used for initial management. In patients with a good respiratory drive and mild- to-moderate respiratory failure, PSV is a good initial choice. 2. Tidal Volume (TV): An initial tidal volume of 5-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight is generally indicated, with the lower values recommended in the presence of obstructive airway disease and ARDS. The goal is to adjust the TV so that plateau pressures are <35 cm H 2 O. 3. Respiratory rate: 10-12 breaths per minute is recommended initially for adult patients not requiring hyperventilation for management of toxic or metabolic acidosis, or intracranial injury. High respiratory rates allow less time for exhalation, which increases mean airway pressure, and causes air trapping in patients with obstructive airway disease. The initial rate for COPD/Asthma/ARDS may be as low 5-6 breaths per minute. 4. Supplemental oxygen therapy: Initial setting should provide 100% oxygen delivery and transitioning quickly to provide the lowest FiO 2 that produces arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) >90% and PaO 5. Inspiration/Expiration Ratio: The normal inspiration/expiration (I/E) ratio to start is 1:2. This ratio reflects the duration of machine insufflation and the rest periods between them. a. If atelectasis is a problem, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) should be added. This may permit the use of more physiologic FiO 2 levels. b. In COPD patients, the I/E ratio is reduced to 1:3 or 1:4 to avoid air- trapping (breath stacking) and auto-PEEP or intrinsic PEEP (iPEEP) . c. Use of inverse I/E ratio may be appropriate in certain patients with complex compliance problems (e.g., ARDS ). 6. Inspiratory flow rates : Inspiratory flow rate is a function of the TV, I/E ratio , and RR and may be controlled internally by the ventilator. If flow rates are set manually, 60 L/min is typically used. This may be increased to 100 L/min to deliver tidal volumes quickly and allow for prolonged expiration in the presence of obstructive airway disease. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 48 Mechanical Ventilation Set-up and Management: 7. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP): PEEP has several beneficial effects and may be clinically underutilized. Applying physiologic PEEP of 3- 5 cm H 2O is common to prevent decreases in functional residual capacity in those with normal lungs. The reasoning for increasing levels of PEEP in critically ill patients is to provide acceptable oxygenation and to reduce the FiO 2 to nontoxic levels (FiO 2 < 0.5). The level of PEEP must be balanced such that excessive intrathoracic pressure (with a resultant decrease in venous return and risk of barotrauma) does not occur. a. PEEP has been found to reduce the risk of atelectasis and increase the number of \"open\" alveoli participating in ventilation, thus minimizing V/Q mismatches. b. In ARDS, the degree to which alveoli function is compromised varies tremendously and there is no single \"ideal\" PEEP appropriate for all alveoli. ARDS can occur from inhalation injury from fires, blast lung (primary blast injury) from explosions, inhalation of ammonia or chlorine or other toxic chemicals from a Hazmat scene. If high levels of PEEP are required, the lungs have a greater tendency to \"pop\". Therefore, the patient must be closely monitored for pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax. Chest decompression needles and chest tube kits with Pleurevac must be kept nearby and ready for immediate use. c. PEEP shifts fluid from the alveoli to the perivascular interstitial space, and therefore beneficial in cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Additionally it causes decreased venous return to the right side of the heart by increasing intrathoracic pressure. 8. Sensitivity: Sensitivity adjusts the level of negative pressure required to trigger the ventilator. A typical setting is -1 to -2 cm H 2 O. Too high a setting causes weak patients to be unable to trigger a breath. Too low a setting may lead to overventilation by causing the machine to auto-cycle. Patients with high levels of autoPEEP may have difficulty inhaling deeply enough to achieve a sufficiently negative intra-airway pressure. Monitoring during Mechanical Ventilation: Peak inspiratory and plateau pressure be assessed frequently, although recognize these will increase in the presence of extrapulmonary pressure (e.g., stiff chest wall or distended abdomen), and do not reflect the true risk of barotrauma . Parameters may be adjusted to limit pressure to <35 cm H 2 O. Expiratory volume is checked initially and periodically (continuously if ventilator is capable) to ensure the set tidal volume is delivered. Any indication of an air leak must prompt a search for underinflated ET tube cuff, open tubing port, or worsening pneumothorax. In patients with airway obstruction, monitor auto-PEEP. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 49 Mechanical Ventilation Set-up and Management: Mechanical Ventilator Troubleshooting: 1. High-pressure alarms are triggered when resistance to ventilation is high. This may occur secondary to reduced lung elasticity or airway obstruction, or extrinsic compression. Patients should be evaluated for pneumothorax, bronchospasm, elevated abdominal pressure, mainstem intubation, ETT obstruction, tube biting, dynamic hyperinflation/air trapping, psychomotor agitation, and worsening pulmonary compliance secondary to progressive pulmonary disease. a. Tube suctioning and adequate patient sedation are recommended after other causes of obstruction are ruled out. b. Comparison of peak pressure with plateau pressures may be helpful in indentifying the location of resistance, especially if graphical representation of airway pressure is available. Plateau pressure can be measured by applying a brief inspiratory pause after ventilation. It better reflects the risk of barotrauma than peak inspiratory pressure. If pleural pressure is elevated secondary to a stiff chest wall or high abdominal pressure, transpulmonary pressure (plateau pressure-pleural pressure) will be low, minimizing the risk of bleb or alveolar rupture. 2. Low exhaled volume alarms are triggered by air leaks. These are most frequently secondary to ventilatory tubing disconnect from the p atient's tracheal tube but may also occur in the event of balloon deflation or tracheal tube dislodgement. Tube placement, balloon inflation, and connection to the ventilator should be verified. 3. Hypoxia after intubation may occur secondary to hypoventilation, worsening cardiac shunting, mainstem intubation, aspiration, tube dislodgement, pulmonary edema, or inadequate FiO 2. High airway pressures and low exhaled volumes described above can result in hypoxia if they cause hypoventilation. Despite the use of numerous safety precautions, cases are occasionally documented of ventilators being connected to compressed air or nitrous oxide rather than oxygen. Increasing FiO 2 and adjusting ventilatory settings to increase PEEP or respiratory rate are useful first steps after excluding equipment failure and mechanical cause of hypoxia. 4. Hypotension after intubation is usually attributable to diminished central venous blood return to be the heart secondary to elevated intrathoracic pressure. This can be treated with fluid infusions and/or adjustment of ventilatory settings to lower intrathoracic pressure (reduce PEEP, tidal volume, and, if air trapping is suspected, respiratory rate). Hypotension may also be secondary to vasovagal reaction to intubation, rapid sequence induction, sedation, and tension pneumothorax. OSF Disaster Preparedness Office 50 Pre-Hospital Patient Care Protocols: Peoria Area EMS System Prehospital Care Manual Revised: July 11, 2016 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 2 FOREWORD The format of the Peoria Area EMS System (PAEMS System) Prehospital care manuals has changed several times throughout the history of the System. The initial protocol manual (June 1983) consisted of ALS field treatment protocols. Changes in IDPH rules and regulations resulted in the addition of ILS protocols (July 1990), BLS protocols (November 1992) and First Responder protocols (April 1998). In 1994 the PAEMS System Policy Manual was developed to address medical-legal issues and concerns and, in 1995, procedures were formatted into a Standard Operating Procedure Manual. With the complexity of a tiered response system and with the growing demand that health care services are both effective and efficient, the format for providing medical direction and patient care guidelines changed again in 2002. The separate manuals outlining field treatment guidelines, policies and procedures were all combined into one manual, the Prehospital Care Manual . This manual has become the focal point for patient care for Peoria Area EMS System providers in the Prehospital setting. In 2006, dramatic changes were made to the protocols to reflect changing national trends in an effort to provide optimal patient care. This current update reflects changes in AHA guidelines as well as some other evidence-based information (from local and national research) that dictates some needed changes to improve patient care. The intent of this manual is to create a team approach to Prehospital care, resulting in optimum patient care that is both efficient and effective. The focus of this manual is on providing safe, well-planned care for the patients we serve as well as maintaining a safe environment for the Prehospital care provider. This manual is also meant to be used as a study guide and helpful reference when necessary. All information contained herein is intended for use within the Peoria Area EMS System. No other system's protocols, policies, or procedures shall supersede the guidelines set fo rth in this manual or be utilized in place of this manual by a provider in the Peoria Area EMS System without the approval of the Peoria Area EMS System Medical Director. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 3 The mission of the Peoria Area EMS System is to deliver the highest quality health care that can be achieved with available resources. A uniform application of the protocols will ensure that competent and efficient care is provided to our patients. Our mission is accomplished by pursuing the goals of providing strong Prehospital education and training. The protocols will help resolve potential problems that may jeopardize the health and safety of the patient, prehospital healthcare provider or the community. As your EMS Medical Director, I welcome your input and encourage your suggestions by promoting an \"open door\" atmosphere. The EMS Office is a resource to assist you in accomplishing the mission of providing emergency medical services to your community. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of any assistance to you or your agency. It is my sincere wish that your experience with and service to the Peoria Area EMS System is both enjoyable and rewarding for you.

Professional Conduct & Code of Ethics Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 18 (Applies to ALL Prehospital providers) Professional status as an Emergency Medical Technician is maintained and enriched by the willingness of the individual practitioner to accept and fulfill obligations to society, other medical professionals, and the profession of Emergency Medical Technician. As an Emergency Medical Technician, I solemnly pledge myself to the following code of professional ethics: A fundamental responsibility of the EMT is to conserve life, to alleviate suffering, to promote health, to do no harm, and to encourage the quality and equal availability of emergency medical care. The EMT provides services based on human need, with respect for human dignity, unrestricted by consideration of nationality, race, creed, color or status. The EMT does not use professional knowledge and skills in any enterprise detrimental to the public well-being. The EMT respects and holds in confidence all information of a confidential nature obtained in the course of professional work unless required by law to divulge such information. The EMT, as a citizen, understands and upholds the law and performs the duties of citizenship; as a professional, the EMT has the never-ending responsibility to work with concerned citizens and other healthcare professionals in promoting a high standard of emergency medical care to all people. The EMT shall maintain professional competence and demonstrate concern for the competence of other members of the EMS healthcare team. An EMT assumes responsibility in defining and upholding standards of professional practice and education. Code of Ethics Professional Conduct & Code of Ethics Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 19 The EMT assumes responsibility for individual professional actions and judgment, both in all aspects of emergency functions, and knows and upholds the laws which affect the practice of the EMT. An EMT has the responsibility to be aware of and participate in matters of legislation affecting the EMS System. The EMT, or groups of EMTs, who advertise professional service, does so in conformity with the dignity of the profession. The EMT has an obligation to protect the public by not delegating to a person less qualified, any service which requires the professional competence of an EMT. The EMT will work harmoniously with and sustain confidence in EMT associates, the nurses, the physicians, and other members of the EMS healthcare team. The EMT refuses to participate in unethical procedures and assumes responsibility to expose incompetence or unethical conduct of others to the appropriate authority in a proper and professional manner. Professional Conduct & Code of Ethics Policy Code of Ethics (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 20 If compliance with IDPH Rules and Regulations of the Peoria Area EMS System Policies results in unreasonable hardship, the EMS provider agency shall petition the PAEMS System and IDPH for a temporary rule waiver. The format for waiver petition shall be as follows: Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Cover letter, to include: agency name, IDPH agency number, agency official(s), agency designated contact person, telephone number, statement of the problem and proposed waiver . Explanation of why the waiver is necessary. Explanation of how the modification will relieve problems that would be created by compliance with the rule or policy as written. Statement of and justification for the time period (maximum one year) of which the modification will be necessary. This section must also include a chronological plan for meeting total compliance requirements. a) Staffing waivers require local newspaper advertisement explaining staffing shortage, mention that there will be \" no reduction in standard of care\", and a request for new volunteers/ employees. b) Submit a copy of 60-day staffing schedule. The petition should be submitted to the Peoria Area EMS System Medical Director for review and approval. The IDPH Regional EMS Coordinator will then review the petition. If needed, the Illinois Department of Public Health may request review of the petition by the State Advisory Board. These recommendations will be forwarded to the Director of IDPH for final action. Waivers will be granted only if there is NO reduction in the standard of medical care. Agency Compliance Waiver Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 21 EMS agencies are expected to advertise in a responsible manner and in accordance with applicable legislation to assure the public is protected against misrepresentation. No agency (public or private) shall advertise or identify their vehicle or agency as an EMS life support provider unless the agency does, in fact, provide service as defined in the EMS Act and has been approved by IDPH. No agency (public or private) shall disseminate information leading the public to believe that the agency provides EMS life support services unless the agency does, in fact, provide services as defined in the EMS Act and has been approved by IDPH. Any person (or persons) who violate the EMS Act, or any rule promulgated pursuant there to, is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor. A licensee that advertises its service as operating a specific number of vehicles or more than one vehicle shall state in such advertisement the hours of operation for those vehicles, if individual vehicles are not available twenty-four (24) hours a day. Any advertised vehicle for which hours of operation are not stated shall be required to operate twenty-four (24) hours a day. It is the responsibility of all Peoria Area EMS System personnel to report such infractions of this section to the EMS Medical Director. Agency Advertising Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 22 EMS practitioners, by virtue of their state licensure, certification, or national registration, have unsupervised, intimate, physical and emotional contact with patients at a time of maximum physical and emotional vulnerability, as well as unsupervised access to personal property. In this capacity, they are placed in a position of the highest public trust, even above that granted to other public safety professionals and most other health care providers. While police officers require warrants to enter private property, and are subject to substantial oversight when engaging in \"strip searches\" or other intrusive practices, EMTs are afforded free access to the homes and intimate body parts of patients who are extremely vulnerable, and who may be unable to defend or protect themselves, voice objections to particular actions, or provide accurate accounts of events at a later time. Citizens in need of out-of-hospital medical services rely on the EMS System and the existence of state licensure/certification or national certification to assure that those who respond to their calls for aid are worthy of this extraordinary trust. It is well accepted in the United States that persons who have been convicted of criminal conduct may not serve as police officers. In light of the high degree of trust conferred upon EMTs by virtue of licensure and certification, EMTs should be held to a similar, if not higher, standard. For these reasons, the EMS certifying/licensing agency has a duty to exclude individuals who pose a risk to public health and safety by virtue of conviction of certain crimes. System Certification of individuals convicted of felonies present an unreasonable risk to public health and safety. Thus, applications for certification by individuals convicted of any felony crime will be denied in all cases. Examples of felonies, without limitation, are as follows: 1. Felonies involving sexual misconduct, assault or abuse. 2. Felonies involving the sexual or physical abuse of, or neglect of, children, the elderly or the physically or mentally disabled. 3. Any felony in which the victim is an out-of-hospital patient or a patient or resident of a health care facility including abuse, neglect, theft from, or financial exploitation of a person entrusted to the care or protection of the applicant. 4. Felonies of violence against persons, such as assault, or battery with a dangerous weapon, aggravated assault and battery, murder or attempted murder, manslaughter (except involuntary manslaughter), kidnapping, robbery of any degree, or arson. Prohibited Hiring Policy Preamble General Denial PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 23 5. Felonies involving controlled substances or synthetics, including unlawful possession or distribution, or intent to distribute unlawfully, Schedule I through V drugs as defined by the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. 6. Felonies against property, such as grand larceny, burglary, embezzlement or insurance fraud. Applications for certification by individuals convicted of any crimes which are no t felonies may be accepted at PAEMS' sole discretion after consideration of the following factors: 1. The seriousness of the crime. 2. Whether the crime relates directly to the skills of out-of-hospital care service and the delivery of patient care. 3. How much time has elapsed since the crime was committed. 4. Whether the crime involved violence to, or abuse of, another person. 5. Whether the crime involved a minor or a person of diminished capacity. 6. Whether the applicant's actions and conduct since the crime occu rred are consistent with the holding of a position of public trust. 7. The age of the applicant when committing the crime. 8. Any other relevant circumstances. Discretionary Approval Prohibited Hiring Policy General Denial (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 24 It is the responsibility of the Resource Hospital to confirm the credentials of th e System's EMS providers. System certification is a privilege granted by the EMS Medical Director in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health. 1. A System applicant must hold a State of Illinois license or be eligible for State licensure. EMS providers transferring in from another system or state must have all clinical and internship requirements completed prior to System certification. Transferring into the Peoria Area EMS System to complete internship requirements of an EMT training program is prohibited. 2. The System applicant must be a member of or in the process of applying for employment with a Peoria Area EMS System provider agency. The System agency must inform the EMS Office of the applicant's potenti al for hire or membership to their agency. 3. A Pre-Certification Application must be completed and submitted to the EMS Office. 4. The System applicant must also submit copies of the following: IDPH license (FR-D, EMT, Intermediate, Paramedic, or PHRN) National Registry certification (if applicable) AHA ACLS (Intermediate, Paramedic) ITLS (Intermediate, Paramedic) PEPP or AHA PALS (Intermediate, Paramedic) CPR {AHA Healthcare Provider OR American Red Cross} (FR-D, EMT, Intermediate, Paramedic or PHRN) Letter of reference from current EMS Medical Director Resume\u00b4 (education and employment history) 5. Upon System review of the Pre-Certification Application , EMS Office personnel will conduct a pre-interview with qualified applicants. 6.

However, these individuals are not responsible for any certifications other than their own. Failure to maintain current certification in ACLS, ITLS, PEPP/PALS, CPR or any other System certification may result in suspension of the individual in violation if an extension has not been applied for and granted through the EMS Office. In either case, the individual will be required to take a full provider course in the lapsed certification and will NOT be allowed to simply take a refresher course for certification . Suspended individuals will remain on suspension until proof of current certification is presented to the EMS Office. System Certification Policy Maintaining System Certification PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 27 A System participant may resign from the System by submitting a written resignation to the EMS Medical Director. A System participant who resigns from or is terminated by a System provider agency has a 60-day grace period to re-establish membership/active status with another System provider agency. If the participant does not do this within the 60-day time period, then the individual's System certifica tion will be re-categorized or terminated. An EMS provider requesting to re-certify in the PAEMS System will be required to repeat the process for initial certification. Active Provider - A FR-D, EMT or PHRN is considered an active provider if he/sh e: Is System-certified at the level of his/her IDPH licensure level. Is active and functions at his/her certification level with a PAEMS System agency providing the same level of service. Maintains all continuing education requirements, certifications, and testing requirements in accordance with System policy for his/her level of System certification.

Provider Status System Certification Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 29 1. To be re-licensed as an EMS provider, the licensee shall submit the required documentation for renewal with the Resource Hospital (EMS Office) at least 60 days prior to the license expiration date. Failure to complete continuing education requirements and/or failure to submit the appropriate documentation to the EMS Office at least 60 days prior to the license expiration date may result in delay or denial of re-licensure. The licensee will be responsible for any late fees or class fees incurred as a result. 2. The EMS Office will review the re- licensure applicant's continuing education records. If the individual has met all requirements for re-licensure and approval is given by the EMS Medical Director, the EMS Office will submit a renewal request to IDPH. 3. A licensee who has not been recommended for re-licensure by the EMS Medical Director will be instructed to submit a request for independent renewal directly to IDPH. The EMS Office will assist the licensee in securing the appropriate renewal form. 4. IDPH requires the licensee to certify on the renewal application form (Child Support Statement), under penalty of perjury , that he or she is not more than 30 days delinquent in complying with a child support order (Section 10-65(c) of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act [5 ILCS 100/10- 65(c)]). The provider's social security number must be provided as well. 5. The license of an EMS provider shall terminate on the day following th e expiration date shown on the license. An EMS provider may NOT function in the Peoria Area EMS System until a copy of a current license is on file in the EMS Office . 6. An EMS provider whose license has expired may, within 60 days after license expiration , submit all re-licensure material and a fee of $50.00 in the form of a certified check or money order made payable to IDPH (Note: personal checks, cash or credit cards will NOT be accepted). If all continuing education and System requirements have been met and there is no disciplinary action pending against the EMS provider, the Department may re-license the EMS provider. Re-Licensure Requirements Policy Re-Licensure Process PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 30 7. Any EMS provider whose license has expired for a period of more than 60 days will NOT be re-licensed and must complete all aspects of the initial training program required for licensure, pay the fees required for initial licensure and pass the State (or National Registry) exam . **NOTE : Failure to re- license at any level does not \"automatically\" drop a provider to a lower level of certification (e.g. An EMT does not automatically become a First Responder, etc.). Once a provider's license has expired, he or she is no longer an EMS provider at ANY level and cannot provide medical care in the System or the State. 8. Requests for extensions or inactive status must be submitted on the proper IDPH form and forwarded to the EMS Office at least 60 days prior to expiration. Extensions are granted only in very limited circumstances and are handled on a case by case basis. NOTE: The EMS Medical Director may mandate additional CEU requirements during the extension period. 9. At any time prior to the expiration of the current license , an EMT-I or EMT- P may revert to the EMT-B status for the remainder of the license period. The EMT-I or E MT-P must make this request in writing to the EMS Medical Director & the Department and must submit their original current EMT-I or EMT- P license to the Department. To re-license at the EMT-B level, the provider must meet all of the EMT-B requirements for re -licensure. 10. At any time prior to the expiration of the current license , an EMT-B may revert to the First Responder/Defibrillator (FR-D) status for the remainder of the license period. The EMT-B must make this request in writing to the EMS Medical Director & the Department and must submit their original current EMT- B license to the Department. To re-license at the FR-D level, the provider must meet all of the FR-D requirements for re-licensure. 11. The provider must submit a copy of their new IDPH license to their agency(s) and to the EMS Office. Failure to do so will result in ineligibility to function in the System. Re-Licensure Process (continued) Re-Licensure Requirements Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 31 In conjunction with the Region 2 EMS/Trauma Plan, the Peoria Area EMS System requires: 1. Twenty-five percent (25%) of the didactic continuing education hours required for re-licensure (as an EMS provider, at any level in the PAEMS System) must be earned through attendance at System-taught courses, courses sponsored by the Peoria Area EMS Office or courses taught by a System-approved instructor. 2. No more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the continuing education hours required for re-licensure will consist of hours obtained from the same site code. 3. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the continuing education hours required for re-licensure will consist of any single subject area ( i.e. shock, diabetic emergencies, etc.). 4. EMS providers (all levels) must attend at least one (1) continuing education program that reviews PAEMS System and Regional Policies, Standing Medical Orders and Operating Procedures as part of the four-year, 25% PAEMS System continuing education requirements. 5.

This Prehospital Care Manual, containing Standing Medical Orders, Protocols, Policies & Procedures, is intended to establish the standard of care which is expected of the Peoria Area EMS System provider. 1. Standing Medical Orders, Protocols, Policies & Procedures contained in this Prehospital Care Manual are the written, established standard of care to be followed by all members of the Peoria Area EMS System for treatment of the acutely ill or injured patient. 2. The EMS provider will initiate patient care under these guidelines and contact Base Station Medical Control in a timely manner for those treatments which require on- line physician's ord er. Diligent effort must be made to contact Medical Control in a timely manner via cellular telemetry, landline phone or VHF MERCI radio. Delay or failure to contact Medical Control for required on-line orders is a quality assurance indicator. 3. These Standing Medical Orders will be utilized as Off-Line Medical Control under the following circumstances: In the event communication cannot be established or is disrupted between the Prehospital provider and Medical Control (or the receiving hospital). In the event that establishing communications would cause an inadvisable delay in care that would increase life threat to the patient. In the event the Medical Control physician is not immediately available for communication. In the event of a disaster situation, where an immediate action to preserve and save lives supersedes the need to communicate with hospital-based personnel, or where such communication is not required by the disaster protocol. 4. Inability to contact Medical Control should not delay patient transport or the provision of life-saving therapies. Patient destination and transport decisions are set forth in these Standing Medical Orders / Protocols. Off-Line Me dical Control, Standing Medical Orders & Protocols Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 39 Base Station Medical Control is designed to provide immediate medical direction and consultation to the Prehospital EMS provider in accordance with established patient treatment guidelines. On-line Medical Control is utilized to involve the expertise of an Emergency Medical Physician in the treatment plans and decisions involving patient care in the Prehospital setting. 1. Voice communications shall be categorized as \" MERCI \" for calls that do not require medical orders and \" Telemetry \" for medical or trauma calls requiring medical orders or base station physician contact and/or consultation. 2. EMS communications requiring on-line contact with a base station physician shall be conducted using cellular telemetry (309)655-6770. 3. Use of telemetry is required for patient care requiring interventions beyond the Universal BLS, ILS or ALS standing medical orders. Situations requiring Medical Control contact include, but are not limited to: Anytime an order is required for BLS, ILS or ALS medications. Anytime orders are needed for procedures . Any instance an EMS provider desires physician involvement . Any situation that involves bypassing a closer hospital. Anytime an EMS provider feels a deferral is warranted. Anytime a Field Training Instructor (FTI) feels a student needs to further develop communication skills. When a pre-hospital 12-Lead EKG is acquired that shows wide- complex tachycardia or consultation is needed . Suspected stroke patients. Circumstances involving a Death at Scene ( DAS ) or cases involving advanced directives ( DNR et al). On-Line Medical Control Policy On-Line Medical Control PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 40 High risk refusals (see next page ). First Responder low risk refusals (see item #10 of this policy). Use of restraints (including handcuffs ). Trauma cases or potential trauma cases (based on mechanism of injury). 4. \"Telemetry\" calls include all medical complaints requiring Medical Control contact, refusals, traumas and consultations. 5. \"Trauma Traffic\" includes calls that are related to injuries or mechanisms of injury that meet (or potentially meet ) Minimum Trauma Field Triage Criteria (see Critical Trauma Procedure ). Trauma traffic does not inclu de refusals (including accident refusals). 6. \"MERCI\" calls are made via MERCI radio and called directly to the receiving hospital (or in cases where telemetry communication is not possible and consult with a physician is necessary). MERCI communication is adequate for patient care that does not require interventions beyond Universal BLS, ILS or ALS Care . Specifically, patients that have received only oxygen, monitor, IV and/or medications without the need for additional orders or in cases where Medical Control contact is not required. If MERCI traffic prevents contact with the receiving hospital, Medical Communications (MEDCOM) should be contacted at the Resource Hospital (OSF Saint Francis Medical Center) for assistance in proper routing of communication s. If the receiving hospital deems that further care is necessary or requests additional interventions be performed, the EMS provider should contact Medical Control. If the receiving hospital requests discontinuation of treatment established by the prehospital provider, Medical Control contact should be established. On-Line Medical Control (Continued) On-Line Medical Control Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 41 7. High Risk Refusals require Medical Control consultation prior to securing and accepting the refusal and terminating patient contact. High risk refusals involve cases where the pati ent's condition may warrant delivery of care in accordance with implied consent of the Emergency Doctrine or other statutory provision. High risk refusals include, but are not limited to: Head injury (based on mechanism or signs & symptoms) Presence of alcohol and/or drugs Anytime medications are given and patient refuses transport Significant mechanism of injury ( e.g. rollover MVA) Altered level of consciousness or impaired judgment Minors (17 years old or younger, regardless of injury) Situations that involve bypassing a closer hospital 8. Low Risk Refusals do not require Medical Control consultation (for BLS, ILS & ALS levels) if the prehospital provider determines that the patient meets the Low Risk Criteria and there is no doubt that the patient understands the risk of refusal. The patient cannot be impaired and must be able to consent to the refusal. Medical Control should be contacted if there are any concerns about the patient's ability to refuse. Low risk refusals may include: Slow speed auto accidents without injury Isolated injuries not related to an auto accident or other significant mechanism of injury False calls or \"third party\" calls where no illness, injury or mechanism of injury is apparent. Lifting assistance or \"public assist\" calls (for which EMS is called for assistance in moving a patient from chair to bed, floor to bed, car to home, etc.). This assumes the EMS agency is routinely called to assist this patient, the patient is assessed to ensure there is no complaint or injury and there has been no significant change in the patient's condition. EMS crews must complete a patient care report indicating all assessment findings and assistance rendered. On-Line Medical Control (Continued) On-Line Medical Control Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 42 9. If the EMS provider has not been able to contact Medical Control via cellular telemetry, telephone or MERCI radio, the EMS provider will initiate the appropriate protocol(s). Upon arrival at the receiving hospital, an incident report must be completed and forwarded to the EMS Office within 24 hours of the occurrence. This report should document all aspects of the run with specific details of the radio/communications failure and initiation of the Peoria Area EMS System Standing Medical Orders and Standard Operating Procedures . 10. First Responders may handle low risk refusals only (as defined above). However, First Responders must contact Medical Control via cellular telemetry at (309)655- 6770. Under no circumstance should a First Responder obtain a high risk refusal . On-Line Medical Control Policy On-Line Medical Control (Continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 43 Radio communications is a vital component of prehospital care. Information reported should be concise and provide an accurate description of the patient's condition as well as treatment rendered. Therefore, a complete patient assessment and set of vital signs should be completed prior to contacting Medical Control or the receiving hospital. Regardless of the destination, early and timely notification of Medical Control or the receiving hospital is essential for prompt care to be delivered by all involved. Unit identification Destination & ETA Age/sex Chief complaint Assessment (General appearance, degree of distress & level of consciousness) Vital signs : 1. Blood pressure (auscultated {or palpated if unable to auscultate}) 2. Pulse (rate, quality, regularity) 3. Respirations (rate, pattern, depth) 4. Pulse oximetry, if indicated 5. Pupils (size & reactivity) 6. Skin (color, temperature, moisture) Pertinent physical examination findings SAMPLE History Treatment rendered and patient response to treatment NOTE: Items listed in red should be transmitted without delay. If Medical Control contact is necessary to obtain physician orders (where indicated by protocol), diligent attempts must be made to establish base station contact via: 1. Cellular telemetry (309) 655-6770 2. Telephone landline direct to MEDCOM (309) 655-6770 3. MERCI radio If unable to establish contact, then initiate protocol. If Medical Control contact is not necessary, contact the receiving hospital via MERCI. Radio Communications Protocol Components of the Patient Report PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 44 A patient may refuse medical help and/or transportation. Once the patient has received treatment, he/she may refuse to be transported if he/she does not appear to be a threat to themselves or others. Any person refusing treatment must be informed of the risks of not receiving emergency medical care and/or transportation . NOTE: Family members cannot refuse transportation of a patient to a hospital unless they can produce a copy of a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare . 1. Assure an accurate patient assessment has been conducted to include the patient's chief complaint, history, objective findings and the patient's ability to make sound decisions. 2. Explain to the patient the risk associated with his/her decision to refuse treatment and transportation. 3. Secure Medical Control approval of high risk refusals (low risk refusals for First Responders) in accordance with the Online Medical Control Policy . 4. Complete the Against Medical Advice/Refusal Form and have the patient sign the form. If the patient is a minor, this form should be signed by a legal guardian or Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare . NOTE : Parental refusals may be accepted by voice contact with the parent (i.e. by telephone) if the EMS provider has made reasonable effort to confirm the identity of the parent and the form may be signed by an adu lt witness on scene. This should be clearly documented on the refusal form and in the patient care report. 5. If available, it is preferable to have a police officer at the scene act as the witness. If a police officer is not present, any other bystander may act as a witness. However, his/her name, address & telephone number should be obtained and written on the back of the report. 6. If the patient refuses medical help and/or transportation after having been informed of the risks of not receiving emergency medical care and refuses to sign the release, clearly document the patient's refusal to sign the report. Also, have the entire crew witness the statement and have an additional witness sign your statement, preferably a police officer. Include the office r's badge number and contact Medical Control.

It is just as important as the care itself and should be an accurate reflection of the events that transpired. It is imperative that written documentation is left with the patient at the receiving facility . 1. All EMS providers must complete a patient care report for each patient contact or request for response ( e.g. agency is cancelled en route to a call then a \"cancelled call\" chart must be completed). 2. Ideally, a patient care report will be completed in its entirety and provided to the receiving hospital's Emergency Department immediately afte r transferring care to the ED staff and prior to departing the hospital. 3. If the patient care report cannot be completed prior to departing the ED, then a Peoria Area EMS System Preliminary Field Medical Report Form must be completed and left with the ED staff. The patient care report should then be completed and faxed to the ED as soon as possible after the call (within the shift). 4. Documentation must be completed on System approved forms and/or System approved electronic reporting systems. 5. Failure to leave written documentation will be reported to the EMS Office by ED personnel. Agencies and/or personnel failing to comply with documentation requirements will be reported to the EMS Medical Director and corrective action may be taken to assure documentation policies and procedures are followed. 6. Non-transport agencies must complete patient care documentation immediately following the call . 7. Copies of all patient care reports must be provided to the EMS Office.

Patient Confidentiality & Release of Information Policy Confidential Information Guidelines (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 52 GENERAL PATIENT ASSESSMENT & MANAGEMENT EMS OPERATIONS PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 53 Patients should be transported to the clo sest appropriate hospital. A patient (or the patient's Power of Attorney for Healthcare ) does have the right to make an informed decision to be transported to a hospital of choice. This decision should be respected unless the risk of transporting to a more distant hospital outweighs the medical benefits of transporting to the closest hospital. A trauma patient may benefit from transport directly to the closest appropriate Trauma Center rather than the closest geographically located hospital . Bypassi ng the nearest hospital to respect the patient's hospital choice is a decision based on medical benefits and associated risks and should be made in accordance with: 1. Urgency of care and risk factors based on: Mechanism of injury (physiologic factors) Perfusion status and assessment findings (anatomical factors) Transport distance and time (environmental factors) 2. Medical Control consultation 3. Capacity of the nearest facility or facility of choice 4. Available resources of the transporting agency 5. Traffic and weather conditions The patient's hospital preference may be honored if: There are no identifiable risk factors. The patient has a secure airway. The patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient has been advised of the closer hospital. Medical Control approves. The EMS provider will explain the benefits versus the risks of transport to a more distant hospital and contact Medical Control for approval. The patient (or representative) must sign a Peoria Area EMS System AMA/Refusal Form documenting that the patient understands the risks. No transporting service shall bypass a hospital in order to meet an ALS intercept (including Life Flight) unless approved by Medical Control . Patients may be transported to the hospital of choice within the city limits of Peoria without contacting Medical Control for approval as differences in transport times is negligible. Patient Destination Policy Patient Hospital Preference Guidelines PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 54 All trauma patients fall under the American College of Surgeons Field Triage Decision Scheme . Any trauma patient who meets the ACS Field Triage Guidelines shall be transported to the Level 1 Trauma Center unless otherwise directed by Medical Control. If a patient is unconscious and meets ACS Field Triage guidelines for trauma, the patient will be taken to the highest level trauma center available. If a patient has an altered level of consciousness and meets ACS Field Triage guidelines for trauma, the patient will be taken to the highest level trauma center available. If a patient is alert and oriented to person, place & time with stable vital signs, the patient may be taken to the hospital of his/her choice in accordance with Patient Hospital Preference Guidelines . If a family member or any other person is at the scene of an emergency and can readily prove Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare , he/she can request that the patient be transported to a specific hospital in accordance with Patient Hospital Preference Guidelines . If a parent requests that a child (less than 18 years of age) who meets ACS Field Triage guidelines be taken to a specific hospital, Medical Control must be contacted for the final decision. Patient Destination Policy Trauma Patient Guideline s PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 55 Patient abandonment occurs when there is termination of the caregiver/patient relationship without consent of the patient and without allowing sufficient time and resources for the patient to find equivalent care. This is assuming, and unless proven otherwise, there exists a need for continuing medical care and the patient is accepting the treatment. EMS personnel must not leave or terminate care of a patient if a need exists for continuing medical care that must be provided by a knowledgeable, skilled and licensed EMS provider unless one or more of the following conditions exist: 1. Appropriate receiving hospital personnel assume medical care and responsibility for the patient. 2. The patient or legal guardian refuses EMS care and transportation (In this instance, follow the procedure as outlined in the Patient Right of Refusal Policy ). 3. EMS personnel are physically unable to continue care of the patient due to exhaustion or injury. 4. When law enforcement personnel, fire officials or the EMS crew determine the scene to be unsafe and immediate threat to life or injury hazards exist. 5. The patient has been determined to be dead and all policies and procedures related to death cases have been followed. 6. If Medical Control concurs with a DNR order. 7. Whenever specifically requested to leave the scene due to an overbearing need ( e.g. disasters, triage prioritization). 8. Medical care and responsibility for the patient is assumed by comparably trained, certified and licensed personnel in accordance with applicable policies. If EMS personnel arrive on scene, establish contact and evaluate a patient who then refuses care, the EMS crew shall conduct termination of the patient contact in accordance with the Patient Right of Refusal Policy and On -Line Medical Control Policy . EMS personnel may leave the scene of an illness or injury incident, where initial care has been provided to the patient and the only responsibility remaining for the EMS crew is transportation of the patient or securing a signed refusal, if the following conditions exist: 1. Delay in transportation of another patient (i.e. trauma patient) from the same incident would threaten life or limb. 2. An occurrence of a more serious nature elsewhere necessitates life-saving intervention that could be provided by the EMS crew (and without consequence to the original patient). 3. More appropriate or prudent transportation is available. Transfer and Termination of Patient Care Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 56 4. Definitive arrangement for the transfer of care and transportation of the initial patient to other appropriate EMS personnel must be made prior to the departure of the EMS crew. The alternate arrangements should, in no way, jeopardize the well-being of the initial patient. During the transport of a patient by ambulance, should the EMS crew come across an emergency requiring ambulance assistance; the local EMS system will be activated. Crews involved in the treatment and transportation of an emergency patient are not to stop and render care. The priority is to the patient onboard the ambulance. In the event you are transporting the patient with more than two (2) appropriately trained prehospital personnel, you may elect to leave one medical attendant at the scene to render care and the other personnel will continue to transport the patient to the receiving facility. In the event there is not a patient onboard the ambulance and an emergency situation is encountered requiring ambulance assistance; the crew may stop and render care. However, the local EMS agency should be activated and their jurisdiction respected. Transfer and Termination of Patient Care Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 57 A smooth transition of care between EMS providers is essential for optimum patient care. First Responder and BLS non-transport crews routinely transfer care to transporting EMS providers. The transfer of advanced procedures presents unique concerns for both the EMS provider relinquishing patient care as well as the EMS provider assuming patient care. A smooth transition between providers is essential for good patient care. Cooperation between all EMS personnel is encouraged and expected. 1. EMS providers arriving at the scene of a call shall initiate care in accordance with the guidelines provided in this manual. The EMS provider must maintain a constant awareness as to what would be the best course of action for optimum and compassionate patient care. Focus should be placed on conducting a thorough patient assessment and providing adequate BLS care . The benefit of remaining on scene to establish specific treatments versus prompt transport to a definitive care facility should be a consideration of each patient contact. 2. Once on scene, the EMS transporting agency shall, in conjunction with Medical Control, be the on-scene authority having jurisdiction in the determination of the patient care plan. The rank or seniority of a non-transport provider shall not supersede the authority vested in the transporting EMS provider by the EMS Medical Director. 3. Upon the arrival of the transporting agency, the non- transport provider should provide a detailed verbal report to the transporting provider and then immediately transfer care to the transporting provider . The non-transport provider may continue the establishment of BLS/ILS/ALS procedures with the concurrence of the transporting provider. 4. The transport provider should obtain report from the non-transport provider and conduct a thorough patient assessment. Treatment initiated by the non-transport provider should be taken into consideration in determining subsequent patient care steps. 5. If the provider has initiated advanced procedures, then the transport provider should verify the integrity of the procedure prior to utilizing it for further treatment ( e.g. verify patency of peripheral IVs and ETTs should be checked for proper placement). Transporting crews shall not arbitrarily avoid the use of (or discontinue) an advanced procedure established by non-transport personnel . Rationale for discontinuing an established procedure should be documented on the patient care report. 6. Properly licensed and System-certified providers may be utilized to establish ILS/ALS procedures with the concurrence of the transporting provider. EMS personnel are encouraged to use all responders for efficiency in coordinating patient care. Transition of Care Policy Patient Care Transition Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 58 When a patient's condition warrants the highest level of available care, in -field service level upgrades shall be utilized to optimize patient care. \" In-field service level upgrades \" as referred to in this policy implies services above the level of care provided by the initial responding agency. If a patient's condition warrants a higher level of care and an advanced level is available, then the more advanced agency will be called for immediate assistance. Conditions warranting advanced assistance include: Trauma patients entrapped with extrication required. Patients with compromised or obstructed airways. Full arrests. Patients exhibiting signs of hypoxemia ( e.g. respiratory distress, restlessness, cyanosis) unrelieved by oxygen. Patients with altered mental status/altered level of consciousness. Chest pain of cardiac nature unresolved with rest, oxygen and/or nitroglycerin. Patients exhibiting signs of decompensated shock (BP<100mmHg, pallor, diaphoresis, altered LOC, tachypnea). Unconscious or unresponsive patients (other than a behavioral episode). Any case in which the responding agency or Medical Control deems that advanced care would be beneficial to patient outcome. Pediatric cases with any of the conditions listed above. If the primary response area is covered by any combination of BLS, ILS or ALS, the highest level of service available shall be utilized for any patient whose condition warrants advanced level care as indicated. ILS may be utilized if, and only if ALS is unavailable. When determining the need for advanced assistance, consideration should be given to the following: Transport time to the hospital - Units with less than a 10 minute transport time to the hospital may complete transport without an intercept. Early activation - Diligent efforts should be made to request an intercept as early as possible. This could include simultaneous dispatch of an advanced unit to the scene of the emergency. Rendezvous site - Intercepts should be done in a safe area, away from traffic. Availability of resources - Units used for intercept should be in direct travel to the receiving hospital. Transportation shall not be delayed due to an intercept not being available. Patients should not be transported via a longer route in order to obtain an intercept. Decisions for or against requesting an intercept should be in the best interest of the patient based on his/her current medical condition, not past medical history. Intercept Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 59 Regardless of the response jurisdiction, if two (2) different agencies with different levels of care are dispatched to and arrive on the scene of an emergency, the agency with the highest certification level shall assume control of the patient . Safety will be emphasized throughout the intercept and during the transfer of care. Intercepts should not take place on heavily traveled roadways if at all possible. Rendezvous sites should be predetermined by operating procedures or unit- to-radio contact. Sites that should be considered include parking lots, safe shoulders or on side streets. The following guidelines also apply: Pertinent patient information should be transmitted to the intercepting personnel prior to rendezvous ( i.e. nature of the problem, vitals). Patients should not be transferred from ambulance- to-ambulance. The higher-level personnel, along with proper portable equipment, shall board the requesting agency's ambulance. The higher level personnel will oversee patient care with the assistance of the requesting agency's personnel. Once the higher level perso nnel have boarded the requesting agency's ambulance, the higher level provider will determine the transport code for the remainder of transport: Code 1 (Signal 1) = Emergency transport with lights and sirens in operation. Code 2 (Signal 2) = Transport without lights and sirens and obeying all normal traffic laws. NOTE : Transport should never be done using lights only or sirens only (follow the \" all or nothing \" rule) . Intercept Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 60 In the event that a PAEMS System approved ALS or ILS Provider is used to assist a BLS Provider an in-field service level upgrade* can be utilized to optimize patient outcome. To provide guidelines for infield upgrades of ambulances to higher level of care. In certain circumstances, it may become necessary to upgrade BLS vehicles to the EMT- Intermediate or Advanced Life Support level. In the event that it becomes necessary to upgrade a BLS ambulance, the following steps will be followed. ALS or ILS personnel may board a BLS vehicle to render a higher level of prehospital emergency care thereby temporarily upgrading that BLS vehicle to the status of an ALS or ILS vehicle. All portable ALS or ILS equipment as listed in the PAEMS Ambulance Supply List (airway kit, monitoring equipment, drug box, and controlled substance container) must be transferred to the BLS ambulance. The BLS ambulance will be approved by the PAEMS System to function as an ALS or ILS ambulance for the duration of this staffing arrangement. The ALS or ILS personnel will assume responsibility for the treatment and transport of patients while on the up graded BLS ambulance. BLS providers may assist with patient care on scene and during transport if requested. Once the patient has been transported to the hospital and the call terminated, the ALS or ILS equipment will be removed from the EMS unit it will return to its BLS certification level. ** \"In -Field Service Level Upgrades\" as referred to in this policy imply services above the level of care provided by the initial responding agency. This may include a higher level ambulance or higher level alternate response vehicle. In-Field Service Level Upgrades Purpo se: Policy Statement: Policy: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 61 The goal of the patient assessment process is to measure the status of the patient's perfusion, identify life- threatening conditions, determine the patient's chief c omplaint and/or mechanism of injury, evaluate the complaint (OPQRST) and obtain a (SAMPLE) history. The components of the patient assessment process include the scene survey, initial assessment (ABCs) and rapid trauma assessment or detailed physical exam. A focused physical exam may be conducted if the general impression of the patient's condition appears to be of a specific nature. The EMS provider must constantly monitor the patient's perfusion status. Perfusion is defined as the adequate flow of bloo d through the body's tissues. For perfusion to be adequate the patient must have an adequate blood volume (with adequate supplies of oxygen and glucose), a properly functioning cardiovascular system and an intact neurological system for regulation of vascular dilation. Failure of the body to maintain adequate perfusion will result in signs and symptoms of shock. Signs and symptoms of shock vary depending on the degree and cause of shock. Level of consciousness is an important assessment of the patient's vital organ perfusion status. A patient with an altered level of consciousness must be considered at risk of shock. Peripheral tissue condition is another important indicator of perfusion status. A patient with cool, clammy, pale or cyanotic skin should be considered at risk for shock. If the patient is found to be in shock, the assessment process should be directed at finding the cause of shock, immediate interventions to support perfusion and prompt transport. Conversely, if the mechanism of injury or assessment findings suggests that the patient may have a condition that could result in shock, EMS personnel should carefully assess the patient's perfusion status and prepare to treat shock. The goal of patient care is to identify patients in shock or at risk of shock, initiating care that will directly assist maintaining the patient's perfusion and safely transporting the patient to an emergency department or trauma center in a timely manner. The EMS provider must maintain a constant awareness as to what would be the best course of action for optimum and compassionate patient care. The benefit of remaining on scene to establish specific treatments verses prompt transport to a definitive care facility should be a consideration of each patient contact. Patient Assessment Process & Goals of Patient Care PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 62 1. Initiate body substance isolation (BSI) precautions prior to arrival at the scene for all patient contacts. Apply appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Use special care in the handling of sharps, contaminated objects, linens, etc. 2. Assure the well-being of the EMS crew by assessing scene safety. If the scene is not safe, do not enter until appropriate authorities have secured the area (i.e. violent crime calls, domestic violence calls, hazardous materials, etc.). 3. Determine the mechanism of injury, number of patients and need for additional resources. 1. Initial Assessment (Primary Survey) a) Airway: Assess airway patency and assess for possible spinal injury. b) Breathing: Assess for respiratory distress, bilateral chest expansion, rate, pattern & depth of ventilations, adequacy of gas exchange, use of accessory muscles and lung sounds. c) Circulation: Assess rate, quality & regularity of pulses, skin condition, hemodynamic status, and neck veins. Evaluate and record cardiac rhythm if indicated. d) Disability: Mini-neuro exam to include brief pupil check and assessment of mental status: A - Alert V - Not alert but responds to verbal stimuli P - Not alert but responds to painful stimuli U - Unresponsive to all stimuli e) Expose: Examine patient as indicated. 2. Focused History and Physical Exam (Secondary Survey) or Detailed Physical Exam a) Vitals signs and Glasgow Coma Score b) Chief complaint and history of present illness c) Past medical history, current medications and allergies d) Systematic head- to-toe assessment (detailed exam/secondary survey) General Patient Assessment & Initial Care Procedure Scene Size -Up General Patient Assessment PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 63 1. Airway : Establish and maintain a patient's airway by using appropriate patient positioning, airway adjuncts, suctioning and advanced airway control (intubation). 2. Breathing : Evaluate adequacy of respirations by assessing chest movement, lung sounds and skin condition. Initiate oxygen therapy if indicated and provide or assist ventilations as necessary. 3. Circulation : Evaluate perfusion status by assessing carotid and peripheral pulses and skin condition. Initiate CPR and early defibrillation if indicated. Control any external hemorrhage and establish IV access of .9% Normal Saline if indicated. No more than two (2) attempts should be made to establish an IV on scene unless requested b y Medical Control. 4. Loosen tight clothing and reassure patient; keep NPO (nothing by mouth) unless specified by SOP or Medical Control. 5. BLS/ILS Units: Initiate ALS intercept if indicated (Refer to Requesting Advanced Assistance for Optimal Patient Care ). 6. Place the patient in a semi- Fowler's (45o) position of comfort unless contraindicated. Patients with altered mental status should be placed on their side. The backboard should be tilted for immobilized patients with altered mental status to prevent aspiration. 7. Evaluate pain. Ask the patient to rate any pain on a scale of \"0 -10\" with \"0\" indicating a pain- free state and \"10\" being the worst pain imaginable. 8. Recheck and record vital signs and patient responses at least every 15 minutes for stable patients, every 5 minutes for critical patients and after each intervention. Be sure to accurately document the times the vitals were obtained. 9. Establish Medical Control contact as indicated. 10. Transport to the closest appropriate hospital. NOTE: Follow System-specific policies regarding patient destination and bypass procedures. Initial Medical Care General Patient Assessment & Initial Care Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 64 First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and establishing initial care to treat and prevent shock: 1. Open and/or maintain an open airway. 2. Loosen all tight clothing and be prepared to expose vital body regions if necessary. 3. Reassure patient by identifying yourself, explaining how you will help them and inform the patient that additional help is en route. 4. Place patient in a position of comfort. Sit patient upright unless the patient is hypotensive (BP<100mmHg systolic) or has a potential for cervical spine injury. 5. Administer Oxygen, preferably 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask. If the patient does not tolerate a mask, then administer 6 L/min by nasal cannula. 6. Ensure that EMS has been activated for further care and transport. Provide responding units with pertinent patient information. 7. Monitor the patient's level of consciousness, vital signs, etc. for any acute changes. BLS Care should be directed at conducting a thorough patient assessment, providing care to treat for shock and preparing or providing patient transportation. 1. BLS Care includes the components of First Responder Care. 2. Attach pulse oximeter and obtain analysis, if indicated. 3. Attach cardiac monitor, obtain 12-lead ECG and print rhythm strip for documentation, if indicated by smptoms *Cardiac Monitoring is not in the EMT-Basic scope of practice. 4. Initiate ALS intercept, if indicated (or ILS intercept if ALS is unavailable). 5. Simultaneously with above, perform physical exam/assessment, obtain baseline vital signs and obtain patient history. 6. Continue to reassess patient en route to the hospital. 7.

Obtai n a 12-Lead EKG as soon as possible if indicated. See 12-Lead EKG Procedure for indications. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 66 Pain, and the lack of relief from the pain, is one of the most common complaints among patients. Pain control can reduce the patient's anxiety and discomfort, making patient care easier. The patient's severity of pain must be properly assessed i n order to provide appropriate relief. Managing pain clinically in the prehospital setting will provide greater patient care. First Responder Care should focus on the reduction of the patient's anxiety due to the pain. 1. Render initial care in accordance with the Universal Patient Care Protocol. 2. Assess level of pain using the Pain Assessment Scale (0-10) or the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale . 3. Place patient in a position of comfort. 4. Reassure the patient. 5. Consider ice or splinting. 6. Reassess level of pain using the approved pain scale. BLS Care should focus on the reduction of the patient's anxiety due to the pain. 1. BLS Care includes all of the components of First Responder Care. 2. Initiate ALS intercept, if indicated. ILS Care should focus on t he reduction of the patient's anxiety due to the pain. 1. ILS Care includes all of the components of BLS Care. 2. Fentanyl : 50mcg IV, over 2 minutes for pain. Fentanyl 50mcg IV may be repeated every 5 minutes to a total of 200mcg. Fentanyl : 50mcg IM, if unable to initiate IV access. May be repeated as needed to a total of 200mcg.

Monitor respiratory status, SPO2 and or Waveform Capnography if available. Blood pressure should be monitored closely - check 5 minutes after narcotic administration (and prior to administering repeat doses). Verify that the patient is not allergic to the pharmaceutical agent prior to administration. Patients with a head injury / ALOC or patients with unstable vital signs should not receiv e pain medications . In patients with known renal failure, the Fentanyl dose must be reduced to 25mcg. The dose may be repeated one time to a maximum dose of 50mcg. Pain medication may be given IO to conscious patients experiencin g discomfort from IO inf usion. Pain Control Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 69 Traditional EMS education emphasizes utilization of oxygen therapy on most patients. Current research on supplemental oxygen use in prehospital care has identified certain conditions in which supplemental oxygen use may be HARMFUL. The American Heart Association recommended in the 2010 CPR Guidelines that: Supplemental oxygen should no longer be administered to patients with uncomplicated cardiac chest pain, and stroke patients with an oxygen saturation 94%. Rapid weaning of oxygen after Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) in cardiac arrest. Device Flow Rate Oxygen Percentage Nasal Cannula 1-6 L per minute 21 - 6-15 L per minute 60-100% Bag-Valve -Mask 15 L per minute 100% Ventilation rates for BVM or Advanced Airway: 1 breath every 6 -8 seconds (8 -10 breaths/min) Initiate during stabilization of all seriously ill or injured patients with respiratory insufficiency, suspected ischemic pain, shock, or trauma even if oxygen saturation is normal. Once patient is stabilized the oxygen may be weaned to maintain an oxygen saturation 94%. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): May administer to all patients until stable. Continue oxygen for pulmonary congestion, ongoing ischemia, or oxygen saturation < 94%. Suspected stroke and hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 94%). ROSC following resuscitation: Use the MINIMUM inspired oxygen concentration to achieve oxygen saturation 94%. Pulse oximetry may be inaccurate in low cardiac output states, with vasoconstriction, or with exposure to carbon monoxide. (Very Rare ) Observe closely when using with pulmonary patients known to be dependent on hypoxic respiratory drive. Oxygen Therapy Protocol Indications Delivery Devices Precautions PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 70 Critical Thinking Elements Oxygen directly affects most tissues it travels through by acting as a vasoconstrictor. The harmful effects of oxygen are thought to be caused by oxygen reducing coronary artery flow, and increasing coronary vascular resistance, further reducing stroke volume and cardiac output. Other adverse hemodynamic consequences of oxygen therapy through increased v ascular resistance from hyperoxia, and reperfusion injury from increased oxygen free radicals. Oxygen Therapy Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 71 Establishing and maintaining an open airway and assuring adequate ventilation is a treatment priority with all patients. Proper techniques must be used to assure treatment maneuvers do not inadvertently complicate the patient's condition. 1. Assure an open airway by utilizing either the head tilt/chin lift maneuver, the modified jaw thrust maneuver or the tongue-jaw lift maneuver. The head tilt/chin lift maneuver is NOT to be used if there is any possibility of cervical spine injury. 2. Expose the chest and visualize for chest rise and movement, simultaneously listen and feel for air movement at the mouth and nose. This procedure will need to be done initially and after correcting an obstruction and securing the airway. 3. If the chest is not rising and air exchange cannot be heard or felt: a) Deliver two positive-pressure ventilations. If resistance continues, follow AHA sequences for obstructed airway rescue. b) Reassess breathing and check for a carotid pulse. c) If spontaneous respirations return and a pulse is present, provide supplemental Oxygen by non-rebreather mask or assist respirations with bag-valve mask (BVM) at 15 L/min. d) If the patient remains breathless and a pulse is present, initiate ventilations with a BVM at 15 L/min at a rate of 12 breaths per minute. e) If the patient remains breathless and a pulse is not present, initiate CPR and institute the appropriate cardiac protocol. 4. If the patient presents with stridor, \"noisy breathing\" or snoring respirations, render treatment for partial airway obstruction in accordance with AHA guidelines. a) Reassess effectiveness of the airway maneuver. b) If initially unable to resolve partial airway obstruction, suction the airway and visualize the pharynx for any evidence of foreign objects. Perform a finger sweep if a foreign object can be seen. c) If partial airway obstruction persists, treat according to AHA guidelines for resolving a complete airway obstruction. 5. Once the obstruction has been corrected: a) Insert an oropharyngeal airway in the unconscious patient (without a gag reflex). Basic Airway Control Procedure Basic Airway Control PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 72 b) Insert a nasopharyngeal airway in the conscious patient or an unconscious patient with a gag reflex. Note : Do not use if the possibility of head injury exists. 6. Establish the presence and adequacy of breathing by observing the frequency, depth and consistency of respirations. Also, observe the chest wall for any indications of injuries which may contribute to respiratory compromise. 7. Supplemental oxygen should be delivered to any patient who exhibits signs of difficulty breathing, sensation of shortness of breath, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute, use of accessory muscles, altered level of consciousness/altered mental status, cyanosis, cardiac symptoms, head injury or any indications of shock. a) Supplemental oxygen should be provided by a non-rebreather mask (NRM) at a rate of 15 L/min (assuring reservoir bag is inflated). b) If patient is unable to tolerate the NRM, administer oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 6 L/min. 8. Bag-valve mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen at 15 L/min should be initiated at the rate of 12/min if respirations are absent, there is evidence of inadequate ventilation, respiratory rate is < 8/min, absent or diminished breath sounds or wounds to the chest wall. Critical Thinking Elements Inadequate maintenance of the patient's airway, inappropriate airway maneuvers, using inappropriately sized airway equipment and/or failure to recognize an obstructed airway will complicate the patient's condition. Do NOT use the head tilt/chin lift maneuver on a pa tient with a suspected cervical spine injury. Proper facemask seal during artificial ventilations is imperative to assure adequate ventilation. Basic Airway Control (continued) Basic Airway Control Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 73 An airway obstruction is life threatening and must be corrected immediately upon discovery. 1. If the patient has an obstructed airway and is still conscious: a) Encourage the patient to cough. b) Perform 5 abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts if the cough is unsuccessful. c) Repeat until the obstruction is relieved or the patient becomes unconscious. d) Administer oxygen at 15 L/min if the patient has a partial airway obstruction and is still able to breathe. 2. If the patient becomes unconscious: a) Open the patient's airway and attempt to ven tilate. b) Reposition the head and reattempt to ventilate if initial attempt is unsuccessful. c) Perform 30 chest compressions d) Attempt to removed object if visualized in the airway following compressions e) Repeat steps (c) and (d) if obstruction persists. f) BLS & ILS immediately initiate ALS intercept. g) ILS & ALS attempt direct extraction via laryngoscope and Magill forceps. 1. Use the laryngoscope and examine the upper airway for foreign matter and suction as needed. 2. Remove any foreign objects with forceps and suction. 3. Re-establish an open airway and attempt to ventilate. 4. If the obstruction is relieved, continue with airway control, ventilations, assessment and care. h) Continue chest compressions if unable to relieve obstruction and expedite transport. Airway Obstruction Procedure Critical Thinking Elements Maintain in -line c -spine stabilization using 2 EMTs in patients with suspected cervical spine injury. Poor abdominal thrust technique, inappropriate airway maneuvers, and/or failure to recognize an obstructed airway will complicate the patient's condition. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 74 The KING Airway is an effective airway adjunct when intubation is not available or difficult to perform. Insertion is rapid & easy and does not require specialized equipment or visualization of the larynx. It's latex-free and should be considered safe to use on latex-sensitive patients. The King LTS-D is an airway device designed for emergency or difficult intubation in the apneic or unresponsive patient without a gag reflex. Active gag reflex Patient under four (4) feet tall Patient less than 16 years old Ingestion of a caustic substance ( e.g. gasoline, drain cleaner, etc.) Known or suspected esophageal disease ( e.g. esophageal varices) Tracheostomy (ETC will be ineffective with esophageal placement) 1.

Test cuff inflation system by injecting the maximum recommended volume of air into the cuffs. Remove all air from both cuffs prior to insertion. 4. Apply a water-based lubricant ( e.g. K-Y or Surgilube) to the beveled distal tip and posterior aspect of the tube. Avoid introducing lubricant in or near the ventilatory openings. 5. Position the head in the \"sniffing position\" if possible. It can also be inserted with the head in the neutral position if following c-spine precautions/c-collar in place. 6. Hold the KING LTS-D at the connector with the dominant hand. With the non- dominant hand, hold mouth open and apply chin lift. 7. With the KING LTS-D rotated laterally 45-90o (such that the blue orientation line is touching the corner of the mouth), introduce tip into the mouth and advance behind the base of the tongue. Never force the tube into position and do not take longer than 20 seconds for the attempt! 8. As the tube tip passes under the tongue, rotate the tube back to midline (blue orientation line faces chin). 9. Without exerting excessive force, advance the KING LTS-D until the proximal opening of gastric access lumen is aligned with teeth or gums.

Inflate the cuffs with the minimum volume necessary to seal the airway (see chart). 11. Attach BVM. Gently bag the patient while assessing ventilations. Simultaneously withdraw the airway very slowly until ventilation is easy & free-flowin g. 12. Use multiple confirmation techniques: Confirm presence of breath sounds Visualize rise and fall of the chest Monitor for clinical improvement Colormetric ETCO 2 (e.g. EasyCap)** Capnography (if available) **NOTE: Ventilate the patient at least six (6) times prior to attaching a colormetric device (EasyCap). 13. The gastric access lumen allows the insertion of up to an 18 Fr diameter gastric tube into the esophagus & stomach. Lubricate the gastric tube prior to insertion. KING Airway Insertion Procedure (continued) Critical Thinking Elements If unsuccessful in one (1) attemp t, refer to the Basic Airway Control Procedure . ILS/ALS should immediately defer to the King LTS -D Airway if the pre -intubation assessment is GRADE 3 or GRADE 4 on the Cormack -Lehane scale (refer to the Advanced Airway Control Policy). Do NOT administer me dications via the King LTS -D Airway. It is designed as an airway adjunct only and cannot be utilized as a medication route. KING LTS -D Airway Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 77 The Laryngeal Mask Airway is an adjunctive airway device composed of a tube with a cuffed mask-like projection at the distal end. The LMA has proven to be very effective in the management of airway crisis. Insertion is rapid & easy and does not require specialized equipment or visualization of the larynx. The LMA is an airway device designed for emergency or difficult intubation in the apneic or unresponsive patient without a gag reflex. Active gag reflex Ingestion of a caustic substance ( e.g. gasoline, drain cleaner, etc.) Use caution with pregnant patients.

With neck flexed and head extended, press the laryngeal mask airway into the posterior pharyngeal wall using the index finger. 8. Withdraw your index finger from the pharynx while grasping the tube firmly with the other hand. Press gently downward to ensure the mask is fully inserted. 9. Inflate the mask with the recommended volume of air. Do not over-inflate the LMA Allow the mask to rise up slightly out of the hypopharynx as it is inflated to find its correct position. 10. Connect the LMA to a Bag-Valve Mask and use multiple confirmation techniques: Confirm presence of breath sounds Visualize rise and fall of the chest Monitor for clinical improvement Colormetric ETCO 2 (e.g. EasyCap)** Capnography (if available) **NOTE: Ventilate the patient at least six (6) times prior to attaching a colormetric device (EasyCap). 11. Secure the LMA utilizing the same techniques as those employed in the securing of an endotracheal tube or King LTS-D. LMA Airway Procedure (ILS & ALS ONLY) Critical Thinking Elements Failure to press the deflated ma sk up against the hard palate, inadequate lubrication or deflation can cause the mask tip to fold back on itself , pushing the epiglottis into a down -folded position causing airway obstructio n. If unsuccessful in one (1) attempt, refer to the Basic Airway Control Procedure . Do NOT administer medications via the Laryngeal Mask Airway. It is designed as an airway adjunct only and cannot be utilized as a medication route. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 79 Endotracheal intubation is an effective method of securing the airway. However, if endotracheal intubation is difficult or unsuccessful, the King LTS-D Airway should be used or basic airway control measures re-established without delay. 1. Implement basic airway measures in accordance with the Basic Airway Control Procedure . 2. Conduct a pre-intubation assessment using the Cormack-Lehane scale: GRADE 1 GRADE 2 GRADE 3 GRADE 4 3. Consider using a Bougie (See Endotracheal Tube Introducer Procedure) 4. Select the proper tube size (based on patient size) and attach a 10mL syringe. Inflate the cuff to be sure it does not leak (the cuff must be deflated prior to insertion). 5. Insert stylet and bend to the approximate configuration of the pharynx. 6. Lubricate the ETT with a water-soluble lubricant. 7. Have suction, BVM, stethoscope, colormetric end-tidal CO 2 detector/capnography and commercial ETT holder readily available. 8. Pick up the laryngoscope handle with your left hand and the appropriate blade with your right hand. Advanced Airway Contro l Policy (ILS & ALS Only) Advanced Airway Control Procedure If the pre -intubation assessment is GRADE 3 or GRADE 4 , do not attempt intubation. Proceed to insertion of King LTS -D Airway or return to basic airway control measures using a BVM with OPA or NPA. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 80 9. Holding the blade parallel to the handle, attach the blade to the handle by inserting the U-shaped indentation of the blade into the small bar at the end of the handle. When the indentation is aligned with the bar, press the blade forward and snap into place. 10. Lower the blade until it is at a right angle to the handle. The light should come on. If it does not, see if the bulb is tight and/or the batteries need to be replaced (This should be done on a daily basis so you do not have to spend valuable time fixing it at the scene of a call). 11. Suction the pharynx as needed. 12. Pre-oxygenate the patient with high concentration oxygen prior to intubation attempt. 13. Insert the blade into the mouth on the right side, moving the tongue to the left. Follo w the natural contour of the pharynx, lifting the tongue (not prying) until you can see the glottic opening. a) If you are using a straight blade (Miller), insert it until you can see the epiglottis. With the tip of the blade, lift up on the epiglottis so that you can visualize the vocal cords and glottic opening. If needed, have someone gently press down on the cricoid cartilage (Sellick Maneuver) so that you can see the cords well. b) If you are using a curved blade (Macintosh), insert the tip into the vallecula and lift up. This will lift the epiglottis and expose the vocal cords and glottic opening. If needed, have someone gently press down on the cricoid cartilage (Sellick Maneuver) so that you can see the cords well. 14. After visualizing the glottic opening, grasp the ETT with your right hand and advance the tube from the right corner of the mouth. Insert the tube into the glottic opening between the vocal cords, just far enough to pass the cuff of the tube past the opening. 15. Verify proper position by ventilating the patient through the tube with a bag-valve device while listening to each side of the chest with a stethoscope to be sure air is entering both lungs. Also, check for inadvertent esophageal intubation by listening for air movement in the epigastric area during ventilations. Advanced Airway Control Procedure (continued) Advanced Airway Control Policy (ILS & ALS Only) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 81 16. Utilize a colormetric end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) detector or capnography. 17. If breath sounds are heard on both sides of the chest, no epigastric sounds are heard colormetric ETCO 2 detector/capnography indicate proper placement, inflate the cuff with 10mL of air and secure the tube with a commercial ETT holder. a) If you have inserted the ETT too far, it will usually go into the right main stem bronchus. Therefore, if you hear breath sounds only on the right, you should pull the tube back \u00bd inch at a time until you hear bilateral breath sounds. Inflate the cuff with 10mL of air and secure the ETT with a commercial holder. b) If you hear no breath sounds, you are in the esophagus and must remove the ETT immediately. Ventilate patient and proceed to King LTS-D Airway insertion or continue basic airway control measures. 18. Frequently reassess breath sounds to be sure that the ETT is still in place. 19. Ventilate the patient at a rate of 12 times per minute. 20. If intubation is unsuccessful after one (1) attempt, refer to the KING LTS-D Airway Procedure or Basic Airway Control Procedure. Any type of airway manipulation may be dangerous during airway control of the suspected spinal injury patient. Maintain in-line stabilization and refer to the KING LTS-D Airway Procedure . Do not attempt to intubate . 1. A minimum of two (2) trained rescuers is needed to assure special attention to spinal precautions. 2. One rescuer will apply manual in-line stabilization by placing the rescuers hands about the patient's ears with the little fingers under the occipital skull and the thumbs on the face over the maxillary sinuses. 3. The rescuer performing airway placement should be at the head. 4. Maintain the patient's head in a neutral position and place the KING LTS- D without cervical manipulation. Airway Control in the Trauma Patient Advanced Airway Control Procedure (continued) Advanced Airway Control Policy (ILS & ALS Only) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 82 Attempting difficult and unfamiliar procedures poses a danger to the patients those procedures are being performed on. Certain procedures that are used in the hospital setting are not approved for prehospital personnel in the Peoria Area EMS System. These include: Extubation Nasotracheal Intubation Percutaneous Transtracheal Ventilation Cricothyrotomy/Surgical Airway Prohibited Advanced Airway Procedures in the PAEMS System Critical Thinking Elements Intubation may be attempted if the pre -intubation assessment is GRADE 1 or GRADE 2. If intubation attempt fails (1 attempt), switch to the King LTS -D airway or basic airway control. The definition of an \"attempt\" is actually trying to pass the ET tube through the vocal chords. Verification of proper ETT placement is of vital importance. Utilize multiple methods of verifying placement including direct visualization of the ETT passing through the cords, auscultation of bilateral breath sounds, absence of epigastric sounds during ventilation, and positive color change (purple to yellow) with ETCO 2 or capnography levels between 35 -45mmHg. Document findings. Advanced Airway Control Policy (ILS & ALS Only) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 83 Patient meets clinical indications for endotracheal intubation. Pre-intubation assessment predicts a difficult intubation. Introducer larger than the endotracheal tube internal diameter. 1. Prepare, position and oxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen. 2. Select proper ET tube without stylet, test cuff and prepare suction. 3. Lubricate the distal end and cuff of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and the distal \u00bd of the Endotracheal Introducer (Bougie) - (note: Failure to lubricate the Bougie and the ETT may result in being unable to pass the ETT). 4. Using laryngoscopic techniques, visualize the vocal cords if possible using the BURP method as needed. 5. Introduce the Bougie with curved tip anteriorly and visualize the tip passing the vocal cords or above the arytenoids if the cords cannot be visualized. 6. Once inserted, gently advance the Bougie until you meet resistance or \"hold -up\" (if you do not meet resistance you have a probable esophageal intubation and insertion should be reattempted or manage the airway using a BIAD). 7. Withdraw the Bougie ONLY to a d epth sufficient to allow passage of the ETT while maintaining proximal control of the Bougie. 8. Maintain a firm grasp on the proximal Bougie, introduce the ET tube over the Bougie. 9. Gently advance the Bougie and loaded ET tube until you have hold-up again, thereby assuring tracheal placement and minimizing the risk of accidental displacement of the Bougie. 10. If you are unable to advance the ETT into the trachea and the Bougie and ETT are adequately lubricated, withdraw the ETT slightly and rotate the ETT 90 degree s COUNTER clockwise to turn the bevel of the ETT posteriorly. If this technique fails to facilitate passing of the ETT you may attempt direct laryngoscopy while advancing the ETT (this will require an assistant to maintain the position of the Bougie and, once the vocal cords are visualized, advance the ETT). 11. Once the ETT is correctly placed, hold the ET tube securely and remove the Bougie. 12. Confirm tracheal placement according to the intubation protocol, inflate the cuff with 3 to 10 cc of air, auscultate for equal breath sounds and reposition accordingly.

Post intubation Patient shall remain on cardiac monitor, pulse oximeter, and waveform capnography until care is transferred to the emergency department staff. If patient exhibits movement that may lead to extubation, administer one of the following: Midazolam 0.2mg/kg IV push. May repeat once to obtain necessary sedation. Total amount of Midazolam must not exceed 8mg. Fentanyl 2mcg/kg slow IV push (over 1-2 minutes). May repeat once to obtain necessary sedation. Total amount of Fentanyl must not exceed 150mcg. Medication Facilitated Intubation (ALS with Medical Control Order Only) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 87 Indication for orogastric (OG) tube placement in the Peoria Area EMS System is: Gastric decompression of an adult cardiac arrest patient after endotracheal intubation has been performed and placement verified ; OR with use of the KING LTS-D Airway. Known esophageal varices Esophageal stricture Esophageal or stomach cancer Esophagectomy or partial gastrectomy Gastric bypass Penetrating neck trauma 1. Estimate the length of the tube needed to reach the stomach by measuring the tube from the corner of the mouth to the earlobe and down to the xiphoid process. Mark the length with tape. 2. Lubricate the Salem sump tube (18F) with a water soluble lubricant ( e.g. K Y Jelly). 3. Insert the tube through the oropharynx or through the gastric access lumen on the KING LTS-D Airway until the marked depth is reached. 4. If the tube coils in the posterior pharynx, direct laryngoscopy can be utilized to place the tube in the esophagus. 5. Verify placement (see OG Placement Verification ). Indication Orogastric (OG) Tube Insertion Procedure Contraindications OG Insertion Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 88 1. Using a 60mL catheter tip syringe, instill 30mL of air into tube and auscultate over epigastrim for air sounds. 2. Aspirate for gastric contents and assess for cloudy, green, tan, brown, bloody or off- white color contents consistent with gastric contents. 3. Secure tube with tape. Once placement of the Salem sump tube has been verified, begin gastric decompression in one of the following manners: 1. Attach the tube to portable suction (and suction intermittently as needed). 2. Attach the tube to the onboard suction (and suction intermittently as needed). 3. Attach the tube to continual low suction (approximately 60 mmHg) using the onboard suction. 4. If suction is not readily available, connect the 60mL syringe to the tube while keeping the (blue) air vent patient. This will allow the sump function of the tube to work until suction can be applied and will also prevent gastric contents from leaking from the tube. Orogastric (OG) Tube Insertion Procedure OG Placement Verification Gastric Decompressi on Critical Thinking Elements If you cannot place the OG tube quickly (no more than 2 attempts), forego the procedure - do not delay transport . The blue air vent must remain patent to ensure proper sump function and to prevent damage to the gastric lini ng during suctioning. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 89 Intravenous cannulation is used in the Prehospital setting to establish a route for drug administration and/or to provide fluid replacement. Intravenous cannulation should not significantly delay scene times or be attempted while on scene with a trauma patient who meets load-and-go criteria. 1. Explain to the patient the need for and a brief description of the procedure. 2. Observe the universal precautions for body substance exposure. 3. Obtain an appropriately sized catheter: a) 14 or 16 gauge for trauma patients. b) 14, 16 or 18 gauge for fluid replacement. c) 20 gauge for elderly patients, pediatric patients or for difficult IV cannulations. 4. Check the fluid (1000mL .9% Normal Saline): a) Is it the right fluid? b) Check the expiration date. c) Check for color and clarity (NS should be clear with no particles). 5. Connect the administration set to the IV fluid. Make sure that air bubbles are expelled from the tubing and that all chambers have the appropriate fluid levels. 6. Maintain a clean environment and protect the administration set from contamination. 7. Apply a venous tourniquet just proximal to the antecubital area. 8. Select (by palpation) a prominent vein. Choose a distal vein on the forearm or back of the hand. The antecubital space may be used if needed for drug administration, fluid replacement, the patient condition requires a more proximal site, or in cases where no other vein is accessible. 9. Cleanse the site with an alcohol prep pad using a circular motion moving outward from the site. 10. Stabilize the vein by applying traction below the puncture site. 11. Inform the patient of your intent to puncture the site. 12. Enter the vein directly from above or from the side of the site. With the bevel of the needle upward, puncture the skin at a 30 to 45 degree angle. 13. If blood returns through the catheter, proceed with insertion. If you do not see blood return, release the tourniquet and discontinue the attempt. It time and patient condition allows, you may attempt another site with a new catheter (do not exceed more than two (2) attempts). 14. Insert the catheter. Carefully lower the catheter and advance the needle and catheter just enough to stabilize the needle in the vein. Slide the catheter off of the needle into the vein. 15. Slightly occlude the vein proximal to the catheter with gentle finger pressure. Remove the needle and immediately dispose of it in an approved sharps container. 16. Release the tourniquet and connect the administration set to the catheter. 17. Open the flow regulator on the administration set and briefly allow IV fluid to run freely to assure a patent line (less than 20mL). If the line is patent, adjust flow rate as indicated by protocol or Medical Control order. 18. Secure the catheter and tubing using a veniguard or tape. Loop the IV tubing and secure to the patient's arm. Do not apply tape circumferentially to the extremity. Intravenous Cannulation Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 90 Saline locks may be used if fluid replacement is not indicated: 1. Assemble the pre-filled saline and tubex syringe or draw up 2-3mL of sterile saline. 2. Obtain and inspect an injection site link. Inject saline and expel air from the injection site chamber leaving the syringe attached. 3. After successful venipuncture, connect the saline lock to the catheter. 4. Pull back (aspirate) on the syringe to confirm placement by observing for blood return. If blood is aspirated, continue by injecting 3mL of saline into the chamber. If no blood is aspirated, discontinue the attempt and prepare to repeat the procedure at a new site. 5. If fluid replacement becomes necessary, attach an administration set to the injection port by needleless device or Luer adapter. 6. Secure the catheter and link using a veniguard or tape. External Jugular (EJ) access can be utilized only if traditional extremity cannulation cannot be established and the patient requires immediate stabilizing fluid replacement and/or drug administration route. 1. Position the patient supine with feet elevated. 2. Turn the patient's head i n the direction away from the side to be cannulated. 3. Cleanse the site with a prep pad using a circular motion moving away from the site. 4. Stabilize the vein by applying traction just above the clavicle. 5. Attach a 10mL syringe to the IV catheter. Align the catheter and point the tip of it toward the patient's feet. 6. Enter the vein midway between the angle of the jaw and the clavicle. With the bevel of the needle upward, puncture the skin using a 30 degree angle and aim toward the shoulder on the same side. 7. As you enter the vein, apply gentle aspiration by pulling on the syringe plunger. If blood returns through the flash chamber and syringe, proceed with insertion. Slightly occlude the vein proximal to the catheter with gentle finger pressure. Connect the administration set to the catheter and secure the site. If you do not see blood return through the flash chamber and syringe, discontinue the attempt. Only one (1) attempt at EJ vein cannulation may be made in the Prehospital setting. Saline Locks Jugular Vein Cannulation ( ALS ) Intravenous Cannulation Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 91 Critical Thinking Elements If blood begins to back -flow in the IV t ubing, check the location of the bag to assure it is in a gravity flow position and check to assure all valves are properly set. If the IV equipment is properly set and blood continues to back -flow, re -examine the vessel to assure arterial cannulation has not occurred. Edema, pain and lack of fluid flow at the site indicates infiltration and the IV must be discontinued. Do not partially withdraw a needle and reinsert into the catheter. This can cause catheter shear. Do not substitute a saline lock for IV fluids in trauma patients, patients who are in shock, patients with unstable vital signs or patients requiring multiple drug administrations. External jugular vein cannulation is contraindicated in patients with suspected cervical spine injury. Intravenous Cannulation Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 92 It may be impossible to find an accessible vein in patients presenting with conditions such as shock from any cause, cardiac arrest, overdose with airway compromise, impairment in mentation or hemodynamic parameters, severe dehydration associated with unresponsiveness or shock and multi-system trauma. This is a challenge commonly faced by prehospital providers, which hinders optimal patient care by limiting treatment options and increasing scene time trying to obtain vascular access. The intraosseous space may be viewed as a non-collapsible, easily accessed space for any fluid or medication. Intraosseous infusion is preferred over endotracheal routes of medication administration and is a viable alternative when IV therapy is not available or not accessible. Intraosseous infusion is immediately available, safe and effective. 1. Intravenous fluids and medications are emergently needed, a peripheral IV cannot be established in two (2) attempts AND the patient demonstrates one of the following: An altered mental status (GCS of 8 or less) with loss of protective airway reflexes (with notable exception of known diabetic with symptomatic hypoglycemia) Clinical signs of shock from any cause (hypovolemia from severe dehydration or trauma, cardiogenic, anaphylactic, septic or Neurogenic) with a systolic BP less than 80mmHg Patients in extremis (at risk of death or disability) with immediate need for delivery of medications and fluids ( e.g. multi-system trauma, anaphylaxis, status asthmaticus, status or bradycardia, severe respiratory distress with hypoxia and/or alteration in consciousness, respiratory arrest, and overdose associated with alteration in vital signs, mental status and/or dysrhythmia) If a patient is assessed to be in need of intraosseous access and does not fit any of the above, contact Medical Control for further guidance and orders. 2. EZ-IO insertion may be considered PRIOR to peripheral IV attempts if the patient is in cardiac arrest (medical or traumatic). 1. Fracture of the bone selected for IO infusion (consider another approved site of insertion) 2. Excessive tissue at insertion site with absence of anatomical landmarks (consider another approved site of insertion) 3. Previous significant orthopedic procedures (i.e. prosthesis or hardware placement) (consider another approved site of insertion). 4. Infection at the site selected for insertion (consider another approved site of insertion) Adult Intr aosseous Cannulation Procedure (ALS Only) Indications Contraindications PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 93 Flow rates will be slower than achieved with intravenous (IV) access. To improve continuous infusion rates, use a pressure infusion bag (or BP cuff). Insertion of the EZ-IO in conscious patients or patients responsive to pain has been noted to cause mild to moderate discomfort comparable to the insertion of a large bore IV catheter. IO infusion, however, has been noted to cause severe discomfort. 1. Observe universal precautions. 2. Prepare the EZ-IO driver and needle set: a) 15ga, 15mm long needle for patients weighing between 3kg and 39kg. b) 15ga, 25mm long needle for patients weighing greater than 40kg. c) 15ga. 45mm long needle for patients with excess tissue (optional). 3. Locate an appropriate insertion site. Approved with Betadine and set up infusion solution as for regular IV. 5. Stabilize site and insert appropriate needle set. 6. Remove EZ-IO driver from needle set while stabilizing catheter hub. 7. Remove stylet from the catheter; place stylet in EZ-IO shuttle or approved sharps container. 8. Attach 5-10mL syringe and aspirate bone marrow to confirm placement. a) IO catheter should be at a 90 degree angle and firmly seated in the tibial bone. b) Blood may be visible at the tip of the stylet. c) The IO catheter should flush freely without difficulty or extravasation. 9. Connect the luer-lock equipped IV administration set. 10. For conscious patients (or for previously unresponsive patients who become conscious): Lidocaine: 30mg IO (slowly) to reduce discomfort from infusion. 11. Flush the IO catheter with 10mL of normal saline. 12. Utilize a pressure bag for continuous infusions where applicable. If a pressure bag is not available, wrap a BP cuff around the bag of normal saline and inflate the cuff until desired flow rate is achieved. 13. Dress site, secure tubing and apply wristband as directed. Considerations EZ-IO Procedure Adult Intraosseous Cannulation Procedure (ALS Only) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 94 14. If needed, further manage the patient's pain by using one of the following medications. Morphine Sulfate 2-5 mg IV every 5 minutes to reduce the patient's anxiety and severity of pain. If unable to establish IV access, may administer Morphine 2 -5 mg IM every 15 minutes . Fentanyl 50 mcg IV, over 2 minutes for pain. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV may be repeated every 5 minutes to a total of 200 mcg. If unable to establish IV access , may administe r Fentanyl 50 mcg IM or IN. May be repeated as needed to a total of 200 mcg. (See dosing sheets for IN) 15. Closely monitor EZ-IO site en route. Critical Thin king Elements If respiratory depression or hypotension occurs after administration of Dilaudid or Fentanyl, ventilate the patient as necessary and administer Narcan. Monitor respiratory status, SPO2 and or Waveform Capnography if available. Do not use an area previously used for IO attempts. Sometimes marrow cannot be aspirated and does not necessarily indicate improper placement. Excessive movement of the IO needle may result in leakage. Do not place more than one IO unless absolutely necessary.

Initiate ALS intercept if the patient's chest pain is not eliminated with Oxygen or NTG. Consider the patient to be in cardiogenic shock if the patient has dyspnea, diaphoresis, a systolic BP < 100mmHg, and signs of congestive heart failure. Obtaining a 12 -Lead EKG should not significantly delay initiation of transport. EKG limb leads should actually be placed on the patient's limbs ! A pulse oximeter is a tool to aid in determining the degre e of patient distress and the effectiveness of EMS interventions. A high pulse oximeter reading should not result in oxygen therapy being withheld. NTG that the patient self administers prior to EMS arrival should be reported to Medical Control. Subseque nt doses should be provided by the EMS unit's stock. Medications should not be administered IM to a suspected AMI patient . Nitro paste can be placed on the patient's upper back instead of the anterior chest if needed (e.g. if the patient has excessive ches t hair).

ILS Care ALS Care Cardiogenic Shock Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 107 The successful resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest is dependent on a systematic approach of initiating life-saving CPR and early defibrillation and transferring care to advanced life support providers in a timely manner. The majority of adults who survive non-traumatic cardiac arrest are resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation with defibrillation. The primary factor for successful defibrillation and resuscitation is decreasing the time interval from onset of cardiac arrest to effective CPR, defibrillation and advanced life support. First Responder Care should be focused on confirming that the patient is in full arrest and in need of CPR. Resuscitative efforts should be initiated by opening the airway and initiating ventilations & chest compressions while attaching a defibrillator. It is important to assure that CPR is being performed correctly following AHA guidelines. 1. Determine unresponsiveness. Confirm that a transporting unit (and ALS intercept) has been activated. 2. Check for pulse (10 seconds). If pulseless, begin CPR . CPR should start with compressions at a rate of 100/min with a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations for 5 cycles (2 minutes) 3. Apply an AED after 2 minutes of CPR to determine if defibrillation is needed. 4. Continue CPR until the AED is attached and turned on. Stop CPR when the AED is analyzing: a) If the AED indicates \"SHOCK ADVISED\", call out \" CLEAR! \" check for the safety of others, and push the SHOCK button (or stand clear if the AED device does not require shock activation). b) Immediately resume CPR (starting with compressions) for 5 cycles (2 minutes). c) Reassess the patient and allow the AED to analyze. d) If the AED indicates \"SHOCK ADVISED\", call out \" CLEAR! \" check for the safety of others, and push the SHOCK button (or stand clear if the AED device does not require shock activation). e) Check for a pulse if the AED states \"NO SHOCK ADVISED\". f) Continue CPR if pulse is absent . g) Reassess every 2 minutes . Shock if indicated. h) If the patient regains a pulse at any time during resuscitation, then maintain the airway and assist ventilations. i) Re-analyze the patient's rhythm with the AED if the patient returns to a pulseless state. Shock if indicated. 5. Narcan : 2mg IN (1mg per nostril) for suspected or known narcotic overdose. 6. Immediately turn patient care over to the transporting provider or ALS intercept crew upon their arrival. 7. Complete all necessary cardiac arrest documentation.

Do not touch, ventilate or move the patient while the AED is analyzing. Do not exceed three (3) shocks on scene without contacting Medical Control. Patients with implanted pacemakers or implanted defibrillators ( AICDs) are treated the same way as any other patient; however do not place the electrodes, Quick Combo pads or Fast Patches over the top of the pacemaker or AICD site. Treat the patient - not the monitor . A rhythm present on the monitor screen should NOT be used to determine pulse . If the monitor shows a rhythm and the patient has no pulse, begin CPR (the patient is in PEA - pulseless electrical activity ). Trauma patients in cardiac arrest should be evaluated for viability. If the patient is to be resusc itated, begin CPR and LOAD & GO. When changing to ALS monitoring equipment, attach defibrillation cables prior to disconnecting the AED. Resuscitation and treatment decisions are based on the duration of the arrest, physical exam and the patient's medical history. Consider cease -effort orders if indicated.

Possible Causes of Pulseless Electrical Electrical Activit y / Asystole Resuscitation of Pulseless Rhythms Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 118 Unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other interventions may be discontinued prior to transport when this procedure is followed. Allow for the discontinuation of pre-hospital resuscitation after the delivery of adequate and appropriate resuscitation efforts to minimize the use of emergency transport for a patient who has extremely limited to no chance of meaningful, neurologically intact recovery. During resuscitation efforts if any of the following circumstances arise PAEMS providers may terminate the resuscitation process following consultation with Medical Control. Prolonged resuscitation efforts (either BLS alone or combined BLS and ALS) beyond 15 minutes without a return of spontaneous circulation or shockable rhythm are usually futile, unless cardiac arrest is compounded by hypothermia, submersion in cold water. Full ACLS has been instituted (ALS/ILS) to include rhythm analysis and defibrillation if indicated, appropriate airway management, and three rounds of the appropriate ACLS medications are given without return of spontaneous circulation. Extrication is prolonged (>15 minutes) in a pulseless, apneic patient, with no resuscitation possible during extrication (hypothermia is an exception). Patient has a valid DNR where resuscitation efforts were initiated prior to knowledge of resuscitation status. Correctable causes or special resuscitation circumstances have been considered and addressed. Per family request. Notes: Document all elements of patient care and interactions with the patient's family, personal physician, medical examiner, law enforcement and medical control in the EMS patient care report (PCR). Termination of Resuscitation Purpose: Policy: Procedure: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 119 Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than sixty beats per minute (< 60 bpm). Determining the stability of the patient with bradycardia is an important factor in patient care decisions. The assessment of the patient with bradycardia should include evaluation for signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion. The patient is considered stable if the patient is asymptomatic (i.e. alert and oriented with warm, dry skin and a systolic BP > 100mmHg). The patient is considered unstable if he/she presents with: An altered level of consciousness (ALOC). Diaphoresis. Dizziness. Chest pain or discomfort. Ventricular ectopy. Hypotension (systolic BP < 100mmHg). First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating Universal patient care to treat for shock. 1. Render initial care in accordance with the Universal Patient Care Protocol . 2. Oxygen : 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask or 6 L/min via nasal cannula if the patient does not tolerate a mask.

May repeat 0.5mg IV/IO every 5 minutes (with Medical Control order) up to a total of 3mg. 6. Immediate Transcutaneous Pacing : If the patient is in a 3rd degree AV blocks ( or in a Type II 2nd degree AV block unresponsive to Atropine). Target heart rate should be set at 70 bpm . Current should be set at minimum to start and increased until capture is achieved. Refer to the Transcutaneous Pacing Procedure for additional information. 7. Midazolam (Versed) : 2mg IV/IO for patient comfort after pacing is initiated. Re- check vital signs 5 minutes after administration. May repeat dose one time if systolic BP > 100mmHg and respiratory rate is > 10 rpm. Additional doses require Medical Control order. Midazolam (Versed) : Intranasal if unable to obtain IV access. ( See intranasal dosing sheet ). 8. Dopamine : If the patient remains hypotensive. Begin infusion at 24gtts/min. Increase by 12gtts/min every 2 minutes to achieve and maintain a systolic BP of at least 100mmHg. Closely monitor vital signs. Dopamine is provided premixed (400mg in 250mL D 5W). This yields a concentration of 1600mcg/mL. The initial rate of infusion is 1-10mcg/kg/min which can be achieved with a 24gtts/min infusion rate.

Unstable/Stable Bradycardia Protocol Critical Thinking Elements Monitor respiratory status, SPO2 and or Waveform Capnography if available if Versed or Ativan is given. Treat the patient - not the monitor. Bradycardia does not necessarily mean that the patient is unstable or requires intervention. Treat underlying etiologies according to protocol. Atropine is NOT to be given if the patient's blood press ure is normal or elevated . Bradycardia may be present due to increased intracranial pressure from a stroke or head injury . Contact Medical Control. Factors to consider during the assessment of the patient who presents with bradycardia include: patient health & physical condition ( e.g. an athlete), current medications ( e.g. beta blockers), trauma or injury related to the event ( e.g. a head trauma patient exhibiting signs of herniation or Cushing's response ), and other medical history. Assess underlyi ng causes ( e.g. hypoxia, hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or overdose). Fluid bolus should not delay Atropine administration or TCP if the patient is unstable. If the patient's presenting rhythm is a 3rd degree block, immediately prepare to pace. If the patient is symptomatic, pacing should be started without delay.

If the AICD is malfunctioning, alert Medical Control as early as possible so that a round magnet can be available upon arrival. If a patient is unres ponsive and pulseless, CPR must be initiated. If the AED recognizes a shockable rhythm, the shock should be delivered (even though the patient has an AICD). Avoid placing the Quick Combo pad or Fast Patches directly over the AICD unit as this could damage the device and reduce the efficacy of external defibrillation. Slightly alter pad placement if initial defibrillation is unsuccessful. In patients with known renal failure, the Fentanyl dose must be reduced to 25mcg. The dose may be repeated one time to a maximum dose of 50mcg. An implanted cardiac defibrillator (AICD) is a device that delivers an internal defibrillation (shock) whenever the patient's heart rate exceeds defined limits for > 10 seconds. Persons in contact with the patient at the time the device delivers the defibrillation will receive a shock of approximately 3 Joules. This energy level constitutes NO DANGER to EMS personnel.

It is a vital link in the chain of survival in the case of sudden death. Defibrillation is accomplished by passage of an appropriate electrical current through the heart, sufficient to depolarize a critical mass of the left ventricle. 1. Two (2) minutes of CPR should be performed prior to defibrillation attempts. 2. Turn on the monitor/defibrillator. 3. Apply the Quick Combo pads or Fast Patches with cables as soon as possible. The pads must be attached to the defibrillator cables prior to placement on the patient' s chest. 4. The negative electrode should be placed to the right of the upper sternum just below the right clavicle and the positive electrode should be placed laterally to the left nipple in the midaxillary line (approximately 2-3 inches below the left armpit). 5. For adults, defibrillate per manufacturer's recommendations for biphasic monitors (or 360 Joules for monophasic monitors). If using paddles instead of pads, 25 pounds of pressure must be applied to each paddle when defibrillating . 6. Make sure no personnel are directly or indirectly in contact with the patient. Emphasize your intention to defibrillate by loudly stating \"CLEAR!\" and then deliver the shock. 7. Immediately perform 2 minutes of CPR and re-evaluate patient/rhythm. 8. If patient remains in V-fib or pulseless V-tach, defibrillate per manufacturer's recommendations for biphasic monitors (or 360 Joules for monophasic monitors). 9. Immediately perform 2 minutes of CPR and re-evaluate patient/rhythm every 2 minutes. 10. Follow appropriate protocols for rhythm changes. Manual Defibrillation Procedure Critical Thinking Elements Patients with AICDs or pacemakers are treated the same as any other patient. However, do not place the electrodes (defibrillation pads) over the AICD or pacemaker site. Adjust the pads as necessary. Anterior -posterior placement may be necessary. Position the positive pad on the anterior chest just to the left of the sternum and place the negative pad posteriorly just to the left of the spinal column. Shocks delivered to the pa tient prior to arrival should be taken into consideration during the transition of care. Crews may want to utilize the AED equipment and personnel for subsequent defibrillation. If the cardiac arrest is witnessed by EMS personnel, start CPR and defibrilla te immediately after Fast Patches or Quick Combos are placed.

Defibrillation is accomplished by passage of an appropriate electrical current through the heart, sufficient to depolarize a critical mass of the left ventricle. 1. Two (2) minutes of CPR should be performed prior to defibrillation attempts. 2. The AED should be applied using adult pads if the patient has no pulse and is breathless. Pediatric pads should be used on children between ages 1-8 (or adult pads in the anterior/posterior position if pediatric pads are unavailable). 3. Turn the AED on. 4. Apply the Quick Combo pads or Fast Patches with cables as soon as possible. The pads must be attached to the defibrillator cables prior to placement on the patient's chest. 5. The negative electrode should be placed to the right of the upper sternum just below the right clavicle and the positive electrode should be placed laterally to the left nipple in the midaxillary line (approximately 2-3 inches below the left armpit). 6. Make sure no personnel are directly or indirectly in contact with the patient when the AED is analyzing. Emphasize your intention to a nalyze by loudly stating, \"CLEAR! ANAYLYZING!\" and analyze in accordance with product specifications. 7. If the AED indicates \" SHOCK ADVISED \", call out \"CLEAR!\" check for the safety of others and push the shock button. 8. Immediately perform 2 minutes of CPR and re -evaluate patient/rhythm. 9. If patient remains in V-fib or pulseless V-tach, defibrillate per manufacturer's recommendations for a biphasic AED (or 360 Joules for a monophasic AED). 10. Immediately perform 2 minutes of CPR and re-evaluate patient/rhythm every 2 minutes. 11. If the patient regains a pulse at any time during resuscitation, then maintain the airway and assist ventilations. 12. Re-analyze the patient's rhythm with the AED if the patient returns to a pulseless state. Shock if indicated. 13. Immediately turn care over to the transporting provider or ALS intercept crew upon their arrival. 14. Complete all necessary documentation. Automated Defibrillation Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 136 Critical Thinking Elements If the cardiac arrest is witnessed by EMS personnel, start CPR and defibrillate immediately after Fast Patches or Quick Combos are placed. If a pulse is felt at any time, transport the patient without delay. Maintain frequent pulse checks. If at any time you cannot find a pulse, push \"ANALYZE\" and/or repeat the AED procedure for analyzing. If onl y 1 rescuer is available with an AED: verify unresponsiveness, open the airway, give 2 breaths & check pulse. If cardiac arrest is confirmed, attach the AED and proceed with the algorithm. DO NOT analyze or shock in a moving ambulance ! Automated Defibrillation Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 137 It is recognized that early defibrillation is a very important treatment for the cardiac arrest patient. A smooth transition of care between providers is both encouraged & expected and is essential for optimum patient care. 1. Arriving EMS personnel should ask for a quick report from the AED user and perform a rapid assessment. 2. AED personnel can be utilized to provide defibrillation during the arrest. However, if the manual mode is activated, ILS/ALS personnel must then operate the defibrillator. Arriving EMS personnel are encouraged to utilize AED responders for efficiency in coordinating patient care. 3. Situations when the AED may need to be removed immediately (and ALS monitor applied) include: patients needing transcutaneous pacing, patients needing synchronized cardioversion or in the event a spontaneous pulse returns. 4. When changing to manual defibrillation, attach cables to the patient prior to disconnecting the AED. Transition of AE D Care Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 138 Electrical cardioversion is the therapy of choice for hemodynamically unstable ventricular or supraventricular tachydysrhythmias with a pulse. Synchronization of the delivered energy reduces the potential for induction of V-fib that can occur when electrical energy impinges on the relative refractory period of the cardiac cycle. 1. Apply Quick Combo pads or Fast Patches according to protocol and apply regular limb leads. 2. Push the synchronize sensor button on the defibrillator. 3. Confirm that the monitor is sensing \"R\" waves on the monitor screen (this is denoted by the darker mark on the screen with each complex). 4. Select the appropriate energy setting: 100J, 200J, 300J, 360J (or biphasic equivalent). 5. Press the charge button. 6. Depress the discharge buttons simultaneously and wait for the shock to be delivered. 7. Note the rhythm and treat according to the appropriate protocol. 8. If the patient becomes pulseless at any time, turn off the synchronizer circuit and refer to the Resuscitation of Pulseless Rhythms Protocol . Cardioversion Procedure Critical Thinking Elements The energy levels vary in accordance with protocol for the presenting rhythm. Administration of Versed IV/IO or IN may be necessary. The synchronizer circuit MUST be activated. There ma y be a delay between pressing the discharge buttons and delivery of the countershock due to the synchronization process. You must apply the limb leads so the monitor can sense the rhythm and deliver the shock at the same time. PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 139 Transcutaneous pacing (TCP) is used to deliver an electrical stimulus to the heart that acts as a substitute for the heart's conduction system and is intended to result in cardiac depolarization and myocardial contraction. TCP should be utilized for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, namely Type II 2nd Degree AV Block and 3rd Degree AV Block (Complete Heart Block). 1. Confirm the presence of the arrhythmia and the patient's hypoperfusion status. 2. Initiate Routine ALS Care , including application of the cardiac monitor using the regular limb leads. 3. Apply the pacing pads to the patient using anterior-posterior placement. Place the negative electrode on the anterior chest between the sternum and left nipple (the upper edge of the pad should be below the nipple line).

ALS Care CHF / Pulmonary Edema (continued) Respiratory Distress Protocol ILS Care (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 148 Critical Thinking Elements Solu-Medrol should NOT be administered to p atients with fever, hyperglycemia, and who have the signs and symptoms of sepsis. Constant reassessment of the respiratory distress patient is imperative to assure that the patient has adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Closely monitor the patient's re sponse to treatment rendered. Patients in respiratory distress should be transported in an upright position to assist their respiratory effort. CPAP is very effective in the treatment of CHF / Pulmonary Edema and should be applied as soon as possible unles s contraindicated. CPAP should not be initiated on patients with a systolic BP < 90mmHg. CPAP increases intrathoracic pressure and can decrease venous return to the heart (compromising the patient's perfusion). Consult with Medical Control and use CPAP c autiously if the systolic BP is between 90-100mmHg for the same reason. Do not delay CPAP application for administration of Nitroglycerin ( i.e. you do not need to wait until all three (3) doses of NTG SL have been administered before applying CPAP). Respiratory Distress Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 149 CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) can be applied to achieve PEEP (Peak End Expiratory Pressure) for any adult patient presenting with respiratory distress.

If the systolic BP is between 90-100mmHg, contact Medical Control prior to initiating treatement. 3. Connect generator to oxygen outlet and adjust flow rate to desired PEEP 4. Apply and secure mask to the patient's face 5. Treat continuously while en route to the receiving facility. 6. Obtain and record vital signs every 5 minutes. 7. In case of life-threatening complications: a) Stop CPAP treatment. b) Offer reassurance. c) Institute appropriate BLS & ALS support per protocol. d) Adverse reactions to CPAP are to be documented on an Incident Report and forwarded to the PAEMS Quality Assurance Coordinator within 24 hours of occurrence. e) On arrival at the receiving hospital, immediately communicate any adverse reactions to emergency department staff. 8. Documentation in the patient care record should include: a) Detailed description of initial assessment findings. b) Vitals, including pulse oximetry, prior to initiating CPAP. c) Vitals (& pulse oximetry) every 5 minutes. d) Patient response to treatment (positive effects, no change or adverse reaction). CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR CPAP Systolic BP < 90mmHg Severe cardiorespiratory instability and impending arrest Respiratory or cardiac arrest Patients with stridor or airway obstruction Upper airway abnormalities or trauma Penetrating chest trauma Compromised thoracic organs Persistent nausea & vomiting Gastric distention Obtunded patient / Questionable ability to protect airway CPAP Procedure PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 150 A patient with an altered level of consciousness (ALOC) may present with a variety of symptoms from minor thought disturbances & confusion to complete unresponsiveness. The causes of ALOC include cardiac emergencies, hypoxia, hypoglycemia/diabetic emergencies, epilepsy/seizures, alcohol/drug related emergencies, trauma, sepsis, stroke or any other condition which disrupts brain perfusion. ALOC can be the presenting symptom for many disease processes. Syncope is another type of ALOC and is characterized as an acute, temporary suspension of consciousness. Near-syncope (feeling faint) is a sensation of impending loss of consciousness that may rapidly progress to unconsciousness. A patient who has experienced syncope or ALOC of any type should receive a thorough evaluation for secondary injuries ( e.g. fall injuries associated with the ALOC) and for possible underlying causes. Although a patient's ALOC may be resolved in the field, the patient should still be strongly encouraged to accept EMS care and ambulance transport to the hospital for further evaluation. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as beginning treatment for shock. 1.

The patient has no other complaints and no other issues are identified after a thorough evaluation (including a full assessment, vitals and repeat blood sugar). EMS advises patient/family that the patient needs to consume foods containing co mplex carbohydrates & protein within the next 15 minutes (assist patient if needed prior to departing the scene). Altered Level of Consciousness (ALOC) Protocol ALS Care (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 154 A stroke or \"brain attack\" is a sudden interruption in blood flow to the brain resulting in neurological deficit. It affects 750,000 Americans each year, is the 3rd leading cause of death and is the leading cause of adult disability. With new treatment options available, EMS personnel should alert Medical Control as quickly as possible whenever a potential stroke patient is identified. The most common causes of a stroke are: Cerebral thrombosis (a blood clot obstructing the artery). Cerebral embolus (a mass or air bubble obstructing the artery). Cerebral hemorrhage (ruptured artery / ruptured aneurysm). Signs & symptoms of a stroke include: Hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) Decreased sensation or numbness without trauma Facial droop Unequal grips Dizziness, vertigo or syncope Aphasia or slurred speech ALOC or seizures Sudden, severe headache with no known cause Visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision, double vision) Generalized weakness Frequent or unexplained falls Risk factors that increase the likelihood of stroke are: Hypertension Atherosclerosis / coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation Hyperlipidemia Diabetes Vasculitis Lupus To facilitate accuracy in diagnosing stroke and to expedite transport, an easy- to-use neurological examination tool is recommended.

Suspected Stroke Protocol ALS Care (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 160 Critical Thinking Elements Stroke onset t ime (defined as the last time the person was known to be normal) is key in determining the eligibility of IV TPA. EMS personnel should ask family members or bystanders the stroke onset time if the patient is unable to provide that information. IV TPA must be given within 180 minutes of the onset of ischemic stroke so do not delay transport. TIME IS BRAIN!! Interventional angiography can be performed up to 6 hours after onset of symptoms. Maintain the head/neck in neutral alignment. Elevate the head of th e cot 30 degrees if the systolic BP is > 100mmHg ( this will facilitate venous drainage and help reduce ICP without reducing cerebral perfusion pressure ). Bradycardia may be present in a suspected stroke patient due to increased ICP. Do NOT give Atropine i f the patient's BP is normal or elevated . Contact Medical Control for consultation. Spinal immobilization should be provided if the patient sustained a fall or other trauma. Monitor and maintain the patient's airway. Have suction readily available.

Document in the PCR whether the FAST exam is negative or positive. If positive, document \"FAST exam positive\" along with wha t components make it such ( e.g. left-sided facial droop, slurred speech, positive arm drift, etc). Do NOT administer Nitroglycerin (NTG) to a suspected stroke patient with elevated blood pressure in attempt to lower blood pressure. NTG may lower cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) too much and actually increase ischemia to the brain tissue. Suspected Stroke Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 161 A seizure is a temporary, abnormal electrical activity of the brain that results in loss of consciousness, loss of organized muscle tone and presence of convulsions. The patient will usually regain consciousness within 1 to 3 minutes followed by a period of confusion and fatigue ( post-ictal state ). Multiple seizures in a brief time span or seizures lasting more than 5 minutes may constitute status epilepticus and require EMS intervention to stop the seizure. Causes of seizures include: epilepsy, stroke, head trauma, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, infection, a rapid change in core body temperature (e.g. febrile seizure), eclampsia, alcohol withdraw and overdose.

The organs most likely damaged by a hypertensive emergency are the brain, heart and kidneys. Hypertension is also an indication that an underlying condition may exist which is causing the brain to demand more blood from the cardiovascular system. It can also be an indication of head injury with increased ICP, hypoxia or endocrine dysfunction. The goal of treatment is a slow, gradual reduction in BP rather than an abrupt lowering of BP that may cause further neurological complications.

DO NOT give a suspected poisoning patient anything by mouth. Caustic substances are those which have strong acid o r alkali properties and usually cause intra-oral burns, painful swallowing or burning/painful regurgitation. Common Acids : Hydrochloric Acid (swimming pool and toilet bowl cleaners), Sulfuric Acid (battery acid), Acetic Acid and Phenol. Common Bases (Al kali) : Lye (washing powders and paint removers), drain pipe cleaners (Drano), disk batteries, bleach, ammonia, polishes, dyes and jewelry cleaners. Patients who overdose on TCAs may initially appear well but may rapidly deteriorate. Monitor closely for ALOC and cardiovascular instability. Tachycardia and a widened QRS complex are generally signs of a life -threatening ingestion. Common TCAs : Amitriptyline, Elavil, Doxepin, Impramine, Clomipramine, etc. Narcotic and benzodiazepine overdoses do not gene rally cause abrupt changes in consciousness except when combined with alcohol use. Common Benzodiazepines : Valium, Diazepam, Ativan, Lorazepam, Xanax, etc. Drug Overdose and Poi soning Protocol ALS Care Continued PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 183 A pre-existing vascular access device is an indwelling catheter placed into a central vein to provide vascular access for those patients requiring long term intravenous therapy or hemodialysis. A central line is an indwelling catheter that provides access to large central veins: 1. May be used if unable to establish a peripheral IV in patients with a systolic BP < 80mmHg. 2. May be used if the patient is in cardiac arrest. 3. Do NOT administer benzodiazepines ( i.e. Versed) via central line . 4. A 10mL syringe or larger must be used when accessing any central line to prevent excess infusion pressure that could damage the internal wall of the catheter. 5. Always aspirate 5mL of blood from the central line and discard prior to administration of medications or IV fluids to remove Heparin from the line. 6. Strictly adhere to aseptic technique when handling a central line: Cleanse injection port twice with an alcohol prep (using a new alcohol prep each time) prior to accessing. 7. Do not remove the injection cap. 8. Do not allow IV fluids to run dry. 9. Always expel all air from syringes and IV tubing prior to administration. 10. Should damage occur to the external catheter, immediately clamp the catheter between the skin and the damaged area. Central Lines and Fistulas Procedure & Protocol (ALS Only ) Central Lines PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 184 A fistula (\"shunt\") is a surgically created subcutaneous arterio -venous vessel anastomosis used for patients requiring hemodialysis and should NOT be routinely accessed by prehospital personnel. 1. May only be used if the patient is in cardiac arrest and peripheral IV, IO or external jugular a ccess cannot be established . 2. Access must be made using a 14g or 16g IV catheter. Do not use anything smaller. 3. Do not use an arm with a fistula, shunt or arterio-venous (AV) graft to obtain a blood pressure. 4. Do not use an arm with a fistula, shunt or AV graft to establish peripheral IV access. 5. In the event the shunt tubing is pulled out of the entrance site: apply direct pressure, elevate the arm and transport immediately to the hospital. Access requires a specialized needle and cannot be used by prehospital personnel. Central Lines and Fi stulas Procedure & Protocol (ALS Only) Fistulas (\"Shunts\") Critical Thinking Elements Patients with advanced renal disease requiring dialysis have special medical needs that may require specific attention in the prehospital setting. These patients are prone to complications such as fluid overload & electrolyte imbalances, especially if they miss a scheduled dialysis treatment. Fluid overload may lead to pulmonary edema. Hyperkalemia may lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Mon itor dialysis patients closely. Anastomosis is the surgical connection of two tubular structures. Use of the EZ -IO is strongly encouraged over accessing a fistula / shunt.

Heat Disorders Heat (Muscle) Cramps - Heat cramps are muscle cr amps caused by overexertion and dehydration in the presence of high temperatures. Signs & symptoms include: Normal or slightly elevated body temperature; generalized weakness; dizziness; warm, moist skin and cramps in the fingers, arms, legs or abdominal muscles. Heat Exhaustion - Heat exhaustion is an acute reaction to heat exposure and the most common heat -related illness a prehospital provider will encounter. Signs & symptoms include : Increased body temperature ; generalized weakness; cool, diaphoreti c skin; rapid, shallow breathing; weak pulse; anxiety; and possible loss of . Heatstroke - Heatstroke occurs when the body's hypothalamic temperature regulation is lost. Cell death and damage to the brain, liver and kidne ys can occur. Signs & symptoms include: Cessation of sweating; very high core body temperature; hot, usually dry skin; deep, rapid, shallow respirations (which later slow); rapid, full pulse (which later slows); hypotension; confusion, disorientation or unconsciousness and possible seizures. Fever (Pyrexia) - A fever is the elevation of the body temperature above the normal temperature for that person (~ 98.6o F +/- 2 degrees). Fever is sometimes difficult to differentiate from heatstroke; however, ther e is usually a history of infection or illness with a fever. Heat -Related Emergencies Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 196 Burn injuries vary depending on the type of burn (thermal, electrical, chemical) and the amount of exposure (time and depth). Burn injuries range from localized redness to deep tissue destruction and airway compromise. Signs of burn injury include: blisters, pain, tissue destruction, charred tissue and singed hair. The primary goal in the treatment of the burn patient is to stop the acute burning process by removing the patient from direct contact with the source of the burn and maintaining the patient's body fluids. Special attention should be given to limit further pain and damage of the burn to the patient. However, burn care should not interfere with lifesaving measures. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as beginning treatment for shock. 1.

THERMAL BURN TREATMENT : a) If the burn occurred within the last 20 minutes, reverse the burning process and cool the area by flushing the area with 1 Liter of sterile saline (or sterile water if sterile saline is not available). The goal of cooling is to extinguish the burning process - not to systemically cool the patient. Fluid application should be held to a minimum and discontinued if the patient begins shivering. b) Remove jewelry and loose clothing. Do not pull away clothing that is stuck to the burn. c) Cover the wound with sterile dressings*** d) Place a sterile burn sheet on the stretcher. If the patient's posterior is burned, place a sterile burn pad on top of the sheet with the absorbent side toward the patient. e) Place patient on the stretcher. f) Cover the patient with additional sterile burn sheets and blanket to conserve body heat.

The dose may be repeated one time to a maximum dose of 50mcg. Burn Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 201 Smoke inhalation injury is the result of various inhaled components of combustion and direct thermal injury to the airway. Signs and symptoms include: evidence of exposure to fire, stridor, wheezing, acute upper airway obstruction, chemical pneumonia and non-cardiac pulmonary edema. Effects of the exposure may be immediate or delayed several hours. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a common secondary complication to smoke inhalation. Direct exposure to the gas is also common (especially in winter months). Signs and symptoms include: evidence of exposure to fire or natural gases produced by incomplete combustion, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, weakness, chest pain and ALOC. Suspect cyanide toxicity in patients who were in enclosed spaces during a fire and have soot in the nares or oropharynx and exihibit altered mental status. Disorientation, confusion, and severe headache are potential indications of cyanide poisoning IN THE SETTING of smoke inhalation. Hypotension without other obvious cause IN THE SETTING of smoke inhalation increases the likelihood of cyanide poisoning.

Time from injury to definitive trauma center care is a critical factor in the morbidity and mortality of the injured patient. Scene times should be kept to a minimum and the patient should be promptly transported to the trauma center. Trauma notification should be made via telemetry as soon as possible . First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 1. Scene Assessment (Scene Size-Up) Ensure scene safety - identify any hazards ( e.g. fire, downed power lines, unstable vehicle, leaking fuel, weapons). Determine the number of patients. Identify the mechanism of injury (gunshot wound, vehicle rollover, high speed crash, ejection from the vehicle). Identify special extrication needs, if any. Call for additional resources if needed. 2. Primary Survey (Initial Assessment) The purpose of the primary assessment is for the prehospital provider to rapidly identify and manage life-threatening conditions: Obtain a general impression of the patient's condition. Assess, secure and maintain a patent airway while simultaneously using C-spine precautions. Assess breathing and respiratory effort: Approximate respiratory rate. Assess quality of respiratory effort (depth of ventilation and movement of air). Oxygen : 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask or 6 L/min via nasal cannula if the patient cannot tolerate a mask. Be prepared suction the airway and support the patient's respirations with BVM if necessary. Needle Chest Decompression (ALS only ): if patient is in severe respiratory distress or cardiac arrest with s/s of tension pneumothorax. Assess circulation: Evaluate carotid and radial pulses. Evaluate skin color, temperature and condition. Immediately control major external bleeding. Critical Decision ( based on mechanism of injury & initial exam ): Limit scene time to 10 minutes or less if the patient has a significant mechanism of injury or meets \"Load & Go\" criteria.

Patients with poor respiratory effort may require ventilation with a BVM at 8 -10 breaths/min. Cushing's response refers to the ominous combination of markedly increased arterial blood pressure and resultant bradycardi a indicating cerebral herniation. Avoid prophylactic hyperventilation of a head trauma patient as this can cause cerebral vasoconstriction. However, if s/s of increased ICP are present, then controlled hyperventilation may be needed (with Medical Control order) until s/s of increased ICP have subsided: 20 breaths/min for adults 25 breaths/min for children 30 breaths/min for infants Deeply comatose patients may require advanced airway placement (GCS < 8).

ALS Care (continued) Spinal Trauma Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 227 Spinal motion restriction can prevent spinal cord damage and subsequent paralysis in patients with traumatic injuries. However, spinal motion restriction is not without risks and potential complications such as occipital headaches, pressure sores, and tissue ischemia. The intent of these guidelines is to decrease the injury and discomfort to patients caused by arbitrary spinal motion restriction while ensuring that no spinal injuries are missed. Any patient meeting or potentially meeting trauma triage criteria based on the Field Triage Decision Scheme and tr ansfers to a trauma center require full spine motion restriction. All patients with a definite potential or questionable mechanism of injury (MOI) for head injury or spine injury will be assessed using the Spine Assessment Procedure. Spine motion restriction may be deferred for patients meeting all exclusion criteria listed in the Spine Assessment Procedure . Only cervical spine splinting with an appropriate sized C-collar is required for patients who do not fall into trauma triage criteria, but are unable to meet all exclusionary criteria of the PAEMS Spine Assessment o Long spine board, straps, and head blocks may be used for these patients with the EMS provider's discretion. Patients, for whom spinal restriction is deferred, must meet all exclusionary criteria as indicated in the Spine Assessment Procedure. Victims of isolated penetrating trauma to the head, neck, and/or torso SHOULD NOT have spine motion restriction applied unless there is an obvious neurologic deficit to the extremities or if there is a significant secondary blunt MOI (e.g., falling down stairs after getting shot). Pediatric patients will be assessed by the EMS Provider to determine the most appropriate method of spinal immobilization (car seat, towel rolls, cervical collar, KED, or specialized pediatric device). If there is any doubt of potential spine injury, initiate spine motion restriction. Prehospital personnel must clearly document all pertinent findings consistent with the assessment of the patient's need, or lack of need, for spi ne motion restriction. Spinal Care Guidelines Purpose: Policy: Documentation: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 228 All EMS providers must successfully complete the didactic & skills training prior to performing the Spine Assessment Procedure in the field. Documentation of annual competency training for EMS providers and current personnel roster must be submitted to the PAEMS office by all agencies. Requirements: Spinal Care Guidelines PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 229 The spine assessment procedure evaluates the risk of spine injury in patients with definite or potential/questionable mechanism of injury. Using evidence-based medicine, this procedure is utilized to balance the risks and benefits of spine motion restriction. 1. Explain the procedure to the patient. Ensure the patient expresses understanding of the procedure being performed. Patient must be sober and reliable with no distracting injuries. 2. Ask the patient to verbally report any pain or tenderness. Emphasize to the patient to not shake or nod the ir head during questioning. 3. Hold the spine in a neutral position to limit movement. 4. Palpate the midline spine starting at the base of the skull for tenderness and proceed inferiorly along each individual vertebra along the cervical spine. If any evidence of tenderness to palpation, crepitus, or step-off sign is noted, immediately place a cervical splinting device. 5. If no tenderness to palpation, crepitus or step-off sign is present, ask the patient to rotate their head to one side, and if no pain, rotate their head to the other side. For any evidence of pain, immediately place a cervical splinting device. 6. Once the cervical spine has been assessed, the patient may be log rolled to assess the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine by palpating each individual vertebra for tenderness, crepitus, or step-off sign. 7. If a C-collar is applied, the patient needs to remain supine. If patient comfort is a factor, the head can be elevated to a maximum of 30 degrees. Spinal Assessment Procedure Procedure: Indication: Clinical indications: patients with traumatic neck/back pain, head injury or facial trauma, or with a significant or uncerta in MOI or high index of suspicion for spinal trauma (e.g. axial load (diving), MVC* or bicycle, falls...). In high -risk patients (e.g. elderly, osteoporotic, degenerative disorders) less forceful mechanisms can cause significant injuries.

PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 230 Spinal Assessment Procedure Critical Thinking Elements MVC applies to crashes of all motorized vehicles; e.g. automobile, motorcycle, snowmobile, etc. Proper assessment of the spine requires the patient to be calm, cooperative, sober, able to understand questioning, and alert without language barrier Distracting injury includes any injury the produces clinically apparent pain that might distract the pat ient from the pain of a spine injury - pain would include medical as well as traumatic etiologies of pain Motor: Can the patient move fingers and toes? Can the patient dorsi flex and plantar flex the feet? Are grips strong and equal? Sensory : Can the p atient feel you touch fingers and toes? Does the unconscious patient respond when you pinch fingers and toes? PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 231 Spinal injury should be suspected in all patients presenting with Head, neck, or facial trauma (i.e., injury above the clavicles) ALOC with unknown history of events Physical findings suggesting neck or back pain/injury High mechanism of injury despite complaints Complaints of neck or back pain unrelated to th e patient's past medical history Complaint of head pain related to trauma Unknown mechanism of injury Suspected deceleration injuries Spinal management of patients in a supine position. 1. Immediately establish manual stabilization of the cervical spine. Stabilize the patient's head & neck in a neutral, in -line position by grasping the patient's head along the lateral aspects (and perform a modified jaw thrust if indicated) 2. Apply a rigid C-collar after airway, breathing, and circulatory status have been assessed. 3. Log roll the patient onto a long spine backboard. Assess and document neurovascular status before and after immobilization. 4. Secure the patient's torso and extremities to the backboard using spider straps or belts. 5. Reassess (perform ongoing assessment). Spinal management of the patients in a sitting position. 1. Patients found in a sitting position that have a suspected spinal injury should be secured to an extrication device (i.e. KED) prior to being moved. Assess and document neurovascular status before and after immobilization. 2. Patients who meet \"Load & Go\" criteria should be moved using the rapid extrication technique. Proper manual stabilization must be maintained throughout the extrication. Assess and document neurovascular status before and after immobilization. Secure neutral, in-line stabilization of the head & neck (as per General Spinal Management). Keeping the patient's spine in a neutral position, pivot the patient in order to place and long backboard under the patient's buttocks and b ehind his/her back. Lower the patient to the long backboard and secure (as per General Spinal Management). Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure Indication: Procedure: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 232 Resuscitation success rates of trauma patients in cardiac arrest are extremely poor, usually due to prolonged hypoxia. Efforts to resuscitate are more likely to be successful if EMS arrives early in the arrest, understands the differences between traumatic cardiac arrest patients & medical cardiac arrest patients and treatment is directed at identifying & treating the underlying cause. Traumatic arrest is usually caused by airway problems (unmanaged airway during unconsciousness), breathing problems (from chest trauma) and/or circulatory problems (internal or external hemorrhaging). Patients who are found in asystole after massive blunt trauma or penetrating trauma of a vital organ are dead and may be pronounced dead at scene with the concurrence of Medical Control. First Responder Care , BLS Care , First Responder , BLS , ILS & ALS Care should be focused on rapid assessment confirming that the patient is in cardiac arrest and determine if resuscitation will be attempted. Medical Control must be consulted for death determination on scene. If resuscitative efforts are going to be attempted, begin resuscitation immediately and \"Load & Go\" with the patient. 1. Rapidly assess to determine possible causes of the arrest and determine if resuscitation will be attempted. 2. Initiate cardiac arrest protocols and procedures. 3. Rapidly extricate, fully immobilize and \"Load & Go\". 4. \"Load & Go\" w ith any type of penetrating trauma. 5. BLS Care, ILS Care and ALS Care : Place a KING LTS-D Airway using in-line stabilization of the cervical spine or use basic airway control measures. 6. ILS Care and ALS Care : Obtain IV access en route to the hospital with a 14g or 16g IV catheter (if possible). A 2nd line may be established if time permits. 7. ILS Care and ALS Care : IV Fluid Therapy : 20mL/kg fluid bolus to achieve and maintain a systolic BP of at least 100mmHg. 8.

PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 234 Attention should be given to extremity injuries to limit further damage and discomfort for the patient. However, extremity care should never interfere with lifesaving decisions or interventions and should not delay transport of trauma patients. Signs of extremity injury include: Pain Deformity Contusion Tenderness Swelling Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating care to assure the patient is maintaining an airway, is breathing, has a perfusing pulse and beginning treatment for shock. 1. Render initial care in accordance with the Universal Patient Care Protocol . 2. Oxygen : 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask or 6 L/min via nasal cannula if the patient cannot tolerate a mask. Be prepared to support the patient's respirations with BVM if necessary. 3. Control any external bleeding: a) Apply direct pressure and pressure dressing. b) Elevate the extremity if possible. c) Use pressure points. d) Assess distal pulse, motor & sensation. 4. Splint musculoskeletal injuries: a) Immobilize the joints with a rigid splint above and below the injury for long bone injuries. b) Immobilize the long bones with a rigid splint above and below the injured site for joint injuries. c) Assure the joints and bones are immobilized sufficiently to stabilize the injured structures (especially when using a soft splint or pillow). d) Assess distal pulse, motor & sensation. 5. If the extremity is angulated and no distal pulse is present, reduce by gently applying manual traction until the pulse returns. a) Reassess distal pulse, motor and sensation. Extremity Injury Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 235 First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 6. Amputation cases: a) Control external bleeding. b) Dress, bandage and/or splint the injured extremity. c) Attempt to recover the severed part: Wrap in sterile gauze, towel or sheet. Wet dressing with sterile water or .9% Normal Saline. Place severed part in waterproof bag or container and seal. Place the bag/container in another container filled with ice or cold water. DO NOT immerse the amputated part in any solutions. DO NOT allow the tissue to freeze. Transport the container with the patient. 7. Initiate ALS intercept if needed and transport as soon as possible. 8. Contact the receiving hospital as soon as possible or Medical Control if necessary. 1. IV Fluid Therapy : 20mL/kg fluid bolus if the patient is hypotensive to obtain a systolic BP of at least 100mmHg. 2. Fentanyl : 50mcg IV, over 2 minutes for pain.

Critical Thinking Elements In patients with known renal failure, the Fentanyl dose must be reduced to 25mcg. The dose may be repeated one t ime to a maximum dose of 50mcg. Avoid use of Zofran in patients with congenital long QT syndrome as these patients are at particular risk for Torsades de Pointes Extremity Injury Protocol ALS Care (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 237 Use of tourniquets does not require on-line medical direction however; there may be situations in which medical direction consultation is advised. The goal of tourniquet application is to control hemorrhage. Overall morbidity and mortality, however, is affected by multiple factors related to type of device, application technique, and duration of application. Fortunately, civilian extremity exsanguination is exceedingly rare. To control potentially fatal hemorrhage from wounds or traumatic amputations when significant extremity bleeding cannot be stopped using simpler methods. Tourniquets may also be indicated in tactical or safety situations, those involving prolonged extrication, remote locations, multiple casualties Tourniquets may be considered when treating patients who have had prolonged compression of an entrapped extremity in order to decrease the life-threatening release of Potassium and acids from the ischemic limb. Venous, bony and small vessel bleeding. Tourniquet application is generally unnecessary when wound bleeding is adequately controlled using direct pressure, pressure dressings, elevation, or any other simpler method. Non-extremity hemorrhage 8. Commercially made tourniquets are preferred over improvised devices with the exception of pediatric patients (as there exists no effective commercial device designed for a pediatric patient).* 9. Apply device approximately 3 inches proximal to wound. If the wound is on a joint, or just distal to the joint, apply the tourniquet above the joint. 10. Tighten until bleeding stops (venous oozing is acceptable) and/or distal pulse is absent. 11. If one tourniquet is not sufficient a second should be applied just proximal to the first. 12. Do not cover the tourniquet with a dressing. 13. Once a tourniquet has been applied, do not remove or loosen it unless ordered by medical direction. 14. Note time of tourniquet application and communicate this to the receiving care providers. 15. Dress wounds per general wound care procedure. 16. Document application time, location, and patient response on the Patient Care Report (PCR) * The commercially made tourniquets recommended in the PAEMS System include the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) and the Special Operations Forces Tourniquet (SOFT-T). Tourniquet Application Procedure: Indications: Contraindications: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 238 Critical Thinking El ements PRECAUTIONS A tourniquet applied incorrectly can increase blood loss and lead to death. If loosely applied, a tourniquet will obstruct venous outflow from the extremity while not stopping arterial inflow, thus paradoxically increasing bleeding. Although unlikely if applied correctly and removed within 1 -2 hours, tourniquets may cause nerve and tissue damage. Application of a tourniquet in the conscious patient will cause tremendous pain. COMPLICATIONS Complications generally occur with applicatio ns greater than two hours duration and may be irreversible by six hours. Tourniquets may result in local tissue damage (worse with narrow or improvised tourniquets): blisters, nerve damage and gangrene are possible. Systemic complications can also occur with prolonged applications from byproducts of ischemia distal to the site: pulmonary emboli, rhabdomyolysis, lactic and respiratory acidosis, dysrhythmias, shock, circulatory overload (in cardiac patients). Patients who were in shock before the applicati on of the tourniquet have a much lower survival and the degree of tissue loss will be greater, especially with tourniquet times beyond two hours. Tourniquet Application PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 239 Thoracic decompression involves placement of a needle through the chest wall of a critical patient who has a life-threatening tension pneumothorax and is rapidly deteriorating due to intrathoracic pressure. Signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax include: Restlessness and agitation Severe respiratory distress Increased airway resistance with ventilations JVD Tracheal deviation Subcutaneous emphysema Unequal breath sounds Absent lung sounds on the affected side Hyper resonance to percussion on the affected side Hypotension Cyanosis Respiratory arrest Traumatic cardiac arrest Initiate Universal Trauma Care . If a tension pneumothorax is identified: 1. Locate the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the side of the pneumothorax. 2. Cleanse the site with providone-iodine preps and maintain as much of a sterile field as possible. 3. Attach a 10-20mL syringe to a 2 inch, 14g IV catheter. 4. Puncture the skin perpendicularly, just superior to the 3rd rib (in the 2nd intercostal space). Direct the needle just over the 3rd rib and into the thoracic cavity. A \"pop\" should be felt as well as a \"rush of air\" along with the plunger of the syringe moving outward. 5. Advance the catheter while removing the needle and syringe. 6. Secure the catheter in the chest will with a dressing and tape. 7. Monitor the patient closely and continue to reassess. Needle Thoracentesis Procedure (Needle Chest Decompression ALS Only) Critical Thinking Elements Nerve bu ndles and blood vessels are located under the ribs and puncturing them could cause nerve damage and extensive bleeding.

Prepare for delivery: a) Control delivery of the head so that it does not emerge too quickly. Support the infant's head as it emerges and protect the perineum with gentle hand pressure. b) Puncture the amniotic membrane with gentle finger pressure if it is still intact and visible outside the vagina. c) Assess for nuchal cord and, if present, gently remove the cord from around the newborn's neck. d) Suction the mouth, then nose of the newborn with a bulb syringe as soon as the head is delivered. e) As the shoulders emerge, guide the head & neck downward to deliver the anterior shoulder. Support and lift the head & neck slightly to deliver the posterior shoulder. f) Ensure a firm hold on the baby as the rest of the newborn's body delivers. g) Keep the newborn level with the mother's vagina until the cord stops pulsating and is double clamped. 1. Begin the Emergency Childbirth Record . 2. Continue to suction the nose and mouth. Spontaneous respirations should begin within 15 seconds . If spontaneous respirations are not present, begin artificial ventilations with BVM & 100% O 2 at 30-40 vpm. If no brachial pulse is present OR the pulse is less than 100 bpm, begin CPR. 3. Dry the newborn and wrap in a warm blanket, keeping the baby at the level of the mother's vagina until the cord is clamped and cut. 4. After the umbilical cord stops pulsating, clamp the cord at 3\" & at 4\" from the newborn's ab domen and cut between the clamps with the sterile scalpel found in the OB kit. 5. Assess the cord for bleeding and note the number of vessels present. 6. Obtain an APGAR score at 1 minute and again at 5 minutes after delivery. 7.

ALS Car e (continued) Critical Thinking Elements High body temperature is a key finding in predicting a high risk of sudden death. Another key symptom to the onset of death while experiencing excited delirium is \"instant tranquility\". This is when the person h as been very violent and vocal then suddenly becomes quiet and docile. It is paramount that patients exhibiting symptoms of this syndrome be effectively and quickly physically restrained, and then calmed using Versed and verbal coaching. The likelihood of sudden apnea and death increases the longer these patients are allowed to struggle against restraint . Managing these patients therefore requires a coordinated effort among all responders and Law Enforcement personnel. Excited Delirium Protocol PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 262 EMS providers should consider the mental health needs of a patient who appears emotionally or mentally incapacitated. This involves cases that the EMS provider has reasonable cause or evidence to suspect a patient may intentionally or unintentionally physically injure himself/herself or others, is unable to care for his/her own physical needs, or is in need of mental health treatment against his/her will. This does not include a person whose mental processes have merely been weakened or impaired by reason of advanced years and the patient is under the supervision of family or another healthcare provider, unless the family or healthcare provider has activated EMS for a specific behavioral emergency. 1. Attempt to persuade the patient that there is a need for evaluation and compel him/her to be transported to the hospital. 2. If persuasion is unsuccessful, contact Medical Control and relay the history of the event. Clearly indicate your suspicions and/or evidence and have the base station physician discuss the patient's needs with the parties involved in the situation. 3. The EMS crew will then follow the direction of the base station physician in determining the disposition of the patient or termination of patient contact. Another agency's or party's opinion should not influence the EMS provider's assistance to a mental health need. 4. Under no circumstances does transport of the patient, whether voluntarily or against his/her will, commit the patient to a hospital admission. It simply enables the EMS providers to transport a person suspected to be in need of mental health treatment. 5. If a patient is combative or may harm self or others, call law enforcement for assistance and follow the Patient Restraint Policy. Petitioning an Emotionally D isturbed Patient Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 263 Patients will only be restrained if clinically justified. The use of restraints is only utilized if the patient is violent and may cause harm to themselves or others. Physical and/or chemical restraints are a last resort in caring for the emotionally disturbed patient. 1. To safely restrain the patient, use a minimum of 4 people. 2. Contact Medical Control as soon as possible for an order / guidance. 3. If available, may use police protective custody. 4. Explain the procedure to the patient (and family) if possible. The team leader should be the person communicating with the patient. 5. If attempts at verbally calming the patient have failed and the decision is made to use restraints, do not waste time bargaining with the patient. 6. Remember to remove any equipment from your person which can be used as a weapon against you (e.g. trauma shears). 7. Assess the patient and surroundings for potential weapons. 8. Approach the patient, keeping the team leader near the head to continue communications and at least one person on each side of the patient. 9. Move the patient to a backboard or the stretcher. 10. Place the patient supine and place soft, disposable restraints on 2-4 limbs and fasten to the backboard or stretcher. Avoid restraining the patient prone if at all possible. 11. Transport as soon as possible. 12. Document circulation checks every 15 minutes (of all restrained limbs) and thoroughly document the reasons for applying restraints, time of application, condition of the patient before and after application, method of restraint and any law enforcement involvement, including any use of law enforcement equipment (e.g. handcuffs) and the time Medical Control was contacted. 13. Do not remove restraints until released by medical personnel at the receiving hospital. Patient Restraint Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 264 Effective January 1st 2014, Illinois citizens can obtain a permit to legally carry a concealed weapon. The purpose of this policy is to outline common expected procedures for intervening with patients and/or their families who under the law may be carrying a concealed deadly weapon. The intent is to reduce the potential risk of injury to emergency responders, healthcare personnel and the public. This policy aims to mutually respect the rights of citizens who lawfully carry a concealed weapon as well as to provide safety for emergency responders and healthcare providers. This policy pertains to all weapons, including, but not limited to firearms, hunting knifes, and electronic weapons. 1. No weapon will ever be transported unsecured inside the ambulance whether belonging to the patient or family member. The only exception to this rule will be for on duty law enforcement personnel. 2. Assume all weapons are loaded. Never attempt to unload a firearm, or engage the safety. 3. Upon arrival, EMS personnel should directly ask the patient, \"Do you have any weapons or needles that could poke or harm me?\" prior to performing a physical assessment. If patient is unable to answer, proceed with caution. 4. If EMS personnel are threatened or feel threatened by a patient, family member or bystanders, even if a weapon is not displayed, personnel should move to a safe location, notify law enforcement, and wait for the scene to be secured until returning to the scene. 5. If a patient refuses to remove or allow removal of the weapon, that patient is considered to be refusing medical care and the scene now unsafe. EMS personnel should leave and wait for Law Enforcement to secure the scene. 6. Optimally, a patient with a concealed weapon away from their residence should have it taken control of by local law enforcement. The goal is for the EMS provider to minimally handle any weapon 7. If patient has a weapon, and is able, ask them to lock up their weapon at home or in the trunk of their vehicle. 8. The weapon may be removed by properly trained EMS personnel, tagged with patients name and secured in a lockbox and placed in an exterior compartment of the ambulance. 9. If weapon is located while transporting a patient, the ambulance should be stopped, weapon tagged with patient's name, secured in lockbox, and placed in an ex terior compartment of the ambulance. 10. If a weapon is found in a holster, the weapon should remain in the holster while it is secured. If you cannot remove the holster from the patient, cut away any restraining belts or clothes and secure the holstered weapon. 11. Weapons will not be taken via helicopter, if a patient is to be transported by helicopter from the scene, make sure their weapon is secured by a Law Enforcement official. 12. When a weapon is encountered on a call, the patient care report should include documentation that a weapon was located, type of weapon, how it was recovered, where it was located, what the disposition was, and any actions or comments made to or by the patient. Concealed Weapons Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 265 1. Each hospital will have its own procedure when it comes to dealing with secured weapons that arrive by EMS. If you are unsure of the receiving hospital's policy, please inquire with their staff on your arrival. 2. When transporting a patient to St. Francis notify Medcom that security will need to meet you to take control of the patient's personal property. 3. Cased weapons will be turned over to St. Francis security staff and locked in their designated safe location. Your safety case will then be returned to you by the security officer. 4. A \"Transfer of Personal Property\" form m ust be completed and signed by all parties. One copy left with hospital, one copy left with patient, and original left with the patient's PCR.

Critical Thinking Elements Refer to Behavioral Emergencies/Chemical Restraint Protocol for continued aggressiveness or violent behavior. Chemical defense sprays such as oleoresin capsicum (pepper spray) leave residue that may be contacted and transferred to providers. Care must be taken to ensure cross contamination does not occur. Avoid touching your own face, eyes or any other mucous membrane. Patients who have been subdued using less than lethal weapons are commonly agitated and may be combative. Saf ety of the EMS crew is of utmost importance. Many of these patients fit into a syndrome known as \" excited delirium \" that has been associated with adverse medical outcomes, including SUDDEN DEATH, especially when restraints are utilized. Careful monitoring should be exercised when dealing with these patients. Contaminated clothing should be removed and sealed in a plastic bag to prevent further irritation and to reduce cross contamination. Monitor the patient for respiratory depression when administering na rcotics. If respiratory depression or hypotension occurs after administration of Dilaudid or Fentanyl, ventilate the patient as necessary and administer Narcan. Monitor respiratory status, SPO2 and or Waveform Capnography if available. If law enforcement has removed the probes, treat the probes as biohazards. Exercise caution to prevent accidental needlestick -like injuries. Ask law enforcement to eject the cartridge from the taser prior to patient contact. Patients who have been subdued using less than le thal weapons are commonly agitated and may be combative. If the patient is not yet subdued and/or is violent, do not initiate contact. Safety of the EMS crew is of utmost importance. Less than Lethal Weapons Protocol Taser -Related Injuries (continued) ALS Care (continued) PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 277 A Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) policy is a tool to be used in the prehospital setting to set forth guidelines for providing CPR or for withholding resuscitative efforts. The purpose of this policy is to specify requirements for valid DNR orders and to establish a procedure for field management of these situations. A DNR policy shall be implemented only after it has been reviewed and approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health in accordance with the requirements of Section 515.380 of the Illinois Administrative Code. 1. Any FR-D, EMT-B, EMT-I, EMT-P or PHRN who is actively participating in a Department approved EMS system may honor, follow and respect a valid DNR. Medical Control will be contacted in all cases involving a DNR . 2. DNR refers to the withholding of life-sustaining treatment such as CPR, electrical therapy (e.g. pacing, cardioversion & defibrillation), endotracheal intubation and/or manually/mechanically assisted ventilation, unless otherwise stated on the DNR order. 3. By itself, a DNR order does not mean that any other life-prolonging therapy, hospitalization or use of EMS is to be withheld. DNR orders do not affect treatment of patients who are not in full arrest (pulseless and breathless) . 4. On-line Medical Control must be consulted in cases involving DNR orders. A DNR order may be invalidated if the immediate cause of a respiratory or cardiac arrest is related to trauma or mechanical airway obstruction. 5. When EMS personnel arrive on scene and discover the patient is pulseless and breathless and CPR is not in progress, resuscitation (at minimum CPR) must be initiated unless one or more of the following conditions exist: Obvious signs of biological death are present: Decapitation Rigor mortis without profound hypothermia Dependent lividity Obvious mortal wounds with no signs of life Decomposition Death has been declared by the patient's physician or the coroner. A valid DNR order is present and the EMS provider has made reasonable effort to verify the identity of the patient named in the order (i.e. identification by another person, ID band, photo ID or facility, home-care or hospice nursing staff). Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 278 If the above signs of death are recognized, EMS personnel must contact Medical Control to confirm the decision not to attempt resuscitation prior to contacting the coroner. The EMS provider should immediately institute BLS measures and contact Medical Control for further direction if he or she has concerns regarding the validity of the DNR orders, the degree of life-sustaining treatment to be withheld or the status of the patient's condition. 6. When EMS personnel arrive on scene and discover that CPR is in progress, the EMS provider should: Determine if signs of death are present or a valid DNR exists. If signs of death are present and/or the patient does not have a pulse, has no respirations and a valid DNR does exist, contact Medical Control for orders, including possible cease efforts order. If no valid DNR exists, continue CPR (refer to cardiac resuscitation policy). 7. If the patient's primary care physician is at the scene of (or on the phone) and requesting specific resuscitation or DNR procedures, EMS personnel should verify the physician's identity (if not known to the EMT) and notify Medical Co ntrol of the request of the on-scene physician. Follow Medical Control orders. 8. The only recognized DNR form EMS providers are obligated to honor, follow & respect is the standardized State of Illinois Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order form which has the Seal of the State of Illinois in the upper left corner. All signature lines must be completed in order for the DNR to be valid. 9. Any other advance directives or \"living will\" cannot be honored, followed and respected by pre-hospital care providers. EMS personnel must contact Medical Control for direction regarding any other type of advanced directive . Resuscitation should not be withheld during the process of contacting or discussing the situation with the on-line Medical Control physician. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 279 10. A Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare is an agent who has been delegated by the patient to make any healthcare decisions (including the withholding or withdrawal of life- sustaining treatment) which the patient is unable to make. When a patient's surrogate decision-maker is present or has been contacted by prehospital personnel and they direct that resuscitative efforts not be instituted: Ask the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare agent to provide positive identification (i.e. driver's license, phot o ID, etc.), see the document and ask the agent to point out the language that confirms that the \"power\" is in effect and that it covers the situation at hand (i.e. assure the scope of authority the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare has and that the patient's medical or mental condition complies with the document designating the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare ). The Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare agent or a surrogate decision-maker can provide consent to a DNR order, but the order itself must be written by a physician. An EMS Provider cannot honor a verbal or written DNR request/order made directly by a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare agent, surrogate decision-maker or any person other than a physician. If such a situation is encountered, contact Medical Control for direction. 11. Revocation of a written DNR order is accomplished when the DNR order is physically destroyed or verbally rescinded by the physician who signed the order and/or the person who gave consent to the order. 12. Prehospital care providers have a duty to act and provide care in the best interest of the patient. This requires the provision of full medical and resuscitative interventions when medically indicated and not contraindicated by the wishes of the patient. 13. When managing a patient that is apparently non-viable, but desired and/or approved medical measures appear unclear (i.e. upset family members, disagreement regarding DNR order, etc.), EMS personnel should provide assessment, initiate resuscitative measures and contact Medical Control for further direction. 14. If EMS personnel encounter a patient with a valid DNR from a long-term care facilities, hospice, during an inter-hospital transfer or when transporting to or from home and the patient arrests enroute, do not initiate resuscitative measures and contract Medical Control for orders. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 280 15. If EMS personnel arrive at the scene and the family states that the patient is a hospice patient with a valid DNR order, do not initiate resuscitative measures and contact Medical Control for orders. 16. On occasion, EMS personnel may encounter an out-of-town patient with a valid DNR order visiting in the Peoria Area EMS System. If the DNR order appears to be valid (signed by the patient and physician), contact Medical Control for orders. 17. The coroner will be notified of any patient or family wishes that there is to be tissue donation in cases where the patient is not transported to the hospital. 18. The Medical Control physician's responsibility is to make reasonable ef fort to confirm the DNR order is valid and order resuscitative measures within the directives of the DNR order. 19. Appropriate patient care reports will be completed on all patients who are not resuscitated in the prehospital setting. A copy of the DNR form should be retained and attached as supporting documentation to the prehospital care report form. 20. All Peoria Area EMS System personnel are to submit an incident report to the Quality Assurance Coordinator in the EMS Office regarding any difficulties experienced with DNR situations. These cases will be evaluated on an individual basis. Any issues identified will be reported to the EMS Medical Director for further review. 21. Follow the System's Coroner Notification Policy . Resuscita tion vs. Cease Efforts Policy Critical Thinking Elements Ask the patient's family to produce an actual copy of the DNR / Advanced Directives. Family members will often identify themselves as \"Power of Attorney\" when in fact, they are solely \"Power of Attorney for Finance\". \"Power of Attorney for Finance\" does NOT convey authority for healthcare decisions. Only a valid \"Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare\" conveys authority for healthcare decisions. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 281 It is the policy of the Peoria Area EMS System that CPR need no t be initiated when death has been determined based on the criteria outlined below. Peoria Area EMS providers are required to contact Medical Control for determination of death covered i n this policy. A person is presumed dead on arrival when all five signs of death are present and at least one associated \"Factor of Death\" is present. Signs of Death (All must be present) Factors of Death (At least one must be present) Medical Unresponsiveness Lividity and/or any degree of generalized cyanosis Rigor mortis Presence of venous pooling in the body Decomposition Decapitation Incineration or extensive full thickness burns Transection of head or trunk Major blunt or penetrating trauma Separation of heart and/or brain Deforming brain injury Apnea Pulselessness Non-reactive pupils Trauma Uresponsiveness Absence of vital signs in a trauma victim upon arrival of EMS personnel despite a patent airway. Do not initiate resuscitation in the following: Do Not Resuscitate orders: No resuscitation efforts should be initiated when the person or family has evidence of a valid Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order i n hand. Scene safety: The physical environment is not safe for the EMS providers to enter. Infant death (SIDS): An infant who is apneic, and meets the above criteria may be presumed dead. Neonatal death: A neonate who is apneic, pulseless, and exhibits neonatal maceration (softening or degeneration of the tissues after death in utero), anencephaly (absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and sc alp), or if the gestational age is less than 22 weeks and neonate shows signs of obvious immaturity (translucent and gela tinous skin, lack of fingernails, fused eyelids) may be presumed dead. Withholding Resuscitation / Criteria for Death Purpose: Policy: Procedure: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 282 Notes: Resuscitation may be initiated if the condition of the scene in dicates that withholding resuscitation could cause a poten tial unsafe condition for the ambulance crew. If the EMS providers determine t he situation warrants removal o f the patient from the scene, resuscitation efforts must be initiated, continued throughout t ransportation to the hospital and circumstances documented in a patient care report. 2010 American Heart Association Gu idelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergenc y Cardiovascular Care. Circulation. 2010; 122:S665-S675 Critical Thinking Elements Pediatric patients and patient with hypothermia may have no sig ns of life but still be viable. Prolonged resuscitative efforts are indicated in these cases. Withholding Resuscitation / Criteria for Death PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 283 In accordance with Section 10.6, Chapter 31 of the Illinois Revised Statutes - Coroners: 1. Every law enforcement official, funeral director, ambulance attendant , hospital director of administration or person having custody of the body of a deceased person, where the death is one subjected to investigation under Section 10 of this Act, and any physician in attendance upon such a decedent at the time of his death, shall notify the coroner promptly. Any such person failing to notify the coroner promptly shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, unless such person has reasonable cause to believe that the coroner had already been notified. 2. Deaths that are subject to coroner investigation include: Accidental deaths of any type or cause Homicidal deaths Suicidal deaths Abortions - criminal or self-induced maternal or fetal deaths Sudden deaths - when in apparent good health or in any suspicious or unusual manner including sudden death on the street, at home, in a public place, at a place of employment, or any deaths under unknown circumstances may ultimately be the subject of investigation. 3. The coroner (or his/her designee) should be provided the following information: Your name Your EMS service Location of the body or death Phone number and/or radio frequency you are available on Brief explanation of the situation 4. Once this information has been provided, wait for the coroner (or his/her designee) to arrive for further instructions. EMS crews may clear the scene if law enforcement is on the scene and no other emergency exists. 5. Law enforcement personnel are responsible for death scenes once the determination of death is established with Medical Control and the coroner has been notified. 6. If a patient is determined to be dead during transport, note the time & location and record this information on the patient care report. Immediately contact the coroner to discuss death jurisdiction. Do not cross county lines with a patient that has been determined to be dead. Coroner Notification Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 284 EMS providers should be aware of law enforcement's concern for preserving, collecting and using evidence. Anything at the scene may provide clues and evidence for the police. 1. Immediately notify law enforcement of any suspected crime scene (this does not necessarily include petty crimes or traffic violations). 2. If the victim is obviously dead, then he or she should remain undisturbed if at all possible. 3. Do not touch, move or relocate any item at the scene unless absolutely necessary to provide treatment to an injured, viable victim. Mark the location of any item that must be moved so the police can determine its original position. 4. Restrict access to the scene of onlookers or other unauthorized personnel on the premises of the crime. 5. Observe and note anything unusual ( e.g. smoke, odors, or weapons), especially if the evidence may not be present when law enforcement arrives. 6. Give immediate care to the patient. The fact that the patient is a probable crime victim should not delay prompt care to the patient. Remember that your role is to provide emergency care, not law enforcement. 7. Keep detailed records of the incident, including your observations of the victim and the scene of the crime. Lack of records about the case can be professionally embarrassing if called to testify. Reporting and Control of Suspected Crime Scenes Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 285 Only personnel licensed to perform care in the prehospital setting and certified in the Peoria Area EMS System are allowed to provide advanced patient care ( e.g. intubation, IV access, medication administration, pacing, etc.) at the scene unless approved by Medical Control. An on-scene physician (or other medical professional) does not automatically supersede the EMS provider's authority. Patient care shall not be relinquished to another person or provider unless approved by the EMS Medical Director or Medical Control. 1. If a professed, duly licensed medical professional ( e.g. physician, nurse, or dentist) wishes to participate in and/or direct patient care on scene, the EMS provider should contact Medical Control and inform the base station physician of the situation. 2. If the medical professional on scene (including the patient's primary care physic ian) has properly identified himself/herself and wishes to direct patient care, the base station physician must grant approval prior to acting on the on- scene medical professional's request. If care is relinquished to the professional on scene, he/she must accompany the patient to the hospital. This procedure should be explained to the provider prior to contacting Medical Control. 3. If an on-scene physician orders procedures or treatments that the EMS provider believes to be unreasonable, medically inacc urate, and/or outside the EMS provider's standard of care, the EMT should refuse to follow such orders and re-establish contact with Medical Control. In all circumstances, the EMS provider shall avoid any order or procedure that would be harmful to the patient. 4. If an on-scene medical professional (or any person claiming to be a healthcare provider) is obstructing EMS efforts or is substantially compromising patient care, the EMS provider should distract or redirect the interfering person, request law enforcement assistance and communicate the situation to Medical Control. 5. If EMS personnel or nursing staff from another system or jurisdiction (other than a requested intercept or mutual aid) are at the scene and request to provide or assist with patient care, excuse them from the scene if their assistance is not needed. If assistance is needed, these personnel may provide assistance with the supervision of the agency having jurisdiction of the scene. Peoria Area EMS System policies, procedures and protocols must be followed regardless of the assisting EMS personnel's authorized level of care. Physician (or Other Medical Professional) On Scene Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 286 Incidents involving school buses pose unique challenges to the EMS provider in assuring proper release of uninjured children. Once Medical Control confirms that the minor children are not injured, the custody and responsibility for these children will remain with the responding EMS provider until the children are transferred to parents, legal guardians, school officials or the hospital. If no procedure exists to have children transferred to a parent, legal guardian or school official, then these children will need to be transported to the hospital. On arrival at the scene, EMS personnel shall determine the category of the incident and request appropriate resources. EMS must also accomplish a complete assessment of the scene to include at least: Mechanism of injury Number of patients Damage to the vehicle Triage as outlined in the System Plan Once this has been accomplished, then the patients may be assigned to one of the following categories: CATEGORY A: Significant mechanism of injury ( i.e. rollover, high-speed impact, intrusion into the bus, etc.) - school bus occupancy indicates that at least one child may reasonably be expected to have significant injuries or significant injury is present in one or more children. All children in this category must be transferred to an appropriate hospital unless a Peoria Area EMS System refusal form is signed by a parent or legal guardian . CATEGORY B: Suspicious mechanism of injury ( i.e. speed of impact, some intrusion into the bus, etc.) - school bus occupancy indicates that at least one child may reasonably be expected to have minor injuries or minor injury in one or more children exists with no obvious mechanism of injury that could reasonably be expected to cause significant injuries. EMS personnel must complete the EMS Multiple Casualty Release Form and secure a signature of an appropriate school official . CATEGORY C: No obvious mechanism of injury - school bus occupancy indicates no injuries may be present and that the release of uninjured children may be the only EMS need. No injuries are found to be present in any of the children. EMS personnel must complete the EMS Multiple Casualty Release Form and secure a signature of an appropriate school official . CATEGORY D: If the pediatric patient(s) have special healthcare needs and/or communication difficulties, then all of these patients must be transported to the hospital for evaluation unless approval for release is received from Medical Control or a parent/legal guardian has signed the approved refusal form. Region 2 School Bus Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 287 1. After determining the category of the incident, EMS personnel shall determine the extent of EMS involvement and contact Medical Control . 2. Adults, victims 18 years and older, and occupants of other vehicles will be treated or released in accordance with routine System operating procedures. 3. If Medical Control has approved usage of this policy/plan, then each provider will implement their procedure for contacting parents, legal guardians or appropriate school officials to receive custody of uninjured children. 4. The approved system Multiple Casualty Release Form for school bus incidents must be utilized for all children who will not be transported. 5. Each child transported must have a completed run report. 6. One run report indicating the nature of the incident, etc. shall be completed and must include all information regarding the incident including the number of patients released. Keep a copy of this report with the release form or with refusal forms signed by the parents. 7. A parent, legal guardian or appropriate school official must be given a copy of the refusal/release form. 8. Any parent or legal guardian who arrives on scene to remove and assume responsibility for their child will be requested to sign an individual refusal form. 9. EMS providers shall use reasonable means to contact the parents or school officials. This could include use of telephone, cellular phone or direct contact by law enforcement. If contacted by phone, EMS providers shall take reasonable means to confirm the identity and authority of the parent, legal guardian or school official. 10. Once the identity and authority of the parent, legal guardian or school official has been established, the EMS provider may release the child to that individual or alternate transport source. School officials will follow their established program for informing parents or legal guardians regarding the incident. 11. The health and safety of the child is the primary concern. It is the responsibility of the EMS provider to assure that the child is returned to the parent or placed on the school's alternate transport vehicle. If the EMS provider on scene determines a child should receive a physician evaluation or be offered medical care, the child will be transported to the hospital unless a parent or legal guardian is on scene and consents to refusal. Region 2 School Bus Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 288 12. Each prehospital provider agency in the Peoria Area EMS System who may likely respond to a school bus incident must contact the school superintendents in their district to obtain the name and title of the \"appropriate school official\" who may take responsibility for the child on the bus involved in the incident. 13. Copies of documentation must be forwarded to the EMS Office (Quality Assurance Coordinator) for review within 24 hours of utilization of this policy. Region 2 School Bus Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 289 Insert EMS Multiple Casualty Release Form PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 290 WELL-BEING OF THE EMS PROVIDER PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 291 The following procedure has been established in accordance with the Illinois State Statutes, Centers for Disease Control recommendations and OSHA standards. All Peoria Area EMS System agencies should have a specific exposure control program and post exposure plan. 1. Utilization of body substance isolation gear during all patient contacts is an effective mans of avoiding exposure to body fluids. EMS personnel should don protective gear prior to entering a scene or situation that may increase the risk of exposure to body fluids or other infectious agents. 2. Thorough hand washing should be accomplished immediately after each patient contact or handling of potential infectious vectors. 3. EMS personnel should consult their agency's e xposure control program for specific guidelines in the type of protective gear. 1. An exposure incident has occurred when, as a result of the performance of an EMS provider's duty, the provider's eyes, mouth, mucous membrane or area of non -intact skin has come in contact with body fluids or other potentially infectious vector. This includes parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. 2. If EMS personnel treating and/or transporting a patient are directly exposed to a patient's b ody fluids or infectious vector, the provider(s) should immediately report the incident. This includes notifying the EMS provider's supervisor, obtaining the Peoria Hospitals Communicable Disease Incident Form and following post exposure procedures. After an exposure has occurred: 1. Thoroughly cleanse the exposed area with soap and water immediately. 2. The eyes and/or mouth of the provider should be thoroughly rinsed with water if exposed. 3. Immediately seek treatment at the emergency department where the source patient was transported. If the source patient was not transported to an emergency department, treatment should be sought at a local hospital (emergency department). Infectious Disease Control Policy Protective Measures Exposure Post Exposure Management PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 292 4. Complete the Peoria Hospitals Communicable Disease Incident Form . The completed form should be sealed in an envelope addressed with the words \"Attention Infection Control\" and be left with the emergency department charge nurse. The charge nurse will forward the envelope to the infection control department. The EMS provider should also provide a copy to his/her supervisor and to the EMS Office within 24 hours. 5. A request should be made for consent to test the source patient's blood for HBV/HCV/HIV infectivity. If consent is granted, a blood sample shall be drawn and results of testing documented. Testing is not necessary if the source patient is known to be infected with HBV or HIV. 6. Results of tests performed on the source patient shall be made available to the exposed EMS provider's private or occupational physician while main taining confidentiality of all persons involved. 7. The exposed EMS provider will be given the opportunity for a blood specimen collection and testing to determine baseline assessment for HBSAB/HIV. If the EMS provider does not wish to be tested, the blood sample must be maintained for 90 days. The EMS provider may consent to testing at any time within that period. 8. The EMS provider should follow-up with his/her private or occupational physician and the provider should be advised of available post-exposure counseling. 9. All findings or diagnosis shall remain confidential. Questions concerning exposure control program requirements or post exposure procedures should be directed to the EMS provider's supervisor, training officer or infection control department. 1. If a patient is suspected to have, or is diagnosed with a reportable communicable disease, a copy of the ambulance patient care report will be forwarded to Infection Control Department as soon as possible by the receiving hospital emergency department supervisor. 2. The Infection Control Department will maintain a log and file. If any patients treated and/or transported by EMS providers are diagnosed as having one of the specified diseases, the designated EMS provider(s) will be notified by the Infection Control Department within seventy-two (72) hours after the confirmed diagnosis is known.

Infectious Disease Control Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 295 A latex allergy is recognized as a significant problem for specific patients and healthcare workers. There are two (2) types: Systemic - Immediate reaction (within 15 minutes). Symptoms include generalized rash, wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angioedema, hypotension and cardiac arrest. Delayed - Delayed reaction (6 to 48 hours). Symptoms include contact dermatitis such as local itching, edema, erythema (redness), blisters, drying patches, crushing & thickening of the skin, and dermatitis that spreads beyond the skin initially exposed to the latex. Persons at risk include patients with spina bifida, patients with urogenital abnormalities, workers with industrial exposures to latex, healthcare workers, persons with multiple surgeries, persons with frequent urinary procedures and persons with a history of predisposition to allergies. 1. Assess for suspected latex sensitivity by asking the following: \"Do you react to rubber bands or balloons? Describe. \" 2. Initiate interventions for Known Latex Sensitivity if the latex sensitivity screen response suggests a latex hypersensitivity. 3. Notify the receiving hospital of suspected latex hypersensitivity. 4. Follow orders as per the Allergic/Anaphylactic Reaction Protocol . 1. Obtain a patient history and ask the patient to describe their symptoms of latex hypersensitivity. 2. Monitor the following signs and symptoms: Itching eyes Feeling of faintness Hypotension Bronchospasm/Wheezing Nausea/Vomiting Abdominal cramping Facial edema Latex Allergy Policy Suspected Latex Allergy Known Latex Allergy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 296 Flushing Urticaria Shortness of breath Generalized itching Tachycardia Feeling of impending doom 3. Notify the receiving hospital of known latex sensitivity. 4. Follow orders as per the Allergic/Anaphylactic Reaction Protocol . 5. Remove all loose latex items ( e.g. gloves, tourniquets, etc.) and place in a closed compartment or exterior storage panel. 6. Utilize available latex-free supplies when preparing to care for or transport the latex-sensitive patient. The latex-free supplies must be on the ambulance (or other apparatus) and readily available. 7. Cover the mattress of the cot with a sheet so that no areas of the mattress are exposed. 8. DO NOT administer any medications through latex IV ports. 9. Wrap all tubing containing latex in kling before coming into contact with the patient ( e.g. stethoscope tubing, BP cuff tubing, etc.). Known Latex Allergy (continued) Latex Allergy Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 297 The Peoria Area EMS System considers substance abuse (drug and/or alcohol dependency) to be a health problem and will assist any System provider who becomes dependent on drugs and/or alcohol. The System, and ultimately our patients, will suffer the adverse effects of having a provider whose work performance is below acceptable standards. Any EMS provider whose substance abuse problems jeopardize the safety of patients, co-workers or bystanders shall be deemed \"unfit to work\". Any EMS provider involved in the PAEMS System who voluntarily requests assistance with a personal substance abuse problem may contact their agency or the EMS Office for resources. The Peoria Area EMS System does not require EMS Providers to submit to blood and/or urine testing for drugs and/or alcohol as a routine part of their employment physical examination. However, individual agencies may require testing as part of the application process . Any prehospital provider may contact the EMS Medical Director (or his/her designee) if he/she has reasonable cause to suspect that a co-worker or student is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol while on duty. The EMS Medical Director may choose to require the System provider to submit to a blood alcohol test and/or blood/urine toxicology screening. The cost of this testing procedure may be billed to the provider's agency, or in the case of a student, the student. Disputes related to billing of drug testing should not delay the procedure(s). 1. If a System provider who is required to submit to testing for drugs and/or alcohol refuses to cooperate, or anyone caught tampering with, or attempting to tamper with his/her test specimen (or the specimen of any other prehospital care provider) he/she will be subject to disciplinary action for insubordination (up to and including permanent suspension/decertification from the System). 2. If any of the test results are positive, the EMS Medical Director will interview the provider. The EMS Medical Director will consult with the provider's agency to determine if referral to an assistance program shall occur. First Occurrence - results in a referral of the prehospital care provider to the appropriate assistance program and the provider will be subject to disciplinary action as determined by the EMS M edical Director in consultation with the provider's agency/employer. Second Occurrence - will result in disciplinary action as determined by the EMS Medical Director in consultation with the provider's agency/employer and may result in license decertification in the PAEMS System. Substance Abuse Policy Purpose : Policy: PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 298 Depending on the situation the EMS Medical Director may remove a student from a program with the first occurrence. 3. The progress of employees with substance abuse problems who have been referred to an assistance program will be closely monitored by their agency/employer and the EMS Medical Director. The provider must successfully complete the entire required rehabilitative program and maintain the preventative course of conduct prescribed by the assistance program. He/she must attend the appropriate after-care program(s) and provide verification of compliance with the program requirements, including additional drug testing as determined by the EMS Medical Director and the agency/employer. 4. If the prehospital care provider refuses to correct his/her health problems, he/she shall be subject to disciplinary action that pertains to all System providers who cannot, or are not, performing their job duties and responsibilities at acceptable levels. 5. The PAEMS Office can require random drug testing of any provider at any time. The use, sale, purchase, transfer, theft or possession of an illegal drug is a violation of the law. Illegal drug means any drug which is (a) not legally obtainable or (b) legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained. The term illegal drug includes prescription drugs not legally obtained and prescription drugs legally obtained but not being used for prescribed purposes. Anyone in violation will be referred to law enforcement, licensing and/or credentialing agencies when appropriate. Testing for Drugs & Alcohol (continued) Substance Abus e Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 299 There are certain emergencies that may have a lasting emotional effect on EMS personnel. These include emergencies involving children, co-worker, familiar or particularly close persons, multiple death situations and disaster incidents. The Heart of Illinois Critical Incident Stress Management Team is an important resource in assisting EMS personnel in coping with stressful experiences. 1. EMS providers of the Peoria Area EMS System involved in an unusually stressful incident can contact the Heart of Illinois Critical Incident Stress Management Team. 2. The CISM Team members have specialized training in providing pre-incident education, on- scene support services, defusing, demobilization, formal debriefings, one- on-one debriefings, follow-up services and specialty briefings. 3. Debriefings and stress management services are most effective when conducted within 72 hours of the incident. 4. The CISM Team Coordinator may be reached by contacting Medical Communications at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center at (309) 655-2564.

Minimum Requirements PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 316 The Peoria Area EMS System recognizes that EMS agencies must stock medications, including controlled substances, on site and on each licensed EMS vehicle to provide optimal patient care. An understanding of the risks associated with such practices, including the potential for abuse and diversion of such medications, is critically important, as are the development and maintenance of tracking mechanisms to prevent such events. This policy and procedure creates a mechanism for tracking controlled substances and identifying the personnel responsible for the inspection and accountability of these medications. Controlled substances will be kept on site in a designated locked cabinet and inside each licensed EMS vehicle in a drug box/cabinet with a numbered lock intact. When the EMS vehicle is not in use it will be locked. At the beginning of each shift, two EMS providers will count the controlled substances in the designated locked cabinet on site, verify the count is accurate, document the levels on the Narcotic Par Level Sheet, and both will sign the sheet. At the beginning of each shift, two EMS providers will verify the controlled substance tags on the vehicle drug box are secure and the tag numbers match the Controlled Substance Usage Form. Upon verification, both providers will sign the form. If the tag is not intact or the number is not verifiable, an inventory will be taken immediately, a supervisor will be notified, and an incident report will be submitted to the PAEMS Quality Assurance Coordinator within 24 hours of the finding. Each usage of a controlled substance will be documented on the Controlled Substance Usage Form. All items on the form must be completed. Any controlled substance that was opened, but was not administered must be properly disposed and witnessed by the other provider on the vehicle. The amount wasted must be noted on the Controlled Substance Usage Form, signed by the provider wasting the substance and the provider who witnessed the wastage. Controlled substances on the vehicle will be inspected each shift by an EMS provider. The inspection will be documented with previous and current tag numbers. Any discrepancies will be reported to supervisor immediately. If no discrepancies are found the Controlled Substance Usage Form will be signed by the EMS provider that administered medications during the call and witnessed by the other EMS provider on the vehicle during the call. Controlled Substances Policy Purpose Policy PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 317 When restock is needed, two EMS providers will restock the vehicle drug box from the designated locked cabinet on site, document the transaction on the Narcotic Par Level Sheet and the Controlled Substance Usage Form, and sign both. By signing the Narcotic Par Level Sheet and the Controlled Substance Usage Form, the EMS providers are confirming all of the controlled substances are secure, the counts are accurate, and the tag on the vehicle drug box is intact. At the end of each shift, the EMS provider will verify the tag on the controlled substances box on the vehicle is secure and the tag number matches the Controlled Substances Usage Form. New tag numbers must be documented on the form. The Narcotic Par Level Sheet, kept on site, will be changed at the end of each month. Thus, a new sheet will be started on the first day of each month. The individual agency will maintain the Narcotic Par Level Sheet and Controlled Substance Usage Forms and ensure all forms are available for inspection by IDPH, PAEMS Quality Assurance Coordinator, or any other authorized individual. The narcotic Par Level Substance Sheets and Controlled Substance Usage Forms will be kept on file for 7 years. If any agency is using an electronic locking/tracking device, an electronic report will be utilized to track the daily usage in the cabinet. A copy of the log may be requested by the Peoria Area EMS Office at any time.

Utilization of pediatric treatment guidelines and the extent of care rendered is based on the general impression of the pediatric patient's condition, physical examination findings and the history of the event. Patients 16 years or older will treated with adult protocols . The goal of the pediatric patient assessment process is similar to that of the adult patient. However, children are not \"little adults\". The causes of catastrophic events, such as cardiac arrest, are most often related to respiratory failure, shock or central nervous system injuries. Early recognition and treatment of the pediatric patient's injuries or illness is important to ensure the best outcome. Special attention and awareness must be g iven to the pediatric patient's exceptional ability to compensate for respiratory failure and shock. Vital signs are valuable in the assessment of the pediatric patient but do have significant limitations and be dangerously misleading. For example, hypotension is a late and often sudden sign of cardiovascular decompensation. Tachycardia (which varies by age group) will persist until cardiac reserve is depleted. Bradycardia is an ominous sign of impending cardiac arrest. Infants and children are able to maintain their blood pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance (shunting) and heart rate. The pediatric patient can be in compensated shock and exhibit a normal blood pressure and skin condition . This increases the importance of the EMS provider understanding of pediatric vital signs and behavior patterns. The EMS provider must establish a general impression of the pediatric patient. This impression, which is critical, should be done from the doorway of the room. Therefore, the pediatric patient will not be disturb ed by a \"hands -on\" assessment. A simple question to ask yourself is, \"How sick is this child?\" Three (3) key areas of importance of a general impression are: 1. Appearance 2. Work of breathing 3. Circulation to skin The three components are known as the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) established by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2000). Pediatric Assessment Process and Management 4 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Appearance The appearance of the pediatric patient should be assessed from the doorway. This is the most important aspect to consider when determining how sick or injured the child is. Appearance will give the EMS provider insight on oxygenation, neurological status and ventilation. Remember, the sick child may be alert on the conventional AVPU scale, but still have an abnormal appearance. Children need a more subtle assessment tool so that life-threatening injuries can be identified earlier. A good mnemonic to remember when assessing appearance is \"tickles\" (TICLS): Characteristic Features to look for: Tone Is he/she moving or resisting examination vigorously? Does he/she have good muscle tone? Or, is he/she limp, listless or flaccid? Interactiveness How alert is the child? How readily does a person, object, or sound distract him/her or draw his/her attention? Will he/she reach for, grasp and play with a toy or exam instrument such as a penlight or tongue blade? Or, is he/she uninter ested in playing or interacting with the caregiver or prehospital professional? Consolability Can he/she be consoled or comforted by the caregiver or by the prehospital professional? Or, is his/her crying or agitation unrelieved by gentle assurance? Look/Gaze Does he/she fix his/her gaze on a face? is there a \"nobody home,\" glassy -eyed stare? Speech/Cry Is his/her cry strong and spontaneous, or weak or high -pitched? Is the content of speech age -appropriate, or confused or garbled? The TICLS Mnemonic (PEPP/AAP 2nd Edition 2006) Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) 5 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Work of Breathing Assessing work of breathing must go beyond the rate and quality of respirations that is used for adult patients. Work of breathing is an accurate indicator of the oxygenation and ventilation status of the pediatric patient. This is another \"hands off\" evaluation method in order to avoid disturbing the pediatric patient and causing anymore respiratory distress (other than what is already present). Characteristic Features to look for: Abnormal Airway Sounds Snoring, muffled or hoarse speech; stridor; grunting; wheezing Abnormal Positioning Sniffing position, tripoding, lie down Retractions Supraclavicular, of the chest bobbing\" in infants Flaring Flaring of the nares on inspiration Characteristics of Work of Breathing (PEPP/AAP 2nd Edition 2006) Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) 6 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Circulation to Skin A rapid circulatory assessment is needed to determine the perfusion status of the pediatric patient. The key is to assess the core perfusion status of the child. Assessing the skin and mucous membranes can do this. Circulation to the skin reflects the overall status of core circulation. Charact eristic Features to look for: Pallor White or pale skin/mucous membrane coloration from inadequate blood flow Mottling Patchy skin discoloration due vasoconstriction/vasodilation Cyanosis Bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes Characteristics of Circulation to Skin (PEPP/AAP 2nd Edition 2006) Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) 7 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Putting it all Together The goal of pediatric patient care is to identify patients in shock or at risk of shock, initiating care that will directly assist maintaining the patient's perfusion and safely transporting the patient to an emergency department or trauma center in a timely manner. The benefit of remaining on scene to establish specific treatments versus prompt transport to a definitive care facility should be a consideration of each patient contact. Requesting advanced assistance is another important resource that BLS & ILS providers should consider.

Infant (1-12 Months): Approach the infant slowly and calmly. Fast motion and loud noises may startle or agitate the infant. Use warm hands and assessment tools. Avoid doing anything potentially painful or distressing until after the assessment is completed. Have the caregiver assist in care - this is less threatening to the infant. Children over six (6) months of age are usually best examined in the arms of a parent. \"Stranger anxiety\" may be present and could eliminate other assessment options. If needed, calm the infant with a pacifier, blanket or favorite toy. Toddler (1-3 Years): Approach the toddler slowly. Keep physical contact at a minimum until he/she feels familiar with you. Perform the assessment at the level of the toddler by sitting or squatting next to them and allow the toddler to remain in the caregiver's lap whenever possible. Assessment should be toe to head . This is less threatening to the toddler. Give limited choices such as \"Do you want me to listen to your chest or fe el your wrist first?\" Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Age Definitions & Assessment Considerations 9 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Toddler (1-3 Years) {Continued}: Use simple, concrete terms and continually reassure the toddler. Do not expect the toddler to sit still and cooperate - be flexible. Preschooler (3-5 Years): A preschool aged child is a \"magical thinker.\" Concrete concepts must be described in short, simple terms. A preschooler is often very cooperative during the assessment process and may be able to provide a history. Questions should be simple and direct. Allow the child to handle equipment. Use distractions. Do not lie to the child. If the procedure is going to hurt, tell them. Set limits on behavior ( e.g. \"You can cry or scream, but don't bite or kick.\"). Focus on one thing at a time. Play games with immobilized preschoolers to distract him/her and prevent them from squirming. Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Age Definitions & Assessment Considerations 10 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL School Age (5-13 Years): The school aged child is usually cooperative and can be the primary sources for the patient history. Explain all procedures simply and completely and respect the patient's modesty. Substance abuse issues may be present in this age group and should be considered during the care of altered level of consciousness cases. Children at this age are afraid of losing control, so let him/her be involved in the care. However, do not negotiate patient care unless the child really has a choice. Reassure the child that being ill or injured is not a punishment and praise them for cooperating. Adolescent (13-16 Years): The adolescent is more of an adult than a child and should be treated as such . Depending on the nature of the problem, an accurate history may not be possible with parents observing. It may be necessary to separate the parent and child during the assessment. Regardless of who is present, respect the patient's modesty. Avoid exposing the adolescent unnecessarily. Explain what you are doing and why you are doing it! Show respect - speak to the adolescent directly. Do not turn to the caregiver for the initial information. Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Pediatric Age Definitions & Assessment Considerations 11 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 1. Scene Size- Up Note anything suspicious at the scene ( e.g. medications, household chemicals, other ill family members, etc.). Assess for any discrepancies between the history and the patient presentation ( e.g. infant fell on hard floor but there is carpet throughout the house). 2. General Approach to the Stable/Conscious Pediatric Patient Utilize the PAT (Pediatric Assessment Triangle) to gain a general impression of the child. Assessments and interventions must be tailored to each child in terms of age, size and development. Smile, if appropriate to the situation. Keep voice at an even, quiet tone - do not yell. Speak slowly. Use simple, age appropriate terms. Keep small children with their caregiver(s) whenever possible and complete assessment while the caregiver is holding the child. Kneel down to the level of the child if possible. Be cautious in the use of touch. In the stable child, make as many observations as possible before touching (and potentially upsetting) the child. Adolescents may need to be interviewed without their caregivers present if accurate information is to be obtained regarding drug use, alcohol use, LMP, sexual activity or child abuse. Observe general appearance and determine if behavior is age appropriate. Observe for respiratory distress or extreme pain. Look at the position of the child. What is the level of consciousness? Muscle tone: good vs. limp. Movement: spontaneous, purposeful or symmetrical. Color: pink, pale, flushed, cyanotic or mottled. Obvious injuries: bleeding, bruising, gross deformities, etc. Determine weight - ask patient, caregiver(s) or use Broselow tape. Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Assessment of the Pediatric Patient 12 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 3. Initial Assessment Airway access/maintenance with c-spine control Maintain with assistance: positioning Maintain with adjuncts: oral airway, nasal airway Listen for any audible airway noises ( e.g. stridor, snoring, gurgling, wheezing) Patency: suction secretions as necessary Breathing Rate & rhythm of respirations - compare to normal rate for age and situation Chest expansion - symmetrical? Breath sounds - compare both sides and listen for sounds (present, absent, normal, abnormal) Positioning - sniffing position, tripod position Work of breathing - retractions, nasal flaring, accessory muscle use, head bobbing, grunting Circulation Heart rate - compare to normal rate for age and situation Central pulses ( e.g. brachial, carotid, femoral) - strong, pulses ( e.g. radial) - present/absent, thready, weak or strong Color - pink, pale, flushed, cyanotic, mottled Skin temperature - hot, warm, cool, or cold Blood pressure - use appropriately sized cuff and compare to normal for the age of the child Hydration status - observe anterior fontanel in infants, mucous membranes, skin turgor, crying tears, urine output, history to determine Pediatric Assessment Process and Management Assessment of the Pediatric Patient 13 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Disability - Brief Neurological Examination: Assess responsiveness - APGAR or TICLS Assess pupils Assess for transient numbness/tingling Expose and Examine: Expose the patient as appropriate based on age and severity of illness. Initiate measures to prevent heat loss and keep the child from becoming hypothermic. 4. Rapid Assessment vs. Focused History & Physical Assessment Tailor assessment to the needs and age of the patient. Rapidly examine areas specific to the chief complaint. Responsive medical patients : Perform focused assessment based on chief complaint. A full review of systems may not be necessary. If the chief complaint is vague, examine all systems and proceed to detailed exam. Unresponsive medical patients : Perform rapid assessment ( i.e. ABCs & a quick head- to-toe exam). Render emergency care based on signs & symptoms, initial impression and standard operating procedures. Proceed to detailed exam. Trauma patients with NO significant mechanism of injury : Focused assessment is based on specific injury site. Trauma patients with significant mechanism of injury : Perform rapid assessment of all body systems and then proceed to detailed exam. 5. Detailed Assessment SAMPLE history - acquire/incorporate into physical exam.

There are circumstances in pediatric emergency care as determined by local medical control where it would be appropriate to transport directly to an emergency department of a Pediatric Critical Care Center, \"PCCC\" (OSF St. Francis) . Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to the following: Prolonged seizures or status seizure activity A lethargic infant or child Cardiac arrest or Respiratory arrest Significant toxic ingestion history Severe respiratory distress (cyanosis or moderate to severe hypoxia) Massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleed Life threatening dysrhythmias Compromised airw ay Signs or symptoms of shock or sepsis Trauma based on EMSC Pediatric Trauma guidelines. 2. If the pediatric patient's condition becomes unmanageable or exceeds the capability of the transporting unit (i.e. cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest) the patient should be treated at the closest most appropriate facility. 3. Call medical control for physician decision regarding destination determination. If the transport time is going to be greater than 30 minutes to the Pediatric Critical Care Center (PCCC), Medical control may consider having the transporting unit stop at the closest hospital for stabilization. 4. Pediatric emergency air ambulance transports should go directly to a Pediatric Critical Care Center (PCCC). Pediatric Destination Determination Protocol 16 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and establishing initial care to treat and prevent shock: 1. Open and/or maintain an open airway. Have suction equipment readily available to suction nose and mouth as needed. 2. Protect the child from environmental exposure. Give special consideration to the warmth of the infant ( e.g. cover the head to prevent heat loss). 3. Reassure the patient and caregiver(s). Speak softly and calmly, maintaining conversation and explanation of exam and treatment. Use age-appropriate communication techniques. 4. Patient positioning will be based on assessment / patient condition, age / development and safety. Both the patient and caregiver should have the appropriate safety restraint devices / seat belts in place for transport. 5. Administer oxygen, preferably 10-15 L/min via non-rebreather mask (either on the child's face or holding the mask close to th e face). If the patient does not tolerate a mask, then administer 4-6 L/min by nasal cannula. 6. Ensure that EMS has been activated for further care and transport. Provide responding units with pertinent patient information. 7. Monitor the patient's level of consciousness, vital signs, etc. for any acute changes. Routine Pediatric Care Protocol First Responder Care 17 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL BLS Care should be directed at conducting a thorough patient assessment, providing care to treat for shock and preparing or providing patient transportation. 1. BLS Care includes the components of First Responder Care . 2. Attach pulse oximeter and obtain analysis, if indicated. 3. Attach cardiac monitor and print rhythm strip for documentation, if indicated. 4. Initiate ALS intercept, if indicated (or ILS intercept if ALS is unavailable). 5. Simultaneously with above, perform physical exam/assessment, obtain baseline vital signs and obtain patient history. 6. Establish on-line Medical Control as indicated. 7. Continue to reassess patient en route to the hospital. 8. Transport should be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity. ILS Care should be directed at conducting a thorough patient assessment, providing care to treat for shock and preparing or providing patient transportation. The necessity of establishing IV access is determined by the patient's condition and chief complaint. Consideration should also be given to the proximity of the receiving facility. 1. ILS Care includes all of the components of BLS Care . 2. If indicated, establish IV access using a 1000mL solution of .9% Normal Saline with macro drip or blood tubing. No more than one (1) attempt should be made on scene. Infuse at a rate to keep the vein open (TKO) - approximately 8 to 15 drops (gtts) per minute. Dependent upon patient condition, consider initiating IV access en route to the hospital. Routine Pediatric Care Protocol BLS Care ILS Care 18 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL ALS Care should be directed at conducting a thorough patient assessment, providing care to treat for shock and preparing or providing patient transportation. The necessity of establishing IV access is determined by the patient's condition and chief complaint. Consideration should also be given to the proximity of the receiving facility. 1. ALS Care includes all of the components of ILS Care . Routine Pediatric Care Protocol ALS Care Critical Thinking Elements When determining the extent of care needed to stabilize the pediatric patient, the EMS provider should take into consideration the patient's presentation, chief complaint, risk of shock and proximity to the receiving facility. IV access in pediatric patients i s difficult and may complicate the situation. Indications and benefits vs. patient disturbance and complications should be considered. If the patient exhibits signs of shock, administer fluid bolus (.9% Normal Saline) at 20mL/kg over 2 minutes. If the ped iatric patient is in emergent need of fluids and/or medications ( i.e. cardiac arrest, trauma, decompensated shock or severe burns) and peripheral IV access is unobtainable, proceed with intraosseous infusion ( ALS only ). Saline locks may be used as a drug a dministration route if fluid replacement is not indicated. IV access should not significantly delay initiation of transportation or be attempted on scene with a trauma patient meeting load -and-go criteria. 19 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Establishing and maintaining an open airway and assuring adequate ventilation is a treatment priority with all patients. Proper techniques must be used to assure treatment maneuvers do not inadvertently complicate the patient's condition. Special consideration needs to be given when caring for the pediatric airway due to anatomical differences from the adult. 1. Assure an open airway by utilizing either the head tilt/chin lift maneuver or the modified jaw thrust maneuver (without head-tilt). The head tilt/chin lift maneuver is NOT to be used if there is any possibility of cervical spine injury. 2. Expose the chest and visualize for chest rise and movement, simultaneously listen and feel for air movement at the mouth and nose. This procedure will need to be done initially and after correcting an obstruction and securing the airway. 3. If the chest is not rising and air exchange cannot be heard or felt: a) Deliver two positive-pressure ventilations. If resistance continues, follow AHA sequences for obstructed airway rescue. b) Reassess breathing and check for a brachial or carotid pulse. c) If spontaneous respirations return and a pulse is present, provide supplemental oxygen by non-rebreather mask or assist respirations with bag-valve mask (BVM) at 15 L/min. d) If the patient remains breathless and a pulse is present, initiate ventilations with a BVM at 15 L/min at a rate of 20-30 breaths per minute. e) If the patient remains breathless and a pulse is not present, initiate CPR and institute the appropriate cardiac protocol. 4. If the patient presents with stridor, \"noisy breathing\" or snoring respirations, render treatment for partial airway obstruction in accordance with AHA guidelines: a) Reassess effectiveness of the airway maneuver. b) If initially unable to resolve partial airway obstruction, suction the airway and visualize the pharynx for any evidence of foreign objects. Perform a finger sweep if a foreign object can be seen. Do not perform a blind finger sweep . c) If partial airway obstruction persists, treat according to AHA guidelines for resolving a complete airway obstruction. Basic Airway Management of the Pediatric Patient Basic Airway Control 20 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL 5. Once the obstruction has been corrected: a) Insert an oropharyngeal airway in the unconscious patient (without a gag reflex). b) Insert a nasopharyngeal airway in the conscious patient or an unconscious patient with a gag reflex. Note: Do not use a nasopharyngeal airway if the possibility of head injury exists. 6. Establish the presence and adequacy of breathing by observing the frequency, depth and consistency of respirations. Also, observe the chest wall for any indications of injuries which may contribute to respiratory compromise. 7. Supplemental oxygen should be delivered to any patient who exhibits signs of difficulty breathing, sensation of shortness of breath, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, altered level of consciousness/altered mental status, cyanosis, cardiac symptoms, head injury or any indications of shock. a) Supplemental oxygen should be provided by a non-rebreather mask (NRM) at a rate of 10-15 L/min (assuring reservoir bag is inflated). b) If patient is unable to tolerate the NRM, administer oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 4-6 L/min. 8. Bag-valve mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen at 15 L/min should be initiated at the rate of 20-30/min if respirations are absent, there is evidence of inadequate ventilation, absent or diminished breath sounds or wounds to the chest wall. Basic Airway Control (continued) Basic Airway Management of the Pediatric Patient 21 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Critical Thinking Elements The pediatric airway varies anatomically from the adult airway. The airway is smaller and more flexible, the tongue is relatively larger and the glottis is higher. These differences must be taken into consideration when positioning the head to maintain the airway ( i.e. less hyperextension is needed to open the pediatr ic airway than the adult). Mucous, blood and vomit may easily block the pediatric airway. Therefore, careful attention must be given to clear the airway and appropriate pediatric suction equipment should be available. Inadequate maintenance of the patient 's airway, inappropriate airway maneuvers, using inappropriately sized airway equipment and/or failure to recognize an obstructed airway will complicate the patient's condition and can lead to bradyarrythmias / cardiac arrest. Do NOT use the head tilt/chin lift maneuver on a patient with a suspected cervical spine injury. Proper facemask seal during artificial ventilations is imperative to assure adequate ventilation. Inadequate oxygen delivery settings ( i.e. too low) will complicate the patient's condition . Basic Airway Management of the Pediatric Patient 22 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL An airway obstruction is life threatening and must be corrected immediately upon discovery. 1. If the patient has an obstructed airway and is still conscious: a) Encourage the patient to cough. b) Perform 5 abdominal thrusts (5 back blows & 5 chest thrusts in the infant) if the cough is unsuccessful. c) Repeat until the obstruction is relieved or the patient becomes unconscious. d) Administer oxygen at 15 L/min if the patient has a partial airway obstruction and is still able to breathe. 2. If the patient is unconscious: a) Open the patient's airway and attempt to ventilate. b) Reposition the head and reattempt to ventilate if initial attempt is unsuccessful. c) Perform 5 abdominal thrusts (5 back blows/chest thrusts in the infant). d) Remove object if visualized. Do not perform a blind finger sweep of the patient's mouth . Reattempt to ventilate. e) Repeat step (c) if obstruction persists. f) BLS & ILS immediately initiate ALS intercept. g) ILS & ALS attempt direct extraction via laryngoscope and Magill forceps. 1. Use the laryngoscope and examine the upper airway for foreign matter and suction as needed. 2. Remove any foreign objects with forceps and suction. 3. Re-establish an open airway and attempt to ventilate. 4. If the obstruction is relieved, continue with airway control, ventilations, assessment and care. h) Continue abdominal thrusts (or back blows/chest thrusts) sequence if unable to relieve obstruction and expedite transport. Critical Thinking Elements Maintain in -line c -spine stabilization using 2 EMTs in patients with suspected cervical spine injury. Poor abdominal/chest thrust technique, inappropriate airway maneuvers, and/or failure to recogni ze an obstructed airway will complicate the patient's condition. Pediatric Airway Obstruction Procedure 23 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL The KING Airway is an effective airway adjunct when basic airway control is difficult or ineffective. Insertion is rapid & easy and does not require specialized equipment or visualization of the larynx. It is latex-free and should be considered safe to use on latex- sensitive patients. The King LTD is an airway device designed for emergency or difficult intubation in the apneic or unresponsive patient without a gag reflex. Active gag reflex Ingestion of a caustic substance ( e.g. gasoline, drain cleaner, etc.) Known or suspected esophageal disease (e.g. esophageal varices) Tracheostomy (ETCO 2 monitoring will be ineffective with esophageal placement) 1. Pre-oxygenate/ventilate utilizing a bag-valve mask (BVM) at 15 L/min according to the Basic Airway Control Procedure . 2. Choose the correct size: King LTD Size 2 2.5 Connector Color Green Orange Patient Criteria 35-45 inches or 12-25 kg 41-51 inches or 25-35 kg Cuff Volume 25-35 mL 30-40 mL 3. Test cuff inflation system by injecting the maximum recommended volume of air into the cuffs. Remove all air from both cuffs prior to insertion. 4. Apply a water-based lubricant ( e.g. K-Y or Surgilube) to the beveled distal tip and posterior aspect of the tube. Avoid introducing lubricant in or near the ventilatory openings.

Position the head in the \"sniffing position\" if possible. It can also be inserted with the head in the neutral position if following c-spine precautions/c-collar in place. 6. Hold the KING LTD at the connector with the dominant hand. With the non- dominant hand, hold mouth open and apply chin lift. 7. With the KING LTD rotated laterally 45-90o (such that the blue orientation line is touching the corner of the mouth), introduce tip into the mouth and advance behind the base of the tongue. Never force the tube into position and do not take longer than 20 seconds for the attempt! 8.

The majority of pediatric patients found in non- traumatic cardiac arrest are found to have some form of airway obstruction or respiratory failure. Providing good BLS care with regards to relieving foreign body airway obstructions and/or initiating CPR, pediatric patients have a better chance at a positive outcome. Adequate ventilation is the most important step in pediatric resuscitation. First Responder Care should be focused on confirming that the patient is in full arrest and in need of CPR. Resuscitative efforts should be initiated by opening the airway and initiating ventilations & chest compressions while attaching a defibrillator. It is important to assure that CPR is being performed correctly following AHA guidelines. 1. Determine unresponsiveness. Confirm that a transporting unit (and ALS intercept) has been activated. 2. Maintain patent airway and assess breathing. If breathing is absent or inadequate, give two (2) rescue breaths with a barrier device. 3. Check for pulse (10 seconds). If pulseless, begin CPR . The patient should be ventilated at 20-30 breaths/min using oxygen at 15 L/min via BVM . 4. Apply an AED after 2 minutes of CPR to determine if defibrillation is needed. a) If PEDIATRIC PADS are available - apply as pictured on each of the AED electrodes with proper contact and without any overlap of the pads. If overlap of the pads occurs, use anterior (front) / posterior (back) placement with cervical spine precautions if neck/back injury is suspected. b) If ADULT PADS only - apply anterior (front) / posterior (back) with cervical spine precautions if neck/back injury is suspected (see diagram at the end of this protocol). 5. Continue CPR until the AED is attached and turned on. Stop CPR when the AED is analyzing: a) If the AED indicates \"SHOCK ADVISED\", call out \" CLEAR!\" check for the safety of others, and push the SHOCK button (or stand clear if the AED device does not require shock activation). b) Immediately resume CPR for 2 minutes .

Shock if indicated. h) If the patient regains a pulse at any time during resuscitation, then maintain the airway and assist ventilations. i) Re-analyze the patient's rhythm with the AED if the patient returns to a pulseless state. Shock if indicated. 6. Immediately turn patient care over to the transporting provider or ALS intercept crew upon their arrival. 7. Complete all necessary cardiac arrest documentation. BLS Care should focus on maintaining the continuity of care by confirming the patient is in cardiac arrest and continuing resuscitative efforts initiated by the First Responders. Transporting BLS units should initiate an ALS intercept as soon as possible. 1. BLS transport care includes all of the components of First Responder Care . 2. Shocks delivered to the patient prior to the transporting unit arriving on scene should be taken into consideration during the transition of care.

ALS Care (continued) Pediatric Ingestion / Overdose / Toxic Exposure Protocol 89 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL The majority of pediatric contacts the prehospital professional will face involve traumatic injuries. Trauma care in the pediatric patient must be aggressive, due to the child's ability to compensate and mask otherwise obvious signs and symptoms of shock. Early recognition of potential life-threatening injuries due to trauma will help save the pediatric patient. In addition, pediatric patients may not always have obvious injuries. The anatomical position and size of internal organs are drastically different compared to the adult trauma patient. Children may not bruise or show marks of impact, thus disguising underlying life-threatening problems. When the pediatric patient presents as a possible trauma patient, treat them as such. Stay within the \" platinum 10 minutes \" of scene time, effectively immobilize the spine, keep the child warm and treat pain and anxiety. First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 1. Scene Assessment (Scene Size-Up) Ensure scene safety - identify any hazards (e.g. fire, downed power lines, unstable vehicle, leaking fuel, weapons). Determine the number of patients. Identify the mechanism of injury (gunshot wound, vehicle rollover, high speed crash, ejection from the vehicle). Identify special extrication needs, if any. Call for additional resources if needed. 2. Primary Survey (Initial Assessment) The purpose of the primary assessment is for the prehospital provider to rapidly identify and manage life-threatening conditions: Obtain a general impression of the patient's condition. Assess, secure and maintain a patent airway while simultaneously using C-spine precautions. Assess breathing and respiratory effort: Approximate respiratory rate. Assess quality of respiratory effort (depth of ventilation and movement of air). Oxygen : 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask. Be prepared to suction the airway and support the patient's respirations with BVM if necessary.

Secondary Survey (Focused History & Physical Exam) The secondary survey is a head- to-toe evaluation of the patient performed in a toe-to-head method. The object of this survey is to identify injuries or problems that were not identified during the primary survey. Examine the head: Search for any soft tissue injuries. Palpate the bones of the face & skull to identify deformity, depression, crepitus or other injury. Check pupils for size, reactivity to light, equality, accommodation, roundness and shape. Examine the neck: Examine for contusions, abrasions, lacerations or other injury. Check for JVD, tracheal deviation, deformity. Palpate the c-spine for deformity Examine the chest: Closely examine for deformity, contusions, redness, abrasions, lacerations, penetrating trauma or other injury. Look for flail segments, paradoxical movement & crepitus. Auscultate breath sounds. Watch for supraclavicular and intercostal retractions. Examine the abdomen: Examine for contusions, redness, abrasions, lacerations, penetrating trauma or other injury. Palpate the abdomen and examine for tenderness, rigidity and distention.

CONTACT MEDICAL CONTROL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE Critical Thinking Elements Prompt transport with EARLY Medical Control contact & receiving hospital notification will expedite the care of the trauma patient. IVs should be established en route to the hospital thereby not delaying transport of critical trauma patients (unless scene time is extended due to prolonged extricati on). Trauma patients should be transported to the closest most appropriate Trauma Center. Medical Control should be contacted immediately if there is ANY question as to which Trauma Center the patient should be transported to. Children are prone to hypoth ermia in traumatic situations - keep the patient warm!!!! Routine Pediatric Trauma Care Protocol 94 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL The pediatric patient in shock can pose a challenge to the prehospital professional. Since pediatric patients have young, strong cardiovascular systems, they can compensate extremely well. This can mask the signs and symptoms of shock until the child's cardiovascular system tires and begins to decompensate. Once the pediatric patient enters into a state of decompensated shock, prognosis for a full recovery is poor. Conditions that may indicate impending shock include: Significant mechanism of injury Tender and/or distended abdomen Pelvic instability Bilateral femur fractures \"Load & Go\" with any trauma patient with signs and symptoms of shock - on scene treatment should be minimal. Conduct a Primary Survey , manage the airway, take C- spine precautions & immobilize and control any life-threatening hemorrhage. Contact Medical Control as early as possible.

ALS Care Critical Thinking Elements Pediatric patients will compensate for shock as long as they have the energy to do so. Once pediatric patients start to decompensate due to shock, it is exceedingly difficult to reverse the process. Therefore, it is imperative that shock is identified and treated early! Pediatric Shock Protocol 97 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL The causes of closed head injuries in pediatric patients are numerous. Injuries resulting from vehicular accidents or failure to wear proper safety gear (e.g. helmets) are common. The most effective way of determining the extent of closed head injury is mechanism of injury and level of consciousness. The head is the largest body part of a pediatric patient which makes him/her \"top heavy\" and to fall head first during a trauma. The head is usually more seriously injured than any other area of the body in pediatric trauma. Proper management of a closed head injury patient can impact long term damage. Priorities for the treatment of head injury patients include airway management, maintenance of adequate oxygenation & blood pressure as well as appropriate C-spine control & immobilization.

Special attention should be given to limit further pain and damage of the burn to the patient. However, burn care should not interfere with lifesaving measures. One aspect of pediatric burn care is different and prehospital providers need to be aware of it - suspicious burns . Suspicious burns include burns that have a familiar pattern (e.g. circumferential burns, burns from a cigarette lighter, etc.) or a story that does not fit the injury sustained. Pediatric burns carry a high index of suspicion for abuse and neglect. Follow local protocol for reporting abuse and neglect if suspected. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation, removing the child from harm and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as beginning treatment for shock. 1.

Be prepared to support the patient's respirations with BVM if necessary. 4. THERMAL BURN TREATMENT : a) If the burn occurred within the last 20 minutes, reverse the burning process and cool the area by flushing the area with 1 Liter of Sterile Saline (or Sterile Water if Sterile Saline is not available). The goal of cooling is to extinguish the burning process - not to systemically cool the patient. Fluid application should be held to a minimum and discontinued if the patient begins shivering. b) Remove jewelry and loose clothing. Do not pull away clothing that is stuck to the burn. c) Cover the wound with sterile dressings*** d) Place a sterile burn sheet on the stretcher. If the patient's posterior is burned, place a sterile burn pad on top of the sheet with the absorbent side toward the patient. Pediatric Burn Protocol First Responder Care 103 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL e) Place patient on the stretcher. f) Cover the patient with additional sterile burn sheets and blanket to conserve body heat. 5. ELECTRICAL BURN TREATMENT : a) Assure that the power service has been cut off and remove the patient from the source of electricity. b) Fully immobilize the patient due to forces of electrical current and possible trauma. c) Assess for entry and exit wounds. No cooling or flushing is necessary due to the type of burn. d) Cover the burn with dry, sterile dressings. e) Closely monitor the patient. 6. CHEMICAL BURN TREATMENT : a) Consider possible scene and patient contamination and follow agency safety procedures. b) Note which chemical agent caused the burn and obtain the MSDS for that chemical (if possible). c) The patient's clothing should be completely removed to prevent continued exposure and the patient decontaminated prior to being placed in the ambulance for transport. d) Dry chemical powder should be brushed off before applying water. e) Irrigate the patient with Sterile Water and if the MSDS indicates use of water will not cause an adverse reaction.

ALS Care (continued) Pediatric Burn Protocol 106 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Heat-related emergencies can often be seen in the pediatric population involved in intense sporting activities. When the body loses the ability to cool itself off, the body will retain heat, elevating core body temperature. If the core body temperature rises above normal, physiological consequences can develop. These can range from muscle cramps up to loss of consciousness and death. The treatment of hyperthermic injuries is basic if caught early. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as beginning treatment for shock. 1. Render initial care in accordance with the Routine Pediatric Care Protocol . 2. Move the patient to a cool environment. Remove clothing as necessary to make the patient comfortable.

ALS Care Pediatric Heat -Related Emergencies Protocol 109 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Heat Disorders Heat (Muscle) Cramps - Heat cramps are muscle cramps caused by overexertion and dehydration in the presence of high temperatures. Signs & symptoms include: Normal or slightly elevated body temperature; generalized weakness; dizziness; warm, moist skin and cramps in the fingers , arms, legs or abdominal muscles. Heat Exhaustion - Heat exhaustion is an acute reaction to heat exposure and the most common heat -related illness a prehospital provider will encounter. Signs & symptoms include : Increased body temperature ; generalized weakness; cool, diaphoretic skin; rapid, shallow breathing; weak pulse; possible loss of . Heatstroke - Heatstroke occurs when the body's hypothalamic temperature regulation is lost. Cell death and damage to the brain, liver and kidneys can occur. Signs & symptoms include: Cessation of sweating; very high core body temperature; hot, usually dry skin; deep , rapid, shallow respirations (which later slow); rapid, full pulse (which later slows); hypotension; confusion, disorientation or unconsciousness and possible seizures. Fever (Pyrexia) - A fever is the elevation of the body temperature above the normal temperature for that person (~ 98.6o F +/- 2 degrees). Fever is sometimes difficult to differentiate from heatstroke; however, there is usually a history of infection or illness with a fever. Pediatric Heat -Related Emergencies Protocol 110 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Hypothermia in children is common at any time of the year. Children dissipate heat faster than adults due to their body mass compared to the surface area of skin. EMS providers must suspect an onset of hypothermia in all cold environmental emergencies, child neglect and trauma. Rapid identification and treatment of hypothermia can have a significant effect on the outcome of the pediatric patient. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as beginning treatment for shock. 1.

There is no profile of the \"typical\" family in which abuse is taking place. Maltreatment of children affects all socio-economic classes. As EMS professionals, we need to be aware of the warning signs, treat the injuries of the child and report accordingly. First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 1. Consider scene safety issues: a) If the offender is present and interferes with transportation of the patient, or is influencing the patient's acceptance of medical care, contact law enforcement and Medical Control for consultation on the appropriate action to take. b) If the parent/guardian refuses to allow transportation of the child, contact law enforcement and Medical Control for consultation on the appropriate action to take. 2. Render initial care in accordance with the Routine Pediatric Care Protocol . 3. Treat obvious injuries or illnesses. 4. Survey the scene for evidence of factors that could adversely affect the child's welfare: a) Environmental b) Interaction with parents/guardians c) Discrepancies in the history of events d) Injury patterns inconsistent with history of events or anticipated motor skills based on the child's growth and development stage. e) Signs of intentional injury or emotional harm. 5. Transport regardless of extent of injuries. 6. Upon arrival at the ED, notify the receiving physician or nurse of the suspected maltreatment. Remember - healthcare workers (including EMTs/Paramedics) are mandated by Illinois state law to report cases of suspected abuse or neglect to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) by calling 1-800-252- 2873.

SIDS is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States and the causes are not known. The death of a child is a horrible event and creates difficult emotional issues for the caregivers as well as for the prehospital professional. The infant may be in the care of a parent/caregiver or babysitter at the time of death and may not be at home. Absence of one or both parents may complicate field management and interactions at the scene (PEPP 2001). First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 1. Render initial care in accordance with the Routine Pediatric Care Protocol . 2. If obvious signs of biological death are present (pulseless, apneic, cold skin, frothy/blood tinged fluid in the mouth, lividity, dark red mottling on the body, rigor mortis ): a) Confirm absence of breathing and pulse. b) Confirm asystole in two (2) or more leads. c) Contact Medical Control and follow procedures for death at scene. d) Provide for the needs of the family: Have at least one prehospital professional stay with the family until a support network is established. Contact support personnel: Clergy Other family members Friends Professional counselors 3. Consider the possibility of child maltreatment: a) Refer to Suspected Child Maltreatment Protocol . b) Obtain past medical history and the history of events. Refrain from asking judgmental or leading questions. Do not place blame or accusations. 4. Consider CISM for prehospital personnel. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Protocol 119 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Protocol Critical Thinking Elements The decision of staying on scene or transporting a dead infant to the ED is a difficult one. Consider these factors: a) Could this be a crime scene? b) Am I giving false hope to the family? The prehospital caregiver cannot determine the true cause of death in an infant. Therefore, do not rus h to judgment. Treat every caregiver as a grieving parent regardless of the situation. There are nearly 3000 SIDS cases per year in the United States: a) 90-95% of SIDS cases are less than 6 months old. b) Premature infants are at higher risk for SIDS c) SIDS case s occur more frequently in males & during the winter months. d) 5% of SIDS cases are actually due to child neglect. 120 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL No Extra **Divide dose in 1/2 and administer 10 minutes apart to reduce runoff**200 mcg (4.0 ml)(+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) (+ 0.1 ml) No Extra **(+ 0.1 ml)** ml) mcg (0.6 ml) 40 mcg (0.8 ml) 50 mcg (1.0 ml) 60 mcg (1.2 ml) 90 mcg (1.8 ml) 100 mcg (2.0 ml) 110 mcg (2.2 ml) 120 Lbs) 121 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PEDIATRIC PREHOSPITAL CARE MANUAL Dose (mL) Dose (mL) 0.7 ml 0.3 mL 1.3 ml 0.4 mL 2.1 ml 0.5 mL 2.9 ml 0.7 mL 3.3 ml 0.8 mL 3.8 ml 0.9 mL 4.1 ml 1.0 mL 4.5 ml 1.0 mL 4.9 ml 1.1 mL 5.3 ml 1.2 mL 5.7 ml 1.3 mL 6.1 ml 1.4 mL 6.5 ml 1.4 mL 6.9 ml 1.5 mL 8.1 ml 1.8 mL 10.1 ml 2.0 mL4.4 mg 4.8 mg 5.2 mg 8.0 mg2.8 mg 3.2 mg 3.6 mg 4.0 mg 5.6 mg 6.0 mg 6.4 mg 6.8 mg2.0 mg 4.0 mg 4.8 mg 5.6 mg3 4 516kg (35) Lbs 18kg (40) Lbs 6 87 93.2 mg 34kg (75) Lbs3.6 mg 4.4 mg 6.0 mg5.2 mg20kg (44) Lbs 22kg (48) Lbs 24kg (53) 14kg (30) Lbs0.6 mg 1.2 mg 2.8 mg0.6 mg 1.2 mg 2.0 mgDose (mg) *Volume is based on the calculated dose PLUS 0.10 mL dead space in the device.

During a medical disaster, it is imperative that the first arriving EMS Agency on scene notifies OSF Medical Communications of the disaster by calling (309)655-5714. In turn, medical communications will initiate communications among System hospitals for notification and bed status. In addition, medical communications will notify Disaster Medical Services . 2. A medical disaster is defined as: A mass casualty incident involving more than 10 patients. A prolonged rescue where the victim will be entrapped 60 minutes or more. A Hazardous M aterials release (a chemical that is a direct life-threat to a population) with multiple patients or incident of 1 or more contaminated patients being transported to a hospital. A weapon of mass destruction (WMD) release. Any natural or man-made event ( e.g. tornado) with multiple patients (or the potential for multiple patients) that will have a prolonged EMS scene time of greater than 2 hours. 3. When contacting OSF Medical Communications, the following information will be needed: Type of disaster ( i.e. what caused it?) Location of the disaster Staging area or route of entry into the disaster Operational frequency ( i.e. what channel is incident command on?) Number of injured Name of agency making notification as well as a call-back number Notification of a Medical Disaster Policy 4 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS A condition known as crush syndrome occurs in prolonged entrapments where the victim's body tissue is crushed and circulation to the tissue is restricted. Because the blood flow is reduced or absent, lactic acid builds up causing the affected tissue to become acidotic. When the crushed tissue is released and circulation restored, the acidotic blood dumping into the central circulation causes such problems as cardiac arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances. First Responder Care should be focused on assessing the situation and initiating routine patient care to assure that the patient has a patent airway, is breathing and has a perfusing pulse as well as assuring personal safety. 1.

Treat per the appropriate protocol. Patient's who a re trapped under debris can appear hemodynamically stable until the debris is moved, at which point, toxins enter the core circulation. When the debris is lifted off of the patient, he/she can become very unstable. Monitor vitals every 5 minutes. Have airway equipment ready. Crush Syndrome Protocol 8 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS Prehospital and hospital personnel may find themselves in a situation where the number of injured patients exceeds the available healthcare providers and resources to care for the injured. In these situations, the patients must be triaged in order to do the most good for the greatest number of patients. Triage assessments are based on the severity of the injury, resources available and existence of any hazardous substance contamination to the patient. If everyone \"speaks the same language\" during a mass casualty event, confusion will decrease and more patients will be saved. Therefore, the START method of triage will be implemented. 1. Prioritize patients according to the START system. 2. Establish treatment areas for all four (4) categories of patients: Immediate/Critical ( Red treatment area) Delayed ( Yellow treatment area) Minor/Walking Wounded ( Green treatment area) Deceased ( Black treatment area) 3. Move through the entire scene, rapidly assessing each patient, stopping only to open an airway or to stop profuse bleeding. As you move through the scene, affix a triage tag to each patient according to their priority. 4. Treat and transport those patients who are viable and have life-threatening injuries first, according to the resources available. Any trauma patient who meets the Minimum Trauma Field Triage Criteria shall be transported to the highest level Trauma Center available, unless transport time is greater than 30 minutes to that hospital. 5. Treat and transport those patients who have impending or potential life-threats next. In some major incidents, these patients may even be transported by means other than an ambulance. 6. Walking wounded ( i.e. those patients without life-threatening injuries) should be transported last. In some major incidents, these patients may even be transported by means other than an ambulance. Simple Triage and Rapid Transport (START) Protocol 9 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS 7. Non-viable patients ( i.e. those in cardiac arrest or with obvious mortal wounds) should not be treated and transported unless adequate resources/personnel are available. 8. Documentation: The mass casualty tag is considered patient documentation and must be attached to the run report or submitted as the run report to the Resource Hospital. The mass casualty tag is considered to be confidential patient information. START Triage System Step 1 : Clear the scene of any walking wounded (These patients are considered to be in the MINOR category ( Green ). Step 2 : Assess ventilations in the remaining patients: No respiratory effort after opening airway: Deceased (Black) Respirations > 30: Immediate ( Red) Respirations < 30: Delayed ( Yellow Step 3 : Assess perfusion: No radial pulse present: Immediate ( Red) Radial pulse present: Delayed ( Yellow Step 4 : Assess ne urological status: Unconscious: Immediate ( Red) Cannot follow simple commands: Immediate ( Red) Can follow simple commands: Delayed ( Yellow Simple Triage and Rapid Transport (START) Protocol 10 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS START Triage System Simple Triag e and Rapid Transport (START) Protocol 11 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS JumpSTART Pediatric Multiple Casualty Incident Triage A standardized triage system provides guidance for personnel making life and death decisions that otherwise may be influenced by emotional issues when triaging children. JumpSTART Pediatric Multiple Casualty Incident Triage is an objective triage system that addresses the needs of children and can be a resource tool when planning a triage process for pediatric patients. Although the JumpSTART system parallels the START system, it takes into consideration the developmental and physiological differences of children by using breathing as the cornerstone for triage decisions. Adding a respiratory component to the triage system may increase triage time by 15-25 seconds, however, since the number of patients requiring a ventilatory trial would most likely be small, it is not thought to significantly affect overall triage time for an incident. Additionally, since the physiologic indicators specified for START are not generally applicable to the pediatric victim, different criteria are needed to assess young patients. For example, neurological status under START depends on the patient's ability to obey commands. This index is clearly not applicable to young children who lack the developmental ability to respond appropriately to commands. The JumpSTART Pediatric MCI triage system is designed for triaging infants and young children. Determining the appropriate system to use in the pre- adolescent and young teen population can be sometimes challenging, so the current recommendation is: If a victim appears to be a child, use JumpSTART ; if a victim appears to be a young adult, use START . In children, because of mechanical reasons such as weak intercostal muscles or mechanical airway obstruction, apnea may occur rapidly. Thus circulatory failure usually follows respiratory failure . There may be a period of time when the child is apneic but continues to maintain a pulse. It is during this time that airway clearance and a ventilatory trial may stimulate spontaneous breathing. Pediatric Triage (JumpSTART) Protocol 12 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS If spontaneous breathing begins, the child is categorized as RED for further treatment. If spontaneous breathing does not follow the initial ventilatory trial, the child is categorized as BLACK or non-salvageable. JumpSTART uses the same color-coding as START : RED (Immediate); YELLOW (Delayed); GREEN (Minor/Ambulatory); BLACK (Deceased/non- salvageable). The triage steps of the JumpSTART Pediatric MCI triage system are as follows: Step 1 : All children who are able to walk are directed to an area designated for minor (GREEN) injuries where they will undergo a secondary and more involved triage. Infants carried to this area or other non-ambulatory children taken to this area must undergo a complete medical and primary evaluation using modifications for non-ambulatory children to ascertain triage status. (Please refer to the Modifications for Non-Ambulatory Children* section on the following page). Step 2 : a) All remaining non-ambulatory children are assessed for the presence/absence of spontaneous breathing. If spontaneous breathing is present, the rate is assessed and the triage officer moves on to step three. b) If spontaneous breathing is not present and is not triggered by conventional positional techniques to open the airway, palpate for a pulse (peripheral preferred). If no pulse is present, patient is tagged BLACK and the triage officer moves on. c) If there is a palpable pulse, the rescuer gives five breaths (approximately 15 sec.) using mouth to mask barrier technique. If the ventilatory trial fails to trigger spontaneous respirations, the patient is tagged BLACK and the triage officer moves on. However, if respirations resume, the patient is tagged RED and the triage officer moves on without providing any further ventilation. Pediatric Triage (JumpSTART) Protocol 13 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS Step 3 : If the respiratory rate is 15-45/minute, proceed to check perfusion. If the respiratory rate is less than 15 (less than 1/every 4 seconds) or faster than 45/minute or irregular, tag as RED and move on. Step 4 : Assess perfusion by palpating pulses on a (seemingly) uninjured limb. If pulses are palpable, proceed to Step 5. If there are no palpable pulses, the patient is tagged RED and the triage officer moves on. Step 5 : At this point all patients have \"adequate\" ABCs. The triage officer performs a rapid APVU assessment of mental status. If the patient is Alert, responds to Voice, or responds appropriately to Pain (withdraws from stimulus or pushes away), the patient is tagged YELLOW and the triage officer moves on. If the patient does not respond to voice and responds inappropriately to pain (moans or moves in a non-localizing fashion) or is Unresponsive, a RED tag is applied and the triage officer moves on to the next patient. NOTE : All patients tagged BLACK, unless clearly suffering from injuries incompatible with life, should be reassessed once critical interventions for RED and YELLOW victims are completed. Pediatric Triage (JumpSTART) Protocol 14 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS *Modifications for Non-Ambulatory Children Children in which this modification would be used include: Infants who normally can't walk yet Children with developmental delay Children with acute injuries which prevented them from walking before the incident occurred Children with chronic disabilities Non-ambulatory children who meet the above criteria are evaluated using the JumpSTART algorithm beginnin g with Step 2. If the child meets any RED criteria, the child is tagged RED . A quick survey is then conducted to determine whether there are any significant external signs of injury ( i.e. deep penetrating wounds, severe bleeding, severe burns, amputations, distended tender abdomen, or multiple bruises). If any significant external signs of injury are present, the child is tagged YELLOW . Non-ambulatory children without any significant external injury, with all other aspects of the JumpSTART algorithm normal, are tagged GREEN . NOTE: Final disposition (transport destination) depends on local and regional resources. This information was obtained from the JumpSTART Pediatric MCI Triage Tool website. The JumpSTART pediatric MCI field triage tool was developed by Lou Romig, M.D. Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Miami Children's Hospital in Miami, FL in 1995 and modified in 2002.

Pediatric Triage (JumpSTART) Protocol 15 16 17 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS Rapid identification of possible infectious patients is very important in limiting the spread of infection. EMS providers play a key role in the mitigation of infection. Patient assessment and background information should key an EMS provider in on the possibility that the patient is either infectious or had a possible infectious exposure. Early notification to the receiving hospital will allow the hospital to prepare to place the patient in isolation. Care should focus on personal protective equipment for all responders (to include an N-95 respirator). The Routine Patient Care Protocol should be followed and actual treatment of the patient should not deviate from protocol. The patient should receive the same type of medical care and respect as a non-infectious patient. First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care 1. Assess for possible Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): Travel (including transit in an airport) within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with current or previously documented or suspected community transmission of SARS . OR Close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS . Temperature of >100.4oF or one or more clinical findings of cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or hypoxia. 2. Assess for possible infectious biological agent : Unidentifiable rash or large amounts of bruised/necrotic skin tissue. Temperature of >100.4oF or one or more clinical findings of cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or hypoxia. Patient Isolation Protocol 18 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care (continued) 3. Isolate the patient. Only a minimum number of EMS providers should take care of the patient: Place the patient in a Tyvek or hospital gown. If possible, have the patient wash their hands with anti-microbial soap. The soap is to kill any infectious organisms on the patient's hands ( Note : waterless soap / alcohol gel is acceptable). If possible, place a surgical mask on the patient. The surgical mask prohibits the respiratory spread of the infectious organism. Do not place an N-95 on the patient and do not withhold oxygen therapy if needed . 4. EMS providers should follow their agen cy's SOP for personal protection equipment. The SOP should include at least: N-95 HEPA mask for the EMS provider Double gloves Eye protection Tyvek protection gown 5. Notification to OSF Medical Communications should be made as soon as possible: Notify Medical Communications of a possible infectious patient, what facility the patient is being transported to and an ETA to the facility. Notify the receiving medical facility by MERCI radio when the transporting ambulance is at the emergency department entrance. Patient Isolation Protocol 19 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS First Responder Care , BLS Care , ILS Care , ALS Care (continued ) 6. Do not take the patient into the emergency department (or into the hospital at all) : Wait for an emergency physician to examine the patient in the back of the ambulance and determine if isolation precautions should be continued. When transporting the patient into the hospital, ensure that the patient is wearing a surgical mask. Or, if the patient is being manually ventilated, have a BVM with an attached HEPA filter (if available). 7. Follow the EMS agency's policy on decontamination of the ambulance and equipment. 8. Complete a Peoria Hospitals Communicable Disease Incident Form . Patient Isolation Protocol 20 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS With the advent of the National Incident Management System ( NIMS ) under Presidential Directive #5, all critical response agencies must follow the Incident Command System (ICS). EMS has a defined role within the ICS - the medical branch. The medical branch needs to be run effectively to establish proper care and save lives during a medical disaster. 1. Have pre-established job functions. One person cannot manage a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) alone. Pre-defined roles and responsibilities will help reduce the stress and confusion of a mass casualty event. EMS has very specific roles during an MCI. The roles and responsibilities of EMS will be scalable - not all roles will be needed at all times. The Incident Commander (IC) and the Medical Branch Director during the MCI will determine what is needed. 2. During a declared medical disaster or MCI, the Peoria Area EMS Office/Disaster Medical Services staff may be used as a resource and can assist in moving patients to local or regional hospitals. 3. Following is a brief description of roles and responsibilities of EMS during an MCI as well as an organizational chart: INCIDENT COMMANDER OPERATIONS MEDICAL BRANCH DIRECTOR TRIAGE TREATMENT TRANSPORTSTAGINGPLANNING LOGISTICS MEDICAL UNIT (REHAB)ADMINISTRATION / FINANCESAFETY INFORMATION OFFICER LIASON Command and Control of the EMS Branch Policy 21 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS Medical Branch Director - This person is responsible for the implementation of the Incident Action Plan within the Medical Branch. He/she reports to the Operations Section Chief and supervises the Medical Group(s) and Patient Transportation. Triage - This branch is responsible for the identification and triage of all victims and reports to the Medical Branch Director. At times, a patient transport team will be assigned to this area to help move patients from the scene into treatment areas. Treatment - This branch reports to the Medical Branch Director and is responsible for treatment (usually sub-divided into the corresponding triage categories), preparation for transport and directs movement of patients to loading locations. On-scene treatment is usually limited to the stabilization of patients. Transport - This branch reports to the Medical Branch Director and is responsible for the coordination of patient transportation and maintenance of records relating to the patient's identification, condition and destination. The transport branch has the responsibility of not overloading one specific hospital. As soon as possible, the Transportation Unit Leader should coordinate with the POD Hospital (OSF Saint Francis Medical Center)/EMS Office staff regarding patient destination. Staging - This branch reports to the Operations Section Chief and is responsible for organizing incoming EMS resources into one central location. This could include vehicles, personnel or equipment. The Staging Director will deploy the resources as needed via the request of the Medical Branch Director. Medical Unit (Rehabilitation) - This branch reports to the Logistics Section Chief and is responsible for establishing an area for on-scene providers to rest and receive medical care if needed. In addition, the Rehabilitation Branch will identify those individuals too fatigued to continue with the mission. This is a very important role in any prolonged or high-risk MCI operation. Command and Control of the EMS Branch Policy 22 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS A special cache of pharmaceuticals has been stockpiled in order to deal with an organophosphate (nerve agent) poisoning. This stockpile is designed for rapid deployment to the scene of the incident. The ChemPack is designed to treat up to one thousand (1,000) people using MARK I auto-injectors and Benzodiazepines. If the EMS provider on scene determines an organophosphate (nerve agent) release affecting more than two (2) people: 1. Call Medical Communications at (309)655-5714. 2. Request the ChemPack . 3. Give the Medical Communication Dispatche r: Location where the ChemPack is to be delivered Signs & symptoms patients are exhibiting Total number of patients involved Contact phone number Contact frequency Note: The ChemPack will take approximately 30-45 minutes plus drive time to arrive on scene. Critical Thinking Elements Agencies who already have Mark I kits should utilize those auto -injectors. The ChemPack can still be requested if needed ( i.e. for large -scale events). Requesting the EMS ChemPack Policy 23 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS The Region 2 Medical Response Team is a deployable 20-bed (critical) and 100-bed+ (non-critical) emergency treatment facility. The team consists of doctors, nurses and paramedics and can be used for any type of medical disaster. 1. Determine if a medical disaster has occurred. Criteria for activation of the medical response team includes, but is not limited to: Man-made disasters ( e.g. terrorism-related events, Hazardous Materials spills, building collapse, urban search & rescue, mass casualties, etc.) Natural disasters ( e.g. tornadoes, floods, forest fires, public health emergencies, etc.) 2. Contact OSF Medical Communications (309)655-5714. 3. Give the Medical Communications Dispatcher the following information: Type of event Exact location of where the team should set up (minimum: 100x100 area) Provide GPS coordinates if available Number of casualties Name and phone number of the contact person Note : In most cases, the Region 2 Medical Response Team can be deployed within an hour. This will be a tiered response and drive time must be taken into consideration. Requesting the Region 2 Medical Response Team Policy 24 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS Natural and technological crises may place an intense demand for EMS and emergency department resources on one or more the EMS systems in Illinois. The potential exists for these crises to occur or evolve without adequate warning or notification. Such crises may include: Environmental emergencies Communicable diseases Influenza epidemic Terrorist acts (involving chemical, biological or nuclear agents) As a result, EMS and emergency department personnel must be cognizant of evolving trends of the influx of patients with similar signs & symptoms. Recognition of an impending or active system-wide crisis will better prepare hospitals and local ambulance providers to handle any type of situation. The following outlines how and when recognition / notification may occur: 1. Recognition a) ED physician, emergency communicator, registered nurse or other MERCI/telemetry personnel may be notified of a system-wide crisis by: Communication from the local ambulance provider ( e.g. mass casualty incident) Increase in ED census due to patients complaining of similar signs & symptoms Noted increase in the number of emergency departments requesting bypass The MERCI/telemetry personnel should report these occurrences to the attending physician or charge nurse and the POD Coordinator. b) When ambulance providers of their personnel notice that they have an increased number of calls/transports with patients complaining of similar signs & symptoms, this information should be reported to OSF Medical Communications at (309)655-5714 who will notify the POD Coordinator. Preparedness to a System -Wide Crisis Policy 25 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS 2. Notification of Personnel a) Notification of a system-wide crisis can be made to OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Medical Communications at (309)655-5714. Do not call directly to the ED. b) The reporting medical provider will tell the medical communicator in which county the crisis is occurring. c) OSF Saint Francis Medical Communications personnel will activate that county's System -Wide Crisis call personnel. d) System-Wide Crisis call personnel will include: POD Coordinator Local Public Health Infectious Disease (or Emergency) Coordinator EMS System Coordinator e) The reporting hospital or EMS agency will fill out the Region 2 System- Wide Crisis Form . This form will be faxed to minimally the above mentioned personnel. f) If there appears to be a trend (either prehospital or hospital) of an increase in frequency of similar signs & symptoms, the POD Coordinator shall contact the IEMA (Illinois Emergency Management Agency) Command Center at 1-800-782-7860 . Preparedness to a System -Wide Crisis Policy 26 PEORIA AREA EMS SYSTEM PREHOSPITAL DISASTER PROTOCOLS 3. Plan of Action a) The EMS Coordinator of the affected system and POD Coordinator will contact the involved hospitals and local ambulance providers within the EMS System to inform them of the crisis. The EMS Coordinator will request that each involved hospital take steps to avoid ambulance diversion and alert them to the possible need of having to mobilize additional staff and resources or activate their emergency management plans. b) Hospitals needing to go on bypass will follow the Region 2 Bypass Policy. c) The EMS Coordinator and POD Coordinator will assist local public health departments in their needs during the system-wide crisis. 4.

This protocol is for all levels of EMS providers. In addition, this protocol is to be used if any agency carries DuoDote kits, or if the DuoDote kits arrive on scene to be used. The DuoDote kit consists of one autoinjector containing: in to be used for prophylaxis. The injectors are antidotes, not a preventative device. The auto- injectors are to be used only if the patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to nerve or organophosphate agents. Prior to rendering medical care, follow routine procedures for: 1. Scene safety 2. Having an appropriately trained HazMat team present for decontamination, if necessary. 3.

Firmly grasp the center of the injector with the Green Tip (needle end) pointing down. 2. With your other hand, pull off the Gray Safety release. The DuoDote Auto- Injector is now ready to be administered. 3. The injection site is the mid-outer thigh area. The DuoDote Auto-Injector can be injected through clothing; however, make sure pockets at the injection site are empty. 4. Swing and firmly push the Green Tip straight d own (a 90 angle) against the mid-outer thigh. Continue to firmly push until you feel the DuoDote Auto-Injector trigger. IMPORTANT: After the auto-injector triggers, hold the DuoDote firmly in place against the injection sit for ~ 10 seconds. 5. Remove the DuoDote injector from the thigh and look at the Green Tip. If the needle is visible, the drug has been administered. If the needle is not visible, check to be sure the Gray Safety Release has been removed, and then repeat above steps beginning with Step #3, but push harder in step #4. 6. After the drug has been administered, push the needle against a hard surface to bend the needle back against the DuoDote Auto-Injector. 7. Put the used DuoDote Auto-Injector back into the plastic pouch, if available. 8. Leave the DuoDote Injector(s) with the patient to allow other medical personnel to see the number of injectors administered.
