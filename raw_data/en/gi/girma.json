RIVM will invite the oldest people first, and will then send an invitation to everyone aged 60 years and older over the next few weeks. Care workers who have contact with patients will be invited through their employers. Starting in early October, GPs will send invitations to people under 60 who have a higher risk of severe COVID-19. The Municipal Public Health Services (GGDs) in each region will begin administering the repeat vaccination as of 19 September 2022, using the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were recently approved for use. The peak of the COVID-19 crisis appears to be behind us. A new wave of COVID-19 cases may still occur in autumn, however. To maintain protection against serious illness and death and to ensure access to healthcare, the Outbreak Management Team on Vaccinations (OMT-V) has advised launching a new round of COVID-19 vaccinations in the second half of September. The first invitations will be sent to people who have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and to care workers who have contact with patients and clients. After that, everyone in the Netherlands aged 12 years and older who wants a repeat vaccination against COVID-19 can make an appointment with the GGD. When it is your turn for a [repeat vaccination](/en/covid-19-vaccination/questions-and-background-information/repeat-vaccination), you can be vaccinated once it has been 3 months since your last COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Advisory opinion The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently issued a positive scientific opinion for the updated vaccines, which have been authorised for use for everyone aged 12 years and older. These COVID-19 vaccines not only contain the spike protein from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus (the Wuhan strain), but also the spike protein from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The updated vaccines offer protection against multiple variants of the coronavirus, such as the Omicron variant. For everyone aged 12 years and older, the benefits of this repeat vaccination outweigh the possible side-effects. The people who will receive an invitation in the next few weeks will benefit most from a repeat vaccination, either for their own protection or to help protect vulnerable people around them. The repeat vaccination is especially important for people who only received the basic series of COVID-19 vaccinations. First invitations Starting from 13 September 2022, people who have a higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19 can expect to receive an invitation. This applies to everyone aged 60 years and older, people aged 12 to 59 years who also receive an invitation for the annual flu jab, people with Down's syndrome, and people living in residential care institutions. Care workers who have contact with patients or clients can expect an invitation through their employers. Vaccination sites The Municipal Public Health Services (GGDs) will begin administering this repeat vaccination against COVID-19 as of 19 September 2022. People living in residential care institutions will be offered the vaccination through the institution, but can also be vaccinated at a GGD vaccination site if they prefer. People living at home who are unable to travel to a GGD vaccination site on their own or with assistance, but are in a risk group, can contact their GP to make arrangements. They will be vaccinated at home by their GP or by a mobile team sent out by "}
