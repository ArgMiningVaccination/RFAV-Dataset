However, chiropractic care's effect on the immune system is often overlooked. At Century Center Chiropractic in Atlanta, GA, we aim to increase health and vitality for our patients in addition to relieving pain. The Nervous System and Immune System Chiropractic care can boost the immune system in a few ways. First, there is a direct connection between the immune and nervous systems. These two systems work together in the body and are in constant communication. When the spine is misaligned it can impair the body's immune response, which is necessary to kill germs in the body. Spinal manipulation performed by a chiropractor fixes the problem allowing the immune system and nervous system to work in harmony. Chiropractic Manipulation for Stress Relief The second-way chiropractic care can give you an immunity boost is by relieving stress. The stress hormone cortisol has been shown to suppress the body's immune function by reducing the number of lymphocytes. When stress and cortisol are reduced, the immune system function is increased. It's believed that stress is a cause or a contributing factor in 75-90% of diseases. Studies have shown that spinal manipulation changes biochemical markers in the body related to immune responses. Manipulation also reduces pain, loosens tense muscles, and lowers blood pressure. Stress is lowered by physically reducing these symptoms. It also improves the body's ability to produce and balance needed hormones, including oxytocin which is responsible for many functions in the body and helps relieve stress.
