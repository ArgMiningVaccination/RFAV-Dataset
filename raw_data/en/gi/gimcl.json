Taken daily I feel a difference in my immune system and body. - CPCatherine P.Verified BuyerI recommend this productRated 5 out of 5 your products! your products! - JSJodie BuyerI this productRated 5 out of 5 stars2 years agoI don't really grasp all I don't really grasp all the herbs that are in this bundle but all I know if that it works! I could not wait to start \"Can't Touch This\" - I always (always) have allergies leading to a sinus infection in October. I started to have symptoms on Sunday. Can't touch this (finally) arrived on Monday and by Tuesday my symptoms were gone!!! I still take my allergy meds as well but I am hoping to wean myself off of them by Thanksgiving. I will definitely be ordering this on repeat as needed! My only issue is that while it says you can take it with or without food, \"Can't Touch This\" made me nauseous to take it without eating something so I make sure to have something with it when I take it in the am.
