Magnolia is a plant. People use the bark and flower buds to make medicine. Magnolia is used for weight loss, problems with digestion, constipation, inflammation, anxiety, stress, depression, fever, headache, stroke, and asthma. Magnolia flower bud is used for stuffy nose, runny nose, common cold, sinus pain, hay fever, headache, and facial dark spots. Some people apply magnolia flower bud directly to the gums for toothaches. In rub-on skin care products, magnolia flower bud extract is used as a skin whitener and to minimize or counteract skin irritation caused by the other ingredients. In traditional Chinese and Japanese (Kampo) medicine, magnolia bark is an ingredient in Hange-koboku-to, which is composed of 5 plant extracts, and in Saiboku-to, which is composed of 10 plant extracts. These extracts are used to decrease anxiety and nervous tension and to improve sleep. Some researchers believe honokiol, a chemical in magnolia bark, is what makes these medicines work. How does it work? Magnolia seems to have anxiety-reducing activity in animals. It might also increase steroid production by the body to treat asthma. All research on magnolia has been in laboratories.

So far, there isn't much evidence that magnolia causes weight loss. There is some research showing that overweight women who take a specific product containing a combination of extracts of magnolia plus phellodendron (Relora, Next Pharmaceuticals) don't gain as much weight as other women. They seem to eat fewer calories, possibly because the magnolia reduces their stress-related eating. However, there is no reliable evidence that taking this product actually causes weight loss. Some other weight loss products include magnolia bark with claims that it reduces cortisol levels. However, there is no evidence that magnolia bark causes weight loss or reduces cortisol levels. In fact, it appears to increase levels of corticosterone, a chemical similar to cortisol. - Anxiety. - Depression. - Obesity. - Digestion problems. - Inflammation. - Nasal congestion. - Runny nose. - Common cold. - Headache. - Facial dark spots. - Toothaches. - Other conditions. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate [(detailed description of each of the ratings).](#) Magnolia is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when used short-term. The safety of magnolia use for more than 6 weeks is unknown. In one study, one person experienced heartburn, shaking hands, sexual problems, and thyroid problems. Another person experienced extreme tiredness and headache. But it is not known if these side effects were caused by magnolia or some other factor. Not enough is known to rate the safety of magnolia when applied to the skin.
