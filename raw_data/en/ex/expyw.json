Atwood, M.D., Representative of the Massachusetts Medical Society, for the Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners April, 2001 Executive Summary A small group of naturopaths (practitioners of \"natural medicine\"), who refer to physicians\" or \"naturopathic doctors\" (\"ND's\"), seeks licensure in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These naturopaths portray themselves as \"primary care physicians.\" They are few by any standard, numbering approximately 1500 in the entire U.S. and 30 in Massachusetts (by comparison, in Massachusetts alone there are about 30,000 medical doctors, 4,000 nurse practitioners, 400 nurse midwives, and 1800 chiropractors). They contrast themselves to other naturopaths, whom they consider not worthy of licensure, by virtue of having attended on-campus schools. These schools are not accredited in any meaningful way. They grant the \"N.D.\" degree, but so do several other, \"unapproved,\" correspondence schools. The N.D. degree is not recognized nationally or in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Licensure offers regulation to protect the public. Regulators must hold health professions to a very high standard, since considerable damage can occur as a result of treatment by incompetent practitioners. To be considered a health profession, an occupation must be able to demonstrate an objective, scientific, and ethical basis. Naturopathy fails to meet this standard. For an occupation with little semblance of objective, scientific, and ethical bases, licensure legitimizes an otherwise illegitimate and dangerous activity. This monograph demonstrates, unequivocally and with extensive documentation, that naturopathy is a dangerous activity, and that no amount of regulation is likely to mitigate this fact. It is the opinion of the Massachusetts Medical Society that it would be irresponsible and unconscionable for the Commission to recommend the licensure of naturopathy in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Among the reasons are: 1. Naturopathy is both potentially and actually injurious when practiced according to the accepted standards of the profession. This injury is likely to be due to the failure of the naturopathic practitioner to recommend appropriate medical treatment. The discussion includes several clinical examples and one clinical study supporting these assertions (pp. 6-8, 22-43). 2. Unscientific naturopathic beliefs pose irrational challenges to proven public health measures, most notably childhood immunizations (p.40). 3. Irrational, unscientific beliefs and practices abound in naturopathy, likening it more to a cult than to a valid form of health care. These beliefs and practices are not merely at the 2 fringes but are the standards of the field. They are advocated by the leaders themselves (pp.6-8 and most of the discussion). 4. Naturopathic practitioners are incapable of self-regulation commensurate with public safety. The question of protecting the public from \"less qualified\" naturopaths is demonstrated to be moot. Ample evidence is offered throughout the discussion (see, esp., pp. 33, 44). 5. Naturopaths prescribe numerous \"natural medicines\" with a standard for safety and efficacy that is unacceptably low, as evidenced by the leading textbook in the field (pp. 13-18 and Appendix I). 6. The scientific pretensions of naturopathy and naturopathic training programs are baseless. There is ample evidence that the basic science courses do not teach students to think critically (p.9). Research performed at naturopathic colleges is lacking in scientific rigor and has not investigated common naturopathic claims (p.11). The libraries at naturopathic colleges are filled with books and journals that promote trendy but implausible notions regarding health care (p.10). The major journal in the field is filled with articles that are both absurd and dangerous (p.12). The oft-repeated claim that the major textbook in the field cites \"more than 10,000 scientific references\" is a misrepresentation, as exemplified by the textbook's claims for \"natural remedies\" (pp.12, 13-16 and Appendix I). 7. Collaboration with medical doctors is uncommon in naturopathic practice, in contrast to what the Commission was told by naturopathic representatives. Statistics are cited (p.43). 8. There is a financial conflict of interest built into naturopathic practice that is both sanctioned and shared by the very organization that should be providing ethical guidance (p.18). 9. There are many nonsensical diagnostic practices, some of which are \"electrodiagnosis,\" \"applied kinesiology,\" hair analysis, and \"iridology,\" that are correctly viewed as quackery when offered by a medical doctor but are standard for naturopathic practice (pp. 22-26). 10. There are ubiquitous claims of dubious clinical \"syndromes,\" among which are multiple \"food allergies,\" \"toxemia,\" and chronic yeast infections, which cast further doubt on the science and ethics of naturopathic practice (pp. 26-33). 11. The duration and setting of naturopathic clinical training, even overlooking its content, is inadequate to the task of producing competent primary care physicians. This is clear from a comparison of the training of medical doctors to that of naturopaths. Just as a newly graduated medical doctor, no matter how well-intentioned, would not be allowed to assume the role of a primary care physician, neither should this be allowed for a naturopath whose training is, clearly, inferior (pp.43-44). This monograph also addresses the issue of why it might seem to some people, including naturopathic practitioners themselves, that naturopathy \"works\" (p.45). 3 Table of Contents Executive Summary............................................................................................. 1 Sources........................................................................................................... 5 Introduction to Naturopathic Beliefs and Practices.........................................................6 Naturopathy and Science....................................................................................... 9 Basic Science..........................................................................................9 The Libraries.........................................................................................10 \"Scientific\" Research................................................................................11 A Non-Scientific Textbook........................................................................ 12 A Non-Scientific Journal........................................................................... 12 The \"Science\" of Natural Medicines............................................................. 13 Laetrile................................................................................................ 16 Conflict of Interest.............................................................................................. 19 Clinical Naturopathy........................................................................................... 22 Dubious Diagnostic Methods...................................................................... 22 \"Electrodiagnostic\" Testing............................................................. 22 Hair Analysis............................................................................... 23 Applied Kinesiology...................................................................... 25 Iridology.................................................................................... 26 Dubious Clinical Entities............................................................................. 26 Food Allergies.............................................................................. 26 Toxemia and Detoxification.............................................................. 29 Chronic Candidiasis (Yeast Infections).................................................. 31 The Common Denominator................................................................33 Naturopathic Approaches to Specific Diseases....................................................34 Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection)..................................................... 34 AIDS......................................................................................... 37 Cancer of the Prostate...................................................................... 38 Asthma....................................................................................... 38 A Test of Naturopathic \"Medicine\" in Massachusetts........................................... 39 Naturopaths and Vaccination................................................................................... 40 Naturopaths as \"Primary Care Physicians\"................................................................... 43 Implications for Licensing and Regulation................................................................... 44 Why Ineffective Treatments Seem to Work................................................................... 45 Epilogue............................................................................................................ 48 Summary........................................................................................................... 49 Conclusion......................................................................................................... 50 References......................................................................................................... 50 Appendix I: Comparison of Naturopathic Claims for Natural Medicines with Rigorous Standard Awry 4 Sources It is important that the Commission consider the facts of naturopathic practice generally, and not simply the few particulars that have been presented to it. The discussion herein is based on the form of naturopathy that is being promoted as \"licensable.\" That is, it represents the practices of naturopaths licensed in other states, graduates of the four-year, on-campus schools, and literature from the following sources: 1. Textbook of Natural Medicine (Pizzorno JE and Murray MT. London. Churchill Livingstone, 1999). 2. The official website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and links from this site. 3. The websites of the two major four-year naturopathic schools in the U.S. (Bastyr University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine [NCNM]). 4. The Naturopathic Medicine Network, a website promoting \"naturopathic medicine.\" 5. Quotations and publications of practitioners identified by naturopaths as leaders in the field. All websites were accessed between 12/00 and 3/01. It is entirely appropriate that the Commission consider the Textbook of Natural Medicine a fair representation of the tenets of the field, regardless of whether naturopaths also claim to consult \"conventional\" textbooks. Its co-editors, who are also the authors of most of the book's chapters, are Joseph E. Pizzorno Jr. and Michael T. Murray. The book jacket describes Pizzorno as the \"President and co-founder of Bastyr University.\" Murray is described as \"a faculty member of Bastyr University, the medical editor of the Natural Medicine Journal, and a leading educator in naturopathic medicine.\" Here is how the textbook is described on Bastyr University's official website: The 2nd edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine ... is the most comprehensive and widely-referenced text available on natural medicine. It covers a wide range of approaches for managing and treating over 100 conditions and health problems. The first edition was reviewed in The Journal of Alternative Medicine as \"the ultimate book on naturopathic medicine.\"i 5 Introduction to Naturopathic Beliefs and Practices Here is an account by Kurt Butler, a nutritionist and consumer health advocate in Hawaii, one of eleven states that licenses naturopaths: During the late 1970s, the wife of a naturopath in Hawaii died at the age of twenty-six. The \"official\" cause of death was Hodgkin's disease, but it would be more accurate to say that she was killed by her husband's belief system. When her disease became apparent, he was sure he could cure her with baths, herbal teas, homeopathic remedies, and laetrile. Since these remedies are worthless against cancer, her disease progressed. By the time she had lost confidence in naturopathy, it was too late. The physicians who examined her were sickened by what they found. They advised that the therapy they had to offer (massive radiation) at this late stage would make her miserable and was unlikely to cure her. She chose to forego the treatment and died a few months later. The naturopath was not an unlicensed quack posing as a doctor. He was licensed and practicing within the scope permitted by his license. He was not investigated, sued, prosecuted, or even reprimanded. In the states where naturopaths are permitted to practice, they are permitted to call themselves doctors and represent themselves to be family physicians. About a year after the woman's death, driven by intense curiosity, I visited the naturopath at his home. After we discussed the weather and real-estate prices, I nervously brought up the subject of his wife's illness and death. To my surprise, he discussed the matter calmly and voiced no regrets about his efforts to help her the \"natural\" way.ii One would like to think that this tragic episode was a deviation from the norm, an isolated throwback to the old, premodern, naturopathic practices of the 19th century. At the very least one might hope that in the twenty-plus years since this occurred, things have changed. This turns out not to be the case. The following account was recently posted on the Quackwatch website: My good friend Debbie Benson died July 15, 1997, at age fifty-five. I had known her for thirty years. Her official diagnosis was breast cancer, but she was really a victim of quackery. Conventional treatment might have saved her, but she rejected the advice of her oncologist and went to \"natural healers.\" Debbie was a registered nurse at the Kaiser hospital in Portland, Oregon, but she had a deep distrust of standard medical practice. She didn't have a mammogram for nine years, and when she did -- in March 1996 -- it showed a cancerous lump in her breast. She had the lump removed, but she refused the additional treatment her doctor recommended. Instead she went to a naturopath who gave her -- among other things -- some \"Pesticide Removal Tinctures.\" Soon after that, lymph nodes swelled in Debbie's armpit. The naturopath said that this was merely the effect of the herbal remedies he was giving her and not to worry. Belatedly, she returned to her oncologist at Kaiser 6 hospital, where the lymph nodes were biopsied and found to be cancerous. Once again, she refused the recommended treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer was spreading throughout her body...iii These cases may not sound much like what the naturopathic representatives at the Commission have been discussing, but research suggests that they are an inevitable result of the beliefs and practices of \"naturopathic medicine.\" It may be argued that medical science cannot save every victim of Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer. It may well have saved these two women, however, if naturopaths had not clung to beliefs that are little more than the fantasies of a few charismatic 19th century \"healers.\" The history is beyond the scope of this discussion but can be reviewed in a sympathetic chapter from the Textbook of Natural Medicineiv and two critical treatments.v,vi The contemporary results of that history are well summarized by Butler: Naturopathy is based on the notion that diseases are caused by the accumulation of toxins in the body and should be treated by natural methods that rid the body of these toxins. The toxins are not named, and \"natural\" is not defined, so anything goes except what state law prohibits, which isn't much... Naturopathic treatment may include enemas, starvation, doses of vitamin C equivalent to a hundred oranges a day, doses of vitamin A equivalent to fifty carrots, foul-tasting and toxic herbal teas, and raw beef gland pills. Do these seem \"natural\" to you? Although there is no evidence to support the toxin theory, there is no end to the...methods naturopaths use to get rid of the alleged toxins. Their favorites include high colonics, fasting, an assortment of bizarre dietary regimens, megavitamins, pangamic acid and other pseudonutrients, many unproven and toxic herbal medicines, homeopathy, acupuncture, reflexology, chelation therapy, and a wide assortment of [unlikely] cancer and AIDS drugs such as laetrile, hydrogen peroxide, and miscellaneous herbs and herbal extracts. [Discredited] diagnostic methods popular with naturopaths include iridology, applied kinesiology, Electroacupuncture according to Voll and other electronic gadgetry, hair analysis, cytotoxic testing, and live cell analysis.vii A perusal of the sources above reveals multiple other examples of absurd and dangerous naturopathic beliefs and practices. Here is a short, by no means comprehensive, list: Coffee enemas are claimed to be effective in treating cancer and other serious illnessviii,ix 25% of Americans allegedly suffer from heavy metal poisoningx from drinking common tap water or eating food obtained from grocery stores (yet naturopaths prescribe dangerous heavy metals, e.g., colloidal silver, as medicinesxi) \"Aromatherapy,\" i.e., smelling various aromas, is claimed to be useful in treating Alzheimer's diseasexii \"Bach Flower remedies\" and colors, applied to the skin or simply worn as clothes, are claimed to be effective in the treatment and prevention of strokesxiii 7 Ear infections in children, it is claimed, are usually caused by \"food allergies\"xiv or \"sensitivities\"xv Digestive enzymes taken by mouth are claimed to be useful in the treatment of low back painxvi \"Vaginal depletion packs,\" one-by-three inch cotton tampons containing a tar-like mixture of botanical oils, are used for treating cervical dysplasia and pelvic inflammatory disease. They are inserted into patients by naturopaths, left in place for 24 hours at a time, and repeated weekly.xvii (Both of these conditions are potentially life threatening. If this isn't shocking enough, consider that the \"vaginal depletion pack\" is an almost perfect recipe for producing Toxic Shock Syndrome.) Naturopaths claim to know how to \"enhance immunity\"xviii (but they are opposed to immunizations. See p. 40 below) \"Allopathic\" physicians are said to treat only symptoms, whereas naturopaths \"find the underlying cause of a condition.\" These \"underlying causes\" are discussed below: see \"Dubious Clinical Entities,\" p. 26. The list goes on and on. Naturopaths also espouse numerous other unsupported practices, although many of these are in basic disagreement with each other. Some are directly contradictory, such as homeopathy and megavitamin therapy, or treating cancer with both antioxidants and intravenous hydrogen peroxide (an oxidant). If there is a modus operandi that seems to characterize the field of naturopathy, it is the ease with which it embraces virtually any unlikely, pseudoscientific health claim, no matter how preposterous, while denigrating scientific medicine.xix In an irony that appears to be lost on naturopaths themselves, Bastyr University offers a course in \"Yunani,\" which it describes as \"the most comprehensive and one of the world's oldest systems of health and healing. It encompasses physical, mental and spiritual aspects of human health and is introduced in the light of its twentieth century revolutionary reformation and resynthesis, with brief history of its competitive existence, stature and staying power.\"xx A bit of research reveals that \"Yunani,\" or \"Unani,\" is none other than the prescientific Western medical tradition based on the four \"humours,\" bloodletting, scalding, purging, and other long discredited, toxic methods.xxi In other words, Yunani is the very \"allopathy\" that scientific medicine, fortunately for humanity, has replaced. Naturopathy and Science Basic Science How could practitioners ostensibly trained in science believe such unlikely claims? Naturopathic schools claim to teach the same basic sciences as evidence-based medical schools. When examined closely, this \"scientific training\" is illusory. Here are just a few examples: 8 1. Anatomy: there is no basis for believing that it is possible to \"realign\" the bones of the skull of an adult, which are fused. There is no basis for claiming that realigning the skull of a child can cure learning disorders. Yet \"cranial osteopathy\" is taught at Bastyr University.xxii 2. Physiology and anatomy: it is ridiculous to believe that hydrogen peroxide, applied to the skin, can effectively treat and prevent asthma. Yet this claim is made in a treatise written by a senior editor of the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine and printed on the official website of the AANP.xxiii 3. Anatomy and histology: there is no basis for thinking that every part of the body is \"represented\" on the iris of the eye. Yet \"iridology\" is taught at Bastyr Universityxxiv and has been called \"the most valuable tool of the naturopath.\"xxv 4. Physiology: it is unreasonable to believe that swallowing digestive enzymes eases inflammation in arthritic joints because the enzymes \"enter the bloodstream and clear out products that contribute to inflammation.\"xxvi This claim was made by a naturopath at a Commission meeting and also by a professor of physical medicine at Bastyr University. (Enzymes are proteins, and proteins are broken down in the digestive tract before being absorbed into the body. Even if they were absorbed intact, they would have no way of \"knowing\" where in the body to exert their destructive effects, and where to avoid exerting such effects). 5. Physiology: there is no basis for believing that the sugar content in a normal child's diet determines the sugar content of his/her middle ear, or that \"excessive sugar consumption\" causes urinary tract infections in normal adults. The first of these errors was made at a Commission meeting, and is also to be found in a treatise discussed below; the second is in the Textbook of Natural Medicine.xxvii 6. Biochemistry and pharmacology: it is absurd to believe that the lesser the amount of a drug that is given, the greater the effect, and that the greatest effect is achieved when there is no drug at all. This is the \"second law\" of homeopathy, which is accepted without question by naturopaths even though it is refuted by every dose-response curve ever constructed and is at odds with the most elementary of biophysical principles. 7. Bacteriology, anatomy, physiology, immunology, epidemiology, toxicology, and history of medicine: there is no basis for believing that the large intestine must be periodically \"cleansed\" by fasting or enemas in order to \"rid the body of toxins.\" Yet this quaint, but dangerous, 19th century claim remains virtually ubiquitous in naturopathic literature.xxviii 8. Neurobiology, immunology, microbiology, parasitology, cell biology, molecular biology, and nutrition: there is no basis for believing that measuring the skin's resistance to an electric current can \"test for parasites, food and environmental sensitivities, Candida, nutritional deficiencies and more.\"xxix Beliefs such as these belie the notion that science is taught in any substantial way at naturopathic schools. An examination of the curricula, furthermore, reveals that interspersed with \"basic science\" courses are many other courses such as \"homeopathy,\" \"naturopathic clinical theory,\" and \"fundamentals of Ayurvedic medicine.\"xxx At the very least these courses divert time and attention from basic science, while confusing the students with claims that are inherently antiscientific. 9 Health consumers should be wary, in general, of any \"medical\" field whose training programs are largely unaffiliated with established academic institutions. Lacking such affiliations, the field is insulated from the scrutiny of the larger scientific community and is thus likely to perpetuate dubious, unscientific beliefs and practices. Of the four on-campus naturopathic schools in the United States, only one, the University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine, can boast that it is part of a \"real\" university. Yet this is no ordinary university. It is the \"flagship\" of the World University Federation, a front organization for the Unification Church. This is the cult of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, from whose name its more common designation, the \"Moonies,\" is derived.xxxi Naturopathic schools, unsurprisingly, have not joined the scientific community but have maintained an ideological, cult-like approach to health care. Basic science is not simply a body of abstract knowledge that one studies and then forgets, like so many irregular Latin verbs. It is taught in medical school because it has a direct, obvious, and compelling application to clinical medicine. Science is the very foundation for evidence-based medicine. It is used daily by practitioners in their work with patients and is the basis for evaluating novel therapies, drugs, and techniques. To learn it and ignore it is to not have learned it at all. Nor is learning basic science merely a matter of dissecting cadavers or memorizing formulas or reciting biochemical pathways. It is not a matter of the number of hours of coursework completed or even the ability to pass a standardized exam. Learning basic science involves developing the habit of critical thinking. It is imagining what might be true based on what is already known to be true. This doesn't mean closed-mindedness. What it means is an informed open-mindedness and a willingness to investigate new possibilities, but not without considering them in relation to established knowledge. It is an enlightened sense of how things work. There is none of that attitude in naturopathy. Nowhere in the textbook, nor in any of the other literature mentioned above, is there even a single, significant example of healthy skepticism regarding unlikely claims. The Libraries An examination of the contents of the libraries at Bastyr University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine reveals more evidence that science is, in the ivy-covered halls of naturopathy, little more than a window dressing. One of the naturopathic representatives told the Commission that she regularly reads Circulation, but neither that journal, nor most other notable medical journals, is to be found in the schools' libraries. The few that are, which in the case of NCNM number exactly three out of about 150, are recent additions. The rest are a hodge-podge of pseudoscience, typified by the International Journal of Aromatherapy, Iridology Review, and the Journal of Anthroposophic Medicine.xxxii The \"New Books\" section is even flimsier: laden with titles such as Life Extenders and Memory Boosters! , Breathing Free: The Revolutionary 5-Day Program to Heal Asthma, and Better Sex Naturally, it reads more like the \"New Age\" section at a popular bookstore than a medical library.xxxiii One can reasonably conclude that naturopathic students are led to believe that this literature constitutes a serious discussion of health and disease. \"Scientific\" Research 10 If naturopathic medicine is a scientific field, one should expect significant scientific research to be carried out at the major naturopathic training programs. At the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, Anna MacIntosh, N.D., Dean of Research, is studying \"Gerson Therapy.\"xxxiv This is an absurd, long-since discredited cancer treatment that includes \"detoxification\" with coffee enemas, ozone enemas, massive quantities of juices made from fruits, vegetables, and raw calves' livers, and other arduous regimens. The study, apparently, has no control group. The treatment bears no relation whatsoever to anything that is known about cancer, and is itself toxic.xxxv Bastyr University boasts a federally funded project that looks at naturopathic treatments for HIV patients, but the treatments themselves are a huge assortment of barely plausible guesses, some of which are toxic, and again, there is no control group. Even though the investigators admit that the results are not in, they still believe that their therapeutic recommendations should be instituted now: \"In the meantime, we urge physicians to apply [these] principles of naturopathic medicine in the care of their HIV+ patients.\"xxxvi Their \"research,\" in short, is directed only at supporting their preconceived ideological beliefs. Such an incautious, anti-scientific attitude would never be tolerated in legitimate clinical practice or research. Naturopaths have had ample opportunity over many decades to test their claims scientifically, but have failed to do so. For example, they claim to effectively treat streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) without antibiotics but \"with very low incidence of poststreptococcal sequelae\" including rheumatic heart disease, but they offer no data to support this astonishing claim.xxxvii Any rational physician evaluating the AANP Position Paper on \"strep throat\" will quickly realize that if naturopathic treatments were to become common, the incidence of rheumatic fever would rebound to levels not seen since the introduction of penicillin. There are many other claims that lend themselves to simple study, a few of which are that it is wrong to suppress a fever,xxxviii that \"vaginal depletion packs\" can cure cervical dysplasia,xxxix that goldenseal can cure an acute urinary tract infection,xl and that naturopathic treatments can reliably cure acute otitis media (to be discussed below). Naturopaths have offered no data, not even case series by individual practitioners, to support these or any other unlikely assertions. Many of the claims that naturopaths make, moreover, have already been disproved in other settings. Some of these are \"chelation therapy\" for coronary artery disease,* homeopathy, \"iridology\" and \"applied kinesiology\" as diagnostic methods (to be discussed below), and the ability to detect \"craniosacral rhythms.\"xli Although such claims were implausible to begin with and have since been the subjects of definitive negative studies, naturopaths persist in advocating their validity. A Non-Scientific Textbook * This claim is made in the Textbook of Natural Medicine, pp.1078-1082. Chelation therapy has long been recognized as an implausible treatment based on a simplistic, superficial misunderstanding of atherosclerosis. A recent review of the entire literature of its use for coronary artery disease, performed by a well-known proponent of alternative medicine, concluded: \"The most striking finding is the almost total lack of convincing evidence for efficacy. Given the potential of chelation therapy to cause severe adverse effects, this treatment should now be considered obsolete.\" (Ernst E. Chelation therapy for coronary heart disease: An overview of all clinical investigations. Am Heart J. 2000 Jul; 140(1): 4-5) 11 The Textbook of Natural Medicine, the major textbook of the field of naturopathy, cites \"10,000 references\" to support its claims. The \"10,000 references\" are irrelevant to the issues, as will be shown in some detail in the section below on \"natural medicines.\" An example is this: in a chapter on AIDS, colloidal silver is recommended for the treatment of opportunistic bacterial and yeast infections. The authors justify this by citing a study in which colloidal silver is used not as a medicine, but as a preservative. In fact, colloidal silver is a well-known, toxic heavy metal, and has been declared unsafe by the FDA for any medicinal use. A Non-Scientific Journal The major journal in the field is the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine. The naturopathic representative to the Commission was asked during the January 9th meeting if she would bring copies of this journal for general perusal (it is not to be found in any local medical library). She replied that she was reluctant to do so. That it is understandable, if the following brief review of the journal's content is accurate: The AANP publishes the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine, which has been issued six times between 1990 and 1996. The issues have run from about 80 to 100 pages. The third issue is devoted to \"Non-Standard HIV/ARC/AIDS Management.\" The fifth, which attacks immunization, contains papers suggesting that vaccines may be a factor in causing cancer and that homeopathic prophylaxis using nosodes would be effective and safer than standard vaccines. (Nosodes are homeopathic products made from pathological organs or tissues: causative agents such as bacteria, fungi, ova, parasites, virus particles and yeast; disease products; or excretions.) The sixth issue promotes the use of \"natural\" products for cancer and contains an absurd article claiming that measuring the electrical resistance of the skin may be a useful way to diagnose the early stages of cancer and AIDS. -Stephen Barrett, M.D. (Consumer health activist and creator of the Quackwatch website)xlii The founder of the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine is Peter D'Adamo, ND. He is the author of two popular books that make the absurd claims that one's blood type determines what sort of diet one should choose, and that \"there is a blood-type profile for almost every aspect of our lives.\"xliii The \"Science\" of Natural Medicines A disregard for science is also apparent in naturopathic claims regarding herbal and other \"natural\" medicines. Herbal medicines (\"botanicals\"), glandular extracts, vitamins, and minerals are key to the practice of naturopathy. From the public's point of view these agents distinguish naturopaths from medical doctors more than any other difference. A large fraction of the 12 Textbook of Natural Medicine (TNM), perhaps one-third, is devoted to these agents. Dr. Alan Trachtenberg suggested to the Commission that naturopaths could be the \"learned intermediaries\" that the public needs to help make sense of the myriad \"natural remedies\" that are freely available in the wake of the Dietary and Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. One might expect, then, that on this topic naturopathic practitioners can demonstrate real expertise. Such is not the case. A reliable, up-to-date source for information regarding herbal and other \"natural\" medicines is the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCD).xliv Here, quoted from a review in JAMA, is a summary of its contents: This superb book subjects 964 natural medicines to current standards of scientific scrutiny. The editors' strict, evidence-based grading system allows them to rate the performance of such remedies for their various indications. Efficacy is supported by at least two randomized, prospective, controlled, adequately large human studies that give positive results for clinically relevant end-points plus publication in an established refereed journal.xlv Although it leaves aside all the practical difficulties involved in the use of raw botanicals that our pre-20th century forbears struggled with,xlvi this database ranks medicines for safety and efficacy, and discusses other relevant issues such as possible mechanisms of action, contraindications, interactions with other drugs and disease states, and more. Only the \"effective\" category suggests efficacy equivalent to FDA-approved drugs, which are the ones prescribed by MD's. The \"likely effective\" category suggests that the substance deserves to be studied extensively for efficacy and safety, because it shows some promise to be a useful addition to the pharmacopoeia. The \"possibly effective\" category suggests only that the substance is worth looking at because it might prove to be useful. To further the analogy with FDA-approved drugs, consider that the vast majority of \"possibly effective\" conventional drugs would never win FDA approval.* At the recent Harvard complementary and integrative medicine course, at least three national experts on herbal medicines recommended the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database as a reliable source. Thus we can make useful comparisons of claims made by naturopaths with a reference work that responsible investigators in the field of natural medicines find acceptable. This has been done for several \"natural remedies.\" The results are provided in Appendix I. The comparisons are not favorable to naturopathic claims. Only a few agents and indications that are highly touted by the Textbook of Natural Medicine (TNM) received even a \"possibly effective\" rating by the NMCD. Some received a \"likely ineffective\" rating. For the vast majority, there was * \" 'a minuscule number of drugs we test ever reach testing in man,' says Richard Salvador, Ph.D., a Hoffmann-La Roche vice president and international director of preclinical development. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America organization estimates that only five in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only one of those five may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\" -quoted from FDA Consumer article on drug development: From Test Tube To Patient: New Drug Development in the United States. See: http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/ndd_toc.html 13 \"insufficient reliable information\" to come to any conclusion. An example is vitamin C. It is recommended for nearly one hundred non-standard indications in the TNM, but according to the NMCD is \"possibly effective\" for only one: modestly reducing the duration of the common cold. For the rest it is either \"likely ineffective\" or there is \"insufficient reliable information\" upon which to base any conclusion. Most of the claims in the Textbook of Natural Medicine are grossly exaggerated and based not on human studies but on speculations rooted in naturopathic ideology, occasionally supported by in vitro (\"test tube\") studies or animal studies. Frequently, claims for vitamins are extrapolations from their role in reversing the classic vitamin deficiency states, but these aren't applicable to patients who are not vitamin deficient. An example, in the Textbook's discussion of glaucoma, is this: \"of foremost importance in achieving collagen integrity are optimal tissue concentrations of ascorbic acid\" (vitamin C).xlvii This is not strictly false, but is irrelevant unless the patient is suffering from scurvy, and it has nothing to do with the pathogenesis of glaucoma. To illustrate this point, consider that water is also \"of foremost importance in achieving collagen integrity,\" but more of it than usual will neither prevent nor treat glaucoma. Here is an instructive correspondence with one of the editors of the Natural Medicines 2001, 8:54 AM According to the Textbook of Natural Medicine (Pizzorno and Murray, Churchill Livingstone, 1999), \"Goldenseal is one of the most effective of the herbal antimicrobial agents. Its long history of use by herbalists and naturopathic physicians for the treatment of infections is well documented in the scientific literature.\" Your monograph mentions only a suggestion of this in the \"people use for\" field, and nothing at all about it in the \"effectiveness\" field. Is the statement in the Textbook incorrect? Thanks, Kimball Atwood, M.D. Hello Dr. Atwood, We often find that our standards for suggesting a given natural product is effective or not are much higher than that typically found in the \"naturopathic\" literature. Often with the Textbook of Natural Medicine and other similar references, it is implied that products work for certain conditions based on in vitro or animal data. This is the case with goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis). In some cases, studies with an isolated and purified constituent of goldenseal (berberine) have also been used to imply that goldenseal 14 is effective. Goldenseal is promoted for everything from viral infections to bacterial to fungal infections. Unfortunately, there is almost no clinical evidence that it works for any of these conditions. We do not make the leap from animal data and in vitro data to say that natural products work for a given condition. Furthermore, as you will see in our Mechanism of Action section, there is some evidence that the active constituent of goldenseal probably doesn't reach serum levels adequate to have a clinically significant effect. Take care, Philip J. Gregory, Pharm.D. Assistant Editor Natural Medicines Database also appears to use a \"much higher\" set of standards in discussing safety. Just as efficacy is exaggerated in the TNM, dangers are minimized. This is especially true for uses of agents in pregnant or breast-feeding women, which is rarely mentioned by the TNM but frequently cautioned by the NMCD. Here are some examples: according to the NMCD vitamin C, given to pregnant women in doses above the RDA (70 mg/day), may result in scurvy in the newborn child. This is mentioned in the TNM, but it recommends 500 mg/day for pregnant women. The NMCD calls goldenseal \"likely unsafe used long-term or in high doses ('cardiac damage, spasms, and death'), and in newborns; unsafe in pregnant women; unsafe for breast-feeding mothers\"; the TNM merely states, \"not recommended for use during pregnancy and higher doses may interfere with vitamin B metabolism.\" The NMCD calls licorice \"unsafe\" and \"contraindicated\" in pregnancy, because it can cause spontaneous abortions. This is not mentioned in the TNM, even though it cites some of the other potential toxicities of licorice. The major safety issue having to do with largely ineffective \"natural medicines,\" of course, is the problem of their being substituted for other, truly effective, medicines. When this is done for patients with serious illness, disastrous outcomes can occur. The Textbook of Natural Medicine and other naturopathic treatises recommend such substitutions repeatedly. Several examples are offered below. Laetrile 15 Further insight into the extent to which naturopaths accept unscientific claims for drug effectiveness is found in the notorious case of laetrile. Laetrile, also known as amygdalin or \"vitamin B17,\" is a poisonous cancer \"remedy\" derived from apricot pits. Although lacking scientific basis, it has been promoted for years by various \"alternative healers.\" Several patients have died from cyanide toxicity (cyanide is a component of laetrile) and the FDA fought a long battle to prevent the sale of laetrile in the United States. Laetrile zealots staged public rallies around the country, deceptively framing the issue as one of \"freedom of choice in cancer therapy,\"xlviii a stance that is echoed by the AANP's \"Cancer Position Paper.\"xlix American authorities finally drove it out of the country, but it is still being used in Mexico. Because of enormous political pressure it was ultimately subjected to a rigorous human study at the Mayo Clinic in the early 1980's, given according to the recommendations of proponents. Here is the abstract of the report from the New England Journal of Medicine: A clinical trial of amygdalin (Laetrile) in the treatment of human cancer. One hundred seventy-eight patients with cancer were treated with amygdalin (Laetrile) plus a \"metabolic therapy\" program consisting of diet, enzymes, and vitamins. The great majority of these patients were in good general condition before treatment. None was totally disabled or in preterminal condition. One third had not received any previous chemotherapy. The pharmaceutical preparations of amygdalin, the dosage, and the schedule were representative of past and present Laetrile practice. No substantive benefit was observed in terms of cure, improvement or stabilization of cancer, improvement of symptoms related to cancer, or extension of life span. The hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range. Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment.l Dr. Relman's accompanying editorial was unequivocal: Laetrile has had its day in court. The evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, is that it doesn't benefit patients with advanced cancer, and there is no reason to believe that it would be any more effective in the earlier stages of the disease . . . The time has come to close the books.li This may have closed the books on laetrile for most people but not, apparently, for many naturopaths. In 1994, a full 12 years after the Mayo Clinic report, the following scene occurred at the California state legislature: My second testimony was in 1994. After sitting through hearings on a suite of other bills, the naturopathic licensure bill came up. Four or so 16 naturopaths and supporters then gave a series of sermons on the evils of medicine and the benefits of naturopathy. One said they were being treated like the government treated laetrile, victimizing a natural treatment with unfair and biased attitudes, and accused several of the committee members of being in the pocket of the CMA (which I was not representing.) Recognizing the looks on the members' faces, I realized that the naturopaths had shot themselves down. I pocketed my prepared remarks, and stated only that I never imagined that I would come to this hearing and hear laetrile resurrected, and that I did not think that anything else I would say would alter the opinions of the committee more than what I had just heard, and then was excused. The bill was referred to some shelf or other to be voted on later, and was never out of committee... lii Perhaps the present naturopathic legislative initiative learned something from that experience, because laetrile has not been mentioned here. Or, perhaps, the field has finally decided that laetrile isn't good medicine, but there is nothing to suggest that in naturopathic literature. Naturopaths in general have given no indication that their belief in the benefits of laetrile has been dampened since the Mayo Clinic study. In 1991 the National Council Against Health Fraud reported that three Oregon naturopaths had noted that a group of 22 patients treated with laetrile at the Contreras Clinic in Mexico had died within two years. Nevertheless, the naturopaths \"were still not willing to close the door on Laetrile because the patients had been treated with 'immunosuppressive' conventional therapies.\"liii Members of the Commission may recall that Massachusetts has had its own experiences with laetrile, both commendable and tragic. Senator Edward Kennedy chaired the 1977 subcommittee that held hearings on laetrile. He concluded that laetrile advocates were \"slick salesmen who would offer a false sense of hope\" to cancer patients.liv The infamous case of three-year-old Chad Green is another story: As Laetrile became newsworthy, several cancer victims treated with it drew widespread media scrutiny. One was Chad Green, who developed acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 2 1/2. Although he was rapidly brought into remission with chemotherapy, his parents started him on \"metabolic therapy\" administered by a Manner Metabolic Physician. When Chad developed signs of cyanide toxicity, Massachusetts authorities had him declared a ward of the court for treatment purposes only. His parents then brought suit to reinstitute \"metabolic therapy.\" When the court ruled against them, they fled with Chad to Mexico, where he was treated by Dr. Contreras. Several months later Chad died in a manner suggestive of cyanide poisoning. Dr. Contreras stated that the boy had died of leukemia, but was a good example of the effectiveness of Laetrile because he had died a pleasant death!lv Chad Green died in 1979. His form of cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia, was curable even at that time. Members of the Commission should note that if naturopaths had been licensed in Massachusetts, Chad's mistreatment would have met the standard of care for a licensed health care practitioner. Conflict of Interest 17 There is a clear-cut conflict of interest at work in naturopathic practitioners' zeal to prescribe \"natural medicines,\" which is shared by their national society. Consider the following press release (emphasis added): FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Aliza sharon.rice@mothernature.com MOTHERNATURE.COM ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH TWO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS Agreements with Landmark Healthcare and the AANP Offer Marketing of MotherNature.com Products & Information to Millions of Patients CONCORD FARMS, MA (January 6, 2000) - MotherNature.com (Nasdaq: MTHR), a leading online information source and e-tailer of vitamins, supplements, minerals, and other natural and healthy living products, today announced partnerships with two leading alternative care health organizations to provide natural health products and information to their members. The agreements with Landmark Healthcare and the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) will promote MotherNature.com to millions of patients and healthcare practitioners of the two organizations. AANP The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians is the leading organization for Naturopaths, representing about 650 active physicians. A licensed naturopathic physician (N.D.) attends a four-year graduate-level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an M.D. but also studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. With this new alliance, an AANP doctor can set up a personal dispensary on MotherNature.com and become part of MotherNature.com's Wellness Advisor Network, an online, interactive forum to improve patient care and extend the relationship between patient and practitioner beyond the office walls. The N.D. can then send a patient to their personal site to learn about and purchase the natural products they find efficacious in treatment. \"It is an excellent added value for our N.D.'s to provide their patients with easy access to a trustworthy source for the broad array of natural health products and information they recommend every day in clinical practice,\" added Sheila Quinn, Executive Director of the AANP. \"We look forward to growing this partnership with MotherNature.com and finding new and innovative ways to work together.\" About MotherNature.com, Inc. MotherNature.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: MTHR) established an Internet site in 1995. It is a leading online retailer of a vast array of vitamins, supplements, minerals, and other natural and healthy living products. MotherNature.com is 18 also a leading provider of health information on the Internet, with contributions from a panel of health and medical professionals. The company maintains its corporate office in Concord, MA, a distribution center in Springfield, MA, and a customer support center in Acton, MA.lvi This press release means that the AANP and its members have a profit-seeking, commercial arrangement with a drug company. It's been suggested to this Commission that alternative medicine practitioners not be held to the same ethical standards as physicians, because in some fields \"it's been traditional to sell products out of the office.\"lvii This is simply wrong. A conflict of interest is exactly that, tradition notwithstanding. The AANP, to its discredit, doesn't see it that way. In its \"Sales of Medications by Physicians\" position paper, it dismisses the obvious conflict of interest and sanctions the practice.lviii What's more, the AANP shares in the profits. Here's the deal: 5. How does the AANP benefit when I join the Wellness Advisor Network? The AANP receives 1% of all the retail transactions made by your patients through your Web site. By integrating the Wellness Advisor Network into your practice, you generate revenues that will help maintain and build our organization. 6. What is the benefit to AANP members? The AANP has negotiated a 24% referral fee structure for our members - 4% more than the 20% received by other providers. The referral fee is paid on the retail sales from your patients through your website.lix Such a pact turns out to be nothing new for organized naturopathic \"medicine.\" Consider the means by which it achieved licensure in Utah in 1996: HEALTH FOODS INDUSTRY GROUP GETS NATUROPATHIC PRACTICE ACT IN UTAH The sweetheart relationship between naturopaths and the health food industry became more transparent with the passage of a naturopathic licensure act in Utah. Health Forum, the lobbying organization that pulled off the action, was led by Rae Howard, President of the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), and President of Good Earth Natural Foods at Orem, Utah. In NNFA Today (5/96, p.9) Howard boasts that: \"every state legislator received a visit by representatives from Health Forum and other constituents. Grassroots meetings and training sessions were held throughout the state beginning last September, to explain the bill to consumers, train them in the political process and organize support.\"lx The very schools of naturopathy themselves, which one might expect to be pristine, are not immune to the same temptation. This item appeared in the 1995 summer edition of the National Council Against Health Fraud news: HEALTH FOODS INDUSTRY INFLUENCES NATUROPATHIC EDUCATION 19 Bastyr University, a naturopathic college in Seattle, has added several board members who are associated with the natural products industry. Included are Past President of the National Nutritional Foods Association Martie Whittekin, Sandy Gooch, founder of Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Markets, Michael Murray, ND, Director of Research and Product Development at Enzymatic Therapy, and Jerry Schlesser, ND,DC, President and CEO of IsoChem Corporation. [Natural Health Advocate Winter, 1995 (a publication of Bastyr University as \"an update for the natural products industry.\")] Comment: The symbiotic relationship between naturopathic education and the health food industry (natural foods, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and homeopathic remedies) is scandalous. If drug companies were wielding comparable influence on a medical school there would be a national outcry. It makes naturopathic education appear to be a conspiracy between the health food industry and pseudomedicine.lxi And finally: ENZYMATIC THERAPY, INC. Ira Milner, RD, reports (Nutrition Forum, Nov-Dec, 1990) on his experience of attending a New Jersey seminar along with \"more than 100 retailers and a few chiropractors\" put on by Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. of Green Bay, Wisconsin. Before the program began, participants were asked to sign a \"guarantee\" that they were not agents of the FDA, Better Business Bureau, or any other consumer protection agency; and, that they would not tape the seminar for use against the company by any government agency. The seminar lasted from 9 am to 6 pm, and featured company president Terence J. Lemerond, ND, BS, CNC, Kenneth R. Daub, DC, and Michael T. Murray, ND, who practices naturopathy in Bellevue, Washington and teaches \"therapeutic nutrition\" at John Bastyr College, a naturopathic school in Seattle. Milner details how these promoters work to circumvent the law in the promotion of unapproved drugs disguised as nutritional products. Milner says, \"rather than seek FDA approval, Lemerond and his associates have been using subterfuge to 'distance' illegal claims from their product labels. The fact that this effort has prospered is not the result of its cleverness but of FDA sluggishness. As should be obvious from this report, evidence of wrongdoing is not difficult to obtain.\"lxii Remember Michael T. Murray? He's the co-author/editor of the Textbook of Natural Medicine. He continues to capitalize on his apparent academic stature by shilling for such enterprises as \"Natural Factors,\" a purveyor of herbs and vitamins, and \"BodyBalance,\" a company that hawks dubious laboratory tests directly to unwary consumers.lxiii One of these \"tests\" is hair analysis, an example of consumer fraud that is discussed below. In light of the conflict of interest documented above and their lack of knowledge of the safety and efficacy of natural remedies, can the Commission really think of naturopaths as \"learned intermediaries\" between a poorly regulated market and a na\u00efve public? 20 Clinical Naturopathy Dubious Diagnostic Methods Naturopaths use numerous, highly questionable \"diagnostic\" methods. Here are a few: \"Electrodiagnostic\" testing. Also known as \"electroacupuncture according to Voll,\" (EAV), electrodermal screening (EDS), bioelectric functions diagnosis (BFD), bio resonance therapy (BRT), or bio-energy regulatory technique (BER). The claims made for this \"test\" are endless: disease diagnoses, allergies, vitamin, mineral, and other deficiencies. In spite of one of the names, this technique has very little to do with acupuncture. The instruments that supposedly perform the tests, while appearing impressive and high-tech to patients, are really just galvanometers that measure skin resistance to a tiny electric current. Some of the newer ones provide an instant readout on a video screen of \"therapeutic\" recommendations, e.g., acupuncture, dietary changes, vitamin supplements, and/or homeopathic remedies. The FDA has ruled that these devices are worthless and cannot be legally marketed or imported into the U.S. for diagnostic or treatment purposes.lxiv The Textbook of Natural Medicine admits that the technique is \"controversial\" and suggests, naively, that \"in order for [it] to gain wider acceptance, more research and clinical trials will have to be conducted.\" In a contradiction, it subsequently describes its \"advantages\" as being \"inexpensive\" and \"easily applied,\" and implies that its continued popularity among naturopaths is somehow excused by consideration of \"medicophilosophical paradigms.\"lxv The AANP is also equivocal about electrodiagnostic devices, having called them \"experimental\" in a 1992 position paper that also calls for investigational studies.lxvi But instead of conducting such studies, which would have been simple to do, however nonsensical, the AANP is still condoning electrodiagnostic testing in its position paper on homeopathy.lxvii Experimental or not, illegal or not, these devices enjoy continued popularity among naturopaths, as evidenced by the \"Equipment 4 Sale\" pages at the AANP website.lxviii The following are telling examples (underlines added): Clinic Closing, EAV Screening Device for Sale, A Listen System.

Contact: Michele Goodwin, N.D. 555 Soquel Ave., Suite 260-H, Santa Cruz, CA 95062; (408) 459-9206 email: doctorg@cruzio.com In situations where practitioners are eligible for third party reimbursement, at least one commercial organization is recommending that electrodiagnostic testing be billed under \"biofeedback\" CPT codes,lxix which is a clear example of fraud.lxx Hair analysis. Commercial hair analysis can supposedly diagnose mineral \"imbalances.\" Although it is an established method for diagnosing arsenic poisoning, naturopaths claim far more: Hair Analysis Conditions which may be caused or aggravated by a mineral imbalance include Depression, Hypoglycemia, Hyperactivity, Headaches, Arthritis, Hypertension, and many others. HAIR ANALYSIS CAN DETERMINE MINERAL IMBALANCES! For further information call 1-800-876-3813, or send e-mail.lxxi There is no evidence for any of these things, but there is ample evidence that the enterprise is deceptive. Consider this experience of consumer health activist Stephen Barrett, M.D.: In 1983 and 1984, I sent hair samples from two healthy teenagers to 13 of the commercial laboratories. In 1985, I sent paired samples from one of the girls to five more labs. The reported levels of most minerals varied considerably between identical samples sent to the same laboratory, and from laboratory to laboratory. The laboratories also disagreed about what is \"normal\" or \"usual\" for many of the minerals, so that a given mineral value might be considered low by some laboratories, normal by others and high by others. Most of the reports contained computerized interpretations that were voluminous and potentially frightening to patients. The nine labs that 22 included supplement advice in their reports suggested them every time, but the types and amounts varied widely from report to report and from lab to lab. Many of the items recommended were bizarre mixtures of vitamins, minerals, nonessential food substances, enzymes, and extracts of animal organs. One report diagnosed 23 \"possible or probable conditions,\" including atherosclerosis and kidney failure, and recommended 56 supplement doses per day. Literature from most of the laboratories suggested that their reports were useful in managing a wide variety of diseases and supposed nutrient imbalances. I concluded that commercial use of hair analysis in this manner is unscientific, economically wasteful, and probably illegal, and that even if hair analysis were a valuable diagnostic tool, it is doubtful whether the laboratory reports themselves were reliable.lxxii Have the labs improved since then? No: New study debunks hair analysis. In 1999, researchers from the California Department of Health located nine laboratories and sent identical samples to six of them. The reported mineral levels, the alleged significance of the findings, and the recommendations made in the reports differed widely from one to another. The researchers concluded that the procedure is still unreliable and recommended that government agencies act vigorously to protect consumers.lxxiii The Textbook of Natural Medicine deceptively states that hair analysis has been proven for diagnosis of heavy metal toxicity (in fact, it is only useful to detect the presence of substances that do not normally exist in the body, such as certain drugs, and poisoning by two heavy metals: arsenic and methyl mercurylxxiv). The Textbook also suggests myriad unproven applications, many of which are clearly fanciful, e.g., measuring levels of hair manganese in mothers to predict the risk of congenital malformations in their infants.lxxv Elsewhere in the Textbook hair analysis is called \"perhaps the most useful screening test for calcium balance,\"lxxvi a statement that is not only false, but that also betrays a complete misunderstanding of the role of calcium in the body. Applied Kinesiology (AK). This is a method for \"diagnosing\" food allergies, nutritional deficiencies, and other problems by assessing muscle weakness. Nutritionist Kurt Butler explains the technique: The subject to be tested stands erect with one arm relaxed and the other held straight out with the palm down. The tester presses down on the subject's wrist for a second or two and gauges the resistance to the pressure. Now a finger of the subject's free hand is stuck into a bottle of aspirin (for example) so it is in contact with the tablets. The extended arm immediately weakens, we are told, because aspirin is a poison and the body's \"aura\" somehow senses this. AK practitioners also claim that nutritional deficiencies, allergies, and other adverse reactions to food substances can be detected by placing substances in the mouth so that the patient salivates. \"Good\" substances will make specific muscles stronger, whereas \"bad\" substances will 23 cause specific weaknesses. A series of tests for nutrients can take many hours over a period of days or even weeks. Since our requirements supposedly change often, retesting at least every two months is recommended. As if this were not enough, the procedure is also recommended for a long list of suspected allergens that could cause vague but serious problems without our knowledge.lxxvii It doesn't take much biological sophistication to recognize the illusory nature of this technique. Nevertheless the Textbook of Natural Medicine lists it, along with EAV, as \"inexpensive\" and \"easily applied.\"lxxviii The author suggests that \"more research needs to be done,\" betraying a paucity of appropriate skepticism. In addition, he was apparently unaware that several studies had already failed to support \"applied kinesiology\" well before the publication of the 2nd edition of the Textbook.lxxix,lxxx,lxxxi,lxxxii Iridology. Also known as \"iris analysis\" or \"iris diagnosis,\" this claim has been called \"the most valuable tool of the naturopath.\"lxxxiii Stephen Barrett explains: Iridology is based on the bizarre belief that each area of the body is represented by a corresponding area in the iris of the eye (the colored area around the pupil). According to this viewpoint, a person's state of health and disease can be diagnosed from the color, texture, and location of various pigment flecks in the eye. Iridology practitioners claim to diagnose \"imbalances\" that can be treated with vitamins, minerals, herbs, and similar products. Some also claim that the eye markings can reveal a complete history of past illnesses as well as previous treatment. One textbook, for example, states that a white triangle in the appropriate area indicates appendicitis, but a black speck indicates that the appendix had been removed by surgery. Bernard Jensen, D.C., the leading American iridologist, states that \"Nature has provided us with a miniature television screen showing the most remote portions of the body by way of nerve reflex responses.\" He also claims that iridology analyses are more reliable and \"offer much more information about the state of the body than do the examinations of Western medicine.\"lxxxiv Iridology, like the other techniques described above, has been subjected to several controlled studies that, unsurprisingly, failed to support its claims.lxxxv In spite of this it is still taught at Bastyr University.lxxxvi Dubious Clinical Entities Clinical naturopathy is infused with simplistic themes of \"toxins,\" \"food allergies,\" \"weak digestion,\" a \"weak immune system,\" and other ideas that do not correspond with facts and principles of scientific medicine and therefore have no practical meaning. When naturopaths 24 claim to treat \"the underlying cause of the illness,\" these are the \"causes\" that they invoke. Naturopaths weave these themes together in ways that may sound convincing to unsophisticated patients. What follows are several representative examples. Food Allergies Food allergies are considered by naturopaths to be an almost universal phenomenon. They are invoked, at least as a contributing factor, to explain virtually every complaint. Emily Kane, N.D. explains: Some of the most common warning signs of food allergy are: Dark circles under the eyes (allergic \"shiners\") Puffiness under the eyes Horizontal creases in the lower eyelids Fluid retention and bloating (not the pre-menstrual kind) Chronic swollen glands (under the jaw, armpits, groin) Symptoms and diseases associated with food allergy are: Gastrointestinal: Canker sores, celiac disease (an extreme intolerance to a fraction of wheat called gliadin , which produces crippling diarrhea and weight loss), stomach ulcer, gas, irritable colon, malabsoprtion, ulcerative colitis (may often produce blood in the stool and a constant hungry feeling). Genitourinary: Bed-wetting (eneuresis), chronic bladder infections (cystitis), kidney disease Immune: Chronic infections including ear infections Mental/Emotional: Anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, inability to concentrate, insomnia, irritability, mental confusion, personality change, seizures. Musculoskeletal: Bursitis, joint pain, low back pain. Respiratory: Asthma, chronic bronchitis, wheezing. Skin: Acne, eczema (dry or weeping, itchy, thickened, reddened patches of skin usually on the face, wrists and inside elbows and knees), hives, itching, skin rash. Other: Irregular heart rate, edema (fluid swelling), fainting spells, fatigue, headache, hyperlglycemia, itchy nose or throat, migraines, sinusitis.lxxxvii Is there anyone who doesn't have some of these problems? The reality is that most of the signs, symptoms, and diseases listed above are not caused by, or causative of, food allergies. Food allergies are relatively uncommon, estimated to occur in about 1-2% of adults and about 4-8% of children.lxxxviii The vast majority of them are due to relatively few substances: egg, milk, peanuts, soy, and wheat for children, and peanuts, nuts, fish, and shellfish for adults. They can be life threatening. A competent allergist should perform their diagnosis and treatment. A practitioner who expects to find multiple offending substances may well \"uncover\" these with some of the methods mentioned above, while possibly missing real allergies. 25 Additional misinformation about allergies is available on the Naturopathic Medicine Network website: Conventional treatment of allergies is most commonly directed to block the immune response, or in more severe cases, to suppress the entire immune function with steroids, both topical and systemic.lxxxix In fact, the standard treatment of allergies is directed toward avoidance of the offending agent. Claims to the contrary have the effect of instilling fear into people that physicians routinely and unthinkingly resort to the use of powerful systemic steroids. In reality, MD's recognize the side effects of steroids and avoid them unless there is no other choice. Topical steroids, moreover, rarely have any significant effect on \"the entire immune function.\" Naturopathic therapeutic approach is based on identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the disease, rather than masking its symptoms.xc This claim is repeated in virtually every naturopathic treatise. It is false. It is true that scientifically trained medical doctors don't know what causes some people to produce antibodies directed at molecules found in commonly eaten foods; but then, neither do naturopaths. If they did, one of them would have won the Nobel Prize. Evidence-based medical doctors do their best to understand and treat the underlying causes of diseases, and in many instances are successful. Most of the allergies come as a result of the decreased integrity of the mucous membranes that become 'leaky' to the numerous foreign substances, along with the repeated exposure to these substances. For instance, weak digestion and poor diet lead to the increased volume of the undigested food particles in the gut. At the same time, it causes local damage to the intestinal lining making it more permeable to the above mentioned undigested particles. As a result, we end up with a situation where we have the 'overload' of the foreign substances (undigested food that is a potential allergen) along with the damaged intestinal mucous membrane, which is more likely to allow these substances to enter the blood stream. Once a foreign substance enters the bloodstream, and especially if it does that on numerous occasions, the allergic response can be triggered.xci None of this is true. There is no evidence that \"weak digestion,\" whatever that is, leads to damage to the intestinal lining, nor is there any evidence that \"leaky\" mucous membranes lead to food allergies. If that were true, patients with ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease would have a higher incidence of food allergies than other people. They don't. By the same logic, poor integrity of the respiratory mucous membrane leads to the increased load of the airborne foreign particles on our immune system.xcii Once again, this is not true. If it were, people with tracheobronchitis would be especially prone to develop allergies to inhaled substances. They are not. Smokers, in particular, would be more likely to have allergies to airborne particles. They are not. 26 If this situation continues for a long period of time, the person is very likely to become allergic to almost everything, as he/she is no longer capable to prevent [sic] foreign substances from entering his/her system.xciii This is untrue, but imagine the impact on a patient of telling her that she is \"allergic to everything.\" Some people who are unsatisfied with unexplained aches or pains, or who have a psychological need for medical attention, may be gratified by such an \"explanation.\" Others, however, may be experiencing the subtle symptoms of a more serious disorder. In either case, \"diagnosing\" them with fanciful diseases is unethical. There is the potential, too, for other problems not yet considered by the Commission. For example, what would be the outcome of claims for unemployment or disability compensation for individuals diagnosed with such disorders by licensed naturopaths? The bigger problem is that if naturopaths were licensed, there would be no control over whom they might treat. Consider the results of the \"food allergy\" myth when it is elaborated to include children: CHILDREN'S HEALTH THREATENED BY DUBIOUS FOOD ALLERGY \"TREATMENTS\" A serious condition in children, \"failure to thrive\" (FTT), can result from elimination diets used to treat food allergies that are both real or imagined. The authors of a report in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine (1994:148:1150-5) evaluated 700 children referred for food allergies. Eleven children, 4 to 33 months old, were found to have FTT. No cause other than caloric restriction was found. Most parents said their child was allergic to 5 to 10 foods (avg 8.4), yet skin puncture tests failed to detect allergies in seven, and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges with foods producing positive skin findings yielded responses in only two. The majority of parents who believed their child had a food allergy were apparently mistaken. Some families that persist in potentially harmful feeding practices may be affected by psychological factors that could be addressed by counseling. [Journal Watch 12/5/94, p.93]xciv The \"food allergy\" myth, as suggested by this study, is now an element of popular culture. It is the role of licensed health care professionals to help dispel such dangerous beliefs through responsible education, not to encourage them. \"Toxemia\" and \"Detoxification\" To naturopathic practitioners, as was explained at the beginning of this document, the world is full of \"toxins.\" Kurt Butler, the nutritionist and consumer health advocate from Hawaii, was wrong about one thing: the \"toxins,\" or at least some of them, are named: according to the Textbook of Natural Medicine, antibiotics and virtually all other medicines prescribed by medical 27 doctors are \"toxins.\"xcv So are a number of other substances that obviously would be toxic if present in the body in large enough quantities, such as heavy metals, cleaning solvents, pesticides, and bacterial endotoxins. The reality is that these substances are rarely present in such quantities, and when they are require rapid diagnosis and treatment (which MD's, but not naturopaths, are trained to do) and also may have major public health implications. Naturopaths appear to argue that even tiny amounts of these \"toxins\" cause disease, but they have never so much as attempted to substantiate this idea. By falsely \"crying wolf\" over virtually every patient they see, they not only mislead and mistreat those patients and raise the general level of unfounded fears in the popular culture, but they divert public attention from legitimate health concerns. Frances Berg, the editor of Healthy Weight Journal, says this: It's an irrational concept, yet an intriguing idea, that modern life so fills us with poisons from polluted air and food additives that we need to be periodically \"cleaned out\" (\"detoxified\"). Never mind that natural chemicals in our foods are thousands of times more potent than additives, or that most Americans are healthier, live longer, and can choose from the most healthful food supply ever available. The elaborate, manipulative hoax of \"detoxification\" is gaining ground. Many people sincerely believe that their intestines, colon, and blood stream are subject to \"clogging\" by undigested foods and poisons. Food faddists seem to have a special fascination with bowels, colons, and body wastes.xcvi Naturopaths invoke toxins as an explanation for multiple problems, and explain their significance in a way that is hard for the uninitiated to refute. This is from the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine: Toxic substances are everywhere\u2014in the air we breathe, in the food we eat, and the water we drink. Even our bodies and the bacteria in our intestines produce toxic substances.xcvii This is technically true, but utterly misleading. Most toxic substances in the environment are present in such small quantities that they don't pose a significant risk. These and others that are present in larger quantities rarely gain access to our bodies in amounts that can do any harm. Humans have evolved over eons to accommodate the \"toxins\" in our intestines and those that are produced by our bodies. That's a large part of what digestive and renal physiology are all about, and in the vast majority of people these functions don't need any help, especially by such unnatural measures as enemas and fasting. Toxins can damage the body in an insidious and cumulative way.xcviii In other words, even if you don't think you are suffering from them, you probably are! What problems, specifically, do the toxins supposedly cause? A short list from Pizzorno and Murray includes \"psoriasis, acne, chronic headaches, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, chronic fatigue, muscle pains, indigestion, tremors, constipation, anemia, pallor, dizziness, poor coordination, impaired ability to think or concentrate, childhood learning disabilities, depression, 28 tingling in the hands and feet, abnormal nerve reflexes, respiratory tract allergies, increase rates for many cancers, liver diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, lupus erythematosis, pancreatitis, asthma, myasthenia gravis, and diabetes.\"xcix Some of these claims are based on actual syndromes, such as lead poisoning, which exist but are not nearly so common as naturopaths would have us believe. The rest are mere conjectures. The proposed treatments include sweeping dietary changes, multiple vitamins, antioxidants and other \"natural\" remedies sold to you by the naturopath, fasting, enemas, chelation, and more. What is the reality of the matter? As in the case of food allergies, a little common sense goes a long way. Why, if \"society has increasingly been exposed to toxic compounds in the air, water, and food,\"c has the life expectancy in industrialized nations essentially doubled in the past century? Here's another quotation from Frances Berg and colleagues: The detoxification theory can enable con artists to gain great power over their customers by diagnosing and curing \"potentially fatal\" (but nonexistent) illnesses. \"They have to invent the idea of toxins,\" says Peter Fodor, president of the Lipoplasty Society of North America, \"because that gives them something to pretend they can fix.\" It can be terrifying to believe that one's body is being poisoned by toxins from within. But if this were true, the human race would not have survived, says Vincent F. Cordaro, M.D., an FDA medical officer. \"A person who retained wastes and toxins would be very ill and could die if not treated. The whole concept is irrational and unscientific.\"ci Chronic Candidiasis (Yeast Infections) This is another \"syndrome\" that is similar to \"food allergies\" and \"toxins\": it is nearly ubiquitous, its \"effects\" are numerous, it is both alleged to be caused by and fails to be diagnosed by MD's, it has \"immune system\" implications, it usually requires \"detoxification,\" and it never goes away completely. \"Chronic candidiasis,\" variously called \"candidiasis hypersensitivity, candida-related complex, the yeast syndrome, yeast allergy, yeast overgrowth, or simply \"candida\" or \"yeast problem,\" is the invention of two fringe MD's. Stephen Barrett, MD, has summarized it succinctly: The leading promoters of \"candidiasis hypersensitivity\" have been C. Orian Truss, M.D., of Birmingham, Alabama and William G. Crook, M.D., of Jackson, Tennessee. Truss put forth his concepts with a series of articles that began in 1978 in the Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry, an offbeat publication that caters to physicians who prescribe large amounts of vitamins to emotionally disturbed patients. In 1982, he self-published a book called The Missing Diagnosis. [2]. Crook states that he began treating and communicating about yeast problems in 1979 after reading one of Truss's papers. In 1983, he 29 published the first edition of his book The Yeast Connection [3], which he says was inspired by a television appearance that drew 7,300 requests for further information. Two years later, he established the International Health Foundation to help respond to the requests he kept generating. The foundation's goals were to \"work to obtain credibility for the relationship of Candida albicans to a diverse group of health disorders\" and \"helping children with repeated ear infections, hyperactivity, attention deficits and related behavior and learning problems.\" (He also espoused a variety of unconventional theories about allergies being at the root of these problems.) During the early 1990s, a booklet describing these goals listed Tipper Gore as a member of the foundation's 33-person advisory board [4]. In 1998, Truss and Crook launched an organization called the Candida and Dysbiosis Information Foundation. The Yeast Connection states: \"If a careful check-up doesn't reveal the cause for your symptoms, and your medical history [as described in his book] is typical, it's possible or even probable that your health problems are yeast-connected.\" The book also states that tests such as cultures don't help much in diagnosis because \"Candida germs live in every person's body . . . Therefore the diagnosis is suspected from the patient's history and confirmed by his response to treatment.\" Crook claims that the problem arises because \"antibiotics kill 'friendly germs' while they're killing enemies, and when friendly germs are knocked out, yeast germs multiply. Diets rich in carbohydrates and yeasts, birth control pills, cortisone, and other drugs also stimulate yeast growth.\" He also claims that the yeasts produce toxins that weaken the immune system, which is also adversely affected by nutritional deficiencies, sugar consumption, and exposure to environmental molds and chemicals. To correct these alleged problems, he prescribes allergenic extracts, antifungal drugs, vitamin and mineral supplements, and diets that avoid refined carbohydrates, processed foods, and (initially) fruits and milk. Crook's concepts are a mixture of fact and fancy. It is correct that antibiotics, birth control pills, and certain other drugs can stimulate overgrowth of yeasts, most commonly in the vagina. However: 1. A yeast problem should not be diagnosed without definite clinical signs of an infection. The signs of a local infection, for example, can include itching, soreness, rash, and a discharge. 2. If an infection is present, treatment with an antifungal drug makes sense. However, the rest of Crook's recommendations are senseless whether an infection is present or not. Severe Criticism The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has strongly criticized the concept of \"candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome\" and the diagnostic and treatment approaches its proponents use. AAAAI's position statement concludes: (1) the concept of candidiasis hypersensitivity is speculative and unproven; (2) its basic elements 30 would apply to almost all sick patients at some time because its supposed symptoms are essentially universal; (3) overuse of oral antifungal agents could lead to the development of resistant germs that could menace others; (4) adverse effects of oral antifungal agents are rare, but some inevitably will occur; and (5) neither patients nor doctors can determine effectiveness (as opposed to coincidence) without controlled trials. Because allergic symptoms can be influenced by many factors, including emotions, experiments must be designed to separate the effects of the procedure being tested from the effects of other factors [5]. Several years ago, Crook told me that he had no intention of conducting a controlled test because he was \"a clinician, not a researcher.\"cii Pizzorno and Murray nod approvingly in the direction of Drs. Crook and Truss, citing their popular books as though they were scientific treatises, in both the Textbook of Natural Medicineciii and the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine.civ Both textbooks recommend (and publish) Dr. Crook's \"Candida Questionnaire,\" which is virtually guaranteed to make the \"diagnosis\" every time. It is provided here in Appendix II; the reader is invited to try it. I did and scored 130 points, which means that in me, \"yeast-connected health problems are probably present.\" If I had given positive responses to \"do you crave sugar\" or \"does tobacco smoke really bother you,\" both of which I almost affirmed, I would have been in the \"yeast-connected health problems are almost certainly present\" category. There are not many people who don't qualify for this \"diagnosis.\" The Common Denominator The three entities discussed above, \"food allergies,\" \"toxemia,\" and \"chronic candidiasis,\" share common themes: they are described as ubiquitous, insidious, and dangerous; they seem to provide an explanation for virtually every complaint; and they are said to be unrecognized by \"conventional\" medicine. They are dubious \"diseases,\" whether diagnosed by maverick MD's, naturopaths, \"clinical ecologists,\" or anyone else. So why, if some MD's are also making foolish claims about these \"conditions,\" pick on naturopaths? The reason is that in naturopathic, as opposed to evidence-based practice, such notions are the standard of care. These claims are promoted in the schools, in multiple treatises by naturopaths, on the website of the AANP and, perhaps most importantly, in the textbook called \"the ultimate book on naturopathic medicine.\" This, again, suggests that the field is driven more by ideology and cultism than by rational, scientific inquiry. The vast majority of MD's know that these entities have no basis in fact or reason and that to make a habit of diagnosing them constitutes unethical practice. When physicians think of discipline among their own ranks, they think of ridding the profession of such practices. It would be inconceivable to see such claims condoned by any legitimate professional society, specialty board, medical school, examination, or textbook. In naturopathic \"medicine,\" on the other hand, the very leaders of the field are touting these claims. Where is the will, or even the conceptual basis, for self-regulation? 31 Naturopathic Approaches to Specific Diseases Now that some of the common naturopathic beliefs have been explained, let's examine the naturopathic approach to a few specific diseases: Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection) The following excerpts are taken from a treatise on otitis media offered by the Naturopathic Medicine Network: Who hasn't heard a mom complaining about her child's repeated ear pain? What mom hasn't questioned the efficacy of antibiotics after receiving the tenth prescription for it, when after all the expense and side effects, the problem still remains unresolved? cv This is the usual warning against antibiotics (\"toxins\") and, by implication, MD's. Otitis media occurs when there is a bacterial growth in the internal ear leading to inflammation, which produces fluid build-up, local pain, fever and some other symptoms. Conventional medicine considers bacteria to be the root of the problem, and therefore directs the treatment to kill the bacteria with antibiotics. This appears to be a logical 'solution', which in practice however, fails more often than it works.cvi Again, evidence-based medicine is falsely portrayed. It does not consider bacteria to be the \"root of the problem.\" The problem is caused by a blocked Eustachian tube, which under normal circumstances provides the only egress for secretions from the middle ear. In small children the diameter of the Eustachian tube is tiny, so that even a small amount of swelling, such as may occur with a common cold, can precipitate blockage. Once this blockage occurs, the middle ear becomes a closed space. Since it is lined with mucous secreting cells, it inevitably fills with fluid, which can secondarily become infected with bacteria that are normally present in small quantities. Evidence-based physicians do not, furthermore, always treat otitis media with antibiotics. Pediatricians recognize two major types of otitis media, not acknowledged by the author of the quotation above: 1. Acute otitis media: characterized by fever, chills, extreme ear pain, and pus behind the tympanic membrane (eardrum). This is almost always a serious bacterial infection (even if bacteria are not the initial \"cause\") requiring treatment with an antibiotic.cvii A subset of these children will develop devastating complications if left untreated, including perforation of the eardrum, hearing loss, acute mastoiditis, brain abscess, and bacterial meningitis.cviii To withhold antibiotics in these cases would constitute malpractice. 2. Otitis media with effusion (OME; also known as \"chronic serous otitis media\"): characterized by a persistent middle ear effusion that is not pus, not terribly symptomatic, and not significantly infected by bacteria. Antibiotics have not been shown to be useful in this type of otitis media, and are not recommended.cix Most cases of OME, which is the more common type, get better without any treatment. 32 Regardless of the type, if there are multiple recurrences otitis media is sometimes treated by addressing the underlying problem, which is the lack of drainage from the middle ear. Inserting tiny tubes through the eardrum allows drainage to take place. In children this requires general anesthesia, but contrary to naturopathic literaturecx it is safe, effective, quick, and painless, and has been a significant medical advance. It is done for comfort and to avoid the many complications that can occur with recurrent otitis media, including but not limited to scarring of the eardrum, damage to the delicate bones in the middle ear, and damage to the inner ear, all of which contribute to hearing loss.cxi Remember what bacteria feed on? Yes, bacteria feed on sugar, and if you remove it from a microbiological media, bacteria simply won't be able to grow. By the same logic: reduce the sugar load on the human body, and bacteria will have harder time infecting it.cxii The implication is completely false. The sugar content of the diet bears no relation to the sugar content of the middle ear in a person without diabetes. No practitioner with scientific training would make this simplistic blunder. Moreover, bacteria metabolize a wide variety of nutrients besides glucose. Another important factor allowing pathological bacteria to overgrow in our bodies is a weak immune system. Long-term overuse of antibiotics suppresses the immune system. And, it is the immune system which is supposed to protect us from infections in the first place.cxiii This is untrue. Normal children don't have \"weak immune systems,\" and antibiotics don't \"suppress the immune system.\" There are reports of early treatment of a certain infection resulting in a less vigorous immune response to that infectious agent, for the same reason that if the infection had not occurred in the first place there would have been no immune response. This is not \"suppression of the immune system\" at all, but an inevitable result of successful early treatment. Furthermore, a thoroughgoing reliance on the immune system and naturopathic \"remedies\" for otitis media have already been tried in the pre-antibiotic era. The results were severe and uncontrolled infections, mastoiditis, meningitis, and brain abscesses that often resulted in death or significant disability. In the case of an ear infection, naturopathic medicine seeks to address the cause rather than merely mask the symptoms. Therefore, naturopathic treatment for otitis media may include the use of a natural antibiotic if necessary for comfort, but the emphasis would be on a low sugar diet, eliminating allergens from the diet, and strengthening the immune system. Moving toward a healthy lifestyle includes: 1) Basic dietary changes; 2) Determining and avoiding food allergens; 3) Simple vitamin and nutritional supplements that will make your child stronger and less 'appealing' to pathological bacterial overgrowth; 4) Selected homeopathic remedy to improve your child's overall vitality and to strengthen the defense mechanisms; 5) Appropriate hydrotherapy treatment to increase circulation and relieve local congestion and the associated pain. 6) A well-formulated herbal formula to boost the immune system, while providing direct antimicrobial effect.cxiv 33 Here, again, are the standard naturopathic myths: \"address the cause rather than merely mask the symptoms,\" the \"causes\" in this case being \"food allergies,\" dietary sugar, and a \"weak immune system\" presumed to be caused by antibiotics prescribed by a pediatrician; a \"natural\" antibiotic (goldenseal, garlic, or colloidal silver, perhaps) for which there is no evidence of efficacy; \"simple vitamin and nutritional supplements,\" undoubtedly purchased through dispensary\" but lacking supportive evidence; \"selected homeopathic remedy,\" which sounds professional but is actually nothing at all; a \"well-formulated herbal formula to boost the immune system,\" which is fraudulent advertising because the immune system needs no \"boosting\" nor, if it did, would the herbal formula be effective. The above outlined naturopathic approach to otitis media has proven to be very effective and fundamentally curative. Naturopathic physicians throughout the country use it with a great deal of success bringing permanent relief to children and peace of mind to their parents.cxv The paragraph implies that controlled studies have been done to support these claims. They have not. No naturopath has published even an uncontrolled series of cases to suggest that the \"naturopathic approach\" works. While treatment of otitis media always requires a qualified health care practitioner, always remember that your health is in your hands. No doctor can make you or your child truly healthy unless you commit to it.cxvi This may seem like sound counsel, but consider the actual effect. The reason that naturopathic treatments seem to work is that most children with otitis media will get better with no treatment at all. For those that don't, the naturopath can always cite the fact that the patient or, in this case, the parents, weren't completely \"committed\" to the treatment. The reality is that the dietary recommendations and the multiple herbal and other \"remedies\" are so complicated that it would be almost impossible for anyone to follow them perfectly. Naturopathic medicine considers diet to be the most fundamental basis of reaching and maintaining good health. A healthy diet ensures good health, while a poor diet tops the list of factors compromising our well being.cxvii This seems to be reasonable advice, and may help the naturopath gain trust with the unsophisticated parent, but it's simply wrong. Diet is not the \"most fundamental basis of reaching and maintaining good health,\" unless the starting point is frank malnutrition. If diet can protect a child against ear infections, a proposition that any scientifically literate person would find unlikely, it has yet to be shown. A healthy diet does not necessarily \"ensure good health,\" as Adelle Davis and many other diet gurus have discovered.* To be fair, it should be pointed out that the discussion of otitis media in the Textbook of Natural Medicine is more sophisticated than that excerpted above: it acknowledges both types of otitis media, acute and chronic, and also the primacy of Eustachian tube blockage in the etiology of the * The current scientific consensus is summarized as follows: \"On a ... scientific basis it must be said that the jury is still out on the question of whether lifestyle changes, such as diet modification, really affect health.\" -Nuland SB. 9/13/00. Believe Your Doctor. The New Republic Online. http://www.thenewrepublic.com/091800/3nuland091800.html 34 disease. Nevertheless it argues against the use of antibiotics in the acute form, and repeats the same set of fallacies, e.g., \"food allergies,\" that are found in all other naturopathic discussions of the disease. AIDS An essay on AIDS, \"written by Naturopathic Physicians for the general public\" and offered on the AANP website, is another example of the mischief that pseudoscientific practitioners can produce.cxviii After falsely claiming that \"factors that contribute to the development of AIDS are liver ailments, the frequent use of antibiotics, nutritional deficiencies, digestive problems, stress, and smoking,\" it makes recommendations for herbal and other unproven methods, while failing to mention the existence of new pharmaceutical agents that are HIV protease inhibitors. The latter are the only truly effective treatment for HIV, having converted AIDS from the certain death sentence that it was only a few years ago to the chronic, non-debilitating carrier state that it now is for many treated patients. The closest that the essay comes to making a responsible statement is to recommend the \"supervision of a physician\" but this, of course, could be construed to mean a \"naturopathic physician.\" Cancer of the Prostate Another essay found on the AANP website discusses cancer of the prostate.cxix After reviewing some of the uncertainties surrounding the treatment of this disease, the author guides the na\u00efve reader toward the view that \"a watchful waiting program, monitored by your physician, offers the opportunity to pursue a natural medication program before having to resort to surgical or radiation therapy. If this is coupled with the use of diet and nutritional changes, the chances of having to undergo surgery diminish.\" To the extent that the \"physician\" in this case means a real M.D., this essay may be considered a bit less irresponsible than the aforementioned one. Nevertheless, the assertion is baseless. The author proposes a complex series of highly questionable regimens that include multiple herbal remedies said to \"attack cancerous tissue\" in various ways, radical dietary changes, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, glandular extracts, vaccination with BCG, acupuncture, and \"electrical current in the form of positive galvanism, applied transrectally.\" Such a regimen, entirely fanciful on the part of its creator, may not be well received by a patient. The author seems to acknowledge this when he writes: \"What is required is commitment on the part of the patient and physician to follow through with the therapeutic program.\" And, a bit later: \"Additionally, the patient must be helped to understand that they [sic] must make a total commitment to their health and well being in order for the treatment to ultimately be successful.\" The implication is that if it is not successful it's the patient's fault. Asthma A two part treatise on asthma on the HealthWorld Online website, promoted by the AANP, is another example of worrisome health care advice.cxx After briefly dismissing standard therapy, it 35 suggests a multitude of lifestyle and diet changes; breathing exercises; water therapy, including baths containing \"a cup or so of 3% hydrogen peroxide in the water to bring extra oxygen to the entire surface of the skin, thus making the lungs somewhat less oxygen hungry\"; spinal adjustments, because \"often the upper thoracic vertebrae will be out of alignment after an asthma attack, which will ultimately put pressure on the lungs and precipitate another attack\"; approximately 70 \"specific food remedies\"; 14 foods \"to strictly avoid: the mucous forming ones,\" many of which are common staples; 13 vitamins, minerals, and digestive enzymes; 26 herbs; 21 Chinese herbal remedies; acupuncture; homeopathic remedies different asthma presentations; \"subtle energy\" techniques including \"flower essences,\" colors, gems and minerals (\"They may be worn as jewelry, or placed around the home in special places\"); psychological approaches including \"visualization\" and \"meditation\" techniques. In the last category are numerous, meddlesome assertions that lack any basis in real knowledge: \"asthma is thought to be a manifestation of choking, either from emotional or psychological constriction\"; \"fear of estrangement from the mother and inhibition of crying may play causative roles in the initiation of asthma in children.\" The scariest is this: \"severity of asthma attack is directly related to the amount of fear and anxiety felt by the patient. Anxiety causes further bronchoconstriction. Therapy should be directed to reducing anxiety.\" The author has this exactly backwards. The anxiety is caused by the bronchoconstriction, which is understandable because the person is suffocating. Therapy should be directed at reducing the bronchoconstriction. The danger of this kind of misinformation must not be underestimated. There is not a shred of good evidence for the claims made in this article. Asthma is a serious illness; an acute, severe attack can be life threatening, and is a medical emergency. Young people die of it. The treatise in question never recommends that a patient with an acute asthma attack go to an emergency room or otherwise seek real medical treatment. It is certainly possible that children have died because parents delayed seeking medical attention in the hope that \"reducing anxiety\" was all that was needed. This treatise doesn't even recommend self-treatment with a standard asthma inhaler. The only recommendations for the treatment of an acute attack are \"colors\" and homeopathic \"remedies,\" which are worthless, and a few herbs. In the latter group one, Ephedra, has some pharmacologic rationale, but when taken by mouth its onset is slow and it is not particularly effective. It also has well-known dangers that are not mentioned. A reiteration: licensing offers regulation and public protection only for occupations that have valid, ethical bases, to which licensees must adhere, to guarantee public protection. For an occupation with little semblance of basic validity, licensure legitimizes an otherwise illegitimate, and potentially and actually dangerous, activity. A Test of Naturopathic \"Medicine\" in Massachusetts The potential result of licensing \"naturopathic physicians\" in Massachusetts has already been the subject of a preliminary study. Drs. Kathi Kemper and Anne Lee of Children's Hospital surveyed all the naturopaths that they could find in Massachusetts in the year 1998. Most were identified through the AANP or the Mass. Society of Naturopathic Physicians, and thus were representative of those seeking licensure. The investigators asked them about their pediatric training and 36 whether they treat children. They asked them if they recommend childhood immunizations and what they would do if presented with a 2-week old infant with a temperature of 101 degrees. A total of only 23 naturopaths were identified, of whom 15 responded. All 15 were graduates of four-year, on-campus naturopathic schools, according to one of the authors.cxxi Here are the results: only one third of naturopaths reported having had pediatric training, but all reported seeing pediatric patients regularly. These visits, in fact, constituted one fifth of the naturopaths' practices. Only three (20%) naturopaths recommend childhood immunizations, and only six (40%) would refer a two-week old baby with a fever to a physician or emergency facility. The authors of the study concluded, in an understatement, \"it is worrisome that a substantial proportion of these providers of pediatric care are not equipped with the clinical skills to recognize emergent conditions for which homeopathy or naturopathy might not be effective or expedient, and that could result in detrimental outcomes.\"cxxii Massachusetts has the most advanced medical care of any state in the country. It would be unwise for the Commission to recommend that the children of the Commonwealth be subjected to the naturopathic experiment. Naturopaths and Vaccination Much of this treatise has public health implications, including the spurious claims regarding food allergies, heavy metal poisoning and other \"toxins,\" and treatment of infectious childhood illness. Another glaring public health problem posed by naturopaths, and introduced above, is their anti-vaccination stance. In spite of assurances to the contrary heard by the Commission, there is ample evidence that naturopaths in general are opposed to childhood vaccinations. Childhood vaccinations have been a gift for humanity. Many members of the Commission can remember the devastating polio epidemics of the early 1950's, which were ended virtually overnight by the advent of the Salk vaccine. Other diseases that are now subject to routine childhood vaccinations, such as measles, mumps, pertussis, tetanus, rubella, and more, were once common causes of tragic deaths or disabilities in children and adults, but are now rare among vaccinated individuals.cxxiii Smallpox, one of the great historical plagues, has been eradicated from the earth solely by the policy of universal vaccination. New vaccines against certain forms of hepatitis, bacterial pneumonia, and meningitis have shown promise for greatly diminishing the impact of these diseases. The potential for vaccines that are effective against other dreaded illnesses, such as AIDS, is promising. Vaccinations are exceedingly safe: serious complications are much less common than being struck by lightning.cxxiv,cxxv Vaccinations are, by far, the most effective and important form of preventive medicine. 37 In 1968, naturopaths presented materials to the U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare in an attempt to gain approval for Medicare reimbursement (it was denied). Included in those materials were the following statements: A good case of smallpox may rid the system of more scrofulous, tubercular, syphilitic and other poisons than could otherwise be eliminated in a lifetime. Therefore, smallpox is certainly to be preferred to vaccination. The one means elimination of chronic disease, the other the making of it. Naturopaths do not believe in artificial immunization . . . cxxvi In 1981 a study of naturopaths in Washington found that \"many were opposed to routine immunization because they felt the procedure was unnatural, unnecessary and elitist.\"cxxvii In 1992 Kurt Butler reported the following: ...some naturopaths espouse an \"immunization kit\" containing homeopathic solutions and pills that supposedly protect against polio, measles, pertussis, tetanus, and other lethal diseases...The Academic Dean of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Jared Zeff, N.D., said, in reference to such products, that some naturopaths give conventional vaccines and some give homeopathic pills that \"stimulate the immune system.\"cxxviii This attitude was reinforced by the 1994 issue of the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine, as reviewed by Stephen Barrett, M.D.: The fifth [issue], which attacks immunization, contains papers suggesting that vaccines may be a factor in causing cancer and that homeopathic prophylaxis using nosodes would be effective and safer than standard vaccines. (Nosodes are homeopathic products made from pathological organs or tissues: causative agents such as bacteria, fungi, ova, parasites, virus particles and yeast; disease products; or excretions.)cxxix The 1991 AANP Position Paper on childhood vaccinations, which is still in force, is hardly a ringing endorsement. Its main message is to repeat the myths that vaccinations are dangerous and unnecessary, and that parents should be encouraged to opt out of universal vaccination programs. This is clear from the following excerpt: WHEREAS it is well documented that some of the current childhood vaccinations have been associated with significant morbidity and are of variable efficacy and necessity. THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that it is the position of the AANP that: IV. All physicians should respect that the parents or guardian have both the responsibility and freedom to decide within the range of options provided for by state law whether or not their children should receive vaccinations.cxxx 38 On the AANP website there is a table of contents for a new, on-line version of the Textbook of Natural Medicine. In it is a chapter entitled \"Vaccinations and Immune Malfunction,\" which was not present in the 1999, hard-copy edition.cxxxi Its author is Harold E. Buttram, a medical doctor whose opinions on childhood vaccinations and many other issues are at odds with rational public health initiatives. He claims that vaccinations are the cause of autism, Crohn's disease, ADHD, and many other health problems. He denies that vaccinations have been effective, other than for polio and smallpox. He also warns against water fluoridation, argues that \"food allergies\" are the cause of numerous physical and behavioral problems, and claims that \"toxins are everywhere\" in the same irrational, alarmist way that was demonstrated for naturopaths earlier in this monograph (see \" Dubious Clinical Entities,\" p. 26, and \"The Common Denominator,\" p.33).cxxxii The field of naturopathy has shown a continuing historical pattern of opposition to childhood vaccinations. Naturopaths and Other Alternative Practitioners' Views on Vaccination Naturopaths are closely allied with other \"alternative\" practitioners who are notoriously opposed to vaccinations. Homeopaths, and more importantly chiropractors, have been found in multiple studies to be opposed to vaccinations.cxxxiii,cxxxiv,cxxxv,cxxxvi Many naturopaths are also chiropractors; there is, in fact, little difference in philosophy or practice between \"mixer\" chiropractors and naturopaths.cxxxvii The history of the anti-vaccination stance among chiropractors is remarkably similar to that among naturopaths.cxxxviii It is still in full force in a large fraction of the profession. The International Chiropractors Association (ICA) sells a book entitled Vaccination: 100 Years of Orthodox Research Shows that Vaccines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System. There is even a \"religious order,\" the \"Congregation of Universal Wisdom,\" invented by a chiropractor for the sole purpose of providing a religion-based exclusion for parents who don't wish their children to be vaccinated.cxxxix The Anti-vaccination Movement and Public Health The anti-vaccination movement, much of it fueled by \"alternative\" practitioners, represents a major public health problem for the country. Myths abound, such as that vaccinations don't work, that the diseases that they supposedly prevent were already waning because of \"better hygiene,\" that vaccines cause autism, cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, and more. Many of these myths have been compiled, and refuted, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.cxl Levels of immunization lower than those expected from mainstream public health efforts are known to be dangerous, as exemplified by the following report: Immunization exemptions increase risk of measles and whooping cough. Forty-eight states now permit religious exemptions from mandatory childhood immunizations, and 15 states allow philosophical exemptions. A new study has found that in Colorado, which had more than twice the national rate of nonvaccinated children in 1994: (a) the incidence of measles during 1997-1998 was 22 times higher among exempted school-age children; (b) the incidence of pertussis during 1996-1998 was 6 times higher; (c) among preschool children in day care, these risks were about 62 times greater for measles and 16 times 39 greater for pertussis; and (d) association with nonvaccinated children increased the incidence of these diseases among those who were vaccinated. The last of these findings raises the question of whether some parents should be allowed to place other people's children at risk by refusing immunizations for their own children. [Feiken DR and others. Individual and community risks of measles and pertussis associated with personal exemptions to immunization. JAMA 284:3145-3150, 2000].cxli Here in Massachusetts Dr. Howard Koh, the Commissioner of Public Health, is rightfully proud of his efforts to increase the levels of immunization for two-year olds, which are now at an all time high.cxlii In spite of this he is clearly waging a battle against the anti-vaccination forces, as evidenced by the three page treatise on the DPH website entitled \"Making Informed Decisions About Immunizations.\"cxliii Why, among the many other objections raised herein, would the Commission want to compound this problem, and thereby degrade the health of the citizens of the Commonwealth, by legitimizing practitioners who are part of the anti-vaccination movement or who, at the least, are reluctant to recommend vaccination to parents? Naturopaths as \"Primary Care Physicians\" The naturopaths seeking licensure in Massachusetts are among those who claim to be \"primary care physicians\" and to be adequately trained for this calling. The only branches of medicine that they consider to be outside their expertise are major surgery and trauma. This claim is repeated in the literature of every major institution of the field, including the official websites of all four training programs in the U.S., the official website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), and the Textbook of Natural Medicine. Here is an example, quoted from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine website: Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) are primary care physicians, most of whom are in general private practice. They are trained to be the doctor first seen by the patient for general healthcare, for advice on keeping healthy, and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions.cxliv This pretension is the standard for the field as a whole, and is precisely what Massachusetts consumers will be led to believe if such practitioners become licensed. No crafting of legislative language can change this fact. Is it possible that naturopaths can assume the role of primary care physicians? The \"basic science\" part of naturopathic training is clearly an illusion, as was discussed above. The clinical training is equally lacking, as illustrated by the several examples of clinical naturopathy already presented. Leaving aside the irrational content of their training, moreover, there is no evidence that naturopathic students get enough exposure to patients with real diseases to learn to diagnose and treat those diseases. Simple arithmetic shows that the training of naturopaths and medical doctors cannot be comparable. Real medical school requires four years, of which at least one is spent in an 40 intensive, hospital setting learning about patients who are truly ill. To be licensed to practice medicine, a graduate M.D. must complete another year of intensive hospital training (the well-known \"internship\"). Most primary care physicians in modern times, moreover, have completed a three-year residency and passed a certification exam. Naturopathic schools also advertise a four-year curriculum, but during this time they supposedly combine standard medical training with naturopathic training, and there is no experience with sick, hospitalized, patients. Thus, for naturopaths to claim training comparable to that of even minimally qualified MD's who are allowed to practice primary care, two years of intensive hospital training would have to be added to the naturopathic curriculum, the second occurring after graduation. Since this innovation is not part of any proposal for naturopathic licensure, the result would be to construct a two-tiered medical system for the citizens of the Commonwealth. The evidence, furthermore, shows that many graduates of \"approved\" naturopathy schools (including the naturopathic representative to the Commission) do not attend the full four years at naturopathic school. Instead they receive up to two years of credit for schooling in other fields, such as chiropractic, whose teaching also deviates from the basic educational and scientific premises of evidence-based medical schools. The fact that there are some CAM providers, mainly chiropractors, who are already licensed and who receive patients by self-referral is only slightly relevant to this argument: only about 10% of patients who go to chiropractors do so for reasons other than musculoskeletal problems,cxlv whereas naturopaths attract a cross-section of patients similar to that seen by primary care MD's.cxlvi The naturopaths who have appeared at Commission meetings have stated that they always share patients with medical doctors, but are they representative of most naturopaths? A recent survey in Washington and Connecticut found otherwise. The investigators found that in these states, naturopaths discuss the care of their patients with MD's only 11% of the time.cxlvii This is not surprising, given the way that naturopaths denigrate scientific medicine, and is entirely consistent with their claim to be \"primary care physicians.\" Implications for Licensing and Regulation The naturopathic presentations to the Commission lacked most of the information presented here. Most of the discussion was diverted to the superficial trappings of legitimacy, such as the existence of four-year schools with \"basic science\" courses, a certification exam, a national society, and licensure in other states. The problem is that none of these makes the slightest bit of difference if the beliefs and claims of the field don't stand up to rational scrutiny. Dr. Edzard Ernst, Director of the Department of Complementary Medicine, School of Postgraduate Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Exeter, England, has echoed this point. Dr. Ernst is enthusiastic about \"alternative medicine\" but believes that it must be evaluated 41 according to strict, scientific criteria. In a statement that almost seems directed at this Commission, he writes: Those who would prefer to bypass rigorous research--for example, by shifting the discussion towards patients' preference--and hope to integrate unproved treatments into routine health care are unlikely to succeed in the long run. Those who believe that regulation is a substitute for evidence will find that even the most meticulous regulation of nonsense must still result in nonsense.cxlviii (italics added) Appendix III offers a disturbing example of what can happen when nonsense is made \"legitimate\" by legislative fiat. It is an account of an attempt by a California school board to help learning-disabled children. The scientifically-na\u00efve board members chose to employ chiropractors who practiced \"Neural Organization Technique\" (NOT). This is a painful squeezing of the skull that is claimed to cure everything from dyslexia to Down's syndrome. There is not the slightest biological basis for these claims. The result, in the California case, was the sanctioned torture of schoolchildren. The practitioners involved may not have been naturopaths\u2014that's not the point of this account\u2014yet naturopaths profess the same pseudoscientific nonsense that for NOT: \"applied kinesiology\" and \"cranial osteopathy.\"cxlix It is abundantly clear that naturopathy is nonsense. Naturopaths, therefore, are incapable of providing self-regulation. The question of protecting the public from \"less qualified\" naturopaths is moot. If anything, those \"traditional naturopaths\" are less of a danger, because they don't pretend to be \"primary care physicians\" who diagnose and treat illness. Why Ineffective Treatments Seem to Work What about the inevitable assertion that, in spite of everything that's been discussed here, some people just know that naturopathy (or homeopathy or aromatherapy or whatever) \"works?\" The assertion is a powerful one: a patient feels sick and goes to a doctor. The doctor prescribes a remedy and the patient feels better. Both doctor and patient conclude, with some reason, that the remedy caused the recovery. This happens not just once, but many times, and with many different patients, even if there are occasional exceptions. After a while the doctor develops a reputation for being a \"good\" doctor. She even believes it herself, and why shouldn't she? The evidence seems clear. This kind of evidence has been the basis for every \"healing\" claim ever made anywhere in the world until very recently. Such a conclusion is an example of the logical fallacy known as \"false cause,\" or post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this). The reality is that there are numerous other reasons why the remedy might seem to have worked, including the most obvious one, mentioned in the discussion on otitis media: the natural course of most diseases is to get better. Even chronic and terminal diseases tend to wax and wane, and the patient is more likely to seek medical attention during a waxing phase. Other possibilities are the placebo effect, practitioner expectation, willingness of the patient to please the practitioner, misdiagnosis, selective 42 attention, variable follow-up, and more. There are also social and cultural biases that tend to make people believe in the efficacy of some claims but not of others.cl Every member of this Commission, if he or she thinks about it, knows that this must be true. Prior to the late 19th century, there weren't more than a handful of specific remedies that were truly effective, and many of the rest were not only worthless, but also harmful. Yet the greatest medical minds of the prescientific era were absolutely certain of the usefulness of bleeding, purging, scalding, and many other treatments now known to be worthless or worse. Every famous physician of old, \"allopath\" or homeopath, acupuncturist or Ayurvedist, naturopath or chiropractor, astrologer or shaman, enjoyed a reputation as an effective \"healer.\" Their patients were convinced that they could heal, and so were they. Is it possible that all of them were right? Of course not. In fact, none of them was. Or, more precisely, all of them were right in the sense that their patients frequently did, or seemed to, get better, but only for the reasons cited above. To gauge how deplorable that level of efficacy really was, simply take a walk through any pre-20th century graveyard and consider the ages of the deceased. What distinguishes \"conventional\" from \"alternative\" medicine, and the reason that \"scientific\" is a better term for the former, is that it is the only form of medical inquiry that has, as a field, accepted the primacy of reproducible, objective evidence in establishing the reliability of medical information. Scientific physicians understand that matters as crucial as clinical efficacy and safety can't be left to the vicissitudes of personal opinion, clinical experience, patient satisfaction, social trends, conjecture, or the many other forces that compete for their attention. It's not that all of these things aren't important; they are, and well-trained and compassionate physicians know that they all have a role to play in the practice of medicine. But they cannot determine the safety and efficacy of specific interventions. Scientific medicine, furthermore, draws from established biological knowledge in its search for new knowledge. This is the most obvious rebuttal to the common charge that \"conventional\" medicine is not scientific because much of it is not \"proven.\" Here is an example: the modern treatment of acute appendicitis, which had previously been treated by methods remarkably similar to those advocated by modern naturopaths, began as a consequence of a paper published in 1886 by Reginald Fitz, a pathologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He reported over 400 autopsies of patients who had died after a clinical syndrome of abdominal pain, fever, and other signs and symptoms. He established beyond reasonable doubt that the basis for the syndrome was an inflammation of the \"vermiform appendix,\" and suggested that early surgical removal of this tissue, a heroic measure at the time, be attempted. The result was so obviously correct that within a few years a disease that had historically been an important killer of young people was routinely cured.cli Yet no randomized, controlled trial of surgical versus rational nonsurgical treatment (antibiotics) was performed until 1995, more than a hundred years later (it favored surgery).clii The scientific basis for Fitz's lifesaving proposal was considerable even for its time, drawing from anatomy, histology, pathology, bacteriology, and the recent innovations of aseptic surgical technique and general anesthesia, among other fields. Compare this history with the naturopathic view of the disease. The following quotation is from the \"Medical Procedures Lacking Scientific Evidence\" page of the Alliance Legislative Workshop website.cliii Its purpose is to convince legislators and others that naturopathic claims are safer and cheaper than accepted medical treatments: 43 Appendectomy is a costly technology with the standard risks associated with surgery. The relative benefits and risks of treating appendicitis through surgery or other treatment have not been fully evaluated. For example, there is strong evidence suggesting that appendicitis may be treated with substantially fewer appendectomies without increased loss of life. Thus a controlled clinical trial of the nonsurgical or delayed surgical approach to treatment...might be warranted.cliv Here is a comprehensive critique of this claim: a) The costs and risks of surgery versus naturopathic treatment can be likened to the following argument: since commercial jets are associated with known risks and are expensive to operate, it might be better to travel to California by covered wagon. A controlled trial is warranted. b) There is no \"strong evidence suggesting that appendicitis may be treated with substantially fewer appendectomies without increased loss of life.\" No reference is cited, and anyone in a position to make public policy regarding naturopathy should be wary of such a self-serving claim. c) A controlled clinical trial of surgery versus rational (as opposed to naturopathic) nonsurgical therapy has already been performed, as mentioned above. The author appears not to have read the literature of the very field in which he claims expertise. The pretensions of most \"alternative\" practices to scientific underpinnings are little more than pretensions. The reality is that naturopaths and their fellow-travelers still base their convictions on fantasies and the same \"false cause\" fallacy that elevated medieval alchemists like Paracelsus to fame, even though \"his treatment for dropsy included sulphur, which as a microscopic sun drove the dropsy away,\" and another of his \"cures\" consisted of \"blowing dried human excrement into sore eyes.\"clv The protestations of \"alternative medicine\" advocates that evidence-based medicine is just another \"paradigm,\" or that it reigns simply because of political favoritism, may have been justified as recently as the mid-19th century, when homeopathy was still vying with \"allopathy\" and naturopathy was just making its entrance. What changed is that standard medicine, over a gradual period but mainly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, became inexorably linked to science. The result has been nothing short of revolutionary: the public memory of widespread plague and sorrow is rapidly fading. This is, ironically, the main reason that a new, historically na\u00efve generation, widens its eyes at the same hollow promises that the \"healers\" of old made to our short-lived ancestors. Modern medical and biological science, based on objective evidence, has been wonderfully beneficial for mankind. We can't revert to vitalism and mysticism, or \"differing paradigms\" or \"other ways of knowing,\" without jeopardizing all the benefits of more than a century of breathtaking progress. The point is that there really is knowledge. Acute otitis media really is dangerous, and so far we have only one sure way to reduce the danger. An acute asthma attack really does need to be treated with a bronchodilator, and cannot be effectively treated with a hydrogen peroxide bath or crystals. Heavy metal toxicity really is rare; food allergies and chronic yeast infections are not particularly common, and can only be diagnosed by rational means. Sugar in the diet really doesn't have anything to do with ear infections. Childhood immunizations really do, dramatically and safely, prevent terrible diseases. Goldenseal really doesn't act, in any significant clinical way, as an antibiotic. And so on. There aren't, when it comes to safety and efficacy in medicine, \"other ways of knowing.\" So far, the only way 44 humanity has found to understand the objective world is through scientific research, and the knowledge gained through science is cumulative, even if at some level it remains tentative. Epilogue While researching the material for this treatise I corresponded briefly with Ken Spiker, the man who posted the story about Debbie Benson on the Quackwatch website. I wanted to find out more about the naturopath who had prescribed \"pesticide removal tinctures\" for Ms. Benson's breast cancer. Mr. Spiker offered the following, sad reply: Had I been a Portland resident I would have done a more thorough investigation. I don't know how much chance a lawsuit would have had in Oregon, even if a person had documentary evidence such as cancelled checks, medicine bottles, left over herbs etc. If naturopaths are allowed to practice, then who's to say that the standard of care wasn't followed? Another naturopath? Debbie was always a counterculture type of person. We used to go to peyote meetings in the 60's at the Native American Church. She had her baby in a tipi on a commune in New Mexico. There's still a whole counterculture out here, often associated with hobbit communities in Berkeley, Portland and Mendocino (where I live), where flaky alternative medical advice is passed around and there's not a critical thought in a carload. I met a fellow at a party just last week who declared that he had come down with some kind of flu or crud, and bravely asserted, \"I healed myself!\" \"How do you know that God didn't heal you?\" I asked. Evidently he had gone to some sort of alternative healer and he'd been instructed to \"Put his disbelief on a shelf.\" This fellow wasn't an ignorant peasant, but a retired lawyer. This stuff is rampant. If Debbie had been persuaded by her friends to try some herb or incantation, I wouldn't be so angry about it, that's her choice. But she went to a fake healer who was sanctioned by the State of Oregon and was persuaded to shell out a large amount of money for worthless cures. She made her choices and who's to say for sure that even pursuing conventional medicine she would have lived? But I don't like to see exploiters and cheats get away with their crimes. Naturopathy is best understood as a cult. Many individual naturopaths may have good intentions; what they don't have are the clinical skills to distinguish seriously ill patients from others, the knowledge to competently advise their patients, or the curiosity and honesty necessary to detect the humbug of their beliefs or the corruption in their field. They have been sold a bill of goods by the institutions of \"naturopathic medicine,\" and they have been inappropriately encouraged by a few state governments that lacked the wisdom to reject their spurious claims for legitimacy. 45 Summary This treatise has shown that it would be unwise for the Commission to recommend licensure\u2014an endorsement by the state\u2014for naturopaths in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Several clinical examples and one clinical study were offered showing that naturopathy is both potentially and actually injurious when practiced according to the accepted standards of the profession, and that this injury is most likely to be due to the failure of the naturopathic practitioner to recommend appropriate medical treatment. Statistics were cited showing that collaboration with medical doctors is uncommon in naturopathic practice. The discussion included several examples of naturopathic beliefs that pose irrational challenges to proven public health measures, most notably childhood immunizations. These facts provide ample evidence that naturopaths, posing as \"primary care physicians,\" are incapable of self-regulation commensurate with public safety. The question of protecting the public from other, \"less qualified\" naturopaths was demonstrated to be moot. If anything, those \"traditional naturopaths\" are less of a danger, because they don't pretend to be primary care physicians who diagnose and treat illness. Ample evidence was offered showing that naturopathic pretensions to a scientific basis are illusory. Naturopaths prescribe numerous \"natural medicines\" with a standard for safety and efficacy that is unacceptably low, as evidenced by the leading textbook in the field. There is a financial conflict of interest built into naturopathic practice that is formally sanctioned and shared by the very organization that should be providing ethical guidance. There are many absurd \"diagnostic\" practices that are correctly viewed as quackery when performed by a medical doctor but are standard in naturopathic practice. There are claims for several dubious clinical \"syndromes\" that further indict the rationale and ethics of naturopathic practice. Naturopathy is best understood as a pseudoscientific cult. Naturopaths occupy a kind of parallel, shadow universe of \"health care,\" which is filled with paranoid notions of ubiquitous toxins, food allergies, vaccinations, and other perceived dangers of everyday life. Naturopaths offer such entities as the \"underlying cause\" of every disease, both real and imagined. In response they provide a smorgasbord of treatments that range from the mundane (e.g., dietary and lifestyle advice) to the whimsical and anachronistic (e.g., \"natural remedies,\" homeopathy, and enemas), which in no case can replace appropriate medical treatments for the truly ill. This phenomenon was also noted to exist in the popular culture and to be shared by some maverick MD's and other \"alternative\" practitioners, but these facts argue against governmental endorsement, not in favor of it. 46 The training of medical doctors was briefly discussed and contrasted with that of naturopaths. It is clear that the duration and setting of naturopathic clinical training, even overlooking its content, is inadequate to the task of producing competent primary care physicians. To reiterate a statement made earlier in this discussion, licensing offers regulation and public protection only for occupations that have valid, ethical bases, to which licensees must adhere, to guarantee public protection. For an occupation with little semblance of basic validity, licensure legitimizes an otherwise illegitimate and dangerous activity. Conclusion In 1968, the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare was asked to consider Medicare reimbursement for naturopaths. A thorough investigation was done, and the decision was unfavorable. The HEW report concluded: Naturopathic theory and practice are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.clvi There is no evidence that the field has changed significantly since then. With knowledge of the information presented here, it would be irresponsible and unconscionable for the Commission to recommend licensure for naturopaths in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Wisdom dictates that the best course is to deny official endorsement of naturopathy and let it remain the relatively insignificant, fringe practice that it has always been. With regard to those naturopaths who portray themselves as \"primary care physicians,\" it is the position of the Massachusetts Medical Society that such posing should be viewed as the illegitimate practice of medicine and prohibited by law. i http://www.bastyr.edu/bookstore/tnm.asp ii Butler K.
