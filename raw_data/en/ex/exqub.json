It can be life-threatening and requires urgent treatment in hospital. Anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk. Symptoms of encephalitis Encephalitis sometimes starts off with [flu-like symptoms](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/f/article/flu,seasonal/#Symptoms), such as a high temperature and [headache](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/h/article/headache/). More serious symptoms develop over hours, days or weeks, including: - confusion or disorientation - seizures (fits) - changes in personality and behaviour - difficulty speaking - weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body - loss of consciousness Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has these more serious symptoms. Causes of encephalitis It's not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by: - viral infections - very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by the common viruses that causes [cold sores](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/coldsore/) (herpes simplex) or [chickenpox](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/chickenpox/) (herpes varicella) spreading to the brain - a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against infection) - sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamed - bacterial or fungal infections - these are much rarer causes of encephalitis than viral infections Some types of encephalitis are spread by mosquitoes (such as [Japanese encephalitis](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/j/article/japaneseencephalitis/)), ticks (such as [tick-borne encephalitis](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/t/article/tickborneencephalitis/)) and mammals (such as [rabies](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/r/article/rabies/)). You can't catch encephalitis from someone else. Treatments for encephalitis Encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include: - antiviral medication - [steroid injections](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/corticosteroid(drugs)/) - treatments to help control the immune system - [antibiotics](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/antibiotics/) or [antifungal medication](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/antifungaldrugs/) - painkillers to reduce discomfort or a fever - medication to control seizures or fits - support with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator) How long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months. Recovering from encephalitis Some people will eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process. Many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems due to damage to their brain. Common complications include: - [memory loss](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/m/article/memoryloss(amnesia)/) - frequent seizures - personality and behavioural changes - problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving - persistent tiredness These problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends. But help and support is available. Preventing encephalitis It's not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations. These include the: Speak to your GP if you're not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you're planning to travel abroad and don't know if you need "}
