General Conditions of Coverage, Exclusions, and Limitations The provisions in this section describe general conditions of coverage and important exclusions and limitations that apply generally to all types of servi ces or supplies . Conditions of Coverage Medically Necessary A key general condition in order for you to receive benefits is that the service, sup ply, device, or drug must be medically necessary. Even a service, supply, device, or drug listed as otherwise covered in Details - Covered and Not Covered may be excluded if it is not medically necessary in the circumstances. Wellmark determines whether a service, supply, device, or drug is medically necessary. Wellmark's medically necessary analysis and determinations apply to any service, supply, device, or drug including, but not limited to, medical, mental health, and chemical dependency treatment, as appropriate. Even though a provider may recommend a service or supply, it may not be medically necessary. A medically necessary health care service is one that a provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, provides to a patient for the purpose of preven ting, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms, and satisfies all of the following criteria: Provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. Generally accepted standards of medical practi ce are based on: Nationally recognized utilization management standards as utilized by Wellmark; or Wellmark's published Medical and Drug Policies as determined applicable by Wellmark; or Credible scientific evidence published in peer -reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community; or Physician Specialty Society recommendations and the views of physicians practicing in the relevant clinical area. Clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and durat ion, and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease, Not provided primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other health care provider, and Not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at lea st as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the illness, injury or disease. An alternative service, supply, device, or drug may meet the criteria of medical necessity for a specific condition. If alternatives are substantially equal in clinical effectiveness and use similar therapeutic agents or regimens, we reserve the right to approve the least costly alternative. If you receive services that are not medically necessary, you are responsible for the cost if: You receive the services from an Out -of- Network Provider; or You receive the services from a PPO or Participating provider in the Wellmark service area and: The provider informs you in writing before rendering the services that Wellmark determined the services to be not medically necessary; and The provider gives you a written estimate of the cost for such services General Conditions of Coverage, Exclusions, and Limitations MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 44 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GC_ 0122 and you agree in writing, before receiving the services, to assume the payment responsibility. If you do not receive such a written notice, and do not agree in writing to assume the payment responsibility for services that Wellmark determined are not medically necessary, the PPO or Participating provider is responsible for these amounts. You are als o responsible for the cost if you receive services from a provider outside of the Wellmark service area that Wellmark determines to be not medically necessary. This is true even if the provider does not give you any written notice before the services are rendered. Member Eligibility Another general condition of coverage is that the person who r eceives services must meet requirements for member eligibility. See Coverage Eligibility and Effective Date , page 71. General Exclusions Even if a service, supply, device, or drug is listed as otherwise covered in Details - Covered and Not Covered , it is not eligible for benefits if any of the following general exclusions apply. Injuries Sustained Due to a Felony or Riot You are not covered for injuries sustained while participating in a felony or riot or while incarcerated because of a felony or riot. Investigational or Experimental You are not covered for a service, supply, device, biological product, or drug that is investigational or experimental. You are also not covered for any care or treatments related to the use of a service, supply, device, biological product, or drug that is invest igational or experimental. A treatment is considered investigational or experimental when it has progressed to limited human application but has not achieved recognition as being proven effective in clinical medicine. Our analysis of whether a service, sup ply, device, biological product, or drug is considered investigational or experimental is applied to medical, surgical, mental health, and chemical dependency treatment services, as applicable. To determine investigational or experimental status, we may re fer to the technical criteria established by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, including whether a service, supply, device, biological product, or drug meets these criteria: It has final approval from the appropriate governmental regulatory bodies. The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning its effect on health outcomes. It improves the net health outcome. It is as beneficial as any established alternatives. The health improvement is attainable outside the investigational setting. These criteria are considered by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Medical Advisory Panel for consideration by all Blue Cross and Blue Shield member organizations. While we may rely on these criteria, the final decision remains at the discretion of ou r Medical Director, whose decision is not controlled by policies or decisions of other Blue Cross and Blue Shield member organizations. You may access our medical policies, with supporting information and selected medical references for a specific service, supply, device, biological product, or drug through our website, Wellmark.com . If you receive services that are investigational or experimental, you are responsible for the cost if: You receive the services from an Out -of- Network Provider; or You receive the services from a PPO or Participating provider in the Wellmark service area and: General Conditions of Coverage, Exclusion s, and Limitations Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GC_ 0122 45 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ The provider informs you in writing before rendering the services that Wellmark determined the services to be investigational or experimental; and The provider gives you a written estimate of the cost for such services and you agree in writing, before receiving the services, to assume the payment responsibility. If you do not receive such a written notice, and do not agree in writing to assume the payment responsibility f or services that Wellmark determined to be investigational or experimental, the PPO or Participating provider is responsible for these amounts. You are also responsible for the cost if you receive services from a provider outside of the Wellmark service ar ea that Wellmark determines to be investigational or experimental. This is true even if the provider does not give you any written notice before the services are rendered. See Also: Clinical Trials , page 22.

General Conditions of Coverage, Exclusions, and Limitations MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 46 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GC_ 0122 The exclusion for services or supp lies related to work related illness or injury does not exclude coverage for such illness or injury if you are exempt from coverage under South Dakota's workers' compensation statutes, unless you or your employer has elected or obtained workers' compensati on coverage as provided in South Dakota Code Sections 62 -3-17 or 58 - 20-3.

It relies on a preferred provider organization (PPO) network, which consists of providers that participate directly with the Wellmark Blue PPO network and providers that participate with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield preferred provider organizations (PPOs). These PP O Providers offer services to members of contracting medical benefits plans at a reduced cost, which usually results in the least expense for you. Non -PPO providers are either Participating or Out -of-Network. If you are unable to utilize a PPO Provider, it is usually to your advantage to visit what we call a Participating Provider. Participating Providers participate with a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in another state or service area, but not with a PPO. Other providers are con sidered Out -of- Network, and you will usually pay the most for services you receive from them. See What You Pay, page 3 and Factors Affecting W hat You Pay, page 63. To determine if a provider participates with this medical benefits plan, ask your provider, refer to our online provider directory at Wellmark.com , or call the Customer Service number on your ID card. Our provider directory is also available upon request by calling the Customer Service number on your ID card. Providers are independent cont ractors and are not agents or employees of Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Dakota. For types of providers that may be covered under your medical benefits, see Hospitals and Facilities , page 27 and Physicians and Practitioners , page 32. Please note: Even if a specific provider type is not listed as a recognized provider type, Wellmark does not discriminate against a licensed health care provider acting within the scope of his or her state license or certification with respect to coverage under this plan. Please note: Even though a facility may be PPO or Participating, particular providers within the facility may not be PPO or Participating providers. Examples include Out-of-Network physicians on the staff of a PPO or Participating hospital, home medical equipment suppliers, and other independent providers. Therefore, when you are referred by a PPO or Participating provider to another provider, or when you are admitted in to a facility, always ask if the providers contract with a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. Always carry your ID card and present it when you receive services. Information on it, especially the ID number, is required to process your clai ms correctly. Pharmacies that contract with our pharmacy benefits manager are considered Participating Providers. Pharmacies that do not contract with our pharmacy benefits manager are considered Out -of-Network Providers. To determine if a pharmacy contrac ts with our pharmacy benefits manager, ask the pharmacist, consult the directory of participating pharmacies on our website at Wellmark.com , or call the Customer Service number on your ID card.

See Services Outside the Wellmark Service Area later in this section. Services Outside the Wellmark Service Area BlueCard Program This program ensures that members of any Blue Plan have acc ess to the advantages of PPO Providers throughout the United States. Participating Providers have a contractual agreement with the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in their home state (\"Host Blue\"). The Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and g enerally handling all interactions with its Participating Providers. The BlueCard Program is one of the advantages of your coverage with Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Dakota. It provides conveniences and benefits outside the Wellmark service area similar to those you would have within our service area when you obtain covered medical services from a PPO Provider. Always carry your ID card (or BlueCard ) and present it to your provider when you receive care. Information on it, es pecially the ID number, is required to process your claims correctly. PPO Providers may not be available in some states. In this case, when you receive covered services from a non -PPO provider (i.e., a Participating or Out -of-Network provider), you will re ceive many of the same advantages as when you receive covered services from a PPO Provider. However, because we do not have contracts with Out - of-Network Providers and they may not accept our payment arrangements, you are responsible for any difference bet ween the amount charged and our amount paid for a covered service. An exception to this is when the No Surprises Act applies to your items or services. In that case, the amount you pay will be determined in accordance with the Act. See Payment Details , pag e 7. Additionally, you cannot be billed for the difference between the amount charged and the total amount paid by us. The only exceptio n to this would be if an eligible Out - of-Network Provider performing services in a participating facility gives you proper notice in plain language that you will be receiving services from an Out -of-Network Provider and you consent to be balance - billed and to have the amount that you pay determined without reference to the No Surprises Act . Certain providers are not permitted to provide notice and request consent for this purpose. These include items and services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiolog y, pathology, radiology, and neonatology, whether provided by a physician or nonphysician practitioner; items and services provided by assistant surgeons, hospitalists, and intensivists; diagnostic services, including radiology and laboratory services; and items and services provided by a nonparticipating provider, only if there is no Participating Choosing a Provider Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CP_ 0122 51 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ Provider who can furnish such item or service at such facility. PPO Providers contract with the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield preferred provider organization (PP O) in their home state. When you receive covered services from PPO or Participating providers outside the Wellmark service area, all of the following statements are true: Claims are filed for you. These providers agree to accept payment arrangements or neg otiated prices of the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan with which the provider contracts. These payment arrangements may result in savings. The group health plan payment is sent directly to the providers. Wellmark requires claims to be filed within 180 d ays following the date of service (or 180 days from date of discharge for inpatient claims). However, if the PPO or Participating provider 's contract with the Host Blue has a requirement that a claim be filed in a timeframe exceeding 180 days following the date of service or date of discharge for inpatient claims, Wellmark will process the claim according to the Host Blue's contractual filing requirement. If you receive services from an Out -of-Network Provider, the claim has to be filed within 180 days following the date of service or date of discharge for inpatient claims. Typically, when you receive covered services from PPO or Participating providers outside the Wellmark service area, you are responsible for notification requirements. See Notification Req uirements and Care Coordination , page 57. However, if you are admitted to a BlueCard facility outside the Wellmark service area, any PPO or Participating provider should handle notification requirements for you. We have a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter -Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever you access healthcare services outside the Wellmark service area, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Arrangements. The Inter -Plan Arrangements are described in the following paragraphs. When you receive care outside of our service area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of providers. Most providers (\"Participating Providers\") contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some providers (\"Out -of-Network Providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. In the following paragraphs we explain how we pay bot h kinds of providers. Inter -Plan Arrangements Eligibility - Claim Types All claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter -Plan Arrangements, as described previously, except for all dental care benefits (except when paid as medical benefits), and t hose prescription drug benefits or vision care benefits that may be administered by a third party contracted by us to provide the specific service or services. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you receive covered services within the geog raphic area served by a Host Blue, we will remain responsible for doing what we agreed to in the contract. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its Participating Providers. When you receive covered services outside Wellmark's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for covered services; or Choosing a Provider MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 52 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CP_ 0122 The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to us. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings f or similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over - or underestimation of modifications of past pricing of claims, as noted previously. However, such adjustments will not affect the price we have used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax, or other fee that applies to insured accounts. If applicable, we will include any such surcharge, tax, or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. Out-of-Network Providers Out side the Wellmark Service Area Your Liability Calculation. When covered services are provided outside of our service area by Out -of-Network Providers, the amount you pay for such services will normally be based on either the Host Blue's Out-of-Network Prov ider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the Out -of- Network Provider bills and the payment we will make for the covered services as set forth in this summary plan description . An exception to this is when the No Surprises Act applies to your items or services. In that case, the amount you pay will be determined in accordance with the Act. See Payment Details , page 7. Additionally, you cannot be billed for the difference between the amount charged and the total amount paid by us. The only exception to this would be i f an eligible Out - of-Network Provider performing services in a participating facility gives you proper notice in plain language that you will be receiving services from an Out -of-Network Provider and you consent to be balance - billed and to have the amount that you pay determined without reference to the No Surprises Act . Certain providers are not permitted to provide notice and request consent for this purpose. These include items and services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, radiol ogy, and neonatology, whether provided by a physician or nonphysician practitioner; items and services provided by assistant surgeons, hospitalists, and intensivists; diagnostic services, including radiology and laboratory services; and items and services provided by a nonparticipating provider, only if there is no Participating Provider who can furnish such item or service at such facility. In certain situations, we may use other payment methods, such as billed charges for covered services, the payment we would make if the healthcare services had been obtained within our service area, or a special negotiated payment to determine the amount we will pay for services provided by Out-of-Network Providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the differenc e between the amount that the Out - of-Network Provider bills and the payment we will make for the covered services as set forth in this summary plan description . Care in a Foreign Country For covered services you receive in a count ry other than the United States, payment level assumes the provider category is Out -of-Network except for Choosing a Provider Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CP_ 0122 53 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ services received from providers that participate with Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Program If you are outs ide the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (hereinafter \"BlueCard service area\"), you may be able to take advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program when accessing covered services. The Blue Cross B lue Shield Global Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient, and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the BlueCard service area, you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If you need medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the BlueCard service area, you should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center at 800 -810- BLUE (2583) or call collect at 804 -673- 1177 , 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An assistance coordinator, working with a medical professional, can arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. Inpatient Services. In most cases, if you contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core S ervice Center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to pay for covered inpatient services, except for your deductibles, etc. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center to begin clai ms processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for covered services. You must contact us to obtain precertification for non - emergency inpatient services. Outpatient Services. Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard service area will typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered services. See Claims, page 87. Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim When you pay for covered services outside the BlueCard service area, yo u must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, you should complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core International claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following the instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of your claim. The claim form is available from us, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Glo bal Core Service Center, or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com . If you need assistance with your claim submission, you should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center at 800 -810- BLUE (2583) or call collect at 804 -673- 1177 , 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Whenever possible, before receiving servic es outside the Wellmark service area, you should ask the provider if he or she participates with a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that state. To locate PPO Providers in any state, call 800 -810- BLUE , or visit www.bcb s.com . South Dakota and Iowa comprise the Wellmark service area. Laboratory services. You may have laboratory specimens or samples collected by a PPO Provider and those laboratory specimens may be sent to another laborat ory services provider for processing or testing. If that laboratory services provider does not have a contractual Choosing a Provider MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 54 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CP_ 0122 relationship with the Blue Plan where the specimen was drawn,* that provider will be considered an Out -of-Network Provider and you will be res ponsible for any applicable Out-of-Network Provider payment obligations and you may also be responsible for any difference between the amount charged and our amount paid for the covered service. *Where the specimen is drawn will be determined by which sta te the referring provider is located. Home/durable medical equipment. If you purchase or rent home/durable medical equipment from a provider that does not have a contractual relationship with the Blue Plan where you purchased or rented the equipment, that provider will be considered an Out -of-Network Provider and you will be responsible for any applicable Out-of-Network Provider payment obligations and you may also be responsible for any difference between the amount charged and our amount paid for the cove red service. If you purchase or rent home/durable medical equipment and have that equipment shipped to a service area of a Blue Plan that does not have a contractual relationship with the home/durable medical equipment provider, that provider will be consi dered Out -of-Network and you will be responsible for any applicable Out -of- Network Provider payment obligations and you may also be responsible for any difference between the amount charged and our amount paid for the covered service. This includes situati ons where you purchase or rent home/durable medical equipment and have the equipment shipped to you in Wellmark's service area, when Wellmark does not have a contractual relationship with the home/durable medical equipment provider. Prosthetic devices. If you purchase prosthetic devices from a provider that does not have a contractual relationship with the Blue Plan where you purchased the prosthetic devices, that provider will be considered an Out -of-Network Provider and you will be responsible for any app licable Out-of-Network Provider payment obligations and you may also be responsible for any difference between the amount charged and our amount paid for the covered service. If you purchase prosthetic devices and have that equipment shipped to a service a rea of a Blue Plan that does not have a contractual relationship with the provider, that provider will be considered Out -of-Network and you will be responsible for any applicable Out - of-Network Provider payment obligations and you may also be responsible f or any difference between the amount charged and our amount paid for the covered service.

Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 63 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 7. Factors Affecting Wha t You Pay How much you pay for covered services is affected by many different factors discussed in this section. Medical Benefit Year A benefit year is a period of 12 consecutive months beginning on July 1 or beginning on the day your coverage goes into effect. The benefit year starts over each July 1 . Your benefit year continues even if your employer or group spons or changes Wellmark group health plan benefits during the year or you change to a different plan offering mid - benefit year from your same employer or group sponsor. Certain coverage changes result in your Wellmark identification number changing. In some c ases, a new benefit year will start under the new ID number for the rest of the benefit year. In this case, the benefit year would be less than a full 12 months. In other cases (e.g., adding your spouse to your coverage) the benefit year would continue and not start over. If you are an inpatient in a covered facility on the date of your annual benefit year renewal, your benefit limitations and payment obligations , including your out -of- pocket maximum, for facility services will renew and will be based on the benefit limitations and payment obligation amounts in effect on the date you were admitted. However, your payment obligations , including your out -of-pocket maximum, for practitioner services will be based on the payment obligation amounts in effect on the day you re ceive services. The benefit year is important for calculating: Out-of-pocket maximum. Benefits maximum. Provider Network Under the medical benefits of this plan, your network of providers consists of PPO and Participating providers . All other providers are Out -of-Network Providers. PPO Providers Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans have contracting relationships with PPO Providers. When you receive services from PPO Providers: The PPO payment obligation amounts may be waived or may be less than the Participating and Out -of-Network amounts for certain covered services. See Waived Payment Obligations , page 9. These p roviders agree to accept Wellmark's payment arrangements, or payment arrangements or negotiated prices of the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan with which the provider contracts. These payment arrangements may result in savings. The health plan payment is sent directly to the provider. Participating Providers Wellmark and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans have contracting relationships with Participating Providers. Pharmacies that contract with our pharmacy benefits manage r are considered Participating Providers. To determine if a pharmacy contracts with our pharmacy benefits manager, ask the pharmacist, consult the directory of participating pharmacies on our website at Wellmark.com , or call the Customer Service number on your ID card. When you receive services from Participating Providers: Factors Affecting What You Pay MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 64 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 The Participating payment obligation amounts may be waived or may be less than the Out -of-Network amounts for certain covered services. See Waived Payment Obligations , page 9. These providers agree to accept Wellmark's payment arrangements, or payment arrangements or negotiated prices of the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan w ith which the provider contracts. These payment arrangements may result in savings. The health plan payment is sent directly to the provider. Out-of-Network Providers Wellmark and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans do not have contracting relationships with Out -of-Network Providers, and they may not accept our payment arrangements. Pharmacies other than those participating in the specialty pharmacy program that do not contract with our pharmacy benefits manager are conside red Out -of-Network Providers. Therefore, when you receive services from Out-of-Network Providers: The following is true unless the No Surprises Act applies: You are responsible for any difference between the amount charged and our payment for a covered ser vice. In the case of services received outside Iowa or South Dakota, our maximum payment for services by an Out -of-Network Provider will generally be based on either the Host Blue's Out -of-Network Provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In certain situations, we may use other payment bases, such as the amount charged for a covered service, the payment we would make if the services had been obtained within Iowa or South Dakota, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter -Plan Programs policies, to determine the amount we will pay for services you receive from Out -of-Network Providers. See Services Outside the Wellmark Service Area, page 50. However, when you receive services in an in -network facility and are provided covered services by an Out -of-Network ancillary provider, in -network cost -share will be applied and accumulate toward the out - of-pocket maximum. For this purpose, ancillary providers include pathologists, emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, or hospitalists. Because we do not have contracts with Out -of-Network Providers and they may not accept our payment arrang ements, you will still be responsible for any difference between the billed charge and our settlement amount for the services from the Out -of- Network ancillary provider unless the No Surprises Act applies. Wellmark does not make claim payments directly to these providers, and you are responsible for ensuring that your provider is paid in full, unless the No Surprises Act applies, in which case Wellmark will pay the Out -of- Network Provider directly. When the No Surprises Act applies to your items or services , you cannot be billed for the difference between the amount charged and the total amount paid by us. The only exception to this would be if an eligible Out -of-Network Provider performing services in a participating facility gives you proper notice in plai n language that you will be receiving services from an Out -of- Network Provider and you consent to be balance -billed and to have the amount that you pay determined without reference to the No Surprises Act . Certain providers are not permitted to provide not ice and request consent for this purpose. These include items and services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, and neonatology, whether provided by a physician or nonphysician practitioner; items and services provided by as sistant surgeons, hospitalists, and intensivists; Factors Affecting What You Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 65 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ diagnostic services, including radiology and laboratory services; and items and services provided by a nonparticipating provider, only if there is no Participating Provider who can furnish such item or serv ice at such facility. Amount Charged and Maximum Allowable Fee Amount Charged The amount charged is the amount a provider charges for a service or supply, regardless of whether the services or supplies are covered under your medical benefits. Maximum Allowable Fee The maximum allowable fee is the amount, established by Wellmark , using various methodologies for covered services and supplies. Wellmark's amount paid is based on the lesser of the amount charged for a covered service or supply or the maximum allowable fee. Payment Arrangements Payment Arrangement Savings Wellmark has contracting relationships with PPO Providers. We use different methods to determine payment arrangements, including negotiated fees. These payment arrangements usually result in savings. The savings from payment arrangements and other important amounts will appear on your Explanation of Benefits stat ement as follows: Network Savings , which reflects the amount you save on a claim by receiving services from a Participating or PPO provider . For the majority of services, the savings reflects the actual amount you save on a claim. However, depending on many factors, the amount we pay a provider could be different from the covered charge. Regardless of the amount we pay a Participating or PPO provider, your payment responsibility will always be based on the lesser of the covered charg e or the maximum allowable fee. Amount Not Covered , which reflects the portion of provider charges not covered under your health benefits and for which you may be responsible. This amount may include services or supplies not covered; amounts in excess of a benefit maximum, benefit year maximum, or lifetime benefits maximum; denials for failure to follow a required precertification ; and the difference between the amount charged and the maximum allowable fee for services from an Out -of-Network Provider. For general exclusions and examples of benefit limitations, see General Conditions of Coverage, Exclusions, and Limitations , page 43. Amount Paid by Health Plan , which reflects our payment responsibility to a provider or to you. We determine this amount by subtracting the following amounts (if applicab le) from the amount charged: Copayment . Amounts representing any general exclusions and conditions. Network savings. Payment Method for Services When you receive a covered service or services that result in multiple claims, we will calculate your payment obligations based on the order in which we process the claims. Provider Payment Arrangements Provider payment arrangements are calculated using industry methods including, but not limited to, fee schedules, per diems, percentage of charge, capitation, or episodes of care. Some provider payment arrangements may include an amount payable to the provider based on the provider's performance. Performance -based amounts that are not distributed are not allocated to your specific group or to your specific claims an d are not considered when determining any amounts you may owe. We Factors Affecting What You Pay MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 66 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 reserve the right to change the methodology we use to calculate payment arrangements based on industry practice or business need. PPO and Participating providers agree to accept our payment arrangements as full settlement for providing covered services, except to the extent of any amounts you may owe. Specialty Drug Manufacturer Discount Card Program Certain specialty medications may qualify for manufacturer discount card programs which could lower your out -of-pocket costs for those products. You may not receive credit toward your maximum out -of-pocket for any copayment amounts that are applied to a manufacturer coupon or rebate. This Specialty Drug Manufacturer Discount Card Pro gram is offered as part of your plan's preferred specialty pharmacy network with CVS Caremark's affiliate CVS Specialty.

Pharmacy Benefits Manager Fees and Drug Company Rebates Wellmark contracts with a pharmacy benefits manager to provide pharmacy benefits management services to its accounts, such as your group. Your group is to pay a monthly fee for such services. Drug manufacturers offer rebates to pharmacy benefits managers. After your group has had Wellmark prescription drug coverage for at least nine months, the pharmacy benefits manager contracting with Wellmark will c alculate, on a quarterly basis, your group's use of drugs for which rebates have been paid. Wellmark receives these rebates. Your group will be credited with rebate amounts forwarded to us by the pharmacy benefits manager unless your group's arrangement wi th us requires us to reduce such rebated amounts by the amount of any fees we paid to the pharmacy benefits manager for the services rendered to your group. We will not distribute these rebate amounts to you, and rebates will not be considered when determi ning your payment obligations. Prescription Drugs Benefit Year A benefit year is a period of 12 consecutive months beginning on July 1 or beginn ing on the day your coverage goes into effect. The benefit year starts over each July 1 . Your benefit year continues even if your employer or group sponsor changes Wellmark group health plan benefits during the year or you change to a different plan offeri ng mid - benefit year from your same employer or group sponsor. Certain coverage changes result in your Wellmark identification number changing. In some cases, a new benefit year will start under the new ID number for the rest of the benefit year. In this c ase, the benefit year would be less than a full 12 months. In other cases (e.g., adding your spouse to your coverage) the benefit year would continue and not start over. The benefit year is important for calculating: Out-of-pocket maximum. Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List Often there is more than one medication available to treat the same medical condition. The Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List (\"Drug List\") contains drugs and pharmacy durable medical equipment devices physicians recognize as medically effective for a w ide range of health conditions. The Drug List is maintained with the assistance of practicing physicians, Factors Affecting What You Pay Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 67 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ pharmacists, and Wellmark's pharmacy department. To determine if a drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device is covered, you or your physicia n must consult the Drug List. If a drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device is not on the Drug List, it is not covered. If you need help determining if a particular drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device is on the Drug List, ask your ph ysician or pharmacist, visit our website, Wellmark.com , or call the Customer Service number on your ID card. Although only drugs and pharmacy durable medical equipment devices listed on the Drug List are covered, physicians are not limited to prescribing o nly the drugs on the list. Physicians may prescribe any medication, but only medications on the Drug List are covered. Please note: A medication or pharmacy durable medical equipment device on the Drug List will not be covered if the drug or pharmacy durab le medical equipment device is specifically excluded under your Blue Rx Value Plus prescription drug benefits, or other limitations apply. If a drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device is not on the Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List and you believe it should be covered, refer to Exception Requests for Non -Formulary Prescription Drugs, page 89. The Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List is subject to change. Tiers The Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List also identifies which tier a drug is on: Tier 1. Most generic drugs and some brand - name drugs that have no medically appropriate generic equivalent. Tier 1 drugs have the lowest payment obligation. Tier 2. Drugs appear on this tier because they either have no medically appropriate generic equivalent or are considered less cost-effective than Tier 1 drugs. Tier 2 drugs have a higher payment obligation than Tier 1 drugs. Tier 3. Drugs appear on this tier because they are less cost -effective than Tier 1 or Tier 2 drugs. Tier 3 drugs have the highest payment obligation. Pharmacy DME.

Preferred vs. Non -Preferred Specialty Drugs The Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List also identifies whic h tier a specialty drug is on: Preferred Specialty Drugs have been proven to be safe, effective, and favorably priced compared to non -preferred alternatives that treat the same condition. Drugs may also be classified as preferred because no alternative dru g exists. Non -Preferred Specialty Drugs are drugs without sufficiently documented clinical evidence that they provide a significant benefit over available preferred alternatives. The amount you pay for specialty drugs covered under your Wellmark Blue Rx Va lue Plus prescription drug benefits depends on whether a specialty drug is categorized as preferred or non -preferred. To determine whether a specialty drug is preferred or non-preferred, consult the Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List at Wellmark.com . Also see Specialty Drugs , page 33. Generic and Brand Name Drugs Generic Drug Generic drug refers to an FDA -approved \"A\"-rated generic drug. This is a drug with active therapeutic ingredients chemically identical to its brand name drug counterpart. Factors Affecting What You Pay MCM0 0J1M RCM008EJ 68 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 Brand Name Drug Brand name drug is a prescription drug patented by the original manufacturer. Usually, after the patent expires, other manufacturers may make FDA -approved generic copies. Sometimes, a patent holder of a brand name drug grants a license to another manufacturer to produce the d rug under a generic name, though it remains subject to patent protection and has a nearly identical price. In these cases, Wellmark's pharmacy benefits manager may treat the licensed product as a brand name drug, rather than generic, and will calculate you r payment obligation accordingly. What You Pay In most cases, when you purchase a brand name drug that has an FDA -approved \"A\" - rated medically appropriate generic equivalent, Wellmark will pay only what it would have paid for the medically appropriate equi valent generic drug. You will be responsible for your payment obligation for the medically appropriate equivalent generic drug and any remaining cost difference up to the maximum allowed fee for the brand name drug. Biologics and Biosimilars Biologics are specialty drugs made from natural and living sources and are usually more complex than other drugs. They are often more complicated to purify, process, and manufacture. Biosimilar Drug A biosimilar is a biologic drug. It is highly similar to a biologic drug already approved by the FDA - the original biologic (also called the reference product). Biosimilars also have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product. This means you can expect the same safety and effectiveness fro m the biosimilar over the course of treatment as you would the reference product. Biosimilars are made from the same types of natural and living sources and are just as safe and effective as their reference products. Interchangeable Biosimilar Drug Interch angeable biosimilar drug refers to an FDA -approved biosimilar drug that meets additional requirements based on further evaluation and testing. This drug is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product. Reference Biologic Drug A ref erence product is the single brand biologic drug, already approved by the FDA, against which a proposed biosimilar drug is compared to and evaluated against to ensure that the product is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences. What You Pay To determine what you would pay for a biologic or biosimilar specialty drug, consult the Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List at Wellmark.com. In most cases, when you purchase a reference biologic drug that has an FDA -approved interchangeable biosimi lar, Wellmark will pay only what it would have paid for the medically appropriate equivalent interchangeable biosimilar drug. You will be responsible for your payment obligation for the medically appropriate equivalent interchangeable biosimilar drug and a ny remaining cost difference up to the maximum allowed fee for the brand name reference biologic drug. Quantity Limitations Most prescription drugs are limited to a maximum qua ntity you may receive in a single prescription. Federal regulations limit the quantity that may be dispensed for certain medications. If your prescription is so regulated, it may not be available in the amount prescribed by your physician. In addition, coverage for certain drugs or pharmacy durable medical equipment devices is limited to specific quantities per month, benefit year, or lifetime. Amounts in Factors Affecting What You Pay Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/YP_ 0122 69 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ excess of quantity limitations are not covered. For a list of drugs and pharmacy durabl e medical equipment devices with quantity limits, check with your pharmacist or physician or consult the Wellmark Blue Rx Value Plus Drug List at Wellmark.com , or call the Customer Service number on your ID card. Amount Charged and Maximum Allowable Fee Amount Charged The retail price charged by a pharmacy for a covered prescription drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device. Maximum Allowable Fee The amount, established by Wellmark using various m ethodologies and data (such as the average wholesale price), payable for covered drugs and pharmacy durable medical equipment devices. The maximum allowable fee may be less than the amount charged for the drug or pharmacy durable medical equipment device. Participating vs. Nonparticipating Pharmacies If you purchase a covered prescription drug at a nonparticipating pharmacy, you are responsible for the amount charged for the drug at the t ime you fill your prescription, and then you must file a claim. Once you submit a claim, you will be reimbursed up to the maximum allowable fee of the drug, less your copayment. The maximum allowable fee may be less than the am ount you paid. In other words, you are responsible for any difference in cost between what the pharmacy charges you for the drug and our reimbursement amount. Your payment obligation for the purchase of a covered prescription drug at a participating pharma cy is the lesser of your copayment, the maximum allowable fee, or the amount charged for the drug. To determine if a pharmacy is participating, ask the pharmacist, consult the directory of participating pharmacies on our website at Wellmark.com , or call th e Customer Service number on your ID card. Our directory also is available upon request by calling the Customer Service number on your ID card.

Any employee taking a leave under the FMLA shall be entitled to continue the employee's benefits during the duration of the leave. The employer must continue the benefits at the level and under the conditions of coverage that would have been provided if the employee had remained employed. Please note: The employee is still responsible for paying their share of the premium if applicable. If the employe e for any reason fails to return from the leave, the employer may recover from the employee that premium or portion of the premium that the employer paid, provided the employee fails to return to work for any reason other than the reoccurrence of the serio us health condition or circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 76 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 If you do not provide timely notification of a coverage enrollment event, the affected person may not enroll until an annual group enrollment period . The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) Your group health plan will fully comply with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). If any part of the plan conflicts with USERRA, the conflicting provision will not apply. All other benefits and exclusions of the group health plan will rema in effective to the extent there is no conflict with USERRA. USERRA provides for, among other employment rights and benefits, continuation of health care coverage to a covered employee and the employee's covered dependents during a period of the employee's active service or training with any of the uniformed services. The plan provides that a covered employee may elect to continue coverages in effect at the time the employee is called to active service. The maximum period of coverage for an employee and the covered employee's dependents under such an election shall be the lesser of: The 24 -month period beginning on the date on which the covered employee's absence begins; or The period beginning on the date on which the covered employee's absence begins and e nding on the day after the date on which the covered employee fails to apply for or return to a position of employment as follows: For service of less than 31 days, no later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day following the completion of the period of service and the expiration of eight hours after a period allowing for the safe transportation from the place of service to the covered employee's residence or as soon as reasonably possible after such eight hour period; For service of more than 30 days but less than 181 days, no later than 14 days after the completion of the period of service or as soon as reasonably possible after such period; For service of more than 180 days, no later than 90 d ays after the completion of the period of service; or For a covered employee who is hospitalized or convalescing from an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the performance of service in the uniformed services, at the end of the period that is necessary for the covered employee to recover from the illness or injury. The period of recovery may not exceed two (2) years. A covered employee who elects to continue health plan coverage under the plan during a period of active service in the uniform ed services may be required to pay no more than 102% of the full premium under the plan associated with the coverage for the employer's other employees. This is true except in the case of a covered employee who performs service in the uniformed services fo r less than 31 days. When this is the case, the covered employee may not be required to pay more than the employee's share, if any, for the coverage. Continuation coverage cannot be discontinued merely because activated military personnel receive health co verage as active duty members of the uniformed services and their family members are eligible to receive coverage under the TRICARE program (formerly CHAMPUS). When a covered employee's coverage under a health plan was terminated by reason of service in th e uniformed services, the pre - existing condition exclusion and waiting Coverage Changes and Termination Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 77 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ period may not be imposed in connection with the reinstatement of the coverage upon reemployment under USERRA. This applies to a covered employee who is reemployed and any dependent who se coverage is reinstated. The waiver of the pre -existing condition exclusion shall not apply to illness or injury which occurred or was aggravated during performance of service in the uniformed services. Uniformed services includes full -time and reserve c omponents of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard, the Army National Guard, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency. If you a re a covered employee called to a period of active service in the uniformed service, you should check with the plan administrator for a more complete explanation of your rights and obligations under USERRA. Coverage Termination The following events termina te your coverage eligibility. You become unemployed when your eligibility is based on employment. You become ineligible under your employer's or group sponsor's eligibility requirements for reaso ns other than unemployment. Your employer or group sponsor discontinues or replaces this group health plan. Your employer or group sponsor ends its membership in an association that is the basis of this coverage. The number of individuals covered under th is group health plan falls below the number or percentage of eligible individuals required to be covered. Your employer sends a written request to terminate coverage. We decide to discontinue offering this group health benefit plan in the group market in S outh Dakota by giving written notice to you and your employer or group sponsor and the Director of Insurance at least 90 days prior to termination. We decide to nonrenew all group health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to employers in South Dakota by giving written notice to you and your employer or group sponsor and the Director of Insurance at least 180 days prior to termination. Also see Fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation of Material Facts, and Nonpayment later in this section. When yo u become unemployed and your eligibility is based on employment, your coverage will end at the end of the month your employment ends . When your coverage terminates for all other reasons, check with your employer or group sponsor or call the Customer Servic e number on your ID card to verify the coverage termination date. Fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation of Material Facts Your coverage will terminate immediately if: You use this group health plan fraudulently or intentionally misrepresent a material fact in your application; or Your employer or group sponsor commits fraud or intentionally misrepresents a material fact under the terms of this group health plan. If yo ur coverage is terminated for fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, then: We may declare this group health plan void retroactively from the effective date of coverage following a 30 -day written notice. In this case, we will recover any claim payments made. Premiums may be retroactively adjusted as if the fraud or intentionally misrepresented material fact had been accurately disclosed in your application. Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 78 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 We will retain legal rights, including the right to bring a civil action. Nonpayme nt If you or your employer or group sponsor fail to make required payments to us when due or within the allowed grace period, your coverage will terminate the last day of the month in which premiums have been paid in full. Coverage Continuation When your coverage ends, you may be eligible to continue coverage under this group health plan. COBRA Continuation COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary extension of group health coverage under the plan under certain circumstances when coverage would otherwise end. The right to COBRA coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA coverage can become available when you would otherwise lose group h ealth coverage under the plan. It can also become available to your spouse and dependent children, if they are covered under the plan, when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage under the plan. The following paragraphs generally explain COB RA coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect the right to receive it. The description of COBRA coverage contained here applies only to the group health plan benefits offered under the plan and not to any other benefits offered by your employer or group sponsor (such as life insurance, disability, or accidental death or dismemberment benefits). The plan provides no greater COBRA rights than what COBRA requires. Nothing in the plan is intended to expand the participant's rights beyond COBRA's requirements. Coverage Entitlement. You, your spouse, and/or your dependent child(ren) will be entitled to elect COBRA if you lose your group health coverage under the plan because of a life event known as a qualifyi ng event. You may be entitled to continue this coverage under COBRA for a period of 18, 29, or 36 months depending on the qualifying event that causes loss of coverage under this plan. See Length of Coverage later in this section. The following are recogni zed qualifying events that will entitle you, your spouse, and/or your dependent child(ren) for COBRA Coverage. You will be entitled to elect COBRA: If you lose your group health coverage under the plan because your hours of employment are reduced; or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. Your spouse will be entitled to elect COBRA if he/she loses his/her group health coverage under the plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: You die; Your hours of employ ment are reduced; Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct; You become entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B or both) prior to your qualifying event; or Your spouse becomes divorced or legally separated from you. Your dependent child will be entitled to elect COBRA if he/she loses his/her group health coverage under the plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: You die; Your hours of employment are reduced; Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct; You become entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B or both); You and your spouse become divorced or legally separated; or Coverage Changes and Termination Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 79 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ The dependent stops being eligible for coverage under the plan as a dependent child. A child b orn to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with you during a period of COBRA coverage is considered to be a qualified beneficiary provided that, if you are a qualified beneficiary, you have elected COBRA coverage for yourself. The child's COBRA coverage be gins when the child is enrolled under this plan, whether through special enrollment or open enrollment, and it lasts for as long as COBRA coverage lasts for other family members of the employee. To be enrolled under this plan, the child must satisfy the ot herwise applicable eligibility requirements (for example, regarding age). Your child who is receiving benefits under this plan pursuant to a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) received by your employer or group sponsor during your period of empl oyment with your employer or group sponsor is entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA as your eligible dependent child. If you take a Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave and do not return to work at the end of the leave or terminate coverage durin g the leave, you (and your spouse and dependent children, if any) will be entitled to elect COBRA if: They were covered under the plan on the day before the FMLA leave began or became covered during the FMLA leave; and They will lose coverage under the pl an because of your failure to return to work at the end of the leave. This means that some individuals may be entitled to elect COBRA at the end of an FMLA leave even if they were not covered under the plan during the leave. COBRA coverage elected in thes e circumstances will begin on the last day of the FMLA leave, with the same 18 -month maximum coverage period, subject to extension or early termination, generally applicable to the COBRA qualifying events of termination of employment and reduction of hours . For information on how long you may have COBRA coverage, see later in this section, under Length of Coverage. Qualifying Events. After a qualifying event occurs and any required notice of that event is properly provided to your employer or group sponsor, COBRA coverage must be offered to each person losing coverage under the plan who is a qualified beneficiary. You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries and would be entitled to elect COBRA if coverage under the plan is lost because of the qualifying event. COBRA coverage is the same coverage that this plan gives to other participants or beneficiaries under the plan who are not receiving COBRA coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who elects COBRA will have the same r ights under the plan as other participants or beneficiaries covered under the component or components of this plan elected by the qualified beneficiary, including open enrollment and special enrollment rights. Under this plan, qualified beneficiaries who e lect COBRA must pay for COBRA coverage. When the qualifying event is the end of your employment, your reduction of hours of employment, or your death, COBRA coverage will be offered to qualified beneficiaries. You need not notify your employer or group sp onsor of any of these three qualifying events. For the other qualifying events, a COBRA election will be available only if you notify your employer or group sponsor in writing within 60 days after the later of: The date of the qualifying event; and The da te on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the plan as a result of the qualifying event. The written notice must include the plan name or group name, your name, your Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 80 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 Social Security Number, your dependent's name and a description of the event. Please note: If these procedures are not followed or if the written notice is not provided to your employer or group sponsor during the 60 -day notice period, you or your dependents will lose your right to elect COBRA. Elec ting Coverage. To elect COBRA, you must complete the Election form that is part of the COBRA election notice and submit it to WEX, Inc . An election notice will be provided to qualified beneficiaries at the time of a qualifying event. You may also obtain a copy of the Election form from your employer or group sponsor. Under federal law, you must have 60 days after the date the qualified beneficiary coverage under the plan terminates, or, if later, 60 days after the date of the COBRA election notice provided to you at the time of the qualifying event to decide whether you want to elect COBRA under the plan. Mail the completed Election form to: WEX, Inc . P.O. Box 869 Fargo, ND 58107 -0869 The Election form must be completed in writing and mailed to the indiv idual and address specified above. The following are not acceptable as COBRA elections and will not preserve COBRA rights: oral communications regarding COBRA coverage, including in -person or telephone statements about an individual's COBRA coverage; and e lectronic communications, including e -mail and faxed communications. The election must be postmarked 60 days from the termination date or 60 days from the date the COBRA election notice provided at the time of the qualifying event. Please note: If you do not submit a completed Election form within this period, you will lose your right to elect COBRA. If you reject COBRA before the due date, you may change your mind as long as you furnish a completed Election form before the due date. The plan will only provide continuation coverage beginning on the date the waiver of coverag e is revoked. You do not have to send any payment with your Election form when you elect COBRA. Important additional information about payment for COBRA coverage is included below. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA. F or example, your spouse may elect COBRA even if you do not. COBRA may be elected for only one, several, or for all dependent children who are qualified beneficiaries. You and your spouse (if your spouse is a qualified beneficiary) may elect COBRA on behalf of all of the qualified beneficiaries, and parents may elect COBRA on behalf of their children. Any qualified beneficiary for whom COBRA is not elected within the 60 - day election period specified in the COBRA election notice will lose his or her right to elect COBRA coverage. When you complete the Election form, you must notify WEX, Inc ., if any qualified beneficiary has become entitled to Medicare (Part A, Part B, or both) and, if so, the date of Medicare entitlement. If you become entitled to Medicare (o r first learn that you are entitled to Medicare) after submitting the Election form, immediately notify WEX, Inc., of the date of the Medicare entitlement at the address specified above for delivery of the Election form. Qualified beneficiaries may be enrolled in one or more group health components at the time of a qualifying event. If a qualified beneficiary is entit led to a COBRA election as the result of a qualifying event, he or she may elect COBRA under any or all of the group health components under which he or she was covered on the day before the qualifying event. For example, if a qualified beneficiary was cov ered under the medical and vision components on the day before a qualifying event, he or she may elect COBRA under the vision component only, the medical component only, or under both Coverage Changes and Termination Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 81 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ medical and vision (only if both components are available as a separate election option to the active employee). Qualified beneficiaries who are entitled to elect COBRA may do so even if they have other group health plan coverage or are entitled to Medicare benefits on or before the date on which COBRA is elected. However, a qualified beneficiary's COBRA coverage will terminate automatically if, after electing COBRA, he or she becomes entitled to Medicare benefits or becomes covered under other group health plan coverage. For information on when coverage will terminate, see la ter in this section, under Termination of Coverage. When considering whether to elect COBRA, you should take into account that a failure to elect COBRA will affect your future rights under federal law. You should take into account that you have special enr ollment rights under federal law. You have the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as coverage sponsored by the spouse's employer) within 30 days after your group health coverage under the plan ends because of one of the qualifying events listed above. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of COBRA coverage if you get COBRA coverage for the maximum time available. Length of Coverage. When coverage is lost due t o your death, your divorce or legal separation, or your dependent child losing eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA coverage can last for up to a maximum of 36 months. When coverage is lost due to the end of your employment or reduction in hours of empl oyment, and you became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage for qualified beneficiaries (other than you as the employee) who lose coverage as a result of the qualifying event can last a maximum of 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if you become entitled to Medicare eight months before the date on which your employment terminates, COBRA coverage under the plan for your spouse and children who lost coverage as a result of yo ur termination can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus eight months). This COBRA coverage period is available only if you become entitled to Medica re within 18 months before the termination or reduction of hours. Otherwise, when coverage is lost due to the end of your employment or reduction of hours of employment, COBRA coverage generally can last for only up to a maximum of 18 months. Extending Co verage. If the qualifying event that resulted in your COBRA election was your termination of employment or reduction of hours, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualified beneficiary is disabled or a second qualifying eve nt occurs. You must notify your employer or group sponsor of a disability or a second qualifying event in order to extend the period of COBRA coverage. Failure to provide notice of a disability or second qualifying event will eliminate the right to extend the period of COBRA coverage. Along with the notice of a disability, the qualified beneficiary must also supply a copy of the Social Security Administration disability determination. If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administr ation to be disabled and you notify your employer or group sponsor in a timely fashion, all of the qualified beneficiaries in your family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. This ext ension is available only for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving COBRA coverage because of a qualifying event that was your termination of employment or reduction of Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 82 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 hours. The qualified beneficiary must be determined disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage. Each qualified beneficiary will be entitled to the disability extension if one of them qualifies. The disability extension is available only if you notify your employer or group sponsor in writing of the Social Security Adm inistration's determination of disability within 60 days after the latest of: The date of the Social Security Administration's disability determination; The date of your termination of employment or reduction of hours; or The date on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the plan as a result of your termination of employment or reduction of hours. The written notice must include the plan name or group name, your name, your Social Security Number, your dependent's name and a description of the event. You must also provide this notice within 60 days after your termination of employment or reduction of hours in order to be entitled to a disability extension. If these procedures are not followed or if the written noti ce is not provided to your employer or group sponsor during the 60 - day notice period, then there will be no disability extension of COBRA coverage. An extension of coverage will be available to your spouse and dependent children who are receiving COBRA cov erage if a second qualifying event occurs during the 60 days (or, in the case of a disability extension, the 29 months) following your termination of employment or reduction of hours. The maximum amount of COBRA coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying events may include your death, your divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a dependent under this plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under the plan if the first qualifying event had not occurred. (This extension is not available under this plan when you become entitled to Medicare.) This extension due to a second qua lifying event is available only if the participant notifies your employer or group sponsor in writing of the second qualifying event within 60 days after the later of: The date of the second qualifying event; and The date on which the qualified beneficiar y would lose coverage under the terms of this plan as a result of the second qualifying event (if it had occurred while the qualified beneficiary was still covered under this plan). If these procedures are not followed or if the written notice is not provi ded to your employer or group sponsor during the 60 - day notice period, there will be no extension of COBRA coverage due to a second qualifying event. In addition to the regular COBRA termination events specified later in this section, the disability extens ion period will end the first of the month beginning more than 30 days following recovery. For example, if disability ends June 10, coverage will continue through the month of July (7/31). Termination of Coverage. Coverage under COBRA will end when you mee t the maximum period for your qualifying event, as indicated earlier under Length of Coverage. COBRA coverage will automatically terminate before the end of the maximum period if: Any required premium is not paid in full on time; A qualified beneficiary becomes covered, after electing COBRA, under another group health plan; Coverage Changes and Termination Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 83 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ A qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing COBRA; The employer ceases to provide any group health plan for its employees; or During a disability extension period, the disabled qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to be no longer disabled. For more information about the disability extension period, see Extending Coverage, earlier in this section. COBRA coverage may also be terminated for any reason this plan would terminate your coverage or coverage of a beneficiary not receiving COBRA coverage, such as fraud. You must notify your employer or group sponsor in writing within 3 0 days if, after electing COBRA, a qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare (Part A, Part B, or both) or becomes covered under other group health plan coverage. COBRA coverage will terminate (retroactively if applicable) as of the date of Medicar e entitlement or as of the beginning date of the other group health coverage. Your employer or group sponsor will require repayment of all benefits paid after the termination date, regardless of whether or when you provide notice to your employer or group sponsor of Medicare entitlement or other group health plan coverage. If a disabled qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to no longer be disabled, you must notify your employer or group sponsor of that fact within 30 day s after the Social Security Administration's determination. If the Social Security Administration's determination that the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled occurs during a disability extension period, COBRA coverage for all qualified beneficiari es will terminate (retroactively if applicable) as of the first day of the month that is more than 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination that the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled. Your employer or group sponsor will re quire repayment of all benefits paid after the termination date, regardless of whether or when you provide notice to your employer or group sponsor that the disabled qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled. For more information about the disability ext ension period, see Extending Coverage, earlier in this section. Coverage Cost and Payment. Each qualified beneficiary is required to pay the entire cost of COBRA coverage. The amount a qualified beneficiary may be required to pay may not exceed 102 percent (or, in the case of an extension of COBRA coverage due to a disability, 150 percent) of the cost to the group health plan (including both employer and employee contributions) for coverage of a similarly situated plan participant or beneficiary who is not receiving COBRA coverage. The amount of the COBRA premiums may change from time to time during the period of COBRA coverage and will most likely increase over time. You will be notified of COBRA premium changes. All COBRA premiums must be paid by check or money order. Payments should be sent via check or money order made payable to WEX, Inc., to the following address. Include the member ID number on the memo line to ensure the payment is applied to the intended account : WEX, Inc . P.O. Box 2079 Omaha, NE 68103 -2079 The payment is considered to have been made on the date that it is postmarked. You will not be considered to have made any payment by mailing a check if your check is returned due to insufficient funds or otherwise. If you elect COBRA, you do not have to send any payment with the Election form. However, you must make your first payment for COBRA cov erage not later than 45 days Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 84 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 after the date of election. This is the date the Election form is postmarked, if mailed, or the date the Election form is received by the individual at the address specified for delivery of the Election form, if hand - delivered. For more information on electing coverage, see Electing Coverage earlier in this section. The first payment must cover the cost of COBRA coverage from the time coverage under the plan would have otherwise terminated up through the end of the month before the month in which you make your first payment. For example, Sue's employment terminated on September 30, and she loses coverage on September 30. Sue elects COBRA on November 15. Her initial premium payment equals the premiums for October and November and is due on or before December 30, the 45th day after the date of her COBRA election. You are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is correct. You may contact the plan administrator to confirm the correct amount of the first payment. Claims for reimbursement will not be processed and paid until you have elected COBRA and make the first payment for it. If you do not make the first payment for COBRA coverage in full within 45 days after the date of your election, you will lose all COBRA rights under this plan. After you make your first payment for COBRA coverage, you will be required to make monthly payments for each subsequent month of COBRA coverage. The amount due for each month for each qualified beneficiary will be disclosed i n the election notice provided at the time of the qualifying event. Under the plan, each of these monthly payments for COBRA coverage is due on the first day of the month for that month's COBRA coverage. If you make a monthly payment on or before the first day of the month to which it applies, your COBRA coverage under this plan will continue for that month without any break. Although monthly payments are due on the first day of each month of COBRA coverage, you will be given a grace period of 30 days after the first day of the month to make each monthly payment. COBRA coverage will be provided for each month as long as payment for that month is made before the end of the grace period for that payment. However, if you pay a monthly payment later than the first day of the month to which it applies, but before the end of the grace period for the month, your coverage under this plan will be suspended as of the first day of the month and then retroactively reinstated (going back to the first day of the month) when the monthly payment is received. This means that any claim submitted for benefits while coverage is suspended may be denied and may have to be resubmitted once coverage is reinstated. If you fail to make a monthly payment before the end of the grace period for that month, you will lose all rights to COBRA coverage under the plan. Assistance With Questions. Questions concerning the plan or your COBRA rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified below. For more information abou t COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or visit the HHS website at www.hhs.gov . Addresses and phone numbers of Regional HHS Offices are also available through HHS's website. Notification of Changes.

You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices sent by your employer or group sponsor. Coverage Changes and Termination Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 85 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ Plan Contact Information. For additional information about you and your dependents' rights and obligations under the plan and under federal law, you should contact your employer or group sponsor, the plan administrator. You may obtain information about COBRA coverage on request from: WEX, Inc P.O. Box 869 a form: cobraforms@wexhealth.com Fax: 888 -408-7224 The contact information for the plan may change from time to time. The most recent information will be included in the most recent plan documents (if you are not sure whether this is the most recent plan document, you may request the most recent one from the plan administrator or your employer or group sponsor). South Dakota Law. Chapter 58 -18 of the South Dakota Codified Laws applies if you receive health care coverage through an employer with fewer than 20 employees. If this law applies, you may be eligible to continue this health benefits plan. If coverage ends because employment is terminated (because of reduction of hours, self termination, and other approved reasons) continuation coverage i s provided for up to 18 months. Coverage must be the same as the coverage for active employees. The employee is responsible for the premium, which will not be more than 102 percent of the premium for active employees. If a beneficiary becomes disabled duri ng the first 60 days of continuation coverage, continuation may be extended for up to 29 months. If the coverage is terminated for any of the following reasons, coverage may extend for up to 36 months: Former spouses and dependents lose coverage due to di vorce or legal separation from the employee. Surviving spouses and dependents lose coverage due to death of the employee. A dependent is no longer eligible for coverage. Dependents lose coverage when the employee qualifies for Medicare. The premium will no t be more than 102 percent of the premium for active employees up to the 18th month. Beginning with month 19, the premium will not exceed 150 percent of the premium for active employees. Your employer or group sponsor must provide you with written notice of your right to continue your coverage within 14 days of the last day you are considered employed or your coverage ends. After receiving the notice, you have 30 days to notify your employer or group sponsor that you want to continue your coverage. Your request should be written. Assuming you received the proper notice, the right to continue your coverage ends 60 days after the date of termination of your employment or the date you were given notice of your right to continue this health car e program, whichever comes later. If you lose your health care coverage and think this law applies to you, contact your employer or group sponsor for help with forms and information about the cost of continuing your coverage. Chapter 58 -18C of the South D akota Codified Laws applies if you receive health care coverage through an employer and your employer ceases operations, fails to pay premiums, or cancels coverage without notice to employees. In any of these events, continuation of coverage for yourself a nd your eligible dependents may extend for up to 12 months. During this time, you will be Coverage Changes and Termination MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 86 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/CC_ 0122 financially responsible for payment of premiums. The premium will not exceed 125 percent of the group rate. Continuation will be available only to an employee who ha s been continuously insured under the group health plan, or under any creditable coverage which it replaced, during the six -month period ending with the termination. Written notice of termination of group coverage shall be provided, within 10 days, by the employer to each covered employee.

Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/COB_ 0122 91 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 11. Coordination of Benefits Coordination of benefits applies when you have more than one plan, insurance policy, or group health plan that provides the same or similar benefits as this plan. Benefits payable under this plan, when combined with those paid under your other coverage, will not be more than 100 percent of either our payment arrangement amount or the other plan's payment arrangement amount. The method we use to calculate the payment arrangement amount may be different from your other plan's method. Other Coverage When yo u receive services, you must inform us that you have other coverage, and inform your health care provider about your other coverage. Other coverage includes any of the following: Group and nongroup insurance contracts and subscriber contracts. HMO contract s. Uninsured arrangements of group or group -type coverage. Group and nongroup coverage through closed panel plans. Group -type contracts. The medical care components of long - term contracts, such as skilled nursing care. Medicare or other governmental benefi ts (not including Medicaid). The medical benefits coverage of your auto insurance (whether issued on a fault or no -fault basis). Group and nongroup insurance contracts and subscriber contracts that pay or reimburse for the cost of dental care. Coverage that is not subject to coordina tion of benefits includes the following: Hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage. Accident -only coverage. Specified disease or specified accident coverage. Limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law. School accident -type coverage. Benefits for nonmedical components of long -term care policies. Medicare supplement policies. Medicaid policies. Coverage under other governmental plans, unless permitted by law. You must cooperate with Wellmark and provide requested information about other coverage. Failure to provide information can result in a denied claim. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying the following rules and determining the benefits payable under t his plan and other plans covering you. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Your Participating or PPO provider will forward your coverage information to us. If you see an Out -of-Network Provider, you are responsible for informing us about your other coverage. Claim Filing If you know that your other coverage has primary responsibility for payment, after you receive services or obtain a covered prescription drug , a claim should be submitted to your other insurance carrier first. If that claim is processed with an unpaid balance for benefits eligible under this group health plan, you or your provider should submit a claim to us and attach the other carrier's explanation of benefit payment within 180 days of the date of the other carr ier's explanation of benefits. We may contact your provider or the other carrier for further information. Coordination of Benefits MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 92 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/COB_ 0122 Rules of Coordination We follow certain rules to determine which health plan or coverage pays first (as the primary plan) when other coverage provide s the same or similar benefits as this group health plan. Here are some of those rules: The primary plan pays or provides benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other plan. Except as provided below, a plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with applicable regulations is always primary unless the provisions of both plans state that the complying plan is primary. Coverage that is obtained by membership in a group and is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits is excess to any other parts of the plan provided by the contract holder. (Examples of such supplementary coverage are major medical coverage that is superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits and insurance -type coverage written in connection with a closed panel plan to provide Out -of-Network benefits.) The following rules are to be applied in order. The first rule that applies to your situation is used to determine the primary plan. The coverage that you have as an employee, plan member, subscriber, policyholder, or retiree pays before coverage that you have as a spouse or dependent. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is s econdary to the plan covering the person as a dependent and primary to the plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g., a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two plans is reversed, so that the plan covering the person as the employee, plan member, subscriber, policyholder or retiree is the secondary plan and the other plan is the primary plan. The coverage that you have as the result of active employment (not laid off or retired) pays before coverage that you have as a lai d-off or retired employee. The same would be true if a person is a dependent of an active employee and that same person is a dependent of a retired or laid -off employee. If the other plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. If a person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another plan, the plan covering the person as an employee, plan m ember, subscriber, policyholder or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the primary plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the secondary plan. If the other plan does n ot have this rule and, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. The coverage with the earliest continuous effective date pays first if none of the rules above apply. Notw ithstanding the preceding rules, when you present your Blue Rx Value Plus ID card to a pharmacy as the primary payer, your Blue Rx Value Plus prescription drug benefits are primary for prescription drugs purchased at the pharmacy. If, under the preceding r ules, your Blue Rx Value Plus prescription drug benefits are secondary and you present your Blue Rx Value Plus ID card to a pharmacy as the secondary payer, your Blue Rx Value Plus prescription drug benefits are secondary for prescription drugs purchased a t the pharmacy. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits and if the plans cannot agree on the order of benefits Coordination of Benefits Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/COB_ 0122 93 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ within 30 calendar days after the plans have received all information needed to pay the claim, the plans will pay the claim in equal shares and determine their relative liabilities following payment. However, we will not pay more than we would have paid had this plan been primary. Dependent Children To coordinate benefits for a depende nt child, the following rules apply (unless there is a court decree stating otherwise): If the child is covered by both parents who are married (and not separated) or who are living together, whether or not they have been married, then the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs first in a calendar year pays first. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the parent the longest is the primary plan. For a child covered by separated or divorced parents or parents who are not living together, whether or not they have been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the child's health care expenses or coverage and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, then that parent's covera ge pays first. If the parent with responsibility has no health care coverage for the dependent child's health care expenses, but that parent's spouse does, that parent's spouse's coverage pays first. This item does not apply with respect to any plan year d uring which benefits are paid or provided before the entity has actual knowledge of the court decree provision. If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the child's health care expense or health care coverage or if a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or coverage of the dependent child, then the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs first in a calendar year pays first. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the parent the longest is the primary plan. If a court decree does not specify which parent has financial or insurance responsibility, then the coverage of the parent with custody pays first. The p ayment order for the child is as follows: custodial parent, spouse of custodial parent, other parent, spouse of other parent. A custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom t he child resides more than one -half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. For a dependent child covered under more than one plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicab le, as outlined previously in this Dependent Children section. For a dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has his or her own coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the plan that covered the dependent for the longer period of time is the primary plan. If the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable, as outlined in the first bullet of this Dependent Children section, to the dependent child's parent or parents and the dependent's spouse. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits and if the plans cannot agree on the order of benefits within 30 calendar days after the plans have received all information needed to Coordination of Benefits MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 94 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/COB_ 0122 pay the claim, the plans will pay the claim in equal shares and determine their relative liabilities following payment. However, we will not pay more than we would have paid had this plan been primary. Coordination with Noncomplying Plans If you have coverage with another plan that is excess or always secondary or that does not comply with the preceding rules of coordination, we may coordinate benefits on the following basis: If this is the primary plan, we will pay its benefits first. If this is the secondary plan, we will pay benefits first, but the amount of benefits will be determined as if this plan were secondary. Our payment will be limited to the amount we would have paid h ad this plan been primary. If the noncomplying plan does not provide information needed to determine benefits, we will assume that the benefits of the noncomplying plan are identical to this plan and will administer benefits accordingly. If we receive the necessary information within two years of payment of the claim, we will adjust payments accordingly. In the event that the noncomplying plan reduces its benefits so you receive less than you would have received if we had paid as the secondary plan and the noncomplying plan was primary, we will advance an amount equal to the difference. In no event will we advance more than we would have paid had this plan been primary, minus any amount previously paid. In consideration of the advance, we will be subrogated to all of your rights against the noncomplying plan. See Subrogation, page 106. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits and if the plans cannot agree on the order of benefits within 30 calendar days after the plans have received all information needed to pay the claim, the plans will pay the claim in equal shares and determine their relative liabilities following payment. Howe ver, we will not pay more than we would have paid had this plan been primary. Effects on the Benefits of this Plan In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the secondary plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of othe r coverage and apply the calculated amount to any allowable expense under its plan that is unpaid by the primary plan. The secondary plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, total benef its paid or provided by all plans for the claim do not exceed the total allowable expense for that claim. In addition, the secondary plan will credit to its applicable deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other coverage. If a person is enrolled in two or more closed panel plans and if, for any reason including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one closed panel plan, coordination of benefits will not apply between that p lan and other closed panel plans. Right of Recovery If the amount of payments made by us is more than we should have paid under these coordination of benefits provisions, we may recover the excess from any of the persons to or for whom we paid, or from any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the covered person. The amount of payments made includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Plans That Provide Benefits as Services A secondary plan that provides benefits in the form of services may recover the reasonable cash value of the service from the primary plan, to the extent benefits for the services are covered by the primary plan Coordination of Benefits Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/COB_ 0122 95 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ and have not already been paid or provided by the primary plan. Coordination with Medicare Medicare is by law the secondary coverage to group health plans in a variety of situations. The following provisions apply only if you have both Medicare and employer group health coverage and meet the specific Medicare Secondary Payer provisions for the applicable Medicare entitlement reason. Medicare Part B Drugs Drugs paid under Medicare Part B are covered under the medical benefits of this plan. Working Aged If you are a member of a group health plan of an employer with at least 20 employees for each working day for at least 20 calendar weeks in the current or preceding year, then in most situations Medicare is the secondary payer if the beneficiary is: Age 65 or older; and A cur rent employee or spouse of a current employee covered by an employer group health plan. Working Disabled If you are a member of a group health plan of an employer with at least 100 full -time, part -time, or leased employees on at least 50 percent of regular business days during the preceding calendar year, then in most situations Medicare is the secondary payer if the beneficiary is: Under age 65; A recipient of Medicare disability benefits; and A current employee or a spouse or dependent of a current employ ee, covered by an employer group health plan. End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) The ESRD requirements apply to group health plans of all employers, regardless of the number of employees. Under these requirements, Medicare is the secondary payer during the fir st 30 months of Medicare eligibility if both of the following are true: The beneficiary is eligible for Medicare coverage as an ESRD patient; and The beneficiary is covered by an employer group health plan. If the beneficiary is already covered by Medicare due to age or disability and the beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare ESRD coverage, Medicare generally is the secondary payer during the first 30 months of ESRD eligibility. However, if the group health plan is secondary to Medicare (based on other Medicare secondary -payer requirements) at the time the beneficiary becomes eligible for ESRD, the group health plan remains secondary to Medicare. This is only a general summary of the laws. For complete information, contact your employer or the Social Sec urity Administration. Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/AP_ 0122 97 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 12.

Medicaid Enrollment and Payments t o Medicaid Assignment of Rights This group health plan will provide payment of benefits for covered services to you, your beneficiary, or any other person who has been legally assigned the right to receive General Provisions MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 106 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GP_ 0121 such benefits under requirements established pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid). Enrollment Without Regard to Medicaid Your receipt or eligibility for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) will not affect your enrollment as a participant or beneficiary of this group health plan, nor will it affect our determination of any benefits paid to you. Acquisition by States of Rights of Third Parties If payment has been made by Medicaid and Wellmark has a legal obligation to provide benefits for those services, Wellmark will make payment of those benefits in accordance with any state law under which a state acquires the right to such payments. Medicaid Reimbursement When a PPO or Participating provider submits a claim to a state Medicaid program for a covered service and Wellmark reimburses the state Medicaid program for the service, Wellmark's total payment for the service will be limited to the amount paid to the state Medicaid program. No additional payments will be made to the provider or to you. Subrogation and Reimbursement When a member becomes ill or injured because of the actions or inactions of a third party, the plan may cover eligible health care (medical, dental, and vision) expenses, regard less whether the plan includes or excludes coverage for the cost of claims arising from care or treatment. However, to receive coverage, the member must notify the plan the illness or injury was caused by a third party, and the member must follow special p lan rules. When this happens, the plan is subrogated and has a right of reimbursement as described herein, unless otherwise prohibited by law. This section describes the procedures with respect to the plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights. The plan also reserves the right to pursue recovery from the third party at its discretion. The plan has a right to be reimbursed for the amount of any benefits it pays out to a member if the member receives, directly or indirectly, any money from a third party (such as a person responsible for an illness or injury or an insurance company) on account of the same illness or injury for which the plan has paid benefits (any such money is referred to here as a \"recovery\"). Therefore, as a condition of receiving benefits from the plan for medical or other expenses, the member agrees that any recovery is received from a third party on account of an illness or injury for which the plan has paid benefits, the member will pay to the plan the amount of that recovery, up to the total amount of benefits paid to the member by the plan. For example, if a member is injured in an auto accident and either the member's insurance company or the other driver's insurance company settles with the member, the member must reimburse the plan for the benefits the plan provided to the member for all medical expenses resulting from that accident. The plan will have a first priority lien on all sums paid by a third party or received by the member equal to the sums paid by the plan to cover the ca re arising from the illness or injury caused by a third party or for which a third -party insurance company was required to pay money to the member. The plan's first priority lien will not be subject to, or set -off by, any attorneys' fees or expenses the me mber or any insurance company is required to incur in order to recover damages for the illness or injury for which the plan paid benefit claims on a member's behalf. Therefore, by accepting plan benefits to pay for treatments, devices, or other products o r services related to such illness or injury, the member agrees: General Provisions Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GP_ 0121 107 MCM00J1M RCM008EJ The plan has a first priority lien on any and all monies paid (or payable) to member or for the member's benefit by any responsible party or other recovery to the extent the plan paid benefi ts for such illness or injury; The plan may appoint the member as constructive trustee for any and all monies paid (or payable to) the member or for the member's benefit by any responsible party or other recovery to the extent the plan paid benefits for such illness or injury; and The plan may bring an action on its own behalf or on the covered person's behalf against any responsible party or third party i nvolved in the illness or injury. The member will place any recovery (without reduction for attorneys' fees or otherwise) the member or member's attorney receives from a third party on account of an illness or injury for which the plan has paid benefits i n a separate, identifiable account, The plan has a first priority lien on the funds the member has placed in the separate, identifiable account, and The member serves as a constructive trustee over the funds placed in the separate, identifiable account t o the extent the plan has paid expenses related to the illness or injury and therefore the member is deemed to be in control of the funds. As a consequence, the member must pay the plan back first, in full, out of such funds for any health care expenses th e plan has paid related to such illness or injury for the member, regardless of whether the settlement or judgment says that the money received (all or part of it) is for health care expenses. Furthermore, the member must pay the plan back regardless of wh ether the third party admits liability and regardless of whether the member has been made whole or fully compensated for the illness or injury. Additionally, the plan is not required to participate in or contribute to any expenses or fees (including attorn eys' fees and costs) the member incurs in obtaining the funds. The plan's sources of payment through subrogation or reimbursement include, but are not limited to the following: Money from a third party that the member, the member's guardian, or other representatives of the member receive or are entitled to receive; Any constructive or other trust that is imposed on the proceeds of any settlement, verdict, or other amount that the member, the member's guardian, or other repre sentatives of the member receive; Any lien on the portion of the total recovery which is due the plan for benefits it paid; and Any liability or other insurance (for example, uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payments, workers' compensat ion, no - fault, school, homeowners, or excess or umbrella coverage) that is paid or payable to the member, the member's guardian, or other representatives of the member. Each member is required to: Cooperate with the plan's efforts to ensure a successful subrogation or reimbursement claim, including setting funds aside in a particular account. This also includes doing nothing to prejudice the plan's subrogation or reimbursement rights outlined in this Summary Plan Descr iption ; Notify the plan within 30 days of the date any notice is given by any party, including an attorney, of the member's intent to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to sustained injuries or Illness; and Provid e all information requested by the plan, the Claims Administrator or their representatives, or the Plan Administrator or its representatives. General Provisions MCM00J1M RCM008EJ 108 Form Number: Wellmark SD Grp/GP_ 0121 The plan may terminate the member's plan participation, offset future benefits, or use other measures in the event that the member fails to provide the information, authorizations, pay to the plan the monetary value of all claims made, or to otherwise cooperate in a manner that the plan consi ders necessary to exercise its rights or privileges under the plan. The plan also reserves the right to pursue recovery from the third party at its discretion should the member decide not to attempt recovery. The member must notify the Bureau of Human Resources, Benefits Program, o r the Claims Administrator immediately about any illness or injury that may have been caused by a liable third party. Workers' Compensation If you have received bene fits under this group health plan for an injury or condition that is the subject or basis of a workers' compensation claim (whether litigated or not), we are entitled to reimbursement to the extent benefits are paid under this plan in the event that your c laim is accepted or adjudged to be covered under workers' compensation. Furthermore, we are entitled to reimbursement from you to the full extent of benefits paid out of any proceeds you receive from any workers' compensation claim, regardless of whether you have been made whole or fully compensated for your losses, regardless of whether the proceeds represent a compromise or disputed settlement, and regardless of any characterization of the settlement proceeds by the parties to the settlement. We will not be liable for any attorney's fees or other expenses incurred in obtainin g any proceeds for any workers' compensation claim. We utilize industry standard methods to identify claims that may be work -related. This may result in initial payment of some claims that are work -related. We reserve the right to seek reimbursement of an y such claim or to waive reimbursement of any claim, at our discretion. Payment in Error If for any reason we make payment in error, we may recover the amount we paid. If we determine we did not ma ke full payment, Wellmark will make the correct payment without interest.
