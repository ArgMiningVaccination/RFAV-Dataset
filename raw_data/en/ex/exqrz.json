Treatments can be practiced individually as well as in condition with other conventional treatment for the purpose of relaxing mind, body and soul. Alternative medicines are into practice since ancient time and are practiced even today worldwide. Every country has its own conventional system of health. Alternative medicines are nowadays incorporated in many fields including dentistry. A result from few studies conducted has shown significant effect of holistic healing on dental and oral health. This article reviews about impact of alternative medicine in treating dental health and problems associated with it. Keywords: Dentistry; Yoga; Alternative medicine; Periodontal health; Alternative dentistry [Introduction](Introduction) In General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine, published in 2000 by the World Health Organization (WHO): Complementary And Alternative Medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system. The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), states that Complimentary & Alternative medicine (CAM) is \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine\". Quite often we come across patients who express their interest in mind body complimentary therapies to treat their health conditions. Alternative medicine also called as complimentary or integrative medicine, usually discuss and advise patients to any available alternate therapies. As the name suggest \"alternative\", means that its basic lies in a non-drug approach [1]. Even though phleboliths are not rare in the head and neck, buccal soft tissues rarely contain lesions that include calcifications. Here in we report an incidental finding of calcification within a chronic inflammatory gingival enlargement. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first reported instance of occurrence of phlebolith in a case of gingival enlargement. By presenting this case, we aim to alert clinicians regarding the importance of biopsy in all cases of gingival enlargements to rule out the possibility of vascular malformations Alternative medicine is often used interchangeably with terms like complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine.

[Applications in Dentistry](Applications in Dentistry) In recent years, many research studies h as been conducted in the field of dentistry related to traditional practices in medicine including holistic and natural therapies, with significant outcome. [Alternative Dentistry](Alternative Dentistry) Holistic Therapy (Yoga) Accupuncture Homeopathy Herbal Therapy Traditional Ethnic System [Yoga for Dental Care](Yoga for Dental Care) The practice of yoga in the Indian subcontinent was documented as early as 3000 BC.The word 'yoga' is derived fromSanskrit word yuz, which is often interpreted as meaning 'to unite'. Yoga focuses on body, breathing and mind. This is accomplished by Asanas (exercise postures), pranayama (breathing techniques) and meditation. Yoga prevents the impairment of cellular immunity seen in stress. Yoga involves mind body relaxation techniques and cushions the changes related to stress. Since yoga involves mind body relaxation techniques (pranayama and meditation) along with mild to moderate physical exercise (Asanas), yoga may optimize the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [2,5]. [Yoga](Yoga) a) Sirhasana helps in stimulates the blood flow to pituitary gland for strengthen the bones and teeth to prevent periodontal problems. b) Shitali & Shitkar Pranayama in these teeth is occluded during breathing to intermittent force on teeth and correction of alignment of teeth. c) Sarvangasana helps in stimulate the thyroid gland to increase the blood circulation in the mouth for prevention of dental disorders. d) Bhujangasana posture is so therapeutic for practicing dental surgeons, as it tones up the whole spine. Thus, yoga is helpful in prevention of dental diseases and maintenance of good oral hygiene. Accupuncture: Is many years old Chinese way of treatment in which needles are inserted in specific areas of the body. Several studies have been conducted which shows that acupuncture can help in reducing postoperative pain and anxiety. Other dental conditions in which accupuncture can be of use are Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and Xerostomia. Also offers alternative treatment options in dentistry. Some of the conditions in which it is found to be effective are Tooth Pain, Gingivitis, Dry Socket, Halitosis, Dental Trauma, Abscess, and Mouth Ulcers Etc. Herbal Therapy: Many plants/ herbs have the ability to provide anti-inflammatory, analgesic effect. E.g. Herbs like Echinacea, Aloe vera, Chamomile, Peppermint, Eucalyptus etc. They can provide relief in pain and canker sores. Traditional Ethnic System: An effective all natural solution for dental health comes in the form of an ancient ayurvedic practice called OIL-PULLING. It may sound strange but it can in fact become a very therapeutic, meditative practice. The idea is that the toxins are drawn out into the oil providing a deep cleaning and general detox. The practice can be performed as the usual oral hygiene routine [1,6]. [Limitations](Limitations) It is usually based on religion, tradition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, and errors in reasoning. It typically lacks any scientific validation, and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved. Treatments are not part of the conventional or science-based healthcare system. Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed. Might show some side effects when combined with conventional treatments. Treatments are of long duration [5]. [Conclusion](Conclusion) Although there are lot of benefits and significance in healthcare, Alternative Medicine cannot be substituted completely for a conventional scientific procedures and treatments. Nonetheless, it can always be used as an adjunct to conventional medical procedures.
