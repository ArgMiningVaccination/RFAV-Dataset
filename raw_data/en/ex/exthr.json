Balian Bali medicine Westerners come to Bali in search of healing but also of reconciliation with their soul. Balian Bali Medicine refers to the traditional healing practices and beliefs of the Balinese people in Bali, Indonesia. Balian, also known as traditional healers or shamans, play a vital role in the Balinese community, providing spiritual guidance and healing to individuals who seek their assistance. Here are some key aspects of Balian Bali Medicine: - Spiritual and Energetic Healing: Balian Bali Medicine recognizes the connection between the physical body, mind, and spirit. Balian work with the belief that illness and imbalances can be caused by spiritual disharmony or disruptions in the flow of energy. They employ various methods to diagnose and treat these spiritual and energetic imbalances. - Intuitive Diagnosis: Balian use their intuition and spiritual connection to diagnose the root causes of ailments. They may perform rituals, conduct divination practices, or communicate with the spirit world to gain insights into the individual's condition. - Herbal Remedies: Herbal remedies play a significant role in Balian Bali Medicine. Balian utilize a wide range of medicinal plants, roots, leaves, and other natural ingredients to create herbal concoctions or traditional medicines to address specific health issues. These remedies are believed to have healing properties and are often combined with prayers and rituals. - Rituals and Offerings: Balian perform rituals and ceremonies to restore balance and harmony. These rituals may involve offerings, prayers, chanting, and other sacred practices. The purpose is to connect with the spiritual realm and seek divine assistance in the healing process. - Energy Clearing and Balancing: Balian may use techniques such as energy clearing and balancing to remove blockages and restore the free flow of energy within the body. This can involve hands-on healing, energy manipulation, or the use of sacred objects. Balian Bali Medicine is deeply rooted in the Balinese culture and belief system. It combines elements of spirituality, natural remedies, and ancient wisdom to promote healing and well-being. Balian are highly respected members of the community, and their services are sought for various ailments, both physical and spiritual. It's important to note that while Balian Bali Medicine has been effective for many individuals, it should not replace professional medical advice, and seeking proper medical care is essential for serious or acute health conditions. The 3 main types of Balians The first type is the balian ketakson which acts as a channel between God and the patient. They invoke the spirit of a deceased person, and convey information to the family about the types of offerings needed for cremations and other ceremonies. They can also, via this means of communication with the divine, give life advice to populations or locate missing objects. Most Balian women are Ketakson Balians. A second type is Balian Paica who is a medium. He receives physical objects that appear and disappear spontaneously and are used during healing sessions. \"One day I saw a kriss* materialize during meditation, standing on its point and rotating\". The object may be ordinary and unattractive. These ritual objects appear and disappear on their own, and can manifest for up to five years. Then, the person who, at the start, has the clear intention of becoming Balian, and for that follows the appropriate teaching, or the one who receives divine knowledge during a serious illness, is a Usada Balian. These people decide to pursue their knowledge by studying the lontars (sacred texts) with recognized healers. Lontars, thousands of ancient texts in Kawi (Old Javanese) script, contain information on ethics, anatomy, traditional herbs, meditation, yoga, tantra, and other topics. The Balian studies both white and black magick, which are very similar except in the intent of the practitioner. Healers in Bali Traditional healers play an important role in Balinese culture. They treat physical and mental illnesses, eliminate bad spells and transmit information from ancestors and spirits. The Balian is an instrument of divine healing, and the patient enters into a covenant with the Gods to receive this healing with respect, reverence and humility. Medical diagnosis involves magic and an animistic worldview of Bali, where spirits permeate reality. Understanding healing practices in Bali requires an exploration of this worldview. The concept of healer (balian in Balinese, dukun in Indonesian) is broad, with practitioners ranging from traditional healers of the body or mental illnesses to bonesetters, massage therapists, mediums and clairvoyants. There are about four times as many Balians as doctors. They are at the forefront of community health, and Balinese often visit the Balian before going to see the doctor for conventional treatment. Balians have to specialize in a particular area, and often in a specific type of disease, such as skin diseases or muscle problems. Balinese Priests There are three categories of priests in Bali. Balians treat mental or physical problems, so they are healers, doctors, while priests take care of religious services and homage to the Gods. They are the guarantors of universal balance and the guardians of religion. The pedanda or high priest Often himself the son of a pedanda, is always a Brahman, that is to say a Balinese belonging to the upper caste. The spirit of caste is deeply rooted in the Balinese spirit. The names of members of the same caste always begin with the same particle and say a lot about their social and family position. Each caste has its own language and different dialects to address other castes. There are four castes: - Brahmans: religious men. - Satria: warriors, holders of temporal power. - Wesia: civil servants of the kingdom. - Sudra: peasants and fishermen, who represent more than 90% of the population. To become a priest, the pedanda must pass an initiation. From childhood, he undergoes preparations for his new functions through studies and the obligation of exemplary conduct, under the guidance of a master whose word holds authority and truth. The main role of the pedanda is to prepare holy water (tirta), which plays an essential role in Balinese religion, earning it the name \"agama tirta,\" the religion of holy water. This water is used for blessing temples, the faithful during prayer, and consecrated objects. Sometimes also, when buying a car or a scooter, families will bless their new acquisition with holy water. To prepare this holy water, the pedanda washes his hands while pronouncing mantras (sacred phrases), then practices for a certain time breaths resulting from the practice of yoga. He consecrates the water for the first time by throwing flowers into it, inviting Shiva and his sanctifying force to enter it. A second blessing of water follows, during which the priest will be invested by Shiva and will recite prayers. The pedanda also officiates during major ceremonies, especially for princely families: weddings, cremations... The ceremonial Leader (Pemangku) BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons Pemangku (priest of the popular religion) The second category is that of the pemangku, priest of the popular religion; he can belong to any caste. He is the guardian of the temple and the head of its rites, as well as of the ceremonial specific to this or that temple. It is not an initiate, unlike the pedanda. The gods can designate it, for example by the mouth of a person in a trance, or by disease with \"non-medical\" causes for which a shaman will say that his only remedy is to accept becoming pemangku. The status of pemangku is not really sought after. He does not earn his living with this function, but must respect many constraints which radically change his daily life: food prohibitions, loss of the role of head of the family relegated to the eldest son, prohibition to take part in human occupations such as manual labor, card games, or discussions on impure subjects etc... Some pemangku are very erudite but much less than the pedanda, who are clearly superior to them. The functions of the pemangkus bring them much closer to the people because they officiate during the many family ceremonies or in the village temples. Sengguhu is responsible for rituals related to the underworld Finally, the sengguhu is responsible for rituals related to the underworld. He plays my role of exorcist. All the sacrifices to the lower world are his responsibility, and he maintains a special relationship with Vishnu. It is undoubtedly a remnant of the ancient Vishnuite religion which no longer exists in Bali today. The underworld, known as \"Patala\" in Balinese mythology, is a realm inhabited by supernatural beings, spirits, and ancestral souls. It is believed to be a realm of both darkness and light, where balance and harmony are crucial. Sengguhu is revered as a guide and mediator in conducting rituals that connect the living with the underworld. Through intricate ceremonies, offerings, and chants, Sengguhu facilitates communication and seeks blessings and protection from the spiritual entities residing in the underworld. The rituals conducted by Sengguhu often involve offerings of food, flowers, and other sacred items. Chants and prayers are recited to invoke the presence of ancestral spirits and seek their guidance and blessings. These rituals are deeply rooted in Balinese cultural and religious beliefs, reflecting the island's rich spiritual heritage. The presence of Sengguhu in these rituals adds a layer of sacredness and reverence, as they possess the knowledge and understanding of the underworld and its mystical inhabitants. They act as a conduit between the physical and spiritual realms, facilitating a harmonious connection and ensuring the well-being and protection of the community.

Environmental factors, as the Balinese perceive them, are an important part of healing. First, the Balinese being animists, the physical environment perceived by them is not just the physical world we know. It is filled with spirits that can help or harm, and are effective in both functions. On the other hand, the outer, the macrocosm, is simply a mirror of the inner world, the microcosm. The connections between the human body and the world as a whole play out on a grand scale. Not only does internal balance reflect the balance of external forces and vice versa, but the physical body - with its tripartite composition of head, body and feet - is a microcosm of tripartite nature, which the found in the structure of temples and family dwellings. An imbalance between the microcosm and the macrocosm An imbalance between the microcosm and the macrocosm can link a physical or mental dysfunction to the tripartite representation found in each village (housing space, work space, temple space), the island of Bali (beaches, rice fields, volcano), and even the three parts of the nature of the cosmos with the upper world, the middle world, and the lower world. It is difficult to answer the question: \"Can the patient be asked to modify something in his personal behavior?\". It really depends on the case, let's say that the balian can reproach the patient for not practicing the daily religious rituals enough. He will advise him to redouble his attention to the gods who conscientiously make offerings every day. Second, the social environment is fundamental. The individual is defined in terms of their relationship to others, and therefore one cannot view illness or healing as a purely personal or individual phenomenon. Most often the whole family comes together with the patient and discusses with the balian the problems, the illness and what needs to be done for recovery. Thus, we can put the disease back in its natural and social environment, understand its cause and why it can be cured. This is an important part of healing in Bali as in other traditional societies. The origins of Balinese healing There are four influences behind Balinese healing practices: - The first is the Hindu tradition, a vision of the world that is more philosophical than practical. - The second influence comes from Buddhism, as there were once Buddhist practices in Bali. Medically, Buddhism treats disease through surgical intrusion, and has tantric influences centered on magical elements and formulas. - The third came from China and its traditional medicine of energies, although this influence is found more in the use of the sacred book, called lontar, than in the direct contact of the Balian with the patient. - Finally, indigenous peoples have always practiced a magical and practical form of medicine from the animist tradition, which has been incorporated into lontar magick. With all these influences, it is obvious that there can be no unified medical system! Does Balinese traditional medicine work? Balinese traditional medicine, rooted in Bali's cultural heritage, has been used for centuries. While many believe in its efficacy and have positive experiences, individual results can vary. This holistic approach aims to balance the mind, body, and spirit using natural ingredients and traditional therapies. The effectiveness depends on factors like the specific ailment, practitioner expertise, overall health, and individual response. It's advised to consult trained practitioners or healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment. While there is anecdotal evidence and cultural belief in Balinese traditional medicine, scientific studies may be limited. It's important to exercise caution and not rely solely on traditional remedies for serious conditions. It is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals / doctor and seek their expert advice when considering traditional medicine as a complementary option for treatment and under guidance. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Balinese traditional medicine varies. Informed decisions and consultations with healthcare professionals are essential for personalized treatment.
