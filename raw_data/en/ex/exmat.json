Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19: Information for Healthcare Professionals [People with Certain Medical Conditions](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)provides an overview of medical conditions and resources. What You Need to Know - An updated list of high-risk underlying conditions, along with their associated evidence, is provided below. The conditions are grouped by the level of evidence, with the highest level shown in the top section. - The list of underlying medical conditions is not exhaustive and will be updated as the science evolves. CDC continually reviews additional underlying conditions, and some of these might have sufficient evidence to be added to the list. - This list should not be used to exclude people with underlying conditions from recommended measures for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. - The process used to update the list is found on [CDC's Systematic Review Process](/library/researchguides/systematicreviews.html)page. This webpage provides an evidence-based resource for healthcare professionals caring for patients with underlying medical conditions who are at higher risk of experiencing severe outcomes of COVID-19. Severe outcomes of COVID-19 are defined as hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death. This page summarizes data from published reports, scientific articles in press, unreviewed pre-prints, and internal data that were included in literature reviews conducted by subject matter experts. Evidence used to inform the list of underlying conditions was determined by CDC reviewers based on available literature about COVID-19 at time of review. The information reflects evidence regarding underlying medical conditions and is intended to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about patient care and to increase the awareness of risk among their patients. The methods used to assess the conditions have changed during the pandemic as the amount of literature and types of studies increased. For instance, preliminary versions of this list focused on providing the latest information based on descriptive data. As the literature grew, CDC investigators categorized the literature by study design. Since May 2021, the process has been updated to include a CDC-led review process that uses rigorous systematic review methods. To learn more about the process of CDC's systematic reviews, see [CDC systematic review process](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/systematic-review-process.html). Background Age is the strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Patients with one or multiple of certain underlying medical conditions are also at higher risk.(1-3) Additionally, [being unvaccinated](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness%20) or not being up to date on [COVID-19 vaccinations](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#recommendations) also increases the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Providers should consider the patient's age, presence of underlying medical conditions and other risk factors, and vaccination status in determining the risk of severe COVID-19-associated outcomes for any patient. Demographic Factors Studies have shown that COVID-19 does not affect all population groups equally. Three important factors are age, race, and ethnicity. Age Age remains the strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, with risk of severe outcomes increasing markedly with increasing age. Based on data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) at NCHS ( [Risk for COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Death By Age Group](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm)), compared with ages 18-29 years, the risk of death is 25 times higher in those ages 50-64 years, 60 times higher in those ages 65-74 years, 140 times higher in those ages 75-84 years, and 340 times higher in those ages 85+ years. Notably, these data include all deaths in the United States that occurred throughout the pandemic, from February 2020 to July 1, 2022, including deaths among unvaccinated individuals. Risk of severe outcomes is increased in people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions and in people who are 50 years and older, with risk increasing substantially at ages >65 years.4,5 Residents of long-term care facilities are also at increased risk, making up less than 1% of the U.S. population but accounting for more than 35% of all COVID-19 deaths.6-10 Race and Ethnicity The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted [racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities](/healthequity/whatis/index.html) in COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.11-13 Some racial and ethnic minority groups are also more likely to face multiple barriers to accessing health care including lack of insurance, transportation, child care, or ability to take time off from work. Estimates of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. show that people from racial and ethnic minority groups are dying from COVID-19 disproportionately, and studies have identified racial and ethnic differences in at-home COVID-19 test use, vaccination coverage, and access to outpatient therapeutics.14-16 Data has shown that compared to non-Hispanic White people, people from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Once infected, people from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be hospitalized, be admitted to the ICU, and die from COVID-19 at younger ages.17 We are still learning about how the environments where [people live, learn, and work](/socialdeterminants/index.htm) can influence the risk for infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Summary of Conditions with Evidence Evidence used to inform the list of underlying medical conditions that increase a person's risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is presented in alphabetical order by study design section. Conditions are categorized as higher risk, suggestive higher risk, and mixed evidence. Higher Risk (conclusive) Higher risk is defined as an underlying medical condition or risk factor that has a published meta-analysis or systematic review or underwent the [CDC systematic review process](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/systematic-review-process.html). The meta-analysis or systematic review demonstrates a conclusive increase in risk for at least one severe COVID-19 outcome.

[Consider therapies, such as antivirals](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/clinical-considerations-course.html), when treating patients with mild to moderate illness and risk factors for severe illness. These therapeutics have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death, and outcomes are improved if therapeutics are started within the first days of illness. - Encourage patients to keep appointments for routine care and adhere to treatment regimens for their medical conditions. - Consider use of telehealth when appropriate. - Encourage patients with underlying medical conditions, who are able to, to continue practicing [preventive measures](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)such as wearing a high-quality mask in order to decrease the risk of infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. This becomes even more important with increasing age and number and severity of underlying conditions. - Check out [additional information for your patients](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#Actions). - EVUSHELDTM, a monoclonal antibody combination that was used for pre-exposure prophylaxis to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, is not currently authorized for emergency use in the United States because it is unlikely to be active against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. According to the most recent CDC [Nowcast data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions), these variants are projected to be responsible for more than 90% of current infections in the U.S. This means that EVUSHELDTM is not expected to provide protection against developing COVID-19 if exposed to those variants. Healthcare facilities and providers with EVUSHELDTM should retain all products in the event that SARS-CoV-2 variants that are neutralized by EVUSHELDTM become more prevalent in the U.S. in the future. For more information, see [FDA's announcement](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-evusheld-not-currently-authorized-emergency-use-us). Considerations for Patients Within Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups - Ask patients about their concerns about vaccines and therapy. Consider using an evidence-based and culturally sensitive approach, such as [motivational interviewing](/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/engaging-patients.html). Try to provide trusted sources of information and other resources. - Encourage testing, as well as [early treatment](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/), for patients who are eligible. - Facilitate access to culturally and linguistically appropriate resources. - Reduce barriers to accessing current outpatient treatments. CDC strongly encourages healthcare professionals, patients and their advocates, and health system administrators to regularly consult the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/management/clinical-management/hospitalized-adults--therapeutic-management/). Key Findings from One Large Cross-Sectional Study Underlying Medical Conditions and Severe Illness Among 540,667 Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19, March 2020-March 2021 This [study](/pcd/issues/2021/21_0123.htm) used data from the Premier Healthcare Database, which represents approximately 20% of all inpatient admissions in the United States since 2000. This cross-sectional study of 540,667 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 included both inpatients and hospital-based outpatients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021. The database included reports from 592 acute care hospitals in the United States. The study was designed to examine risk factors associated with severe outcomes of COVID-19 including admission to an ICU or stepdown unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. Main Findings: - Certain underlying medical conditions were associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness in adults. - Having multiple conditions was also associated with severe COVID-19 illness. - Obesity, diabetes with complications, and anxiety and fear-related disorders had the strongest association with death. - The number of frequent underlying medical conditions (present in 10.0% of patients) increased with age.207 Adapted from Sources: - Kompaniyets L, Pennington AF, Goodman AB, Rosenblum HG, Belay B, Ko JY, et al.
