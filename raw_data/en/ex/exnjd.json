How they regulated their lands? Or what they used to eat? Etc. One of the aspects that many people are curious about is the old-world medicine, how ancient people dealt with illnesses and how they treated their patients? As for the American civilization, the most recorded advanced medicine was in the Aztec's empire. The Aztec's Empire was the most powerful Mesoamerican kingdom of old ages. In fact, their culture was full of creativity with a combination of methodology and religious tradition. They arrived in the Valley of Mexico in 1325C.E, and their name means Aztlan people, where they were originally from. In fact, The Elizabethan time period was from 1558 through 1603 known as the Renaissance. During the Renaissance there was not any running water, so people would have to throw their waste in the streets. With people's waste in the street came many illnesses including The Plague. Even a minor scrap could kill you in the next minute. When people got sick they needed medicine, physicians, and health care. In the late 1500 there was not a great deal medican, there was mostly just spiritual analysis. Prevention in Shakespeare's time was not understood by people of that time. There was no thought process of how to or that you could prevent getting sick. People would dump waste and use the bathroom in the river. Then they would almost always use the same water to wash and cook (Prezi: Herman and Hashi). They would use water that was full of bacteria Muslims the people of Islam, have inherited of their culture from Greece, Rome, and India, as well as from those that they have conquered. The Muslims have great tolerance for those that they conquered and because of this they were able to advance scholarship to its highest level, in several areas. As a result of this, the achievements that the Muslims have achieved stand out, and have a long lasting impact on the cultures of our world today. Galen was one of the most famous and well known ancient physicians who was also a philosopher, even though most of his philosophical writing is lost. Although, his philosophical interest also showed in his biological science works. Galen made famous anatomical observation in most of which was primates. Galen was very well-read and combined his works with very interesting techniques in observing practices to put more of light into teaching medicine. He often combines his observations with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. His role as one of the prominent and famous physicians in the medical world lasted for about one thousand years and he changed the way medicine was seen forever. Galen really observed and saw there is a method of difference Andreas Vesalius, the father of modern anatomy was born in Brussels in 1514 and died in 1564. Throughout his life of 49 years, Vesalius challenged medical theories with a thirst for learning and discovery. Born into a wealthy family with his father as a pharmacist at the court of Margret of Austria, he received a privileged education from six years old. In 1537, Vesalius gained his doctorate and became a professor of Surgery and Anatomy at the University of Padua. He valued lifelong learning which contributed to his revolutionary works and methods demonstrating the spirit of a Renaissance man. He also used his intelligence to gain understanding across many different areas such as art. Vesalius' family background, universal \"Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they know nothing.\" - Voltaire During the Renaissance health and medicine changed considerably . There were many important changes to the understanding of anatomy and surgery. Important doctors and surgeons discovered different ways of understanding to body and different ways of operating. For example how Vesalius in the 15th century dissected the human body to learn more about anatomy. During this essay I will investigate how far health and medicine improved during the Renaissance by focusing on anatomy and surgery. The Ancient Egyptians thought that cleaning the body was the way to get rid of the illness. they thought praying to the gods would help They would mostly pray to Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, curses, and threats. Hippocrates was an Ancient Greek physician. He is commonly regarded as one of the most outstanding figures in medicine of all time and has been called the father of medicine. He was given this name because he introduced the naturalistic concept of disease. Hippocrates was the one who introduced that you got sick because your organs aeren't working properly, no spirits, no curses, no angry Gods have any link with that. He helped to improve patient's health and also he helped improve medical knowledge. Many of Hippocrates ideas and experimental knowledge was followed for centuries after his death. He also gave the world the Hippocratic Oath, which provided physicians of that time as well as physicians today with a code of ethics. Back in the early 5th/4th c. BCE the Ancient Greeks were not blessed with the technology and information we have today. They are the reason we have so much of what we have because they can be looked at the original foundation that we evolved to the technology we have now. Looking back they were in charge of their own destiny by having to figure everything out by themselves and one the most difficult areas to have a strong hold on was the way diseases work as well as medicine. Some Greeks believed that the gods gave the powers of healing while others believed it was in nature. For example, some Greeks believed that climate and the weather had an effect on the human body. This is where people started to turn to seasons as a way to categorize A: It is very difficult to find a balance between family life and your work life. Even though it is difficult, it is vital that one does. Today, technology is the most relied on resource that people use. During the renaissance, medical technology was not very advanced, but advancements were still made. For example, the first \"modern\" physicians began to develop, studying physics and astronomy. The first disease to spread among thousands of people was syphilis. It spread from sailors from Columbus's first voyage to Spanish soldiers to French troops. The research into the human anatomy began during this period, which led to several medical misconceptions. The Canon of Medicine is an encyclopedia of five volumes revolving around the topic of medicine, which was completed in 1025. The Canon consisted of all medical knowledge up until that time. However, he also combined his own medical observation that had never been documented before. The Canon was originally written in Arabic, however it was then translated to a series of languages including Persia, English, Chinese, Latin and Hebrew. These translations had further added to its exposure, resulting in it being accepted and distributed in both Europe and the Middle East. Eventually, it became the medical authority for centuries and was used as a textbook in many prestigious universities and became a widespread medical piece in the east and west.
