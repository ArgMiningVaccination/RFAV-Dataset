Beauty sleep is real, and the best products for maximizing lifegiving rest and relaxation seek to restore a balance knocked off-kilter in 2022. Of course, the relationship between how you sleep and how you look or feel isn't a new concept, especially in media. I vividly recall a Y2K-era Oprah episode where youthful-looking guests strutted down a catwalk as Oprah Winfrey announced their true ages to the sound of cheers, gasps, and applause. A secret revealed by one fresh-faced woman? She faithfully slept on her back every night\u2014a habit that apparently minimizes the opportunity for pillow-creased cheeks come morning. The search for deeper rest gets similar air time. Comedian Joe Pera has been intentionally [lulling his audience into cozy slumber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSUilYKcRMA) for years to such success that HBO Max added his [animated short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trfHP5LHVNY), Joe Pera Talks You to Sleep, to its [catalog](https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXup_aQMBwgq_tgEAAAGp). On Netflix, [Headspace: Unwind Your Mind](https://www.netflix.com/title/81328829) is a choose-your-own-adventure dreamquest, where one can sink into meditative seaside sounds, or take a scenic train ride to dial down the day. According to doctor of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine Sandra Subotich, DOAM, sleep issues are on the rise for a multitude of reasons. As the director of Eastern medicine at [Bi\u00e2n](https://www.livebian.com/), a luxury wellness center in Chicago that mirrors the attentiveness of members'-only clubs, Subotich sees firsthand that sleep hygiene (that is, the practice of setting yourself up for optimal sleep) deserves more education. \"We have created a society that not only functions in a constant state of stress but also rewards this behavior under the guise of 'hard work' and 'success,'\" she says. \"Couple this with limitless exposure to information and the endless turmoil of the world, and you have a perfect recipe for sleep issues.\" Subotich recognizes that unchecked stress levels make it harder to physically reboot. \"From an Eastern perspective, nighttime is when we rest, digest, and sleep,\" she says of the time when certain organs take a break while others clear out toxins. Closer to the surface, research shows the rate of skin renewal doubles, collagen production accelerates, and cell damage actually reverses while you sleep, according to Blair Murphy-Rose, M.D., a dermatologist at the [Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York](https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/). Since transepidermal water loss (the escape of moisture through the skin barrier) is heightened during sleep, maintaining hydration with products does matter. \"It is so common for people to neglect to moisturize their skin,\" Murphy-Rose says. There's also a cascade of downsides to disrupted rest, affecting everything from mood and cognitive performance to skin flare-ups. \"Lack of sleep increases production of the stress hormone cortisol, which has a negative effect on skin, decreases skin rejuvenation, and worsens inflammatory conditions and acne,\" Murphy-Rose warns. Subotich also suggests refraining from eating three hours before bedtime, to power down the digestive system. Ideally, she says, one would be dreaming by 11 p.m. and clocking a minimum of seven hours to function optimally. Here, 16 tools that seize every opportunity to maximize your sleep\u2014and minimize your stress. After-Hours Skin and Hair Care The current vogue for overnight products makes good sense: That extended contact with the skin allows active ingredients to work uninterrupted, according to Murphy-Rose. \"For the driest skin, overnight moisturizing masks are an excellent choice,\" says the dermatologist, who looks for humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin as well as nourishing lipids to lock in moisture. Sisley's sleeping mask combines plant-based glycerin, shea, and kokum butter with saffron flower extract for a soothing cocoon, while Noble Panacea's Chronobiology mask has a slow-release system that delivers exfoliating polyhydroxy acid in its first \"detox\" stage, retinol in its \"repair\" stage, and hyaluronic acid in its final \"nourish\" stage. It's worth noting that vitamin A derivatives like retinol perform better in the dark. \"Many ingredients in the retinol family are deactivated by sunlight,\" Murphy-Rose explains, pointing out such benefits as stimulated collagen production and increased cell turnover. Subotich believes topical magnesium to be a simple sleep aid, and Neom Organics infuses it into a bedtime body butter scented with lavender and sweet basil. And for hair, an overnight [oil treatment](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2022/01/best-hair-oils-scalp-care-healthy-ends) can be a sleeper secret for healthy maintenance\u2014especially for fine-hair types that need a post-treatment rinse in order to enjoy any level of body or bounce. Mindfulness Upgrades Many agree that screens are best kept at a distance after hours. \"Research has shown that EMFs [electromagnetic fields] from cell phone exposure alter sleeping brain activity by increasing the frequency of brain waves during non-REM sleep,\" says Subotich. \"Switching to an alarm clock and ideally keeping the cell phone out of the bedroom greatly reduces that exposure and the unwanted effects it can have on our brain function.\" Loftie's alarm clock offers a stylish upgrade with bonus breathwork and sound bath content, and Pursoma's Digital Detox bath salts hint at an old-school solution, too. \"A hot bath can absolutely contribute to a deeper rest by providing relaxation to tired muscles at the end of the day,\" says Subotich, who encourages infusing water with essential oils for a multisensory experience. And if a tub isn't near, an essential oil diffuser is a worthwhile substitute. \"Diffusing calming essential oils, such as lavender, chamomile, or ylang ylang, can be enough to soothe your body and relax your mind for a restful night's sleep,\" she says. Vitruvi's Move diffuser operates cordlessly for clean lines, and its [Sleep](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/vitruvi-sleep-essential-oil-blend) blend of oils mixes that prescribed trio of notes with frankincense. Finally, consider giving the ears some attention. \"In traditional Chinese medicine, the ear is a microcosm of the entire body,\" says Subotich, who suggests a targeted massage to relax the whole. Vie Healing takes the ritual a step further with its ear seeding kit, which uses small gold magnetic beads to stimulate key pressure points. Bedroom Essentials The way your room looks and feels matters. \"Messy bed, messy head,\" says Subotich of maintaining a streamlined environment, and dermatologists lend extra credence to the sleek, silky bedding movement. \"Skin and hair slides easily over silk fabrics, reducing the friction and pulling that can cause skin irritation and creases, plus hair breakage and frizziness,\" says Murphy-Rose. \"If you are a side or stomach sleeper and wake up with creases on your face, silk may help to reduce the problem.\" LilySilk's pillowcase mixes a minty scent with antibacterial powers, while Slip's silk turban is an easy hair wrap for nighttime protection. Subotich likes sleep masks for their light-blocking abilities, and CurrentBody's silicone-enhanced version is designed to help ease expression lines and provide a soothing level of pressure. That snug feeling, which you can expect from Bearaby's Cotton Napper weighted blanket, has a multitude of sleep-related benefits. \"Weighted blankets work by utilizing what's known as deep pressure stimulation, and are meant to mimic the experience of being hugged or held,\" says Subotich. \"Studies suggest weighted blankets can help reduce anxiety by modulating autonomic nervous system arousal\u2014the part of the nervous system responsible for increased heart and breathing rates.\" Sleep Aids Before considering what to take internally, it may be worth dispelling the long-held belief that a nip of alcohol before bed can serve as a friendly nightcap. \"Alcohol intake can reduce the quality of sleep,\" cautions Murphy-Rose. Instead, \"an over-the-counter melatonin supplement taken at night before bedtime can improve sleep quality for many,\" says the dermatologist, who suggests checking with a physician before starting any supplement routines. Subotich also recommends seeing a specialist for an herbal prescription and offers an at-home botanical guide. \"Some helpful herbs, either as a tea or in tincture form, include valerian root, jujube, skullcap, chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower,\" says the Eastern medicine expert; she agrees that melatonin can be useful when appropriate and calls ingestible magnesium \"extremely beneficial.\" Hum Nutrition offers melatonin and magnesium in capsule form, and The Nue Co.'s Sleep Drops and Sakara Sleep Tea both combine valerian root and passionflower with, surprisingly, catnip to encourage the body to fall and stay asleep. And if sneaking ingredients into a snack works best (in the spirit of cat treats!), Asystem's melatonin-free gummies infuse saffron and chamomile into a vegan, wild-berry-flavored blast for blissful slumber. \u2014 See All the [Red-Carpet Fashion From the 2022 Oscars](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2022/03/oscars-2022-red-carpet-fashion-see-all-the-outfits-and-looks?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) \u2014 Inside Vanity Fair's [Oscar After-Party](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/vanity-fair-oscar-party-report?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) \u2014 The Life and Confessions of [Mob David Ruggerio](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/the-life-and-confessions-of-mob-chef-david-ruggerio?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) \u2014 \u2014 First](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/prince-andrew-queen-prince-philip-memorial?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) With the Queen \u2014 [All of the Looks](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2022/03?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) From the Vanity Fair Oscar Party \u2014 Inside the [Frenzied World of Rare Watches](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/inside-the-frenzied-world-of-rare-watches?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) and the Rich People Who Love Them \u2014 Mark Seliger's Vanity Fair [Oscar Party Portraits](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2022/03/seliger-oscar-party-portrait-studio-2022?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) \u2014 15 Best Hyaluronic Acid Serums Hydrated \u2014 From the Archive: [Sarma Melngailis, the Runaway Vegan](https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2016/12/the-runaway-vegan?itm_content=footer-recirc&itm_campaign=more-great-stories-040122) \u2014 Sign up for \" [The Buyline](https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletter/buyline)\" to receive a curated list of fashion, books, and beauty buys in one weekly newsletter.
