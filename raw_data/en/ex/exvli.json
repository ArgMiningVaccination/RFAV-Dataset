A growing number of North Texans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine since the shots were approved, and more residents are becoming eligible for their second doses with each passing week. With the approval of a third, single-dose shot manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, vaccination efforts are ramping up throughout the region as hundreds of thousands line up for the potentially live-saving shots. The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were approved and ready for the public with unprecedented speed, and questions remain about the short- and long-term effects of inoculation. Here's what people can expect after getting vaccinated. Will there be any side effects? Like most vaccines, the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots may cause mild side effects, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). The most common side effects are pain, swelling and redness in the arm where the dose was received. People also may experience fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. In clinical trials of all three vaccines, mild to moderate side effects within a week of vaccination were common, the CDC says. Most side effects, however, usually occur within a day or two and go away in a few days. With the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the CDC says side effects throughout the body, which may feel like flu symptoms, were more common after the second dose. With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, side effects were more common in patients aged 18 to 59 than they were in patients 60 and older, according to the CDC. To reduce soreness in the arm where the vaccine was administered, the CDC recommends applying a cold, wet washcloth to the area and using and exercising the arm. Drinking plenty of fluids and wearing lightweight clothing can reduce the discomfort of fever or flu-like symptoms. If soreness in the arm increases after 24 hours, people should call their health care providers, the CDC says. [What you need to know about coronavirus](/news/public-health/2020/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/) What about serious side effects? The Food and Drug Administration says that there is a \"remote\" chance of serious side effects with the [Moderna](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download), [Pfizer](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) and [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download) vaccines. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, rapid heartbeat, rashes, dizziness and weakness, according to the FDA. A serious allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to a few hours after vaccination, which is why health care providers monitor patients for a few minutes after they receive shots. Health experts say serious side effects from the vaccine are rare. Of more than 4 million first doses of the Moderna shot given between Dec. 21 and Jan. 10, only 1,266 serious side effects were reported, or about 0.03% of all people who received a first dose during that time, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e1.htm?s_cid=mm7004e1_w). Of more than 1.8 million first doses of the Pfizer shot administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, only 4,393 serious side effects were reported, or about 0.2% of all people who received a first dose during that time, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm?s_cid=mm7002e1_w). In a study of more than 3,300 people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 0.4% reported serious side effects, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/reactogenicity). The CDC recommends people call their health care providers if they experience any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, or if their symptoms do not go away on their own after a few days. For two-dose vaccines, do people have any protection after the first shot? People will have some protection after their first shot of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Preliminary data showed that the [Moderna shot](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) was 80.2% effective after one dose, while the [Pfizer vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) was 52.4% effective after the first dose. However, patients were followed only for a short period, so longer-term immunity after one dose is not known. When will I be fully protected from COVID-19? The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are all significantly effective at preventing COVID-19. But immunity doesn't happen right away. Vaccines work by teaching the immune system how to respond to a virus, and it takes a while for the body to learn the response. People have to receive two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines a few weeks apart to build immunity. For the Moderna vaccine, the second dose is administered 28 days after the first. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine comes 21 days after the first. It's important to get the second dose as close to the correct time as possible, but people can still be protected if they get their second dose up to six weeks later with both vaccines, [the CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html). The Johnson & Johnson vaccine only requires one dose, but it still takes the body time to build immunity. For all vaccines, the period of time it takes someone to build full immunity varies, but health experts say it typically happens up to two weeks after vaccination. Can I still get COVID-19 if I'm fully vaccinated? It's possible that someone could test positive for the virus even if they are fully vaccinated, [health experts say](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/health/covid-vaccinated-infected-wellness/index.html). No vaccine is perfectly effective. Each of the approved vaccines has [varying levels of effectiveness](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/03/03/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-all-the-available-covid-19-vaccines/), and since no vaccine is 100% effective, it's possible some people could be fully vaccinated and still get infected. As more people become vaccinated, that will become more unlikely, health experts say. It's also possible someone could become infected with the virus before they get their first or second dose and test positive after vaccination. Can I spread COVID-19 if I'm fully vaccinated? It's clear that the COVID-19 vaccines help protect patients against serious illness, health experts say. But researchers are still collecting data on whether someone can spread the virus after being fully vaccinated. The initial trials of the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines focused on how many people developed symptoms of the virus, but not on how the vaccine protects people with an asymptomatic infection. That means it's possible that a vaccinated person could encounter the virus and have enough of it in their body to spread it to others without developing symptoms themselves, health experts say. How often will I have to get the COVID-19 vaccine? It's not known how long immunity lasts after someone is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. It could end up being a yearly vaccine, like the influenza shot, or it could require a booster dose every few years. More research is needed to know for sure, health experts say. Do I still have to wear a mask and social distance after I'm fully vaccinated? According to [guidance released by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) in early March, fully vaccinated people can visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without masks or social distancing. They can also visit with unvaccinated people from a single home who are at a low risk for severe COVID-19 disease without masks or social distancing. Fully vaccinated people also don't have to quarantine or get a COVID-19 test after they are exposed to someone who is positive if they don't experience symptoms of the virus, the CDC says. Beyond those guidelines, vaccinated individuals should still continue to act as though they are not fully immune around those who are not vaccinated, health experts say. Because little is known about whether vaccinated people can spread the virus to others and because the vaccine is not 100% effective, it's important to continue following public health guidelines such as social distancing, avoiding large crowds and mask wearing, health experts say. It's also probably going to take some time before enough of the population is vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, a term that means enough people have immunity to significantly decrease the likelihood of infection in a community. The CDC said it's not yet known what portion of people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, as the rate varies by disease. As long as a large portion of the population isn't vaccinated, it's important for people to continue to take steps to protect themselves and others from the virus, health experts say. "}
