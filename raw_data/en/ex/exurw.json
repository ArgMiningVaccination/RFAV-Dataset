Not just parents, of course. This applies especially to the early years where childhood is arguably at its most vulnerable. This is a bold claim. It would entail many more people delving into the meaning of childhood in the context of human existence than do at present; for as we stand, many of us drift into parenthood, despite the 'advances' in family planning. The 'family plan' of Steiner Education for the turn of the millennium was rst to celebrate the eighty years of Waldorf to date (1919-1999), and afterwards take a look ahead. Well we did celebrate. We focused on what is very high on the list of the most representative and representational of Waldorf achievements- colour. Both numbers last year (vol. 33 nos. 1 & 2) were devoted to this. With the rst number of the millennium. Facing the Future^ we directed the Janus gaze of educationto the broad issues of the day. These included local themes (e.g. the plans for converting a very rectilinear building rom Soviet times in Riga, Latvia into a welcoming home for Waldorf), national themes (e.g. the scheme in Denmark, to which Waldorf successfully subscribes, for counselling youths at the top end of the school to help them intensify their conunitment to further education) and themes of the Zeitgeist (e.g. the necessity of giving people, where possible during their childhood, a world outlook that has at its heart 'something to live for'-well described and awe- inspiringly exemplied in the life and work of Viktor Frankl who evolved logotherapy as a way of treating those neuroses of our time which result from the vacuum in the soul that results if that 'heart' is not throbbing with sufcient vitality). In facing the future, the plight of 'humanity in its infancy' (childhood) is naturally that which tugs most at the heart-strings of the educationist. In the present issue of Steiner Education, several writers from various walks of educational life, join to chorus their current concerns; a publisher with a background in higher education who has received acclaim for his extensive research into the deleterious effects of TV-watching in childhood; aSwiss-based medical doctor whose special interest in, and impressive work for , child health provides us with both an illustrious precedent and good, sound advice; a psychotherapist, urgently alerting us to save the present generation from plunging lemming-like down the cliffs of premature learning, with all the anxieties and tensions that inevitably ensue and frequently dog children throughout their later adult lives; a knight errant for childhood, who globe-canters the early yearsworld, lifting on high her pennon of insight, care, tact and clarity; a 'practitioner' (alias Kindergarten teacher!) who brings us the inside story, the real atmosphere of the Kindergarten in all its fragile tangibility, amber-precious fly-on-the-wall anecdotes, the sound of the child herself fantasy- fresh and crystal-sparkling, as well as her own voice of experience in which courage, love and admonishment mingle harmoniously. And there are other contributors. With his 'Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore' ('Six characters in search of an author'), Pirandello (1867-1921), the Italian playwright and instigator of innovative ideas for the theatre, hit upon a title that might arguably be called the archetypal title (Urtitel, with apologies to Goethe) for dl plays. First it must happen that the plot take place and unfold in the playwright's mind, eventually becoming script; it then embodies and 'dresses' itself in characters; a production is proposed; it attracts actors who sign contracts; they rehearse, speaking and acting and vying with the producer-and there you have it: the box ofce opens, the rst night glitters, and the actors startbathing in the limelight as bouquets pour in! On the world stage-whose brand new millennium curtain is well on its way up-the greatest drama is that of childhood (though, to our shame, it manifestly doesn't grip the screen-held millions as did the bombing of Kosovo). All children in the world are characters in the drama. And like all drama, it too oscillates between joy and tragedy. But unlike Pirandello's initidly forlorn little troupe, these characters have attracted a whole host of gifted and vociferous authors. Titles such as 'Endangered Minds', 'The Disappearance of Childhood', 'The End of Education', 'The End of Evolution', speak for themselves. An impressive list of such publications could be compiled from just thereferences in the articles of this one issue of Steiner Education. Look up the bibliographical references and further reading provided by the authors here and you already have a formidable library-and a considerable indictment of much that goes under the heading of education. However , Pirandello or Shakespeare or any dramatist on a forgotten library shelf is an endangered species-at least a contradiction. Whatthe theatre of childhood lacks-if it is going toescape becoming a museum for an endangered species-is not actors, authors or entrepreneurs: it lacks patrons. Whether we drift into parenthood or not, we might still ask: does the intention of becoming a patron of childhood, allied to other patrons, feature as part of our family plan? Administration is, of course, equally implicated- right from local governance up to ministry level. The want of patronage of childhood is forcing its characters, the children of the world, into 'careers' that lead to gangsterism, drug addiction, child prostitution, teenage abortions, exam- treadmillism and other -tions and -isms which Back Numbers of 'Steiner Education' and (as formerly) 'Child and Man' Price \u00a32.00 (post free in the UK) from the Secretary, Steiner Education, The Sprig, AshdownRoad, Forest Row, RH185BN Vol. 33 No.2 Colour Stories Vol. 33 No. 1 Colour Vol. 32 No.2 Literacy Vol. 32 No. 1 Movement Vol. 31 No.2 Ethics Vol. 31 No.l Imagination Vol. 3o No.2 Language Vol. 29 No.l Gender Vol. 27 No.l Festivals Vol. 26 No.2 Europe Vol. 26No.l Money Vol. 24 No.2 Teeth Vol. 23 No.2Twelvefoldness Vol. 22 No.2 Non-Denominational Religion The January 2000 Issue: Vol. 34 No. 1. is still available to new subscribers.cause society to be riven with ever deeper concern; and which read as symptoms of some drastic malaise in modem life. Of course, one could argue that, just as the mountains must have their climbers, gliders their pilots and the high seas their sailors, so the screen must have its viewers, the exam syllabi must have their candidates, computer games must have their players, league tables must have their competitors, Santa Claus stockings must have their llers and their emptiers, the whole brave new world of e-commerce must have its e-customers with their e-bank accounts, the gun lobby must have its rights, missiles must have their military targets...The arguments for all the foregoing are powerful. At the same time, we must surely provide, vigorously cherish, eamestly value, painstakinglyvalidate and generously invest in 'space'-protected space, in more than one sense, it may need to be-where children may have-playing it out healthily to the fuW-their childhood. Acknowledgement Steiner Education wishes to thank Sally Jenkinson, the SWSF's Early Years representative in the UKand Ireland for her co-operation in this production.The identifying of the urgent need for an issue on the present theme, so soon after the Steiner Education Monograph on the Early Years convinced the Editorial Board to take up the issue again in preference to other themes which are in the pipe line. The Board is also grateful to those contributors who responded so generously to the theme, despite their extremely busy schedules. With deep concem being expressed for childhood at risk in all quarters of society-rom the upper echelons of academia, to parent bodies, to key gures across the political spectrum-gratitude is due those who are indefatigably at work in Kindergartens and in liaison with ofcialdom to bring focus of educational thought sharply andpenetratingly on the need for care in the Early Y ears.

The saddest of those times was When I left school I wanted to go into publishing in Class 2 when our class teacher Mrs Querido died although I was only vaguely aware of what this after asthma and heart problems-we were seven meant. I liked writing and literature but wasn't years old. While the rest of the school went to pushy enough to be a journalist. So I went to the assembly , our class sat quietly and painted angels; London College of Printing which had a very goodand for another term I expected her to be there every reputation for all aspects of communications.

Hall instilled condence: we, as a class and as I graduated in 1997-the job market was 4booming-and was offered a job at Greenaway Harrisons, a top city and commercial printers, as a graduate trainee. This involved working in various departments within the company . In the production division I liaised with typesetting, the machine minders and nishers, to produce the work on time and to specication. In the sales area I had meetings with company secretaries and nancial directors of PLCs, handling their Report & Accounts, and in the studio subsidiary I worked alongside the designers and art workers producing concepts for clients. I stayed at Greenaway Harrisons for three years and gained a lot of valuable print knowledge, but bythe turn of the decade I'd had enough of nancial print and of living in London and went to America with Nick. We travelled to many different parts of the country and had a ball. 1992 was a big year for us: we got married and moved back to Forest Row. Nick did a degree and then started a PhD in mechanical engineering; we bought a house and I went to work for an advertising agency in Tunbridge Wells. This was in the production department, buying in print and producing brochures for a variety of clients. Without going too much further into my job history, I have stayed in this eld ever since. I spent a further two years in a London agency setting up a production department in-house, before moving back to Tunbridge Wells to head up production there, overseeing print suppliers, and handling advertising campaigns. It was a good job and I was respected for what I did, but last year ail that changed... I became pregnant. At rst the company seemed pleased and c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s w e r e i n o r d e r, b u t t h e y understandably appeared less happy when I wassigned off work for over a month with hyperemesis (a severe form of moming sickness). )^^en I came back at ve months pregnant I carried on doing the long hours and driving to different parts of the country to pass jobs on press. I think it f^ly telling that the last time I was ill was the day I left work three weeks before the baby was due. Holly was bom in June 1999 and changed everything. Work seemed a lifetime away and my whole perspective on what was important changed.I did however feel I would like to go back to work part-time when she was older but matermty laws being what they are in this country I had to retum within 29 weeks or lose my job. Sol went back when my baby was ve months old and still so dependent on her mother. But it tore my heart out. I put a proposal to the company whereby I could work a 3-day week andrestructure the department so it did not cost themmoney. This was met by a flat 'no'. I think there is still an attitude in many companies that working mothers should deny they have a home life in order to be any good at their job. My mother was at home when I was small. It made me feel secure even if I was at the other end of the house. I was educated in a gentle environment, and had little cause for anxiety. What more could youwant for your child in her early developmental years? I didn't want to be a weekend parent yet I needed to work for nancial reasons. The options looked bleak. I needed a third way. This is how 'White Rabbit' came into being. It stands for good luck, and magic-pulling the impossible out of the hat. It took condence (which started through school), encouragement from my husband, and inspiration from my daughter-I needed to do this for her. White Rabbit Advertising Support Ltd was set up just a few weeks ago by myself and a business partner so that we could work and be answerable to ourselves only. We handle projects through from design, artwork and print, as well as advertising campaigns in the national press. Although it means long hours, they're at a time to suit Holly. I work three days a week and if necessary from home when she is asleep, or in the evenings. On the days I work she is cared for altematively by my husband and my sister-in-law. Like all parents I want to do what's best for my child and, like most parents, guilt plays a large part in my emotions. I love my daughter dearly and Iwant her childhood to be as peaceful as mine. Continuity and a belief in her own abilities will see her through, just as it did me. The drawings-after Breugel-here and on pp.6-7 are by Anna Nmhofer(see accompanying article). 5Wanted: Pied Piper 2000 Happiness, hygiene and health in the Early Y ears by BRIEN MASTERS A mere six years separated Pieter Breugel the Elder's painting of Children at Play (1560) from his taking brush in hand before the canvas that was to depict so unreservedly the Massacre of the Innocents. The scene of his Children at Play has become familiar today through numerous reproductions. It shows upwards of 200 children in a Flemish street intersection playing some 80 games. Breugel's jubilant celebration of childhood displays movement, uninhibited gesticulation, abundant joy, vigour and daring, group activity, vehement participation, and sheer fun-spurred fantasy. Thepainter places the viewer at an extraordinarily high vantage point from which we have a breathtaking and unimpeded view of the dozens and dozens and dozens of children's limbs, each with a gesture characteristic of the game in which the child is involved and, to a slightly lesser extent, of the strong emotional life that is sparked by the particular moment we are witnessing in the game underway. Rough and tumble there is in plenty, but no detectable bullying or latent gangsterism. Most of the children are in groups in which social interaction appears to flow and gel as readily as quicksilver in a shallow saucer. The amount of detail packed into the relatively small framework is astonishing. Arguably, there is pedagogical comment too. For example, the three versions of'Follow m' Leader' shown towards the end of the main street make a fascinating study, from a Waldorf point of view, of the three seven-year phases of childhood. Comparatively speaking, the younger ones are the most outwardly adventurous. The middle school group are holding onto belts and hems of skirts while following their leader in rhythmical fashion, who surges and swings this way and that, as the fancy takes him. The adolescents areinvolved in a complicated manoeuvre called 'The four sons of Aimon and the horse Bayard' which was a popular game at the time, in which 'Aimon the leader' performed challenging and intricate actions which all 'four sons' would then have to copy, causing considerable adjusting, negotiating and jostling, bustled together as they were and straddled over a long pole-a more mind-riveting and controlled version of the game that they had played with such total freedom in their early years. There is one adult in the picture: a woman who empties a bucket of slops from a rst floorwindow into the street. Her gaze does not fall on a single child! If there ever was a place- a KindergartenUtopia@play.com-in Browning's world network, to which his Pied Piper led the children of rat-infested Hamelin, this could assuredly be it! Here, though it would be easy to get anachronistically paranoiac, let us skim over the glaring absence of supervision, trafc, and safety regulations, with probably atrociously minimal hygiene by today's standards: the message that clarions towards the viewer, louder even than the chorus of jubilant and excited children's voices, is resilient health, abounding soul hygiene, and effervescent child happiness. Health, hygiene and happiness. -Were these the 'three Hs' that Blake had at the back of his prophetic mind when he ended his deceptively childlike 'Laughing Song' so inimitably? Come sing and be merry and join with me T o sing the sweet chorus of Ha, Ha, He'. Breugel's masterpiece presents us with a real shop window onto a civilisation that literally gave space to childhood. To lament the disappearance of that space without further ado would be tantamount to wishing to annihilate New York, Frankfurt,Johannesburg and a colossal chunk of the mechanised world. Apart from the absurdity, it would not in itself lead to identifying where the massacre of today's innocents is taking place. NeilPostman (1994), in his The Disappearance of Childhood took some of the rst courageous steps in that process of identication. Following in his footsteps, educationists would now do well toexamine what constitutes innocence-not in the romantic sense used in some schools of educational thought, but as a general metaphor of childhood. The so-called cultural scene today, that encroaches on childhood so perniciously, results from an intersection in which one street is awash with the slops of indiscreetly aggressive commerce (in his recent publication. The End of Education, undeflected and still hot on the same trail, Postman (1996) observes that between the ages of as young as three and eighteen, a child will have been bombarded with 500,000 commercials!); and the other street with aspects of hi-tec that have stilled the limbs of childhood with potentially dangerous implications for the rest of the human constitution. It would be a major research undertaking to quantify the 'accident rate' and the 'death toll' of this intersection. There can be a sting in the tail too, even where, on the face of it, things might look as though they are improving. As Professor Jonathan Gershuny put it, commenting on his research sponsored by the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex (March 2000): \"Children have lost their licence to roam.\" Statistics showing a slight increase in the amount of 'quality time' parents spent with their children revealed that much of it was because of \"increased pressures at school\" and because it was j ust too dangerous for children to be out on their own, contrasting strongly with former times when children spent time in gangs playing and \"walking to school on [their] own\". There are educational factors encroaching on childhood, too, of course. To remonstrate about those Flemish children being abandoned by the adult world would essentially miss the point. Flanders clearly gavespace to the ebullient innocence of childhood. We, by contrast, have largely banished children from the realm of open spaces, as well as shackling their fantasy with the passivity of sitting before various screens and by manufacturing for their sole use the unyielding plastic of the 'nished' toy. And: shackle a child's fantasy and you render him immobile-always with those important exceptionssuch as the 'toy' machine-gun etc. Not that j^!I^ it will be easy for parents who want to re- r f a s h i o n h o m e l i f e o n e n l i g h t e n e d r e s e a r c h .But there are always intermediate steps, as Kate Kellaway amusingly points out {The Observer 19 December 1999)-her inspiration being research from Munich which showed that children \"do best without any conventional toys... Leavethem with empty boxes, wrapping paper, string and imagination and they'll develop faster\" [my emphasis]. Her son used the baguette she had given him to carry back home from the shops, to help full his military fantasies: \"[T]he baguette, sadly doubled up in the middle, didn't look too clever by lunch time.\" Admittedly, there is a certain degree of safety connected with TV watching or playing video games. The child is not going to get bruised and scratched by the rough and tumble of peers, nor lured by paedophiles lurking on the streets or in public parks, nor endure life-long suffering as a result of sexual abuse. These are severe warning lights whose disco-like pounding no-one can ignore. But they certainly do not represent the only dangers to childhood. Nor is it enough for critics of the over exposure of children to media-and here the outcry has reached an ear-dmmming crescendo over the last decade-to point only to the quality of programme (e.g. the inordinate number of acts of violence) as unsuitable. Despite all the Los Angeles gangsterism to which Barry Sanders (1995) draws our attention in his powerful study A isfor Ox, and the lesser and mini versions of gangsterism across the globe with all the disturbing scenarios to which it leads, research is now showing that there is an even more serious side to the matter than the content of what is being viewed. As a result of the physiologically-seated faculties being unexercised (balance, movement, touch, the sense of well-being), the cheated soul seeks recompense in questionable outlets later in life. Moreover, with the soul isolated, desensitised and constantly exposed to 'the virtual', social barriers are compounded that keep psychotherapists and arms dealers alike in business. Thus, even the meekest documentary showing lambs isking in spring, say, has negative developmental implications if one investigates the resultant neuro-psychology. The highwayman of past, seemingly less merciful ages, who ended up swinging on the gallows was-we may take it-at least a whole human being, who conceivably might have come within a noose of repentance, had he been given the chance, and might therefore have been some benet to society other 67than bniial entenainmem for a bloodthirsty mob and nourishment for the crows. Current neurologicalresearch (Chilion Pearce. 1992: Aim and Scheynius. 1999) is discovering that the child who is insufciently active, and insufciently emotionally developed, is \"damaged\"-and the word, which might seem to border on the libellous, is used alarmingly increasingly in numerous books and articlcs-lhat is, the child results in being less than the whole human being she might otherwise have become. We are witnessing an attack on child health on a vast scale. Even with the best of intentions (e.g. where governments provide the funding for videos and computers in the Kindergaiien), in reality we are depriving children of some of their basic human needs: movement, social interaction and adult love (-love that goes beyond legislative care). The attack is producing a generation whose ability to use its mind, let alone change it (re-pent) when realising it has been conditioned through some form of totalitarianism, is impaired. The irony is that the remedy .seems so simple: restore what is being undermined; replace what is being systematically wiped out; re-pair the child w i t h i t s i n n o c e n c e ; r e s t o r e c h i l d h o o d . F i r s t recognise that formal learning in pre-school is counterproductive, as studies such as that carried out recently by The Institute of Economic and Social Research (Whitburn, 1999) and others show. Then, simply provide a creative space where children can be children-basicaily where they can play. But play-in peace. Not mentally targeted by the politically well-meaning but educationally ill- advised adult, wanting to set them on the highroad of computer literacy, markel-economy-know-how and league-table-winning-numeracy. But creative canters and sometimes gallops, with mane and tail flying, astride the creative fantasy of childhood-or that whispers in the Wendy house like the wind singing cosily in a winter chimney-not to be highwaymanned at the gun-point of formal learning (however informally dressed) that will end up by hoisting the healthy forces of childhood onto the gallows of 'name and shame', there to be pecked as ctirrion by 'performance-related pay for teachers'. Ina word, play that realises something of Schiller's widely acclaimed assertion that links play with being human in the fullest sense. Though human being continues to be tlte given, being human requiresghting for increasingly as the years slip by . This is not to blow with the bitter wind of ingratitude at what recently took place when the British Government's White Paper revealed thatthere had been a change of heart over the content of the Kindergarten day-a change which at Iea.st endorsed the admittance of play into the precincts of the 'secret garden' of the early years. This was a major step forward. But 'structure' in play-the compromise to which the Government was prepared to go was leimed \"structured play\"-must, by denition, veertowards con.stricied play. A contradiction. The real structure-if that is the right word-that play has to offer is a healthy basis for the whole of life. Thus more than a change of heart is needed. If childhood is to be restored, a signicant change of mind is needed, informed by an educational philosophy that is thought through and sufciently far reaching. We must seriously and strenuously sift through the dunes of enlightened re.search that have been piling up, rst taking our heads out of the sands of twentieth centuiy exam-driven traditionalism. As Susan Bassnett, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Warwick University, argues {The Independent 19 August 1998), surely this cannot be unattainable for third millennium intelligence. The key to that change of mind, 1 would suggest, is to be gained through activating metamorphicthinking. (-An Archimedean way of levering ourselves out of a problem that threatens to become global?) Goethe, the 150lh anniversary of whose death we have just been celebrating, claimed to have discovered through metamorphic-type obsers'ation and thinking, the essence of the plant. Bortoft's (1996) thorough investigation into Goethe's Way of Science traces the poet/scientist's pathway whereby he arrived at this experience. From that plant essence (Urpjianz) Goethe was able in his mind to create \"new plants\". One might wonder whether, had he been alive today, he would have been tempted to jump on the GMO band wagon. It would seem unlikely. His acquired capacity for plant creating does not echo through the years as a frustratedinclination to dabble in cloning. The point he precisely describes having arrived at would appear to be one of spiritual insight-spiritual insight which then poured out in a torrent of creativity, in an incessant stream of masterpieces, ever stimulating to read, ever pertinent to cite, ever inspiring to set to music, ever instructive to study, ever illuminating to ponder on, ever enriching to live with. Similarly, metamorphic thinking, based on penetrating observation, accurate research, and developed insight into the nature of the growing child, should produce a form of education in whichwe would be equipped to cater not for a population that resembles cloned-like consumers with obeseChildren active amongst light and life-an Early Years motif.

However, if we are to get at root causes and not merely tinker with peripheral symptoms, we need to delve right into the depths of human life-thai is, into the early years. The 'slops' of global warming, nuclear waste, acid rain, denuded rain forests, the next killer to strike after we have devised inoculations againstcancer and Aids, ethnic cleansing and its shoals of asylum seekers, youth crime, school killings (the most recent incident was the shooting of a six-year- old in Detroit by a classmate), drug trafcking, child prostitution etc. will no doubt continue to .spatter persistently in some form or other onto the highways of our'comfortable' lives. Without losing the sen.se of urgency that these global problems and human disasters manifestly demand, we must now re-focus our gaze onto the nature of the human being,especially-and 1 repeat-in the early years. The 'education debate' must not drift listlessly into aeuphemism for another world disaster. In face of this, twenty-rst century society could do nothing better than make health in child development one of its main concerns and aims. Thankfully, there are those, such as Patrick Bateson, Provost of Kings College, Canterbury, who are heralding the way (Bateson and Martin, 1999). Of course, it would be ludicrous to imagine that we could entice children's games backonto our street intersections to replace the carbon- monoxide, the paedophiles, the robots and police sirens that have usurped them. T o restore the health, hygiene and happiness of childhood, the ngers of the Pied Piper of 2000 will have to hit upon a new tune. But hit upon that tune we must, be it Waldorf-wise or other-wise. That is, if we have a mind to stave off the massacre of innocence, the misery of undesirable outcomes, and the smothering of laughter, serendipity, joy, felicitous fantasy, healthy growth, blossoming spirituality and the creative foundations for responsible human life, the essence of whose nature can never be surrogated.With a background of many years in Sieiner education.

Waldorf movement an unmissable opportunity to In what follows I only have space to consider take our work and values out into a public sphere several interrelated issues; rst, the proper role of which is crying out for a humane and demonstrably play in early learning, and the dangers of distorting effective alternative to the assessment-obsessed, or subverting its natural expression through adult- anxiety-driven fare on offer in the state sector . One centric intrusion; second, the distorting effects of way of doing this is to take every opportunity to anxiety on healthy learning; and third, the write to the press whenever we see an opportunity to developmental dangers entailed in premature or challenge current conventional'wisdom'and set out 'precocious' intellectual or ego development. In the Waldorf alternative (see, for example, my article future writings I intend to explore a range of other in Sre/nerErfMCflrion, 34 (1),2000,'But what about emotion-related issues, including the nature and childhood?'). Another valuable approach is to draw quality of'relationship' in early years environments, upon the wealth of substantive literature in a range and its longer term consequences for healthy of elds broadly centred in the Psychology learning and relational intersubjectivity; and the discipline in order to vindicate the assumptions that centrality of'emotional intelligence' in healthy child underpin Waldorf praxis. It is this latter approach development, that I will pursue in this article.

Professor Tina Bruce If we try to cramp and control him by our own notions of what he ought to be, we may close up the very channels which will bring him value and safety. Susan Isaacs, Social Development in Young Children The issue of play and its place in early years learning environments has had a particular prominence in recent times. Early years professionals were truly horried when, in 1999, the British Government's initial draft proposals for early learning goals failed even to mention the role of play. Following a public outcry at this omission, the Government's revised guidelines invented the notion of so-called 'structured play', being an attempt to preserve their intrusively prescriptive approach to early years 'education' while paying at least some kind of lip service to those championing the central role of 'play' (like the Waldorf movement and the pressure group 'Let The Children Play'). Yet in invoking the notion of structured play, not only did the Government glaringly reveal its limited understanding of the place of play in early child development, but its proposals were actually welcomed in the Times Educational Supplement of 8 October 1999.1 reproduce below excerpts from aletter I submitted in response, but which was not published. The TES's unreservedly positive reporting of the Government's revised guidelines for early years learning (October 8)... wholly embraced the assumed benecence of the new guidelines; and anyone uninitiated in these debates would gain the strong impression from your report that the Government has shifted considerably on the issueof 'play' in early learning, and that its revised proposals are universally welcomed in the early years sphere. If anything, however, the newproposals are even more dangerous than the original ones, in that at least the latter didn't pretend to be what they weren't... You state quite rightly that the \"key concept [of the new guidelines] seems to be the idea of 'structured and focused play'\". Yet the notion of \"structured\" play is a fundamentally incoherent, self-contradictory concept... My dictionary denes 'play' as freedom of movement, space for this..., especially as spontaneous activity of children\" (my emphases). As soon as an assessment-obsessed, objectifying 'educationalgaze' oversees and intrudes into the young child's world, its activity necessarily and by denition ceases to constitute 'play'. The Government's terminological sleight of hand could easily distract attention from its unchanged prescriptive agenda, and must not be allowed to slip through without challenge. It is... difcult to overestimate the damage that will result from the premature over- intellectualisation of the child's early years-as Rudolf Steiner pointed out some 80 years ago. Perhaps I would do well to remain in my current professional eld rather than move into education, as these fundamentally misguided early years policies are likely to keep an army of counsellors and psychotherapists in work for decades to come! What I would like to do here is to cite some literature on play from authoritative non-Waldorf sources in the broad eld of psychology, which thoroughly support the approach to play quite independently advocated by Steiner Waldorf educational philosophy. The distinguished early child psychologist and psycho-analyst Susan Isaacs has some very interesting things to say about the crucid foundational importance of play. For Isaacs, the child's imaginative play \"is a starting point [or necessary foundation-RH] not only for cognitive development but also for the adaptive and creative intention which when fully developed marks out the artist, the novelist, the poet... In his make-believe, [the child] takes the rst steps towards that emancipation of meanings -om the here and now of a concrete situation, which makes possible hypotheses and the 'as if consciousness (1930, p. 104, her emphases). It is exceedingly difcult to imagine how anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of the young child's archetypally momentous yet innitely delicate developmental process could seek to impose a distorting adult agenda upon it-n highly complex process in which the child is freely and imaginatively \"re-creating selectively those elements in past situations which can embody his emotional or intellectual need of the present, [as] he adapts the details moment by moment to the present situation\" (ibid., her emphasis). Several years later, Isaacs was to write that the lessening of inner tension and anxiety resulting from free dramatic play\" makes it easier for the child to control his real behaviour..., helps to free the child from his rst personal schemas, and to enhance his 1011'Happy as a sand boy': sunlight and shadow at play\u2014 a recipe for serenity and security in action. Photo: Sally Schweizer. readiness lo understand the objective physical world for its own sake\" (1933, p. 210). And in a truly magnicent section in her Social Development of Young Children, Isaacs offers us a perspective on play in the early years that should surely be compulsory reading for all professionals and education policy-makers. I quote selectively from it to give the reader a flavour of the Waldorf-afrming wisdom it contains; Play... is supremely the activity which brings [thechild] psychic equilibrium in the early years. In his play activities, the child externalises and works out to some measure of harmony all the different trends of his internal psychic life..., through his own wishes and impulses... Play is indeed the breath of life to the child, since it is through play activities that he... can work upon his wishes, fears and phantasies, so as to integrate them into a living personality.... [The] passivework of the educator in leaving the child free to make-believe is as valuable a part of his function as his more active services-a point sometimes lost sight of in the modem nursery school [plusga change...!-RH]. [The child's) indirect expression of unconscious phantasy... can never appear at the behest of the super-ego [i.e. via extemal didactic insiruclion-RH]. It is always the fruit of the child's own creative wishes. If we attempt to control and contain it. we simply make it lifeless and formal.... [H]ere... the educator... must be passive and merely supporting.... The inner flux of forces within [the child's] own mind...'is beyond our power to affect and control by any deliberate act.... [We cannot] determine the linesupon which his individuality shall develop, and what his actual .solution of conflict shall be. The more clearly we ourselves recognise this, the greater support we are likely to be lo him, (Isaacs, l933,pp.425-7/mw/i,myejTiphases) Finally in this section, here is the psychiatrist and phenomenologist John Heaton on play. [Pjlay is the performance of the movement as such. It is nothing to do with the attitude of a subject who must take up a playful attitude lo an object 'play' in order that playing can occur... If this is not realized, then play becomes distorted, as is commonly done in... educational... circles.... In play there is a suspension of belief and non-belief... -to [the child] there is no conceptual distinction between being and playing.... The game absorbs the player into itself and thus takes from him the burden of [self-aware] initiative.... Play does not allow the player to behave towards it like an object.... [it] does not point to purposes beyond itself, it celebrates itself. It creates a structure in which the identity of the player is lost.... Its nature is completely distorted if it is considered psychologislically as a known thing about which assertions can be made and which people then set forth to cultivate. (1978, pp. 124-5, my emphases) In this light, the British Government's championing of so-called \"structured\" play is comprehensively exposed for what it is-a self-contradictory and incoherent notion rooted in quite fundamental (materialistic) misunderstandings about the nature of human 'coming-into-being' and existence. Anxiety and the adult-centric disruption of healthy early learning ...how serious a mistake it would be lo try to make little children grow along the lines which these records show they can follow. They must be given a large measure of freedom to imagine or to think as the need and occasion ari.ses.

Susan Isaacs, Intellectual Growth in Young Children, italics hers, capitals mineWhile Rudolf Steiner was still alive Susan Isaacs took pan in some very detailed qualitative research into young children's behaviour at the Mulling House School in Cambridge (1924-7). part of which is exhaustively written up in her book Intelleciual Growth of Young Children. The book is notable for the recurrent vindication which it offers lo Waldorf educational philosophy . Not only was Isaacs deeply aware of the need to respect to intrude upon children's early development (cf. the above epigraph), but-being a psycho-analyst-she was also highly attuned to the deleterious effects of \u00ab\u00bb.v/>rvupon learning. According to Isaacs, \"mental alertness and an active interest in objects are very dependent upon freedom from anxiety and inner tension\" (1930 p. 104). For her. make-believe play (which I would argue mu.si be freely cho.sen, if it is to full the following purpose) brings \"indirect aid to the intellectual life... by giving extemal body and form to the phantasied wishes and guilts of infancy , and thus allaying anxiety\" (ibid., my emphasis). In other words, rather than having an inappropriate over- intellectualised and prematurely 'objective' concreteness eternally foisted upon her, the youngchild needs an unintruded-upon space in which to play with, elaborate and work through her deepest wishes, anxieties and unconscious fantasies, in order to gain competence in healthily managing with her own freely developed will, her curiosities and anxieties about relational being and human existence. Couple this with the psychoanalytic insight on the way in which emotional states are unconsciously transferred between people-with young children being particularly susceptible to 'picking up' and being (a)(e)lfected by others' emotions long before they are remotely able coniciously to understand, process and integrate such intersubjective injiuences-and we have a lethally poisonouscocktail (which, if we were being uncharitable, we might call a 'Woodhead-Hodge'). Imagine, for example, the 'inner tensions', and resultant anxietiesand developmental distortions, that are being set up within young children through their being preoccupied by. and having .somehow to manage the irresolvable conflict between their own na.scent inner will forces on the one hand, and an extemally imposed adult-centric agenda on the other. It's little wonder that, within a few years of these imposed Acaravanaboullo cross the Sahara?The Lord Mayor's procession? A farmers' blockade at Dieppe? Morning surgery at the post-natal clinic?

Imagine, further, the effects upon young children of being 'force-fed' Early Learning Goals by adults trying to pretend that they aren't so doing (and hence, incidentally, offering children quite appalling models of mauthenticity to imitate...); with those adults typically carrying with them all the anxieties associated with OFSTED (as Chris Woodhead chillingly called it, \"a very ne, sharp instrument\"-BBC news, 2 August 1999), learning targets, impending inspections...; and with young children unconsciously picking up all such anxiety and perhaps unwittingly making it their own (giventhat they are developmentally nowhere near yet able t o d i ff e r e n t i a t e b e t w e e n t h e i r o w n a u t o n o m o u s feelings and those they are absorbing from the adults and the environment around them). And all this before we even begin to consider the likely effects on young children of adults relating to them with an adult-centric preoccupying agenda of learning goals which cannot but compromise the extent to which those adults are capable of slJuU emotional and relational engagement with the young child-and again, with the child learning through modelling and imitation that human 'relationship' entails being preoccupied with one's own agenda, rather than respecting and trusting the w i l l a n d f r e e d o m o f c h i l d r e n t o n d t h e i r o w n developmental path (as so clearly argued by Susan Isaacs, earlier). No wonder our culture displays increasing signs of difculties in relationship, and of a 'pathological narcissism' and its associated 'character disorders'. Seen in this kind of light, then, what is happening in state early years education is nothing short of the criminal violation of early childhood; and the long- term 'psychosomatic' and psychological price our children are likely to pay for this violation is quite incalculable. The pemicious deforming effects of premature cognitive-intelleetual development Children who are pushed too hard academically, and who consequently advance temporarily beyond their peers, may ultimately pay a price in terms of lost opportunities for development. Professor Patrick Bateson and Paul MartinThere is a substantial psychotherapeutic literature on the dangers of premature intellectual/ego development which strongly supports Rudolf Steiner's insightful cautions in this area. Psychotherapist Robert Royston, for example, describes how \"intellectual inhibition and dysfunction\" in adult life can be traced back to \"a dominating autocratic object\" who, in the patient's childhood, established a relationship of domination in which the child's own natural integrated development was disrupted. Thus, \"the child'sdeveloprtiental agenda and establishment of an independent self are impaired in service to the [intense narcissistic] needs of the object\" (p. 15). Intellectual blocking and the negation of memoryare the kind of adult symptoms which result from the person's inability to digest mentally such a bad childhood experience. Moreover, such debilitating adult psychological symptoms are exceedingly difcult to treat successfully, because the patient tends to feel compelled to defeat the therapeutic healing process (p. 17). It should be noted that, in psychoanalytic object relations theory, an 'object' can be dened as any human person or cultural-environmental influence which the child 'imbibes' (or 'introjects', in object- relations terminology) and makes part of her developing psyche. Royston continues: \"In psychodynamic terms, the autocratic object gives the self of the subject no space toflourish and instead pushes its own narcissistic needs centre stage, forcing the other, in a variety of different possible ways, to bear witness to the object's superiority\" (p. 17, my emphases). And further, the autocratic object \"uses its interactive power to stifle the individuality of the child and will not brook independent ideas or challenge to his or her often dogmatic ideas and maxims\" (ibid.); and the autocratic object tends to operate \"through a range of covert, almost invisible interactions\" (ibid.). Now the reader will probably already have divined my argument-namely, that the intrusive adult-centric, over-intellectual agenda of the state's early years environment constitutes an \"autocratic object\" which may well be doing systematic and untold damage to a whole generation of cognitively hot-housed children. And it should also be clear from this example how we can use theclinical evidence from psychotherapeutic data to verify the insights that Rudolf Steiner bequeathed to us nearly a century ago. (The reader is referred to thebook by Corrigan and Gordon [1955] for a comparable discussion of what they term \"the mind object\", and its debilitating pathological effects on human development.)Discussion Materialistic learning... dominates education.... Education... has became an institution whose purpose... is not to make culture, not to serve the living cosmos, but to harness humankind to the dead forces of materialism. Education, as we know it, from pre-school through graduate school, damages the soul. Robert Sardello If the above analysis is anything like right, then we might already expect to be witnessing signs of the harm being done by the current early years educational regime-though of course it is essentially impossible to separate out the respective effects of the educational environment per se, and the pemicious effects of modem culture moregenerally (e.g. Healy, 1990). Take the recent article in The Observer newspaper ('Mind control dmg threat to children', 27 Febmary 2000), a highly disturbing front-page story which reported on the frightening scale of medically diagnosed child \"behavioural disorders\", with \"tens of thousands of schoolchildren with mild behaviour problems [now] being dmgged with Ritalin... simply in order to control them\". It is by no means far-fetched to propose some kind of causal relationship between the burgeoning and comparatively recent epidemic in child \"behavioural disturbances\", and recent (and 'autocratically objection'-able!) early years policy \"innovations\" which demand a relentless and intmsive \"control-freak\" surveillance, measurement, assessment and testing of children's developmental process-not to mention the forced imposition of premature, adult-centric cognitive-intellectual leaming at ever-earlier ages. In England, Ritalin prescriptions have risen from 3,500 in 1993 to no less than 126,000 in 1998-a 36- fold increase in just ve years. The article highlighted psychiatrists' proposed new drug- prescribing powers for behaviourally 'disordered' children-which represents a chronic misdiagnosis of what is at root a profound educational and cultural malaise. For rather than 'attention decit' and 'hyperactivity' being medically pathologised and their sufferers subjected to normalising biological treatment, these symptoms are surely far better understood as children's healthy response to, and unwitting commentary on, technological culture's ever-escalating manic over-stimulation,and the routine violence it is doing to children's healthy development-not least its cognitively- biased distortions of early child development. Anduntil our policy-makers develop the insight to recognise and to respond to this malaise at a cultural level rather than at an individualised medical level, the prevalence of children's behavioural difculties will inevitably continue to escalate-Ritalin or no Ritalin. Another tell-tale sign of the damage being perpetrated on our young children is the recently published research by Dr Judith Whitburn of the UK's prestigious National Institute of Economic and Social Research, reported in the TimesEducational Supplement of 28 January 2000 ('Nursery lessons \"damage\" learning', p. 6). Whitburn found that because English children start school so young \"many do not have the social and behavioural skills necessary to learn\" (ibid.); and before long, the effects of the head-start (!) which they receive from early formal schooling are more than swamped by a leaming malaise around the age of six or seven-leading in turn to signicant underperformance in maths compared with their Japanese counterparts who start formal schooling later. In a letter published in the TES of 18 Febmary 2000 ('Stop damaging nursery children', p. 18), 1 wrote: \"it seems highly likely that [Whitburn's] ndings will apply to educational performance in general.... In the light of these ndings it will be extraordinarily irresponsible if the Government persists with its massively over- prescriptive formalisation of our early-years leaming environment.\" Conclusion The lucid interpretation, the concise formulation,can be a misleading picture for the child; and indeed, a strain - an impossible demand on his emerging powers of representation. The nursery age child is not stmggling for clarity, she isstmggling for articulation. Adam Phillips (my emphasis) Overall, then, the principal concem of this article is that those whose early childhood development is inappropriately intmded upon and distorted are likely to end up either suffering from emotional- behavioural disturbances in childhood, or - as child psychotherapist Adam Phillips has graphically aigued in his important contribution to the Anna Freudsymposium (Ward, 1998) - they may well end up on the analyst's couch many years down the road. And such pemicious long-term effects certainly won't be picked up by Education Secretary David Blunkett's researchers until it's far too late to do anything about it 1415Richuni House is a gnuiuate of the London Waldorf Teacher Trainini> Semiiun; and currently runs the Steiner 'Fir Cones' Parent & Toddler Group for the Initiative in Norwich.

This concentrated, imitative learning of the child-an activity which is kindled by the role model and tirelessly practised-is here termed non-verbal learning i.e. learning without words. Parents who endeavour to set an example for their children in this manner could therefore be called non-verbal educators. An example might make clear what is meant by this. In a doctor's practice it often happens that when a mother and child come into the surgery a problem arises. The doctor has greeted the mother and then// is not moral preaching and not reasoned instruction which work on children in the right wav .- that which works is what the adidts in their .surroundings do visibly before their eyes. Rudolf Steiner Typically, human beings never nish learning, and even when getting older they'll keep adding new things to what has already been attained. At the same lime, it is obvious that the degree and manner of learning changes during the course of life. Every stage of life is specially adapted to certain learning processes. This shows above all in the rst twenty years where, along with bodily growth, the soul-spirit's ability to takethings in and readiness to learn Is buoyant. With this sketch as background, we may focus our attention on the pre-school years. The development of learning ability up to the beginning of adulthood During the course of their development children learn in different ways. In the rst years it happens through imitation: e.g. walking, talking and thinking, the handling of objects, getting dressed and undressed, eating habits, shaking hands when meeting people, and much more. What lies behind this? Learning through imitation means leaching yourself according to a perceived role model. Without any explanations or pedagogical instruction being given, thechild takes in all the events happening around it, practising out of its own innerdrive until it has attained the corresponding skills. Children do not learn to speak through explanation, nor do they learn to walk through instruction in how to move. They learn these complicated and far- reaching human capacities solely through ...The following is a chapter-minus the questions and answers at the end of the original-fromDrGlocklcr'sb o o k : E l i e n ^ c h u r n d t .

U becomes self-evident that you follow the routine. The Kindergarten teacher goes from group to group, singing the song which she sings every morning, signifying lliai they leave their treasured game and come in to eat. A few children are already following her. This extends into a little trail which affects the others. More and more join in until the whole group go inside. No scolding, no admonition, no telling off-simply a going inside embracing everyone. A mother once said to me, \"When I hear you speaking like this I nd it all perfectly understandable; but then when V m at home I always ask myself: where's my clarity disappeared to? It doesn't work as I hoped it would.\" This is the kind of problem which confronts people who are embarking on non-verbal education. So why is it .so difcult? Why is it hardly possible today for an adult to refrain from a whole rigmarole of explanations when he wants something from a child? He has to learn that instead of words he needs to act concentraledly . One ha.s to do something that mostly doesn't happen today: unite oneself with what one wishes in such a way that one can perform it almost as a ritual-through one's whole disposition, bring it to full expression.

With one person you talk about something in one way and with another person youtalk about it in another way: opinions have something relative about them: you don't want to tie yourself down. This is typical of the intellectual culture in which we live. One distances oneself; one doesn't lake things seriously but remains 'objective*. Seldom is it necessary to really throw yourself heait and soul into something. Many pupils are not used to taking seriously something that's been said by an adult. They think everything can be discussed and made negoiiable-that ultimately it is not decisive. And then they're extremely surprised when they meet a grownup whose every word carries weight. T oday we have all been brought up in this rather hazy, noncommittal way of life. This means that a degree of uncertainty will have bru.shed off on us. Most people have inferiority complexes in that they clearly feel they don't really understand a lot of what is going on in the world. This kind of uncertainty in judgment, resulting in being unable to form an opinion, is widespread; so relativity is also widespread-the feeling that what one thinks one.self has only limited value; everything could actually be quite different. Openness and critical distance are naturally an indispensable precondition for a genuine and realistic striving after knowledge. But they are undermining for the phase of non-verbal education. At that age children simply want to experience the meaning in everything that confronts them. If the adult cannot give this meaning because he is not convinced, or is uncertain, or experiences things as relative and only of limited importance, the child does not receive what she needs. She loses condence, and through this many typicaleducational problems belonging to this age group ensue. The rediscovery of body language Nowadays there is a whole spectrum of psychotherapies-differeni schools ranging from sensitivity training to Gcstall iherapy-which aim to convey to people what they think and feel inwardly, and how to releam to express this in an honest way, through the body as well, and to show this in body language. It has been shown that many people become ill through unbearable tension arising between what they experience inwardly and the facade that they show to the world. It is not that I am recommending the above-named psychotherapeutic metliods for learning how to educate non-verbally. I merely want to emphasise lliat the possibility ofnon-verbal education-thai is the ability to show through body language without words what one is thinking and what Is meaningful-is something which is very foreign to the adult of our lime, witli symptoms of illnesses often appearing in consequence.F o r l e a r n i n g h o w t o e d u c a t e i n a n o n - v e r b a l w a y I have two recommendations. Firstly eurythmy , w h e r e i n e v e r y m o v e m e n t s o m e t h i n g m e a n i n g f u l and entirely in correspondence with feeling and thinking is brought to expression, providing one practises diligently . Secondly acting or drama, where one learns to move expressively and only to say what one really has to at a particular moment. It would be ideal if parents of pre-school children would get together in groups, and act small scenes in mime in order to express thoughts and feelings, patterns of behaviour, commands and taboos, aswell as everyday problems in a non-verbal way. They should then exchange feedback about what they have experienced. It is fascinating to see how engaged children become when an adult makes an iniere.sting movement or when his face has a meaningful expression which is inclined towards mimicry . They love this .sort of thing. Not wanting to let him escape from them, they'll do everything he wants. They love to provoke simple expressive reactions in adults, and like it when their parents show their emotions. In this connection, it often happens that children in the Kindergarten pick up all sorts of rude words and trot these out provocatively in one or anothersituation. A typical case might be as follows. A mother meets an acquaintance on the street and begins a conversation. Little Johnny stands there and begins using rude words: crap, shit, wee-willy- willy. With interest he observes how the friend becomes embarrassed and the mother becomes uncomfortable [not least if it's a Waldorf Kindergarten he attendsl-trans.]. Meanwhile he is relishing the scene. But if the grownups continue talking unperturbed and ignore his silly prattle as a sign that it doesn't cut any ice, the child will soon slop trying it on. How does it happen that children instinctively know either that they have succeeded with such provocation or that it's not worth their while? Had he just been walking with his mother alone, In all probability he wouldn't have come put with anything of the sort. Such words only came into his mind when his mother started talking to her friend. Once again: in the non-verbal phase, children instantly absorb the meaning of all sensory experiences. They do not experience the senseexperience separate from rational understanding. So it is possible for them intuitively to grasp the moral qualities in the soul life of the adult. That which occurs for us adults in later life only on special siiuations-when, for example, we sense that there is an 'atmosphere' in a room we're entering, or when we notice that two people are in love with each other-ihis is a daily and ongoing occurrence for children. As soon as the mother meets her friend, the child feels that her interest has been dellected from him towards the other person. Through his provocative behaviour he would like to bring it about that he is once again the centre of attention. However, he must learn that this can't always be; and the mother achieves this when .she is quite consistent in doing what she considers is right-in this case, continuing to talk to her friend. If she empathises with the child, and understands how he feels a little forlotn, it will be easy for her. evenwhile she's talking, to keep casting a glance at him, or make some little movement so that he doesn't feel left high and dry . In this way she can pre-empt the child's becoming provocative. Conditions for free and responsible action There is yet a third hindrance vis-a-vis non-verbal education: the wish of many parents to allow their child to be free-not to direct. Hence, in order that he is not alienated, the three-year-old is asked what he would like to eat or what clothes he'd like to wear. Whoever realises that children of this age learn through example and are prone to taking on board any uncertainty in the adult's attitude (for example that he is indecisive about what he wants and therefore asks the child) will change his stance forthe sake of the child. Freedom can only developwhen one has achieved one's own mature insight, Of course, there are preliminary stages in the development of freedom. In the non-verbal phase of education this consists in allowing the child to imitate what he sees unrestrictedly and without reserve. He must be allowed to move freely. The house should be so organised that one doesn't have to prohibit the children from this or that; rather should their impulse towards activity be allowed free rein. The example comes from the grownups, but the way in which the child responds is freely experienced and freely formed. Similarly, later at school, when the children learn something because they like their teacher, the element of freedom plays an important role. Because the child likes doing something, she feels free, even if the impulse for the activity has originated from an adult and not fromherself. If children have been allowed to develop 2021Two 'men in a boat'-and in and on their magic carpel of fantasy. Photo: Ligita Gaile. through these preliminary stages, they will also be in the position after puberty, when independent thinking and powers of judgment ripen, to act out of free, self-determined insight and personal understanding. Only then is true freedom possible. To summarise: in the pre-school era, the key is trust in adults and free ploy of movement', in the school years, love and joy in doing: and in adulthood, recognition for what is true and right is the precondition for free and responsible action. Adults who bring trust towards the child so that she will make use of her freedom when she is mature enough for it, will feel themselves in the time up to then as proxy, merely replacing those capabilities over which the child has no sovereignty during the course of his education; and they will hold back wherever the child has reached a sufcient degree of independence. Correspondingly, the child initially brings to the adult, and especially in the pre-school years, deep trust that he will do what is right. An infant lying with open arms and open eyes, having his nappy changed, is at the same time an archetypal image of trust-lled bliss. She allows everything to happen to her. Something of this original trust persists through the whole pre-school period, expressing itself also in the need to give herself over to imitation. The child regards everything that happens around her as worthy of imitation and trust. That is why it is so important that this trust is not betrayed. It is betrayed, however, when the child experiences that an adult does not know his own mind. Likewise, when the course of the day lacks regularity and rhythm and security. But if goodhabits are instilled in the form of a denite sleeping- waking rhythm, in regular meal times, and regular alternation of play and rest, the child feels herself safe and protected, experiencing the course of such a day as something into which she may gladly enter. Without such clear and well formed structure in the daily round, the growing organs of the child do not gel the start in life which they need. Foundations for good functioning of the organs are laid when there is a regular alternating between making demands on the child and leaving her in peace. Many functional instabilities, in the sen.se of psychosomatic disorders in later life (automatic nervous system), have their roots in bad eating habits in early childhood. If children only eat according to fad and fancy, with no appetite at meal times because they've been nibbling and snacking in-between, the digestive organs will fail to learn toworktogetherstrongly and regularly and then to relax. As can be gathered from the above, it is straightforward to understand the principle of non verbal education; the challenge is to put it into daily practice.

Gone are many true children's faces, soft, round and ro.sy with bright eyes shining into the world. Why? What is lacking that this has become so? Children in all strata of society are at risk: poverty and discrimination as well as affluence and over- 2223stimulation create an environment in which children cannot thrive. Urban living exacerbates the effects. All parts of their development may be attacked by harmful influences and images around them. Many children are drowning in a bog of commercialism and media; speed and greed rule. Uncertainty and confusion abound. One blinks and it's all changed, accelerating so fast that we are left gasping. Too much, too often, too early ..., strength is sapped. Do we uphold the need for a proper childhood? Or do we dress children as little adults and plunge them into the realms of adult emotions and intellect in the hope that they will become clever and knowledgeable as early as possible? To what detriment? Research nds that those given early schooling do no better than those starting later. Does early exposure to ICT lead them to access information they really need, or does living in a wholesome environment do it anyway? Childrenare our future. How can we help them to face theworld today? Moral life Every child has an individual spiritual nature as well as an earthly one; it is up to us to nourish both. Then s/he will be able to stand in the world with courage and responsibility. Working with festivals has a healing quality and deepens children's moral understanding. It helps counteract the breakdown of traditions and out-of-season peculiarities (e.g. strawberries in winter). It covers every aspect of learning with its preparation and celebration, bringing a magical depth of spiritual and soul experience to child and parent alike, so healing in our world of untruths, cons and hype. A foundation is laid to help the child withstand later pressures of prestige, and temptations such as drugs, smoking and alcohol. Our daily rituals such as the non- denominational verse and candle lighting at break give the children a sense of occasion and continuity. Celebrating each child's birthday kindles self- respect. six-year-old to another with long golden hair: \"Did God make your hair?\" Religious feeling is at the heart of the 0-7-year-olds' learning. I am not, of course, linking this with any form of creed or organised religion. Wonder is the basis of their search for knowledge. This quality is disappearing, often replaced by only factual and even useless information, and yet it is vital also tothe adult. As a six-year-old said, \"Heaven is more higher than space.\" The true scientist must, next to clear analysis, also be a creative wonderer with reverence for life. We must not be fooled into answering all the children's questions! but can besilent and leave space for their own answers. As, for instance with the seven year-old who said: \"How can a pyjama case walk?...(pause)...You mean....mag/c?\" Precocious, hardened children become softened and their senses opened through our education. W e c a r e f o r t h e r o o m a n d g a r d e n . E v e n s a w d u s t g o e s o n the compost heap, as well as apple maggots to nish eating, and we rescue lost worms for the flower bed. Listen to this: Four-to-six-year-olds weeding around the bonre, nding worms: \"There are three under here.\" \"This one is so fat, he's eaten a lot of bonre.\" \"This one is so small, it was only bom last week.\" 'This one was only bom this moming.\" 'This tiny one just now while we were having break!\" \"I'm going to make a bed under that bush for this one.\" What a wealth of 'Desirable Outcomes'^-all at We care not to waste anything, even water; the future of the planet is at stake, but it is also a picture of caring for each other. We collect just four or ve frogspawn eggs, wait for their metamorphosis and carry the tiny frogs back to the pond. The Waldorf approach is very practical-out of life and living itself, and relevant to everything the child should be learning at this age. The child needs this living integral experience to accumulate knowledge, for he lives in the moment. In winter a candle or two illumine the room instead of electricity-this is cosy and real. Home life A six-year-old: \"I've got to go to aftemoon care because it's booked and paid for.\"A ve-year-old in aftemoon care:\"Mummy and Daddy aren't workingl They're always going in bed.\" Many children suffer rom the breakdown of family life and the vanishing of the extended family.

When women retum to worksoon after the baby's birth, the child feels lost,h o w e v e r l o v i n g t h e c a r e r s a r e .

We visit the children at home, not to pry but to strengthen tmst and gain insight into the childs needs. Parents often need and ask for help. Social life We share a nutritious break mid-moming, prepared with the children, beginning with a grace and ending with thanks. They help of their own accord with the cooking or spreading, baking or chopping, serving, laying tables and washing up. It is a social occasion, as well as nourishing. One apple or apricot brought by a child for me is always shared between us all. What a wonder! There are other domestic activities for them to do such as polishing, sweeping, mending (vital to counteract the throw-away mentality but also to give a picture of caring), crafts, washing, woodwork, sewing and gardening. They become deft and able, supporting later thinking capacity . A new Israeli four year-old to mother (in Hebrew): \"Why don't Jane and Sarah understand when I speak?\" doesn't either.\" \"Yes, she does, she understands very little! but gestures speak louder than words!) Communication has increased, yet racism, ethnic cleansing, violence and war thrive. What a paradox! Increasing loneliness brings new problems. Children need to be shown love and compassion, for they will copy it. Christmas and Whitsun are particularly relevant times for giving a sense of inclusiveness, celebrating the diverse nature of humanity with songs in other languages; but it can happen on a daily basis as well. For example, I leam a song in the language of each one and there are black dolls as well as white.\"All right, you can come in our game;\" said a six- year-old, \"but you are allowed not to play if you want\"(!) Children are egoistic but have a growing sense ofsociability particularly when six years old; because they are under no schooling pressure they havespace for it: how they love to help the little ones and organise each other! Their emotions are gently stimulated through love, music, colour and warmth. T h e i m a g e s c r e a t e d t h r o u g h t h e r e p e a t e d t e l l i n g o f a nature story or fairy tale support the moral and emotional life. Sometimes one needs to show beautiful illustrations alongside, to counteract the ugly, frightening images many children carry, absorbed from the media etc. M o d e m M e T echnology has brought us many wonderful things; yet alongside its advances we need human qualities.This is especially relevant for the child under seven. Our environment becomes less and less child-friendly. Children are adaptable and resilient but it can be at a cost and they become stressed. Their delicate nerve-sense systems may be flooded with impressions through harsh colours, news, image-covered clothing, trafc, background music, advertisements, story tapes, electronicsounds, poor and ugly (often too many) toys and books. Barbie, Aliens, Bugs, Woody etc. leave precious little room for fantasy. Are Disneyworld, T oy Story , etc. 'treats'? Processed foods, pollution, over-much immunisation and unnecessary use of antibiotics undermine their health. Computer games can give the child an experience of a series of violent images with neither context nor resolution, leading to confusion and fear. Children cannot cope, and lapse into lethargy, poor concentration or bad behaviour. Some are stimulated to early sexual awakenings. Bored children are actually simply soover-saturated that they can't absorb any more. Poor sleep may be caused by exhaustion from too many sensations and so nding no rest. Mystery and wonder are frequently distorted. One even intrudes into the life of the unborn child with as yet unknown consequences. Much of the growth of these phenomena is new since my childhood. Not that there is anything wrong with electricity or machines! But where and when is the right or wrong place or time? The child under seven's consciousness does not separate him from the world; he lives in complete sympathy with it, as the following demonstrate. 24 25The footsteps of the Creator' are to he found in sand and shell, silica and carbon, child and childhood. First-hand experience will lead to lieart-Jilled, head-crowned knowledge. A ve-year-old. about a dream: \"But you know, you were in it\" A four-year-old: \"I* m a real perfonnance: \"Are they puppets?\" In catapulting children into workbooks, tests and computers, they are torn away from their real world and forced into a foreign one. This, together with a s t r e s s f u l e n v i r o n m e n t c a n h a v e h a r m f u l consequences. And the tragedy is, it is a tragedy. For the older a child is. the less can be put right. Worse still, so often this environment is seen as benecial, and certainly normal. The goodies and baddies are often portrayed in equal measure by ugly characters. A web site for 2-12-year-olds \"protects them from unsuitable material on the Internet\", but gives them access to a c o l d i n t e l l e c t u a l m e d i u m d e v o i d o f t h e w o n d e r intrinsic to their being, and still providesquestionable material. 'Action toys' turn children into passive players.They 'soak up' these characters and imitate their behaviour, speech and movement. The bright ideas of the commercial world to rake in money render tlie children pawns in their game. One disrespectschildren in a mistaken assumption that they need to be entertained. Many mediaimagesof'beauty','strength' and 'desirability' can lead to anorexia, inadequacy or violence. The same can be said of many toys.Rhythmic life We have many damaged children today, for whom it is a relief to come to the Kindergarten. The rhythmic structuring of the day, week, month and season helps to stabilise uncertainties and lack of boundaries. Children's natural activity nds much harmonious, constructive and strengthening outlet. The teacher consciously creates a balance between play and rest, 'chaos' and calm, noise and quiet, group and individual activity, humour and seriousness, being inside and outside. How they love fun and laughter! Some arrive pale and go home rosy; some begin to sleep better. Rhythms also bring about good habits. \"Where are the toys?\" children sometimes ask at interview. Day 1: Story. Day 2: \"Oh. not that story again!\" Day 3; Story, child silent. Day 4: \"Can we have that .SI017 again?\" a recurring incidence with new children. Children soon warm to unformed playthings of natural materials, just as to the daily repetition of a story. Especially today, the child's inner need for 'again!' must be satised. We have bricks and logs-which in the child's mind can be ships, mobilephones, cheese, fences, or ...logs. Soft dolls with only an indication of a face are not conned to oneemotion. Clothes' horses, planks and cloths may make dog kennels, castles, shops, kitchens, spaceships, houses. Shells, conkers, pine cones form patterns, money , food, plates...

T ime flows on: the chimes are the rhythms: waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing. Tidy-up time begins when I take a cloth and told it: nothing disturbs their concentrated activity: they gradually notice and follow suit. Thinking and consciousness Two six-year-olds in conversation: \"Let's nish the house now.\" \"But it's lime to tidy up.\" \"Then, why did you spend all that time playing! If you hadn't spent all that time playing, we could have built the house.\" A ve-year-old: \"1 don't want to play: I'm doing a puppet show.\"What is play? What is not? In this active dreamworld they lay the foundations of clear philosophical thinking. They nd solutions to problems and help each other . Arguments arc sortedout amicably, often only through my walking nearby or watching from a distance, inwardly supporting but leaving them free. Alongside mathematics and language, physical and imaginative development are fostered. Warm and peaceful simplicity in which they can flourish surrounds them: plain coloured cloths and gifts ofnature in ordered baskets, a few beautiful pictures. Patterns and rhythms hold them. They enjoy beeswax modelling, water colour painting, lyre playing, beeswax crayon drawing, song, poeuy and dance. How can we expect them to work with the 3R's and ICT , when they are still at the following stage of consciousness. Five-year-old: \"Didyon build this school?\" Another, the same age: \"Sally, who are you going to marry when you grow up?\" Every child will play with ready-made games, butthe depth of learning is not equal to that of games Ready for the play (Cinderella).

Similar statistics have not been found for North yet there is another side to the picture if one wants to America, but for some years, Waldorf Kindergarten understand the children and youth of today. Many teachers have commented on the growing speech show a remarkable degree of spiritual awareness problems they are seeing in their children. and a highly sensitive social conscience. In an Looking in more detail at one example from this unusually quiet way, many young people take a deep list of problems, hyperactivity was recently the interest in the problems of the earth and of the poor, topic of a two-day consensus meeting at the Well overhalfofcollege students do volunteer work National Institute of Health (NIH) in Washington, in these areas, and many young people have founded D.C. Experts were gathered to discuss this nearly organisations which work locally or globally on a epidemic problem which is estimated to affect about broad range of social concerns, two million children in the United States alone. The 1 recently had a chance to meet some of the more general consensus was that there are many factors well known of these young people when 1 attended which contribute to hyperactivity, and it takes the State of the World Forum in San Francisco.

Craig had read about a ten-year-old Paki.siani boy who had been chained to a rug loom since age four and forced to weave rugs all day long. 1 had read the same aiiicle and was appalled. Craig, in a way typical of today's children and youth, wasnot only appalled, but addressed the problem directly. He formed an international youth organisation against child labour.\"* During the past three years he has travelled widely and raised muchawareness about the dreadful plight of children forced into labour. Some might argue that he is too young to take on such tasks, that he should have more time for youthful activities while he is still in High School. This may be true, and certainly one does not want him to bum out or become ill through his activities. Yet Craig seems calm, focused and unstressed. He is doing what his heart and mind dictate. Indeed, the message of the young people at the Fomm was; do not tell us we need to wait until we are in our 30s and 40s to become leaders in our elds. We are active and already leading. This can sound brash and arrogant, but when you meet these young people and see what they are actually doing and the modesty and inner maturity with which they do it, you nd yourself reassessing the conventional view of youth and making room for this new and unusual generation. The current generation of youth is often called Generation X, presumably because they were a mysterious generation and not easily described. Now social commentators are saying that the X stands for excellent and extraordinary. This generation stretches downward into the children of today. It even seems that each new wave of the generation is more remarkable than the previous one in terms of openness to the world, both earthly and spiritual, and a willingness to be a fullparticipant in it. As a Kindergarten teacher i wa.s often amazed during the 1980s by how many Kindergaiten children became vegetarians of their own volition. Five-year-olds would tell me, \"I don't want to eat iuiinials anymore.\" and would stick to it despite family pres,sure to continue eating meat. 1 now hear of babies and toddlers who refuse to eat meat products: and realise that children becoming vegetarians is a widespread and probably growing phenomenon. It de.serves study and documentation to understand it more fully. Given that this generation is so open, sensitive and committed to helping the earth and humanity, it is doubly tragic that they must also cope with so many society- induced illnesses. Humanity is in great need of the gifts and capacities which this young generation brings, but we create every possible obstacle to prevent them from bringing their gifts. There is anurgent need for social change so that today's children have the opportunity to grow up in safe and healthy ways. The Waldorf movement both world wide and in North America is concerned about how to best help children in our own schools and at the same time reach out to help other children. As the movement seeks to deepen its own work, an important step has been to bring together the insights and experiences of teachers, doctors andtherapists. One concrete step was last summer's Kolisko Conference in Fair Oaks, California where 900 Waldorf teachers, doctors, therapists and remedial educators from 35 countries met to explorethe problems of children today and the ways in which Waldorf education brings healing to children. Themes such as hyperactivity, learning difculties, eating disorders, and children's growing tendency towards bullying and leasing were explored in some depth. Within the Waldorf early childhood movement there have also been a number of conferences that have brought together teachers and doctors in a wish to better understand children from birth to age seven. At the same time, Kindergarten teachers have recognised a need to go beyond the boundaries of traditional half-day nursery Kindergartens in order to meet the needs of children and families today. They have been developing parent-child programs for children under three, full-lime child care programs for young children of all ages, and new outreach programs for children in especially difcult social and economic circumstances, such as homeless shelters, inner city schools and a Native American reservation. Also, to meet the need tor deeper medical insight, advanced courses and conferences are taking place to bring togetherdoctors, therapists and Kindergarten teachers. Looking beyond the scope of our own schools ithas also become clear that for the sake of children's w e l l - b e i n g a n d h e a l t h , s i g n i c a n t c h a n g e s n e e d t o occur in the wider society . Children cannot remain healthy in the face of the growing onslaught of commcicialism. media and technology , particularly when combined with inappropriate education, inadequate child care and a hectic home life. When children are taced with so many stressful factors in life, they cannot integrate them all and remain h e a l t h y . T h e t o t a l s u m o f s t r e s s f a c i n g m o s t c h i l d r e n is simply too great and results in a wide range of illnesses. These and related concerns gave the impetus for founding an Alliance for Childhood that will bring together parents, educators, doctors, therapists, researchers, and social activists. It is clear that many others also recognise the need to work together to tackle a wide range of social and economic problems affecting children, andcoalitions have been formed.\u00ae It is important that W aldorl education support many of the.se existing coalitions, but there are a number of issues which are not yet being addressed by coalitions. We see them as underlying \"factors in the decline of children's health and want to address them as directly as possible. Central topics of concern for the Alliance for Childhood are: Intelligence in motion. This leads in the Lower School to Etnotional Intelligence: after which all knowledge is raked over at least once again by the pupil's awakening intellect.l.lhe overexposure of children to media and technology rather than their growing up with sufcient opportunities for creative play and family activity:2. the extensive commercialism directed at children which orients their attention too strongly towards material objects and away from the sacred and the socially meaningful: 3. the emphasis on early academics rather than creative play as a loundation for learning in early childhood: 4. the need for families to lessen their hurried life styles and become a shelter that nurtures the growth of the whole family, both children and adults; 5. the inadequacy of much of today's child care, which needs to be transformed into healthy ways to offer nurture and warmth to children: 6. the concern that antibiotics. Ritalin. Prozac and other medications are being over-prescribed for children, leading to .serious side effects: and that more natural remedies need to be used when possible. Waldorf education has insights and experiences in each of these areas. It also has an overview that puts such problems into a context. At the same time, there are many organisations which have entered each of these realms much more deeply than has Waldorf education. If there are to be changes that will benet children and clean up their toxic childhood, we and others need to work togetlier. Single-handedly we cannot affect much change. Is the time ripe for such change? There are a number of indicators that the public is ready to hear about these issues and create social change. One sign is the growing number of articles in mainstream publications during the past two years highlighting the problems of children. Other indicators are the new and surprising directions being taken by anumber of organisations, such as the Parents T elevision Council, which urges parents to pressure sponsors to clean up television. Another new organisation called Commercial Alert was created by Ralph Nader to tackle the problems of commercialism directed at children and youth.' It is loo .soon to know if the following examples indicate a new trend, but it seems that even young children are getting concerned about the impact oftelevision in their lives and are ready to lake action. During our Thanksgiving gathering, my six-year- old nephew hid the remote control to his grandparents' television. He later explained that he did it because \"television rots your brain\". A few 3031weeks huer. I visited a I'onner neighbour who had recently had surgery and allowed her four-year-old twins lo watch more television than usual. At one point she urged them to watch television so she could rest. \"No.\" cried one of the boys, \"let's have a TV Turn-Off Week.\" Hi.s remiu-k refers to a week in April organised by TV-Free America'' when millions of families turn off their television sets and replace passive viewing with family activities. There is a growing concern that families focus far more on television than they do on each other, and this focus is taking its toll on social relations within the family. In addition, many other activities such as civic duty and volunteerism are neglected because of the massive amounts of time spent in front of the television. In the United States it is estimated that viewing is now in excess of 350 billion hours per year.^ Imagine how much socialising and meaningful activity could take place in families and communities if that number were cut even in half. Television impacts children on many levels- physically. emotionally, socially, and mentally. Kindergarten teachers have often noted that children who watch television or videos tend to have difculty with creative play. Their imagination and fantasy seem weakened by regularly viewing other peoples' imagery. Considering how important creative play is for the development of language and social skillsd\" as well as for creative thinking \" the loss of play is a very signicant factor in the life of a child. At the same time, teachers have seen amazingresults within days of parents' turning off the television for their children. Children may need a few days or a week to get over the addiction of media, but they then begin to blossom and play again, and parents will often say after the initial week of adjustment. \"I never knew what a wonderful child I had.\" T h e A l l i a n c e f o r C h i l d h o o d i s b a s e d o n t h e thought that all children are wonderful but they need a chance to develop in healthy ways. What are some of the rst steps the Alliance will take? In February 1999. a small Alliance meeting was called under the dual sponsorship of the Centre for the Study of the Spiritual Foundations of Education of Columbia University's Teachers College and Sunbridge College, a Waldorf teacher training. The consultancy, as it is called, brought together about two dozen people, including Waldorf teachers fromNorth America and Europe with University professors and social activists. During the two-day meeting wc explored ways to bring social change in regard to some of the problems affecting children.This meeting will be followed by a third day devoted to the concerns about the flood of computers entering American schools, to the detriment of children's healthy development. Reports of ihe.se meetings and planned activities arising from them will be widely distributed. In addition, two large conferences for the Alliance are being planned. One will be in Brussels in October 2000 and the other in W ashington. D.C. in 2001. We would also like to see more community- based Alliance endeavours begin, such as the Los Angeles Alliance for Childhood,'' which uses as its starting point parent courses and conferences focusing on the health and nurture of young children. Other initiatives which will focus on helping parents develop a healthier culture for children are being developed. To bring about change for children, the involvement of parents will be crucial. The Alliance for Childhood envisions itself as a loose confederation of individuals and initiatives, which gives space for each group to nd its own starting point. Its unication will come through common concerns, communication and collaboration around key issues. At the moment it is being 'incubated' in the Waldorf Early ChildhoodAssociation of North America (WECAN). We hope it will soon emerge as a free-standing organisation in the world with a wide range of members, its own web site, and all the accoutrements of a modem organisation.

Children deprived of rich sensory experiences need to have play therapy in the nursery school. T eachers may have to put such children through a crash 'course' of such activities as water play, sand play, feeling things and mixing dough. This phenomenon of the 'play-deprived child' has been observed by many nursery teachers. They say that play-deprivation is not primarily connected with achild's socio-economic background, but rather with the amount of television-watching in the family. Whilst many people may concede that excessive television-watching can deprive children of more healthy sense experiences, they may not readily agree that television-watching is sensory deprivation. However, this was demonstrateddramatically by psychologists Fred and Merrleyn Emery, who compared brainwave patterns of television viewers to those undergoing lengthy sensory deprivation. The brainwave patterns on the electroencephalograph showed that a person watching television for a few minutes was as seriously affected as someone subjected to a period of ninety-six hours sensoiy deprivation. The twelve senses Traditionally, there were ve senses attributed to the human being, plus a 'sixth' sense added by hearsay. Physiologists have included a few more, such as the senses of balance and of movement, whilst several 'social senses' such as the 'sense of identity', or a'sense of language and meaning' have been suggested. Each sense provides us with a window on the world, and we experience reality through a 'circle' of such windows as we pay more attention to one sense and then another. The more bodily senses give us an immediate experience of our organism. Balance enables us to experience our bodies in space; touch sketches the boundary of our skin; the sense of life tells us how we are feeling-whether we are well or out of sorts, and the sense of movement brings the perception of the motions of the body's muscles, limbs or joints. Balance, touch, movement and well-being involve us deeply in our own bodily experiences - we trust what these senses tell us. The senses of taste and smell enable us to nd out about substances outside our bodies-in very personal ways since each person develops her own 'sense of taste'. With sight we perceive colours, light and shade in our surroundings. For many people, 'seeing is believing', although more doubting people, like St. Thomas, may rely on their sense of touch for conclusive information. Another sense, the sense of warmth, tells us about relationships between warmer and colder things in the environment - about whether we ourselves are gaining or losing warmth from the surroundings. Whilst sight and warmth take us into the environment, the sense of hearing enables us to penetrate into the heart of things. The tone of a bellm l ^ o r m s u s a b o u t t h e q u a l i t y o f . s u c h m a t e r i a l s f r o mw h i c h I t I S m a d e .

There is the sense of word,which enables us to perceive the gestures, m o v e m e n t s a n d p a t t e r n s w h i c h a r e s h a p e d b y a s p e a k e r i n t o a s t r e a m o f s o u n d s .

Lastly , there is a subtle sense of feel' for the other as a person, as an identity , which can be experienced when 'making contact' with someone. These latterthree senses of hearing, of word and of the sense of t h e T o f a n o t h e r p e r s o n a r e v e r y d e p e n d e n t o n s o c i a l life for their development and conversely without these there is no social life to develop them. In the course of growing up through school, the different senses need to be nurtured more strongly according to the children's stages of development. Many activities in play groups and Kindergartens are usually practical-such as household tasks, cooking, constructing things, simple arts and crafts. Materials, substances, playthings and an environment of a sound kind have a positive influence, since it is through the senses that the world around is taken up into the child's experience-hence the importance of rst-hand experiences with honest materials. Such an early environment creates security of trust in the world, for life. If children experience materials or objects which are a kind of lie-removed from real rst-hand experience -then this produces an insecurity in the child, especially in trusting what the senses bring to him. In the primary and middle schools, children need to be exercised artistically if their senses are to be fully developed. Through painting, which is of crucial importance to children, the world of colour, m o v e m e n t a n d w a r m t h b e c o m e s a c e n t r a l experience for them, Music, language, art and poetry exercise the ner .senses, whilst modelling or crafts enliven particularly the 'will' senses of movement, touch and balance, For it is artistic activities which awaken and develop the senses in a healthy way. Children need toexperience the beauty of the world.At secondary level, when teenagers become much more able to perceive in a detached way. science may help the capacity for accurate, objective observation to develop. The arts- especially if used in a social way as in modern drama teaching-may be of real help in exploring relationships and in awakening the social sen.ses. Above all, teenagers need the experience that 'the world is true'. Television's effects on the senses Y oung children, in the process of discovering the world, are faced with the problem of 'sensing' if television pictures are 'real' or not, if there is in fact a man in the box or if the screen is a window on a different world. Reports of certain primitive people's responses to cinema lms-of being very concerned about where the actor has gone once he leaves the .screen-demonstrate the initial confusion technology has on unsophisticated adults. From this we can envisage how puzzling television must be to children who are just becoming aware of tlie differences and variety of sensory experience. My three-year-old son asked. \"Is there really an orchestra in the box?\" or \"Is that man really dead ?\" T elevision is adeceptive medium to place in reach of children as they are learning to nd their way inthe everyday world and are developing a general'sense' of its reality . Think of the contrast between Though skills are by no means cosmetic, attitudes towards life and work are still more fundamental-a vital principle in Waldoif praxis.

So cramping movement through TV and computers can have disruptive affects: consider hyperactivity, attention decit disorder, and forms of dyslexia when letters move up and down in the visual eld. Dr Harry Levinson treats certain formsof dyslexia and hyperactivity with travel sickness pills. These children, he thinks, suffer from a kind of 'motion sickness'. Certain children's ability to read increases remarkably after taking these pills, because the disturbed sense of movement is calmed down. Alan Hall, a phy.sicist investigating electromagnetic elds noticed the effects of rapidly oscillating, low level electromagnetic elds coming from computers and TVs: \"When one comes within two feet or 18 inches, one can feel the muscles tighten up slightly, and over time a feeling of 'electrostress'.\" So think how such subtle oscillations can effect balance and movement in young children, going from your own direct experience, he suggests. Balance is also affected by TV watching. And how many times do adults say they want to nd balance in their lives! Balance is centred in the inner ear. sensing the pull of the earth, it gives us a sense of uprightness. It gives us a bodily, groundedreference point, a feeling of inner calm and security in space. So think of the modem dizzy pace of life and how this can knock us off balance! Achieving balance is a major achievement for infants, as well as that of standing upright, free tostart moving as an independent being in the world. Cheryl Sanders stresses that balance disorders, resulting from thinas like viewing, can havedevastating effects on children: \"The disruption of balance causes a certain sinking feeling in the stomach, a dizziness that might be 'familiar to spinning about ten or twelve times, then trying to walk straight. Imagine if this feeling were present every time you wanted to read, or write. What if the feeling were more subtle, so that you could not gure out what it was, but you knew you were feeling awful when at school, especially in some classes, but not in others like art or music... and what if lack of co-ordination was extended to any attempt to participate in games, or even Just trying to run across the playground without being laughed at?\" Television closes down the human nervous system The Emerys propose that \"television as a simple, constant, repetitive and ambiguous visual stimulus gradually closes down the nervous system of man\". In an adult's brain the left and right hemispheres have distinct, specialised functions. Each hemisphere governs the activities of the opposite side of the body. The right hemisphere, for instance, controls the movements of your left hand. The 'critical' left brain can process one stimulus at a lime. This leads to orderly thought sequences, linear thinking, analysis, distinguishing parts. The verbal and logical functions arc important. The right brain can process whole clusters of stimuli at once, leading to a grasp of complex wholes-such as a face. The proces.ses of thinking in images and pictures are important. As mentioned previously, viewing tunes out the left brain. According to the Emerys, in adults subjected toelectroencephalographs, whilst watching television, the left hemisphere ishardly active at all, registering a minimal holding pattern. They suggest that \"viewing is at the conscious level of somnambulism\". The right hemisphere does register the television images, although since the cross-referencing of ourj;ubcon.scious intelligence between left and right hasheen 'knocked out', these cannot easily be brought to consciousness. Hence the difculty most people have in recalling much information from a programme. Other researchers into brainwave patterns whilst watching television conrm the Emerys' ndings. Dr Eric Pepper is a Professor of InterdisciplinarySciences at San Francisco State University. Heclaims \"...that the alpha wave patterns which rapidlybecome dominant whilst watching are a sign ofbeing in a totally passive condition and being unaware of the world outside of the pictures which one is seeing.\" The right phrase for alpha patterns isreally \"spaced-oul\". Not orienting. \"When someone pays attention to something external, such alpha patterns disappear .\" Babies have unspecialized brains. Indeed, it is only at about twelve that the left and right sides are fully speciali.sed. Babies seem to have some sort of 'non-verbal thought': for example, they recognise human faces. In the second year, toddlers learn to speak, and language comes to the fore. At this time each brainhemisphere is apparently equally mature; lesions on the left side are no more harmful to language development than on the right side, and vice versa. Similar lesions in the left hemispheres of adults niight cause signicant linguistic problems. As language develops, the brain specialises into the two hemispheres of verbal and or non-verbal thinking. Learning increasingly comes from verbal activities. However, television in the early years when the brain is so malleable and sensitive, prolongs the dominance of the non-verbal 'right hemisphere' functions. The trance-like state of many child viewers, especially if induced for 20-30 hours per week, may seriously inhibit the development of the verbal-logical 'left hemisphere' activities. Furthermore, children exposed to television-a medium which prolongs the dominance of non verbal 'right' hemisphere activities-may not takefull advantage of the special 'language sensitive' period of influence. Just as there are 'tides in the affairs of men' so there are tides of 'readiness' in the child's development, for example, languagereadiness. If a child does not learn to speak during this period of readiness, it may be hard for her tomake up for this deciency later on. Health visitors and speech therapist.s are concemed about the increasing numbers of young children who can hardly speak. What appear to be speech impairments, are in fact children who itavc had little family conversation, no nursery rhymes,and who.se parents prefer dummies (pacilicrs) and television. When neurologists such as DrEric Pepper assert that \"television trains people only for being zombies\"-ii may be time to ask: \"Do we want this state of consciousness to be induced in our children?\" To conclude, viewing at an early age may hinder the development of the senses, such as light, hearing, balance, movement-and, indeed, offers us a poor sensory diet. Over-stimulated, children may \"withdraw from their senses\", and need therapeutic exercises. The patterning the brain needs for language development is hindered by viewing. However, given the extensive research on the effects of viewing on young children, it is up to parents and school to make up their own minds. And at a time when there are so many creative alternatives, families are voting with their feet! However, schools are challenged as well to put more spark into learning. I remember a Waldorf colleague answering a parent asking him about whether she should be concemed about her child's viewing: \"Over the next few months, your daughter will growout of most of her viewing, as she gets involved in all the creative work we do!\" In other words, a lively family and school life is enough to get children 'out of the box'.

Tempie Lodgesh lOipp \u00a38.95. Here is an inspiring and accessible resource book foranyone working with anthroposophy in the culUiral sphere: it places the issue of gender at the heart of human evolution and shows how \"The eternal feminine / Draws us upwards and on\" (Goethe in \"Faust\"), Six lectures given by the writers at \"Homemaker\" conferences held in the Social Science Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum. Switzerland, form the basis of the book: which the writers hope will further a new understanding of the feminine principle and how it works in human experience. The lectures weave an esoteric picture of evolution from what lies concealed in myth and legend. Each lecture, or chapter, shines a different light on the developing picture, and offers practical application of the insights and ideas. The main themes are summarised below. Manfred Schmidt-Brabant rst interprets the Temple Legend to reveal a picture of Ear^ and the human being as feminine at the earliest stages of evolution. \"Eve\" in this context does not mean anything remotely like women: instead \"Eve\" represents the homogenous condition out of which physical humanity developed. This rst chapter describes the different kingdoms of nature separating out from the \"Eve\" condition and how the human sexes separated: which, through the awakening of desire and love, made the development of human individuality possible. The shadow picture is also described and we are shown, through the legend of Lilith, how individuality can succumb to sheer sexuality and be lost, today, just as at the beginning of Earth. Against all that the power of Lilith represents, the writers set their study of the feminine trinity; Virgin, Mother, Queen. Virginity is introduced both as a physiological state, in which the virgin is uniquely sensitive to supersensible perception, and as a soul condition, which can be transformed into a soul power througheducation. So that, for example, the mother may achieve the soul power of the virgin. Virginia Sease then investigates the mystery of the Virgin Mary. Following an explication of the Apocrypha and Rudolf Steiner's lecture cycle The Fifth Gospel, she traces the cultural-historical process whereby Mary became, on the one hand a being of wisdom who holds sway in the starry realms (Queen of Heaven and co-ruler with Christ) and, on the other hand, a being orientated to the earth and embodying earthly wisdom (the Black Madonna). The writer distinguishes the evil of Lilith's black colour from that of the Black Madonna, she raises the issue of our stereotypical associations of black with impurity and she suggests that the blackMadonna today may be calling on us to develop purity of soul within the darkness of our physical life on earth. The writer goes on to describe the influence of the feminine principle on the evolution of art and culture through history. This influence is traced from Lemurian limes, particularly in the realm of poetry, music, singing, drama and dance and we are reminded of the femininity of the spirits who guide creativity: the nine Muses of the Greeks, the seven Liberal Arts of the Middle Ages, and in the myth of Orpheus a picture of creative genius, his soul lled with love for the eternal feminine. The troubadour tradition is discussed in this c o n t e x t , a s a r e s o m e n o t a b l e w o m e n t r o u b a d o u r s a n d mystics. The counter-picture here is the degenerationof feminine Moon cults into orgiastic rites and wild dances: and it shows how the squandering of female creative forces began. There was a long gap after tlie creative freedom of the medieval women troubadours and mystics until women in the nineteenth century once more emancipated themselves enough to be freely creative and spiritually influential. In this context the lives of Helena Blavatsky, Mabel Collins and Marie Steiner- von Sivers are discussed and practical steps aresuggested for developing creative spirituality today. Manfred Schmidt-Brabant leads us into the realm of the Mother through examining the feminine in the hierarchies. Fir.st tlie 'all-Mother'was an Archai being from whom the goddess Natura developed in connection with the 'Eve' condition of humanity. In later evolution earthly mothers as priestesses fashioned the sacred vessel to nurture the human ego's development. This .surrounding, protecting, nurturing quality of the womb is also a quality of the vessel of the family, in spiritual terms of the Holy Spirit and the Grail chalice: and in counter-image the witches' cauldron. The writer sugge.sts ways the modem family can avoid the 'witches cauldron' and instead fashion a vessel for nurturing each other's individuality The trinity of Virgin (open to the spirit) and Mother (creatively fashioning the earthly vessel) is completed in the nal chapter by the introduction of the Queen. In the second Temple Legend we are told that the gure alongside Eve is the Queen of Sheba. Her act of choosing Hiram over Solomon represents star wisdom uniting with the earthly ego: and the writer shows ushow the force of evolution works to close the gap between men and women, until one type of human will appear once more and we will have taken the nal step to truly free individuality. In this way the writers weave us a vision of the archetypal feminine working within evolution, fromthe earliest stages of creation to the far future epochs of humanity. The book is clearly written. It is a pleasure to 'hear' the different, but equally clear, voices of the two writers as one reads and it seems to me a remarkable example of 'the will to collaborate and co-operate' which they recommend us to practise. Notes and references are also clearly made and the presentation is pleasing: a slim, elegant book with appealing colours and fomis for the cover. It is a book which could makean attractive gift. However, I want to introduce a note ol caution here, for 1 would hesitate before giving this book to friends interested in gender and cultural studies but complete newcomers to anthroposophy. It is not an introduction and assumes a certain level of acclimatisation to anthroposophical ideas. It is a book which may need occasional mediation to do its best work in the world. 1 highly recommend it to be read, digested and enjoyed as a rich re.source for discussion and debate. It raises a wealth of interesting, timely and challenging questions, and 1 can imagine many situations where it may enable one to pose the right question at just the right moment 1 Jo.sieAh\\'yn Nul'Hat written and Hin.strated by Gertrude Teut.irh, Mercury Press, sb 47pp. This is a children's book with a rather sophisticated and thought-provoking theme. The story introduces us to 01ms, nature sprites coloured green who tend the plants and are ruled by a wise king. One day tlieir leadercalls and all 01ms begin to wend their way to the meeting place between the Rosebush and the Elder bush by the hill. The story follows the journey of four piU'ticular 01ms as they meet each other along the way .Each has an over-emphasised characteristic which individually proves to be a handicap, but is helpful to ihe others as they meet and become friends. For example. Nose has a long nose always in danger of getting in the way and being an object of deri.sion, butis used to help Chin (a strong 01m with a large chin) pull himself out of a boggy hole. There is Spoons who lias overlarge ears but can hear the quietest of sounds and the thoughts of others. As they make their way to the meeting place they run into a group of 01ms, covered with orange spots, and led by one who is completely orange in colour. TheseOlms have no thought for the little plants, insects and birds. They delight in rampaging through the forest. Their leader wishes to become the next king and has deliberately glued a nutshell to the head of the 01m chosen by the king to take his place. This means thatpoor Nut-Hal's head is squeezed and no thoughts can be released, and the king has called all Olms to help him.The solution that redeems ilie situation is an inspiring and mysterious one, and leaves the reader (as an adult) with the question of individual change and transformation. This is a book that deals in a sensitive way with issues that children are often forced to face even at an early age-bullying, power, environment, loss of trust, evil. Yet the theme could prove to be too sophisticated for many children, and is hampered by anawkwardness in the plot and sentence structure.However, it is never patronising or self-righteous. It may prove to be a useful pedagogical story for Class One, or a way of indirectly reassuring children who nd themselves on the periphery of their social circle. The story is illustrated in rich and lively fashion with four full-size water colours (A4) and a wealth of beautiful vignettes in hachure. Rachel Mager Pico the GnomeA tale illiislraied by hb \u00a38.99. end of Martina Muller's tale is one where gnomes and giant live in hannony side by side, though it is a harmonious conclusion arrived at via fairly erce discord. The gnome, all unawares, drifts rather naively into a precarious position, but as the giant's huge club comes crashing down, little Pico is rudely awoken to the need for instant agility. First he makes off as nimbly as his limbs can carry him. But what ground can possibly bemade against the giant's colossal strides, destroying bushes and trees that lie in his path and \"frightening all the birds and animals\" ? What really saves the gnome,however, is his nimbleness of mind: just as all would seem lost, his bright idea dawns. Even if there were no text-and what there is amounts to no more than a few words on each page-Muller's tale would be 'readable' through the wonderful language of water colour that flows from her brush. She catches the overall mood of each stage of the story with just the right nuance of predominant colour: apple green at the Eden-like opening of the story, wrathful vermilion as the giant lifts himself threateningly to his full height, rich shades of lilac, mauve and purple as pact unfolds and peace descends. What is possibly even more child-like than the story or colour mood, however, is the enchanting way in which the artist has lled page after page with birds, beasts, flowers, ferns, conifers and other plants, in a treasury of form, gesture and colour. Whether the child is blessed by living in a rural situation and thus nds old friends at the turn of each page (robin, squirrel,toadstool, foxglove...): or whether the child is a town- d w e l l e r f o r w h o m t h e B o o k o f N a t u r e i s a comparatively unopened one, such a delicate and colour-enriched portrayal of wild life will surely resonate with the inner delight of nature's marvels that it is every child's birthright to enjoy.
