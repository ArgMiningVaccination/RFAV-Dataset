Please refer to Appendix 1 2 for details . How Well We Are Doing - Behind the Numbers 2021 OPERATING BUDGET $Million 2021 forward funding to 2021 Dental caries is a complex and multifactorial chronic disease that is heavily influenced by biomedical factors (diet, bacteria and host) a nd by social determinants of health. In Canada, 69% of children 6 -11 years of age enrolled in publicly funded dental programs have dental disease and an estimated 2.26 million school -days are lost annually due to dental visits or dental sick -days. Dental screening is a secondary prevention which aims at detecting disease as early as possible to prevent, stop or slow the progression of dental disease to improve function and quality of life. With the exception of 2020, a significant number of school aged chi ldren are screened annual ly. Children and youth attending primary or secondary school should be appropriately immunized against designated disease such as diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rube lla, meningococcal disease, whooping cough and chickenpox. Vaccines build immunity, protect children and youth from getting the disease and prevent children and youth from spreading a vaccine preventable disease to others, particular some of our most vulne rable populations such as younger children and older adults. Assessing records ensures children and youth have the appropriate vaccinations. Vaccine preventable disease levels are at, or near, record lows in Toronto due to T oronto Public Health efforts to maintain high vaccine coverage. Service was suspended due to location closures in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. 2021 Operating Budget & 2021 - 2030 Capital Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 4 of 36 How Well We Are Doing Service Service Measure 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Target 2020 Projection 2021 Target 2022 Target Status Outcome Measures Family Health Reproductive Health Screening - number of screens completed to identify individuals and famili es at risk for adverse birth outcomes in pregnancy 1,400 1,511 1,600 500 500 1,400 Infectious Diseases Prevention Immunization Record Assessment - percentage of immunization records for 7 and 17 year old children assessed * 100% 100% 100% 62% 100% 100% Infectious Diseases Prevention Toronto Urban Health Fund - number of community organizations funded to prevent transmission of HIV 49 40 40 47 48 48 * This Service Level Measure was affected by the closure of schools in mid -March 2020 as a result of public health measures enacted as part of the response to COVID -19. 2021 Operating Budget & 2021 - 2030 Capital Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 5 of 36 Service Service Measure 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Target 2020 Projection 2021 Target 2022 Target Status Service Level Measures Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention Percentag e of municipally funded Student Nutrition programs receiving nutrition consultation and support in the school year * 59% 53% 55% N/A** 55% 55% Emergency Preparedness Maintain the availability of Toronto Public Health staff to respond to public health emergencies on a 24/7 basis Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Environmental Health Percentage of High Risk food premises in compliance with Food Premises Regulation 87% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% * This Service Level Measure c ould not be reported as schools closed mid -March 2020 as a result of public health measures enacted as part of the COVID -19 response. ** A modified version of this service is being provided and a 2021 Approved Target is not available at this time.

The clinic provides services to hard to reach populations such as new immigrants, different sexual orientations and those with high rates of sexually transmitted infections. Service Level Impact: TPH sexual health clinics serve approximately 60,000 clients annually. Due to clinic closures and enhanced infection prevention and control procedures in place, it is anticipated that the number of clients served will decrease to approximately 11,960 (an 80% reduction in service). This proposal will increase the capacity at this clinic from 230 clients per week to 630 clients per week to offset the reduced service capacity of the other clinics either closed or seeing a decreased number of clients during COVID-19. Equity Statement: Family Health Infectious DiseasesAdjustments 2022 Plan Net Change2023 Plan Net Change Council Approved New/Enhanced Services:Budget Committee Recommended: Executive Committee Recommended: City Council Approved:22964 The Hassle Free Clinic Capacity Increase budget proposal's overall equity impact is low positive. Indigenous peoples', immigrants, refugees & undocumented individuals', members of the LGBTQ2S+ community's access to health services will be positively impacted through the provision of low barrier access to sexually health clinics which provide services to identify and treat sexually transmitted infectious diseases.
