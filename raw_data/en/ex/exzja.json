With upland and lowland forests, a freshwater lake and wetlands, diverse vegetation and bird species, visitors can enjoy hiking, biking, fishing and horseback riding in a rustic natural atmosphere. The rural and rugged feeling of the park's natural surroundings has been maintained to create a wilderness experience for all who visit. Crystal Lake is also part of a working farm. Please respect the agricultural areas. Crystal Lake is a main access point for a portion of the Delaware River Heritage Trail, a regional multi-use paved trail that will follow the Delaware River corridor. The portion from Bordentown to Roebling is known as the [Rt. 130 Bypass Trail](http://www.co.burlington.nj.us/1921/Delaware-River-Heritage-Trail) and is a total of 5.5 miles. Included within the boundaries of Crystal Lake Park are 1.7 miles of the paved trail. From the main Crystal Lake parking lot at Axe Factory Rd, it is about 3.5 miles one way to the southern end at Roebling. There are two parking lots for this park: the main large lot with permanent restrooms, drinking fountain, picnic pavilion, and hiking and equestrian trailer parking off of Axe Factory Road, and the small lot off Rt. 130 North with a portable restroom and 1 picnic table. Check out the new pollinator meadow on the Rt. 130 side of the park. Burlington County was selected to participate in the Xerces Society's Northeast Monarch Butterfly and Pollinator Project, a program where the international nonprofit group dedicated to protecting insects and other invertebrates provides conservation partners with milkweed and other nectar-rich plants to place in parks and other strategic areas to create habitat for butterflies and other important pollinators. Flowers bloom May-October in the meadow. Features - Equestrian Trails - Fishing - Hiking Trails - Mountain Biking - Restroom facilities Park pavilions are available for your use at any time.
