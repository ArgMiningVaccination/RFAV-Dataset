The word Homeopathy means: homeo = similar + patia = disease and was thus designated by Hahnemann to differentiate it from the usual medicine of the time, which he called Allopathy, where alos = opposites + patia = disease. Homeopathy is considered a medical science that uses, in the treatment of \"sick people\", medicines manipulated according to their own pharmacotechnics, these medicines originating from the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms. This therapy is based on the doctrine \"Similia Similibus Curantum\" (\"Like things are cured with like things\"). In Homeopathy, patients are treated individually. It is a therapy that understands the patient physically and mentally (individualizing their clinical history and identifying the respective signs and symptoms peculiar to each one). Indications: Behavioral disorders (aggressiveness, shyness, anxiety, self-mutilation, coprophagia, fears and phobias, psychological pregnancy, etc.); Skin problems dermatitis, etc); Between Curiosities In Germany, around 90% of veterinarians prescribe homeopathic medicines. There are several reasons for this preference, for example: Many pet owners have had positive personal experiences with homeopathy. There is also great distrust regarding conventional treatments (antibiotics and corticosteroids), in particular, associated with adverse drug reactions. It is not uncommon for animals with chronic illnesses to employ homeopathy as a last resort after prolonged conventional treatment has failed to produce any lasting improvement. In livestock, homeopathy has become a viable alternative to problems such as legislation prohibiting the use of certain drugs, the growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and the increasing number of farms dedicated to the production of organic food.
