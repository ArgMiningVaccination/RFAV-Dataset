This guidance is effective immediately and will remain in effect until the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) adopts rules and regulations pursuant to the P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B 13, 2020, P.L. 2019, c332 was signed into law. This new law amends P.L.2003, c.284 (N.J.S.A.18A:62- 15.1) and shall take effect on June 15, 2020. In accordance with this law : A new student enrolling in a public or private institution of higher education shal l have received immunization for meningococcal disease as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as a condition of attendance. Students must present evidence of the vaccination(s) required. Each public and private institution of higher education in this State shall offer the required meningococcal vaccines through the institution's student health services program or through a contracted agreement with a community health provider. Requiremen ts for Institutions of Higher Education Public and private institutions of higher education must develop policies and procedures to ensure that all newly enrolling students are vaccinated for meningococcal disease in accordance with ACIP recommendations. A summary of recommendations is provided for your convenience; however, please review the complete ACIP guidance at: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip- recs/vacc -specific/mening.html . Meningococcal vaccines Institutions of higher education must ensure that newly enrolled s tudents receive meningococcal vaccines that are routinely recommended by the ACIP. There are 2 types of meningococcal vaccines available in the United States that are routinely recommended f or certain persons : Meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccines (Menactra\u00ae and Menveo\u00ae) The ACIP routinely recommends vaccination for the following: Children and adolescents through age 18 o All persons aged 11 - 12 years; booster dose at 16 years o All persons 16 - 18 years of age who have no history of prior vaccination are recommended to receive 1 dose Adults 19 years of age and older o First-year college students who live in residential housing (if not previously vaccinated at age 16 or older) o Persons with anatomical or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), HIV infection, persistent complement deficiency, complement inhibitor use o Travel in countries with hyperendemic or epidemic meningococcal disease o Microbiologists routinely exposed to Neisseria meningitidis o Persons who are at risk during an outbreak caused by vaccine serogroup Meningococcal B ( MenB ) vaccines (Bexsero\u00ae ACIP routinely recommends vaccination with the following: Persons 10 years of age and older o Persons with anatomical or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), HIV infection, persistent complement deficiency, complement inhibitor use o Persons who are at risk during an outbreak caused by serogroup B o Microbiologists routinely exposed to Neisseria meningitidis Education on benefits of MenB vaccine Institutions of higher education must ensure that newly enrolled students aged 16 through 23 years of age who are not routinely recommended to receive MenB vaccine (as noted above) r eceive education on the risks and benefits of MenB vaccine and that the vaccine be made available for students who choose to be vaccinated . ACIP recommends that a MenB series may be administered to people 16 through 23 years of age with a preferred age of vaccination of 16 through 18 years. This recommendation allows for shared clinical decision -making between the provider and the student based on the risk and benefit for the individual patients. Resources The following r esources are available to assist institutions of higher education with implementation of this new law. All of these materials are available on the NJDOH website at: https://nj.gov/health/cd/topi cs/meningo.shtml . Meningococcal Disease Informational Flyer for College Students This flyer provides students with an overview of meningococcal disease including how the disease is spread, symptoms, and vaccination recommendations. The student informational flyer may be disseminated or publicly posted to satisfy the education requirement (N.J.A.C. 8:57- 6.10). Meningococcal Vaccine Questionnaire for College Students The document includes a checklist by age and increased risk for a student to self -assess which meningococcal vaccines they may be required to receive. This may serve as a template that can be adapted for sharing with students to help them determine if they are currently meeting the meningococcal vaccination requirements. Algorithms for Men ingococcal Immunization of College Students 16 Years and Older These two documents may be used when determining which vaccines are recommended based on the ACIP recommendations for immunization. The algorithms provide specific dosing guidance based on a ge, and increased risk status. Two algorithms have been developed : one for MenACWY vaccination, and one for MenB vaccination. Meningococcal V accination Guidance for Healthcare Providers These two documents contain a current listing of the ACIP meningococcal vaccination recommendations for MenACWY and MenB vaccines. Recommendations are presented by age and risk factor.

Meningococcal Meningococcal ( muh -nin-jo-cok-ul) disease infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis . The bacteria can invade the body, leading to severe swelling of the tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or bloodstream infection. Both of these types of infections are very serious and can be deadly in a matter of hours. Even with antibiotic treatment, 10 to 15 in 100 people infected with meningococcal disease will die. Up to 1 in 5 survivors will have long -term disabilities, such as loss of limb(s), deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage. How do people get meningococcal disease? People spread meningococcal bacteria by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (saliva/spit). Generally, the bacteria are spread by close or lengthy contact with a person who has meningococcal disease such as: People in the same household Roommates Anyone with direct contact with the patient 's oral secretions such as through kissing or sharing eating utensils, cigarettes/vaping devices, and food. What are the symptoms of meningococcal disease? Symptoms can progress quickly and may include: high fever headache stiff neck confusion sensitivity to light nausea vomiting exhaustion purplish rash Some people carry the bacteria in their noses and throat, but they don 't become ill. Even though they do not have symptoms, they can still spread the bacteria to others. How can I protect myself from meningococcal disease? The best way to protect yourself from meningococcal disease is to get vaccinated . There are two types of meningococcal vaccines that protect against the common serogroups (A, B, C, W, Y) of the bacteria: Meningococcal or MenB Trumenba\u00ae) For more information, please visit https://nj.gov/health/cd/topics/meningo.shtml , or contact the NJDOH Vaccine Preventable Disease Program at 609 -826-4861.

Will I need the meningococcal vaccines? YES , new students enrolling in a public or private institution of higher education in New Jersey are r equired by state law ( P.L. 2019, c.332) to receive meningococcal vaccines as recommended by th e A dvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). W hich meningococcal vaccines do I need? There are two types of meningococcal vaccines that might be required depending on your age a nd your risk. The meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MenACWY) protects against serogroups A, C, W an d Y disease. T he meningococcal serogroup B vaccine ( MenB ) protects against serogroup B disease. You are required to receive meningococcal vaccines that are routinely recommended for you . P lease review the student questionnaire and/or speak with your healthcare provider to determine which vaccines you may need. I recei ved a dose of MenACWY vaccine at 11 years old to attend sixth grade in New Jersey . Why do I still need another dose of MenACWY for college? CDC recommends a dose of MenACWY vaccine at ages 11 -12 years with a booster dose at 16 y ears. This is because protection from the first dose begins to wane, so a booster dose i s r ecommended to provide greater protection from meningococcal disease. College students , esp ecially freshman living in r esidence halls, are at a slightly increased risk for contracting meningococcal disease. All students 16 through 18 will be required to receive a dose of MenACWY (Menactra or Menveo) on or after age 16 even if you received a dose at a younger age. Additionally, a ll first-year college students who are living in residence halls will be required to have received a dose of MenACWY on or after the 16th birthday. I am a first -year college student living in a campus residence hall , do I need meningococcal vaccines? YES , you will be required to receive MenACWY if you are a first -year college student living in a residence hall regardless of age. If you received at least one dose of MenACWY on or after age 16, n o further doses are necessary unless you have a risk factor for meningococcal disease. Y ou will be required to receive MenB vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba) for school attendance if y ou h ave a risk factor. Anyone 16 through 23 years old (preferably at 16 - 18 years of age) may choose to receive MenB vaccine. MenB vaccines provide short -term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. A summary table of increased risk indications is included at the end of the FAQs. 3 Can titers be accepted in lieu of documentation of vaccination? NO, there are no acceptable serologic titers that can be used as evidence of protection against meningococcal strains A, B, C, W, or Y. Do I have to get a meningococcal vaccine if I have a medical condition that prevents me from receiving it? NO, the ACIP provides guidance to healthcare providers on which patients should not receive a particular vaccine. These reasons are listed at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/general - recs/contraindications.html . For all medical exemption s, your physician must provide information to your school that satisfies the following : Only a physician licensed to practice medicine/osteopathic medicine and a nurse practitioner can write a medical exemption. A medical exemption must indicate a specific period of time in which the student cannot receive specific vaccinations. Reason(s) for medical contraindication must be enumerated by the ACIP and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). A medical exemption form is also available on the NJDOH website at www.nj.gov/hea lth/forms/imm- 53.pdf . Do I have to get a meningococcal vaccine if I practice a religion that prevents me from receiving it? NO, according to N.J.S.A.18A:61D -3, a student can submit a written statement that the immunization conflicts with the student's religious beliefs . Philosophical, moral or conscientious exemptions are not acceptable. Where can I obtain my vaccination records? If you do not currently have a copy of your vaccine records, you may be able to retrieve an official copy by contacting your: healthcare provider, the state immunization registry (New Jersey Immunization Information System - njiis.nj.gov - see question below for more info), or a previous school . What is the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS)? NJIIS is the statewide immunization registry. NJIIS consolidates immunization information from all healthcare providers into one official record. More information on the registry can be found at https://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/vpdp/njiis_information_ adults.pdf . If I can't find my vaccination records, do I need to get the vaccination again? YES , documentation of vaccination including the date of administration is required for attendance at institutions of higher education. If no record is available , then revaccination would be required. COLLEGE HEALTH ADMINISTRATOR FAQs Will vaccination be required during an outbreak? YES, vaccination will be required for outbreaks of meningococcal disease with serogroups in the meningococcal vaccines ( A, B, C, W, Y ). The outbreak must be declared by public health authorities. The specifics of the vaccine required, and the vaccination schedule will be determined by public health authorities. 4 How do I know which students are considered at increased risk? Institutions shall develop policies and procedures to determine a student's risk- status based on the ACIP recommendations. A summary table of increased risk indications is included at the end of the FAQs. The ACIP states the MenACWY is recommended for first -year college students who live in residential housing if not previously vaccinated at age 16 years of age and older. How is a first -year student defined? This recommendation only applies to first -year/freshman college students who are also living in campus residential housing. Unvaccinated students 19 years of age and older who are not first -year college students ( e.g., students transferring from another college as a second -year student, previous commuter students) would not be required to receive the vaccine, even if the student is living in residential housing. Although the MenACWY vaccine is not required, any student newly livi ng in campus residential housing can discuss their individual risk with their healthcare provider. Please note that all adolescents, regardless of whether they will be attending college or living on campus, should receive 2 doses of MenACWY vaccine at 11- 12 and 16- 18 years. Therefore, any college student under 19 years of age would be required to be vaccinated. Is there a medical exemption form? YES , the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) created a Request for Medical Exemption from Mandatory Immuniza tion Form (IMM -53) and guidance document available at www.nj.gov/health/forms/imm- 53.pdf . Healthcare providers who submit medical exemptions for mandatory vaccination must ensure that the information submitted is accurate and verifiable. The use of this form is not mandated or required. It is a tool that may be used by healthcare providers, schools, preschools, childcare facilities, and local health department s to assist in determining the validity of a medical exemption from mandatory immunization. Are students 31 years of age and older subject to the immunization requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 8:57- 6.4 (b)1 since the Higher Education statute N.J.S.A. 18A:61D -1 states that the immuniza tion requirements specifically apply to students 30 years of age and under? The NJ Higher Education Statute, N.J.S.A. 18A:61D -1 states: Every public and independent institution of higher education in this State shall, as a condition of admission or contin ued enrollment, require every graduate and undergraduate student who is 30 years of age or less and is enrolled full- time or part -time in a program or course of study leading to an academic degree, to submit to the institution a valid immunization record w hich documents the administration of all required immunizations against vaccine -preventable disease, or evidence of immunity from these diseases, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Health. The institution shall keep the records on file in such form and manner as prescribed by the department. The NJDOH administrative code, N.J.A.C. 8:57- 6.4, states that students born before 1957 are exempt from the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination requirement. Since the Education Statute at N.J.S.A. 18A:61D -1 specifically states that only students 30 years of age or less must show proof of vaccination, NJDOH cannot require a college student over 30 years of age that meets all the other requirements set forth at N.J.S.A. 1 8A:61D -1 to present proof of vaccine or immunity for any of the required college vaccines. However, NJDOH still highly recommends that students are age- appropriately immunized. 5 Is the previous law requiring education on meningococcal disease still in eff ect? YES , it is still required for institutions to provide education on meningococcal disease. Since 2001, institutions of higher education have been required by law (N.J.A.C. 8:57- 6.10) to provide information on meningococcal disease, at a minimum, includ ing its nature and severity, causes, disease prevention and treatments, and the availability of a meningococcal vaccine to prevent disease. The student information flyer, available at https://nj .gov/health/cd/topics/meningo.shtml , may be shared to comply with this law. Alternatively, an institution may develop their own resource to comply. CLINICIAN FAQs How do shared clinical decision -making recommendations differ from routine, catch -up, and risk- based immunization recommendations? Unlike routine, catch- up, and risk- based recommendations, shared clinical decision- making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk gro up. Rather, shared clinical decision -making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian. The key distinction between routine, catch- up, and risk- based recomm endations and shared clinical decision -making recommendations is the default decision to vaccinate. For routine, catch- up, and risk-based recommendations, the default decision should be to vaccinate the patient based on age group or other indication, unles s contraindicated. For shared clinical decision -making recommendations, there is no default \u2014the decision about whether or not to vaccinate may be informed by the best available evidence of who may benefit from vaccination; the individual's characteristics, values, and preferences; the health care provider's clinical discretion; and the characteristics of the vaccine being considered. There is not a prescribed set of considerations or decision points in the decision- making process. Which patients should providers discuss shared clinical decision -making recommendations with? It's up to the provider. Some health care providers may choose to discuss immunizations recommended for shared clinical decision -making with all or most of their patients who could receive it, while some providers may be more selective when discussing these immunizations with their patients. Health care providers should also be receptive to patient -initiated conversations about these immunizations. Are shared clinical decision -making recommendations covered by private insurers? Under the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, ACIP recommendations that have been adopted by CDC \"with respect to the individual involved\" and are \"listed on the Immunization Schedules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" generally are required to be covered by group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage without imposing any cost -sharing requirements (such as a copaym ent, coinsurance, or deductible). This coverage requirement includes shared clinical decision- making recommendations when they have been adopted by CDC and are listed on the immunization schedules. 6 Are the two MenACWY vaccines interchangeable? YES , for persons age 9 months and older the vaccines, MenACWY -D (Menactra) and MenACWY - CRM (Menveo), are interchangeable. Are the two MenB vaccines interchangeable? NO, are not interchangeable. If a series is started with one brand, it must be completed with the same brand. Can both MenACWY and MenB vaccines be administered on the same day? YES , these two vaccines can be administered at the same visit or at any time before or after the other. There is no need for spacing between these two vaccines. If a patient received MenACWY vaccine at age 10 years and a dose of MenACWY before the 16th birthday, will they still need a booster dose at age 16? YES , they should receive a booster dose. A booster dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years even if 2 (or more) doses of meningococcal ACWY vaccine were received before age 16 years.
