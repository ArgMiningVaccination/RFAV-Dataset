A gastroenterologist is the best person to treat [Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/gerd-signs-causes-symptoms-and-treatment-options/) (GERD). Also known as heartburn or acid reflux, GERD develops when the acid present in the stomach moves from the stomach into the oesophagus. It causes a burning sensation. To treat this disorder, Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) is used. It is an incision-less procedure where a new anti-reflux valve is constructed at the entrance of the oesophagus using a special device. This prevents the acid from entering into the oesophagus. Diagnosis and Treatment for Gastric Problem Your doctor might perform some tests to diagnose your condition, which typically includes - - Upper Endoscopy - Upper endoscopy is a test that enables your doctor to examine your oesophagus, stomach and a small part of the small intestine. Upper endoscopy is also known as esophagogastroduodenoscopy or OGD. A thin and flexible tube, called an endoscope, is put into your mouth and gradually proceeded through the throat into the food pipe, stomach and intestines. At the end of the tube is a camera that enables your doctor to view your stomach and small intestine thoroughly. - Blood Tests - Blood tests help to rule out other diseases that can cause similar signs and symptoms. Your doctor may recommend a test to look for a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) that usually causes gastric problems. - Stool Test or Fecal Occult Blood Test - A stool culture checks for the presence of abnormal bacteria in the digestive tract that may cause gastritis and other problems. Once the condition and stage of the gastric problem are diagnosed, a treatment procedure is prescribed. Treatment for gastritis involves: - Antacids and other drugs to reduce stomach acid. - For gastritis caused by a viral and bacterial infection, your gastroenterologist will prescribe a regimen of several medications to reduce heartburn. - Eliminating irritating foods from your diet increase the effect of gastric problems. Usually, these foods are lactose from dairy or gluten from wheat. Most people with gastritis show improvement once medications and treatment start.
