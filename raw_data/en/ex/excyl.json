Individual discoun t parameters pla y no part in this, th us arbitrage will frus- trate attempts to use cash rew ards to measure sub jects' discoun t parameters (Fisher 1930, Lo ew enstein 1987, Cubitt & Read 2007). While prior literature had b een c haracterized b y b oth signi can t presen t bias ( of ab out in mo dels of quasi-h yp erb olic discoun ting, as in Laibson, 1997) and extreme ann ual dis- coun t rates (80% to 100% ann ually rederic k et al. (2002)), new exp erimen tal measures b y Andersen, Harrison, Lau & Rutstrom (2008) and Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) nd lit- tle presen t bias in man y samples, and discoun ting near mark et in terest rates.1Moreo v er, when presen t bias is detected, it is often in samples for whic h sub jects face binding credit constrain ts, as in dev eloping coun tries or among c hildren.2 Although arbitrage w as addressed early in this literature, (Coller & Williams 1999, Har- rison et al. 2002, 2004), imp ortan t recen t ndings ha v e spark ed renew ed in terest in arbitrage (Cohen et al. 2016, DellaVigna 2018).3In particular, Augen blic k, Niederle & Sprenger (2015) sho w ed that when Andreoni & Sprenger's Con v ex Time Budget (CTB) proto col is used to al- lo cate cash there is little presen t bias, y et when the same sub jects allo cate e\u001bort, presen Since allo cating e\u001bort is though t to b e more di cult to arbitrage, fears arose that arbitrage o v er money rew ards w as stripping presen t bias from the data and in v alidating cash for measuring discoun ting. There are sev eral coun terp oin ts to this argumen t. First, Augen blic k et al. (2015) mea- sured b oth and\u000e of quasi-h yp erb ting presen t bias, is0:89 for e\u001bort and 0:98 for cash, indirectly supp orting arbitrage for cash but not w ork. On the other hand, the estimated discoun t factor \u000e pro duces an ann ual 1In 2See, for example, Kuroishi & Sa w ada (2018), Sa w ada & Kuroishi (2015), Janssens et al. (2017), Clot et al. (2017) and L\u00fchrmann et al. (2018). Sa w ada & Kuroishi (2015) nds that v ariables correlated with liquidit y ha v e no signi can t e\u001bect on presen t bias. 3Arbitrage refers to b orro wing at the lo w er rate, and sa ving the higher rate when lab and mark et rates di\u001ber. 1rate of ab out 5% for e\u001bort, a reasonable mark et rate, but 87% for money , an unreasonably high mark et rate. Second, if sub jects arbitrage in these studies, should w e b e surprised that they fail to arbitrage in other similar circumstances (Harrison et al. 2004)? Y et, a large literature on c hoice brac k eting sho ws that in man y situations individuals narr ow ly brac k et their decisions, making c hoices in isolation rather than broadly considering the consequences of their c hoices for later decisions (Read et al. 1999, Rabin & W eizsac k er 2009). Early exp erimen ts unco v er- ing biases in discoun ting (Thaler 1981, Lo ew enstein & Thaler 1989), certain t yp es of men tal accoun ting (Thaler 1985), and the endo wmen t e\u001bect o v er go o ds easily repurc hased outside the lab (Kahneman et al. 1990), are failures of arbitrage attributed to narro w brac k eting. Third, Balakrishnan et al. (2017) applied CTBs to a sample in Ken y a, conducting all pa ymen ts electronically so that the \u0010to da y\u0011 pa ymen t could b e applied immediately . They found a parameter similar to that in the e\u001bort allo cation in Augen blic k et al. (2015), while when the pa ymen t w as made after a four hour dela y returned to 1, as in Andreoni & Sprenger (2012), suggesting that four hours could b e enough dela y to a v oid presen t bias.4 F nancial mark ets where arbitrage is giv en its b est c hance ha v e instead found signi can t deviations of assets prices from funda- men tals (Lei et al. 2001), con tradicting (within-lab) arbitrage. Researc hers in the eld also nd little evidence that individuals smo oth consumption o v er small gains (for a summary , see Halevy , 2014). Fifth, b oth psyc hologists and economists ha v e found that individual discoun ting can v ary across commo dities (Chapman 1996, T suk a y ama & Duc kw orth 2010, Reub en et al. 2010, Ubfal 2016). This is unsurprising if w e think of presen t-bias as self-con trol; not all items are equally tempting. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006), for instance, nd that although discoun ting parameters estimated using rice, ice cream, and money w ere correlated, only the estimates from money predict tak e-up of nancial commitmen t. Others also nd discoun ting estimated from money correlates with other in tertemp oral tradeo\u001bs (Chabris et al. 2008, Meier & Sprenger 2010, 2015) including those using CTB elicitations (Sa w ada & Kuroishi 4This con trasts with the fMRI study of McClure et al. (2007) that found \u0010immediacy\u0011 a\u001bects for gift cards deliv ered one hour after the decision, and whic h pro duced primary rew ards no so oner than a da y later, but ma y sp eak to their conjectures on the imp ortance on framing with monetary rew ards (p.5803). 22015, Andreoni et al. 2016, A ycinena et al. 2018, to name a few). Sixth, a v ariet y of ph ysiological evidence corrob orates the idea that the receipt of a cash rew ard presen ts the same as a primary rew ard. CTB results using cash correlate with pupil dilation (Lemp ert et al. 2015, 2016) and with 2D-4D digit ratios, an indicator of pre-natal discoun ting and presen t bias are signi can tly correlated with psyc hological measures of an ticipated emotional arousal at receiving monetary pa ymen ts o v er time. Finally , fMRI studies of temp oral discoun ting (McClure et al. 2004, 2007, Kable & Glim- c her 2007) using monetary incen tiv es ha v e not b een hamstrung b y arbitrage, and instead iden tify signi can t presen t bias. Also, in a piv otal study , Levy and Glimc her (2011, p. 14693) note an ob vious truth from b oth the economics and psyc hology of exc hange: \u0010The abilit y of h uman sub jects to c ho ose b et w een disparate kinds of rew ards suggests that the neural circuits for v aluing di\u001beren t rew ard t yp es m ust con v erge.\u0011 Their researc h lo ok ed at c hoices in v olving money , fo o d, and w ater, and found supp ort for the for t rew ard t yp es con v erge on a uni ed v aluation net w ork, whic h enables a direct comparison b et w een di\u001beren t rew ard t yp es and hence guides v alua- tion and c hoice.\u0011 That is, the brain has a mec hanism b y whic h money ac hiev es v alue b y its p oten tial to b e exc hanged for a primary rew ard, in something of a neural re-imagining of the Kiy otaki-W righ t (1993) mo del.5In a meta-study of 87 publications, Sescousse et al. (2013) nd substan tial o v erlap in brain areas in v olv ed in primary and monetary rew ards. In a large meta-analysis, Bartra, McGuire & Kable (2013) (see also Levy & Glimc her, 2012) conclude that the evidence \u0010aligns with an emerging consensus of a unitary system\u0011 (p. 424) of neural v alue of primary and monetary rew ards. W e rep ort on a CTB lab oratory study using the proto col of Andreoni et al. (2015), but adjusted to mak e arbitrage as easy as p ossible. W e exp erimen tally manipulate sub ject's initial liquidit y and sub jects allo cate receipts or pa ymen ts b et w een so oner or later dates, while equalizing the p oten tial future v alue of earnings. W e nd only a mo dest fraction of sub jects are arbitrageurs, and that money receipts and pa ymen ts ha v e distinct signatures 5See also Kn utson et al. (2001), Ballard & Kn utson (2009), Chib et al. (2009), and McNamee et al. (2013). See Y o o & Ha yden (2018) for a di\u001beren t in terpretation. 3of v as e nd no signi can t presen t bias in the receipt frame most closely resem bling Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) but nd signi can t presen t bias in the pa ymen t frame that is re ectiv e of the e\u001bort allo cation in Augen blic k et al. (2015). This framing e\u001bect is, lik e man y framing e\u001bects, di cult for t ypical economic mo dels to address. This mak es the nding b oth w orth replication and further in v estigation. The explanation ma y lie in understanding more precisely ho w brains assign v alues to options, and the role p ositiv e and negativ e frames ma y pla y in this.6 These results, in com bination with those from neuroscience, should so othe w orries that money is not a reliable rew ard when studying in tertemp oral c hoice. Moreo v er, they raise man y constructiv e new h yp otheses for ho w b oth money and commo dities generate v alue in exp erimen tal en vironmen ts, and ho w evidence on discoun ting could b e used to impro v e mo dels of in tertemp oral c hoice. 2 Arbitrage v ersus Narro w Brac k eting T o prefer arbitrage, sub jects m ust b e forw ard lo oking; they broadly brac k et their allo cations of money to maximize the presen t v alue of their incomes. T o p erform arbitrage, sub jects m ust ha v e access to capital mark ets and su cien t liquidit y to o\u001bset an y exp erimen pa ymen ts. T o exp ect sub jects to rev eal discoun t parameters using money rew ards w ould require decision mak ers to narro wly brac k et c hoices as they w ould with a desirable primary rew ard (Read et al. 1999, Rabin & W eizsac k er 2009). It is imp ortan t to note that making decisions that are not fully forw ard lo oking is not the same as consuming the allo cations immediately , only that they consume a o w of utilit y immediately . Narro w brac k eting is applied fre- quen tly in b eha vioral economics as a foundation for loss a v ersion, endo wmen t e\u001bects, men and more. Alternativ ely , one tak e the observ ation of di\u001beren t discoun t parameters for e\u001bort and money at face v alue; p erhaps the parameters are measured accurately for b oth money and e\u001bort, but individuals simply ha v e di\u001beren t discoun t factors for eac h. Imp ortan tly , suc h 6In this v ein, the w ork of Fisher & Rangel (2014) comes to mind. If a negativ e frame causes atten tion to b e xated on certain c hoices longer, this could result in the frame a\u001becting v alues and, in turn, rev ealed discoun ting rates. 4go o d-sp eci c discoun ting can easily lead to time-inconsisten t preferences. T o see this, imagine utilit y U(x;y) =u(x0) +v(y0) +\u000exu(x1) \u0010presen t bias\u0011 for the go o d one is relativ ely more impatien t for. W e need only app eal to Jac kson & Y ariv (2014) to demonstrate that go o d-sp eci c discoun t rates must result in time-inconsisten t preferences. A dditionally , w e sho w in App endix Section A.1 that for commo dit y c hoices to presen t accurate measures of discoun ting requires the additional assumption that the commo dit y in use has no complemen ts or substitutes with other items in the budget. As has b een the w a y of economics, hewing as closely as p ossible to Sam uelson's (1937) t utilit y allo wing commo dit y sp eci c discoun t rates w ould app ear to create an implausible degree of separabilit y across commo dities, and a tangled w eb of shifting time inconsisten t preferences. So, while the suggestion of commo dit y- sp eci c discoun ting has some app eal, it is p erhaps a quic k x to a larger and more c hallenging issue. 3 Exp erimen tal Design Sprenger (2015), Cohen et al. (2016) and DellaVigna (2018) pro vide recen t o v erviews of the di culties and adv ances in measuring discoun t rates. In ligh t of the fo cus on arbitrage precipitated b y the study of Augen blic k et al. (2015) comparing time and e\u001bort allo cations in the Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) Con v ex Time Budget framew ork, w e used the CTB design as mo di ed b y Andreoni et al. (2015). Sub jects w ere sho wn a series of in tertemp oral budgets. F or eac h budget, they c hose from a set of eigh t options to allo cate money o v er time at a xed in terest rate. Sub jects rst 5encoun tered eigh t allo cations b et w een the da y of the study and four w eeks in the future. Next w ere eigh t budgets o\u001bering allo cations b et w een four w eeks and eigh t w eeks in the future. Within eac h eigh t-budget decision sheet, sub jects started b y allo cating $21 at a 0% rate. The rate increased as sub jects w ork ed through the budgets. The rates di\u001bered sligh tly b et w een the rst (0-4 w eek) and second (4-8 w eek) allo cations so that sub jects w eren't strongly primed b y their rst decisions. In terest rates ranged from 0% to 28.5%. P articipan ts did not encoun ter the in terest rates directly , but instead sa w eigh t ev enly-spaced options of allo cations at the earlier date and the later date. The maxim um so oner allo cation w as alw a ys the left-most option and the maxim um later allo cation w as alw a ys the righ t-most option. The maxim um receipt/pa ymen t w as alw a ys $21. W e presen t details on eac h budget in App endix T able A1. The sub jects' instructions and decision sheets are in App endix Section B. 3.1 Exp erimen tal Conditions Our 2\u00022 t randomization o et w een-sub jects. In addition to allo cating either receipts or pa ymen ts across so oner and later dates, all sub jects also got an initial pa ymen t on the date of the study and nal pa ymen ts on the da y follo wing their last c hosen transaction. Initial pa ymen ts, whic h could b e negativ e, manipulated whether sub jects initial liquidit y is eased during the course of the study , or tigh tened. Final pa ymen tial future v alue of earnings at $23. All sub jects got early and later pa ymen ts to k eep the total n um b er of pa ymen ts constan t across sub jects. Credit-Receiv e (CR) sub jects participated in a standard implemen tation of the CTB c ho osing an allo cations of electronic transfers in to their bank accoun ts that could b e as high as $21, along with $1 initial and nal transfers (to equalize the n um b er of transactions across conditions). Credit-P a y (CP) sub jects receiv ed an initial transfer of $22 that could co v er an y of the subsequen t repa ymen t plans they could c hose to implemen t. They receiv ed a nal transfer of $22. Debit-Receiv e (DR) sub jects had to mak e an initial pa ymen t of $22 to the EconLab b efore c ho osing a sc hedule for the EconLab to pa y them bac k, th us had to remo v e $22 from their p ersonal funds. They receiv ed a nal transfer of , Debit-P a y (DP) 6sub pa ymen t of $1 from the EconLab (again, to equalize the n um b er of transactions) b efore c ho osing from a sc hedule of pa ymen ts to the EconLab, whic h could b e as high as $21. They receiv ed a nal transfer of $43. App endix T able A2 sho ws the design of eac h cell in our study and the asso ciated transfers. 3.2 Pro cedures Our sample consists of 128 UC San Diego undergraduate v olun teers, spread among 10 ex- p erimen tal sessions. W e recruited only studen ts with accoun ts at Chase Bank who w ould b e willing to use Chase Quic kP a y for exp erimen tal transactions. Chase main tains a branc h UC San Diego studen t cen ter, and Quic kpa y is a free service for Chase clien ts who also ha v e sa vings and c hec king accoun ts and a debit card. Prior to indicating their informed consen t, and regardless of subsequen t treatmen t randomization, participan ts w ere told that there w as a p ossibilit y they w ould ha v e use their o wn funds in the short run, although they w ere guar- an teed earnings commensurate with their time and e\u001bort in the long run. After consen t, ev ery one in the session w as randomized in to the same treatmen t. F ollo wing the session, one budget w as randomly selected as the budget-that-coun ts for pa ymen ts. This w as common to the session. Chase Quic kP a y o\u001bered a v ariet y of an tages for this study . First, participan ts w ere informed that while there w ould b e a stream of pa ymen ts b et w een them and the EconLab o v er the follo wing eigh t w eeks, they w ould not ha v e to come bac k to the lab at an y p oin t. Second, Quic kP a y allo w ed sc heduling ollo wing the participan ts' c hoices, but during the same session, w e sc heduled and v eri ed all pa ymen ts electronically , and an y pa ymen ts due on the date of the study w ere completed b efore sub jects left the lab. Third, all sub jects w ere required to sc hedule the same n um b er of transfers, regardless of their decisions. W e enforce this b y making $0.01 transfers on the dates where sub jects allo cate zero dollars. No pa ymen ts w ere made in cash. F ourth, c ho osing sub jects with accoun ts at a nancial institution with a ph ysical presence on campus w as the most natural w a y gain sub jects' con dence in the transfers, and th us facilitate arbitrage. In a p ost-exp erimen t questionnaire, 127 of 128 participan ts con rmed this con dence. Three participan ts did not complete their transactions as sc heduled and w ere remo v ed 7from the sample. Sev en did not resp ond to all 16 questions in their primary c hoice set and w ere also omitted, lea ving 118 sub jects in our estimation sample.7 4 Results T o compare c hoices across P a y and Receiv e conditions, and across budgets within eac h condition, w e create a v ariable equal to the fraction of p oten tial or residual income that is allo cated to the so oner p erio d. W e call this v ariable A djuste d So oner Inc ome , orASI . F or example, if a sub ject in a Receiv e condition c ho oses $7 to da y and $14 in four w eeks, from a budget that o\u001bered a maxim um of $21 to da y , her ASI is7=21 = 0:33 . If a sub ject in a P a y condition c ho oses $14 to da y and $7 in four w eeks, from a budget that allo w ed a maxim um pa ymen t of $21 to da y , her ASI is also 0:33 , b ecause the unpaid balance to da y is $7. If the four-w eek in terest rate increases to 5%, the maxim um so oner receipt or pa ymen t decreases to $20. Cho osing to receiv e $7 or pa y $13 to da y w ould th us corresp ond to an ASI of7=20 = 0:35 . A comparison of a v erage c hoices across budgets is presen ted in Figure 1. F or eac h c hoice w e plot the budget line that sub jects faced and the a v erage c hoice from it, b y condition. Sev eral observ ations are apparen t in this gure: 1) Choices v ary b y Receiv e/P a y framing. 2) A v erage c hoices are not near corner solutions except for at high in terest rates. While the a v erage in terior c hoice masks man y individual corner c hoices, it is notably inconsisten t with a unique mark et in terest rate that our relativ ely homogeneous sample can access. 3) When the in terest rate is 0%, or close to 0%, sub jects do not fully fron t-load income. This is esp ecially true in the P a y condition, and is inconsisten t with b oth the arbitrage h yp othesis and a mo del in whic h the marginal utilit y of income is non-decreasing. 4.1 T reatmen t E\u001bects on ASI Arbitraging sub jects should not b e a\u001bected b y Receiv e-P a y v ariation in framing. W e test for di\u001berences across conditions in t w o w a ys. First, w e ask whether the distribution of ASI 7In addition to the results rep orted here, our data collection also consisted of a second set of c hoices for eac h sub ject that switc hed the sub jects' pa y/receiv e condition to the opp osite. Since w e found strong order e\u001bects (whic h are also inconsisten t with arbitrage, and in in teresting and complex w a ys) w e opted, due to constrain ts on w ords, to set this data aside for later analysis. 8021021r = 0021020.84r = 0.008021020.71r = 0.014021020.33r Credit-Pay Debit-Receive Debit-PayFigure 1: A v erage Choices b y Budget and Condition 9T able 1: E\u001bect of Condition on A djusted So oner Income Mo del: T obit OLS D V: ASI ASI 1(ASI = 1) 1(ASI = 0) (1) (2) (3) (4) P a 10 10 10 10 Bo otstrap wild- o otstrapp ed for OLS mo dels, and score-b o otstrapp otest' command in Stata, with a seed of 1.

Second, w e regress ASI on P a y and Debit indicator v ariables, and their in teractions. 8App endix Figure A1 sho ws the empirical CDF s of ASI for eac h condition. 9Related results on gain-loss framing, see Lo ew enstein (1988). 10W e use sub ject-mean ASI in our distributional tests, so N= 118 . 10BecauseASI is constructed to lie b et w een zero and one, w e use a T obit mo del to estimate the demand for ASI .11A dditionally , w e consider whether the lik eliho o d of censoring at eitherASI = 1 or0 dep ends on exp erimen tal condition. Because treatmen t is randomized at the session lev el, clustering standard errors at the session lev el is appropriate here. With only ten sessions, ho w ev er, this clustering can b e unreliable (Donald & Lang 2007). W e therefore adopt the wild-b o otstrap cluster suggested b y Cameron et al. (2008) for the OLS mo dels. F or the T obit mo del, w e use the score-b o otstrap generalization of the wild b o otstrap from Kline & San tos (2012). Results are in T able 1.

That is, w e should observ e exclusiv ely corner solutions.

While w e reject arbitrage in general, it is imp ortan t to ask whether individual sub jects mak e c hoices consisten t with arbitrage. These sub jects ha v e at most one switc h p oin t, mo ving from all-so oner to all-later income as the in terest rate rises. They ha v e at most one in terior c hoice, and it will lie on the budget separating the t w o sets of corner c hoices. A cross all treatmen ts, 33% of sub jects meet this de nition of an arbitrageur. Ho w ev er, there is heterogeneit Debit-Receiv (32%), a y and nally Debit-P a y (24%). Notice that Credit-Receiv e is framed lik e a standard CTB and has nearly t wice as man y arbitrageurs as the Debit-P a y treatmen t, whic h has a negativ e frame in common with e\u001bort supply . The strong treatmen t e\u001bect on arbitrageurs is further evidence against arbitrage in gen- eral, and raises questions of whether arbitrage is ev en an ob jectiv e of those w e ha v e just lab eled arbitrageurs. It indicates that no more than a quarter of all p eople w ould b e arbi- trageurs regardless of the frame.21 6 Conclusion There is a ric h and ev olving literature on estimating structural preference parameters for temp oral discoun ting. Researc hers ha v e long relied on monetary rew ards for these estimates. 21F or example, Kuhn et al. (2017) nd that b ehaiv or consisten onds to h unger and satiation. 17F rom the b eginning, ho w ev er, researc hers ha v e noted the concern that arbitrage of cash rew ards remo v es from the data of an y signs of h yp erb olic discoun ting that exists o v er primary rew ards. Since arbitrage requires broad brac k eting of decisions and presen t bias is oted in narro w brac k eting, this argumen t suggests an in teresting mo del in whic h sub jects in tegrate monetary rew ards in to long run nancial plans, y et when faced with opp ortunities to sp end that money submit to narro w brac k eting and displa y presen t bias. T o explore the h yp othesis that money ma y not b e a reliable rew ard when studying in- tertemp oral c hoice, w e constructed a direct lab oratory test of arbitrage. T o giv e arbitrage its b est c hance, w e recruited sub jects with su cien t liquidit y to arbitrage against the exp er- imen tal pa ymen ts. Next, all pa ymen ts b et w een the EconLab and our sub jects w ere made with instan t and direct bank transfers. This mec hanically made arbitrage b oth ob vious and easy . It also made \u0010to da y\u0011 pa ymen ts immediate. W e used our 2\u00022 design to either add to liquidit y b y crediting their bank accoun ts (Credit Condition), or force sub jects to pa y us up-fron t and th us restrict their liquidit y (Debit condition). Finally , w e framed the actions of the sub jects as c ho osing either when to receiv e cash pa ymen ts from us (Receiv e condition) or when to pa y cash to us (P a y condition). All four cells of the study o\u001bered sub jects iden tical maxim v alue, and iden tical transaction costs, and th us arbitrage w ould mak e the same predictions for eac h cell. Our direct tests strongly con tradict the arbitrage h yp othesis. First, the c hoice frame matters. Sub jects in the Receiv e conditions demanded signi can tly more so oner income than those in the P a y frames. Second, not all c hoices w ere made at corner solutions as arbitrage requires, esp ecially at lo w in terest rates. Finally , w e nd no evidence of presen t bias in the Credit-Receiv e condition, the condition corresp onding to standard implemen tations of the CTB. By con trast, w e nd sizable presen t bias in the Credit-P a y condition, whic h has imp ortan t framing elemen ts in common with the e\u001bort-allo cation task of Augen blic k et al. (2015). The Debit conditions\u0016whic h w ere designed to fa v or arbitrage\u0016sho w ed no di\u001beren tial e\u001bects from the Credit conditions. Neuro economists ha v e argued that, m uc h lik e ho w monetary theory accoun ts for money , for the brain to mak e c hoices across disparate bask ets of go o ds, it m ust ha v e a means\u0015a 18currency\u0015for comparing v alues. Levy & Glimc her (2012) measured sub jects' rates of ex- c hange b et w een money and v arious fo o d items outside of the fMRI scanner, then used this exc hange rate to predict the neural exc hange rate while in the scanner. They concluded that, \u0010Both rew ard t yp es did predict the exc hange rate b et w een money and fo o d across our sub ject p o ol,\u0011 supp orting the notion of direct v alue for economic (and neural) currency .22A ma jor meta-analysis b y Bartra et al. (2013), nds a di\u001beren t route to the same conclusion. They state, \u0010A principal insigh t from researc h on classical conditioning is that a conditioned stim ulus can come to in uence b eha vior in the same manner as the primary rew ards with whic h it is asso ciated. Money is presumably an esp ecially w ell learned secondary incen tiv e.\u0011 What do es our study sa y ab out the within-sub ject di\u001berences found discoun ting to w ard ersus money? In ligh t of our ndings rejecting arbitrage and the neurological evidence that money pa ymen ts are lik ely part of a unitary rew ard system, it w ould seem that rejecting either one of the measuremen ts on the basis of the rew ard media could not b e supp orted. Instead w e p erhaps need to ask what it w ould imply for economic theory to accept b oth measuremen ts as re ecting something true ab out preferences. T o do so w ould b e to in te- grate di\u001beren t lev els of impatience for di\u001beren t commo dities in to a single utilit y framew ork, and p erhaps ev en (as suggested b y our ndings) di\u001beren t lev els of impatience for the same commo dit y dep ending on ho w the c hoice is framed. Un til this is accomplished, ho w ev er, an ob vious implication of the w ork presen ted here is that using discoun t parameters from one go o d to predict c hoices on another could b e misleading. Best practices w ould app ear to indicate that if the researc her is in terested in p olicies for e\u001bort, then discoun ting should b e measured with e\u001bort. When the application is to money , the b est media to use to design p olicies regarding p ersonal nance is most lik ely money . Giv en the ubiquit y of Sam uelson's (1937) mo del, the w ell learned re ex for assuming time separabilit y and constan t discoun ting ma y ha v e led economists to force the in terpretation of most data to t this approac h. Is it only the structure giv en b y Sam uelson (1937) that mak es us surprised to see di\u001beren t commo dities ruled b estingly , Sam (1937) himself w arned of this. He sa ys (page 139) that the mo del of discoun ted utilit y has \u0010serious limitations...whic h almost certainly vitiate it ev en from a the- 22See also imp ortan t con tributions b y Chib et al. (2009) and McNamee et al. (2013). 19oretical p oin t of view.\u0011 The questionable assumption he p oin ts to rst and most strongly is time-separable preferences. Abstracting a w a y from time-separabilit y and constan t discoun t- ing, w e can alternativ ely in terpret the data as sa ying the marginal rates of in tertemp oral substitution within a go o d o v er time, or b et w een go o ds o v er time, can b e di\u001beren t. More- o v er, they ma y dep end on past, curren t, or p erhaps future lev els of consumption, accoun ting for endogenous tastes. The question for researc h will then b e can w e fashion a tractable and exible theory that will allo w us to analyze in tertemp oral c hoice from a pro ductiv e and realistic p ersp ectiv e. Giv en our ev er-sharp er to ols of exp erimen tal economics, w e ma y b e able to go b ey ond Sam uelson's self-describ ed \u0010arbitrary\u0011 assumptions and, as he suggested, let observ able facts shap e a more full mo del of preferences. 20References Andersen, S., Harrison, G.

On Using Money to Measure In tertemp oral Preferences\u0011 b y J.Andreoni, C. Gra v ert, M.Kuhn, S. Saccardo,& Y. Y ang. A.1 On Measuring Discoun ting with Consumption As stated in the text, it is also necessary that there b e no other items in a sub ject's curren t or future consumption that is a complemen t or substitute for the consumption b eing used as a rew ard in the lab. This p oin t is most easily con v ey ed with a n um b er of examples. Example 1. Substitutes. A sub ject sp ends e\u001bort e eac h p erio h . F or simplicit y assume no discoun ting and no in terest. She liv es for three p +u(1\u0000e2) +u(1\u0000e3) , whereu(\u0001) is strictly conca v e. She has 1 units of w ork to complete, th us faces the budget constrain t e1+e2+e3= 1 . Giv en this she will c ho ose ek= 1=3 for allk . Supp ose sub ject in an exp erimen t and is required to exert e\u001bort x1+x2= 1 . If the exp erimen t is at the start of da y 1 and she has y et to consume an y w ork or leisure, she will again allo cate her total e\u001bort (no w increased b y 1 unit) equally across the three p erio ds: e1+x1=e2+x2=e3= 2=3 . This has a con tin uum of solutions for x1 andx2 , and since w e do not observ e ek for an yk , w e learn nothing ab out preferences from this exercise. Here the substitutablit y b et w een e\u001bort in the exp erimen t or outside the exp erimen t leads to a fully uninformativ e exp erimen t. Example 2. F utur e Flexibility. Con tin ue with the prior example, but no w supp ose the exp erimen t comes in the middle of the da y and the sub ject has already sp en t e1= 1=3 units w orking. No w to smo oth her w ork equally she m ust c ho ose x1= 1=3 ,x2= 2=3 ,e2= an y sub ject will b e more constrained to da y when the task w as unan ticipated than in the future when the e\u001bort is an ticipated, w e naturally exp ect more cases of e\u001bort b eing higher later. If w e neglect this, then observing only x1 andx2 w ould incorrectly lead us to conclude the sub ject is presen t-biased when in fact she is c ho osing leisure in the 27exp erimen t to smo oth her consumption. This example mirrors the conclusions of Carv alho et al. (2016). This example sho ws problems with e\u001bort pro vision when it in teracts with on some o w of consumption already exp erienced to da y , and the relativ ely greater exibilit y one has later to absorb the an ticipated demands for e\u001bort (or supply of fo o d rew ards) in the future than in the curren t p erio d. Example 3 Complements. Supp ose a sub ject consumes go o ds a andb all of whic h are fully p erishable. The the endo wmen ts in p erio ds the sub ject a c hoice b et w een one unit of a1 and t w o a2 . The sub ject will strictly prefer t w o a2 , leading the exp erimen Next, the ter o\u001bers one b1 or t w ob2 . No w the sub ject prefers one b1 , leading the exp erimen ter to infer \u000e<1=2 . Th us, eac h go o d leads to m utually exclusiv e conclusions. No w in tro duce a new commo dit y c whic h can b e con v erted to either a orb 1-to-1, and, moreo v erc is storable (i.e. c is money). Supp ose, ho w ev er, that the sub ject treats c as p erishable as w ell, that is, she narro w brac k ets her decision. The exp erimen ter o\u001bers a c hoice b et w een 1 unit of c1 ork units ofc2 . F or an y k < 1=\u000e the sub ject will prefer c1 while for an y k>1=\u000e the sub ject strictly prefer the k units ofc2 . This p erfectly rev eals the sub ject's\u000e . Example 3 sho ws ho w money can b e a sup erior w a y to elicit preferences if the sub ject narro w brac k ets consumption. The reason is that, other than discoun ting, money will ha v e a relativ ely constan t v alue across p erio ds that will not b e c hanged m uc h b y prior sp ending of money or recen t consumption of other go o ds. Y ou can notice that if w e brough t in a capital mark et through broadly brac k eting the c hoice, Example 3 w ould end with the exp erimen ter nding the p +r , wherer is the relev an t mark et rate faced b y the sub ject rather than k= 1=\u000e b y Condition .5.6.7.8.91Choice at Corner or Corner-adjacent28.525.116.310.2654.73.331.81.40.80.304-week Interest Rate (Percent) Sample Mean Upper Bound of 99% Condence Interval Figure A2: Corner Solution F requency Exp erimen tal In terest Rate 29Figure Corner and In terior Solutions on the Zero-in terest Budgets T able A1: In terest Rates Horizon: 0-4 W eeks 4-8 W eeks Budget 4-wk Rate Max.

Today's study will involve payments between you and the UCSD Econlab that will take place over the next 8 weeks. All the decisions about timing and amounts of these payments will be made today, in the EconLab, and you will not need to return to the Econlab, as all payments will be made electronically. The whole process will take about an hour. By the end of the 8 weeks, you can expect to have total earning of at least $15 and at most $25. Eligibility for this study To participate in this study you will need to understand and agree to several things. Please read this section very carefully. If you feel that you do not meet all of the criteria below, please let us know and we will excuse you from the study. To take part in this study the following must be true for you: You must have an online Chase bank account with a minimum of $22 in your account. You must be enrolled in Chase QuickPay and willing to log in to your online banking during the study. While you will surely earn money in this study, achie ving you final earnings will sometime involve you making payments to the EconLab as well as you receiving money from the EconLab. You must be willing to receive your payment from the EconLab and to the EconLab via Chase QuickPay. You must be willing to provide your name and e -mail address, as required by Chase QuickPay. This information will only be seen by Professor Andreoni and his assistants when using QuickPay. After the final payment has been sent, this information will be des troyed. Your identity will not be part of any subsequent data analysis. No personal bank data will be collected during the experiment. Once you decide to participate, you must faithfully carry out all payments. If you do not agree or do not meet all of t hese criteria please inform us now. Thank you! Exp erimen tal Instructions 36Earning money In today's study, you will encounter 4 scenarios and make 8 choices in each scenario, for a total of 32 choices. Each of the 32 choices will be over how to allocate money between two points in time. One time is \"earlier\" and one time is \"later\". Both the earlier and later times may vary across different scenarios. While your final earnings from the experiment will be between $15 and $25, however the dates that you will receive these earnings will depend on the scenario. You could have your earnings as early as today before the end of the experiment, as late as 8 weeks and a day from today, or a date in between. All the payments will be done via Chase Quick Pay and will be scheduled by you today. Once all 32 decisions have been made, we will randomly select 1 of the 4 scena rios and then 1 of the 8 choices from that scenario as the decision -that-counts . All 8 choices in a scenario will be on one sheet of paper: so one scenario corresponds to one decision sheet. The randomly selected scenario and choice will determine the exact amount of your actual earnings. Since all scenarios and choices are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each choice in each scenario as if it will be the decision -that-counts . Important : You will be given a total of 4 decision sheets, each with 8 decisions, making 32 decisions in total. At the top of each decision sheet you will be informed about the scenario for the choices. At the end of the session today, you will schedule the payments of the decision- that-counts via Quick Pay, according to the days indicated by the decision -that-counts . IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for you to receive your earnings from this study, you must schedule the payments truthfully based on your choi ce on the decision -that-counts and the selected scenario . We sincerely appreciate your cooperation. On your table is a business card of Professor Andreoni with his contact information. Please keep this in a safe place. If one of your payments is not rec eived you should immediately contact Professor Andreoni. Please do not talk out loud during the rest of the study today. If you have any questions, please raise your hand, and someone will come to speak with you in private. The decisions you will make are best described by examples, so before we begin the study, we are going to work through some examples of the choices and scenarios together. When instructed to do so, please turn the page to begin the examples.
