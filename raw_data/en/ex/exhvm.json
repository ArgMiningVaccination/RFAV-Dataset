The most common customs of Zacatecas are the Festivals, Festivals, and Fairs of Zacatecas. The main festivals in Zacatecas are the religious ones that are celebrated in each one of the municipalities in honor to the patron of the place, also the regional celebrations, in the capital of the state the celebrations are celebrated in the month of September, being day 8 when The Virgin of Patronage is also commemorated. There are also various events in the fair 's cultural and artistic facilities, such as bullfights, Palenque, exhibitions, dances, horse races and gastronomic exhibitions. Also, there are This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. Rest cure was administered to women with intense nervous signs and symptoms. The rest cure was introduced by S. Weir Mitchell who sought to find the cause of varying appearance of nervousness which was known as nervous exhaustion in the nineteenth century. He found out nervous exhaustion was caused by anemia and an irritating environment either in the workplace or at home. The solution to nervous exhaustion according to Weir was the rest cure which kept the patient away from their stressful environment and placed them in an intense regimen of six to eight weeks of total bed rest, massage, mild exercise and controlled diet. The patient was not allowed any form of activity except only cleaning the teeth (Bassuk 251). Daphnia are grown as fish food, and used to test ecotoxicity. Ecotoxicology is defined as, \"the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context\" (Truhaut, 1977). The experiment discussed in this lab report was performed on daphnia, exploiting their transparency which renders them the ideal organism, to test effects of various stimulus on cardiac activity. Past research studies have found ethanol to produce a depressant effect, one similar to the depressant effects of melatonin, and GABA. In contrast, Corotto (2010) has experimented on stimulants, e.g. nicotine, and found an approximate 20% increase in HR. The data presented in this lab report was observed manually. In this experiment, cardiac activity is being determined via measurement of i.e. heart rate. (HR) For this experiment, the daphnia was subjected to different chemicals via submersion. These chemicals were used as stimuli to prompt altered cardiac activity. The purpose of this experiment, is to test whether two select depressants or stimulants, when administered together, produce a synergistic, antagonistic or no effect on Aging: Treating Asian Indian American elders can be very difficult. For example, many elders consider the old-style Indian system of medicine called \"Ayurvedic Medicine\" means preventing and curing illness. This system suggests herbal supplements to cure and prevent illnesses. Elder patients from India don't prefer taking medicines that are prescribed by their doctors. Native American author, Mourning Dove, stated, \"What kept us going, was the knowledge that everything on earth has its purpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission. That is the Indian theory of existence.\" (Mourning, 1990, p. 69) Histories that deal with health, illness, and medicine in America, often make passing mention of Native Americans as healers or sources of knowledge about medicine. Similarly, histories of Native-American cultures and early European contact pay attention only to health and healing with respect to these cross-cultural interactions. Many books and articles have been written on Native American medicine. However, there have been virtually no scientific studies done on tribal healing practices, undoubtedly due to the spiritual nature of the treatments. Some of these historical pieces of literature attempt to assess the impact of Native-American knowledge of New World herbs on the knowledge and practice of early-American elite physicians and botanists. Healing and medical practices of Native Americans has been obscured by time but there is anecdotal evidence available and competing perspectives about the true values of Native American healing practices Herbal products have been used for treatments since ancient times, before the exploration of synthetic industrial drugs. Since herbs are natural, most of the consumers believes herbal products are completely safe and the product use continuously increased and is reported 10-19% growth in United States. In U.S.A any botanical product affects the structure and functions of the body belongs to either a drug or dietary supplement and FDA regulates the dietary supplement. The author of this paper selected St. John's wort ,as the herbal supplement for this assignment of patient educational flyer. This assignment is about the study of the effect of agonist and different concentration on guinea pig ileum and it will consist of method, graph results and discussion. Acupuncture for back pain is proven to be an effective therapy when performed by experienced acupuncturists. Many studies have shown that acupuncture can alleviate chronic back pain and enhance well-being in general. The studies also show that acupuncture techniques provide better results in relieving back pain than physical therapies and medications. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) The history of medicine goes back over thousands of years and is still developing today. Medicine was used to diminish illness and heal injury since the beginning of humanity. In ancient times, if one was to become sick or injured, Egypt would have been the best place to do so. Egyptians chances of survival would have been remarkably better than those of one's foreign peer, but one had the opportunity of being treated by a physician whose work was displayed all over the ancient world and has made a huge impact and change in the modern world that we know today. Although animals are in ample supply and typically are good models for human beings, they are not the highest fidelity model. In some cases when analyzing the side effects on an animal subject to see how it would effect a human, the results can be as accurate as flipping a coin (Archibald 1). No test can be one hundred percent accurate when regarding humans if the subjects used are an entirely different species. The best way to see what would happen to a human being is to test a human Drugs that pass animal tests could not necessarily be safe. In the 1950s, a sleeping pill was created called thalidomide. The pill was tested on animals prior to it 's release. Since then, the pill had caused 10,000 babies to be born with severe deformations. Later, another sleeping pill was tested on animals. However, it didn 't work on the animals unless if it was taken in large doses. So then it was suggested that humans take the same dose. However, it was much more effective on humans, so they only had to take small doses, instead of the large doses the animals needed. This caused tons of cardiac heart diseases and heart attacks. Almost 27,000 The University of Maryland Medical Center states that Herbal Therapy also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using plant's, seeds, berries, leaves, barks, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control, along with advances in clinical research, show the value of herbal medicine in treating and preventing diseases. Herbal medicine is a natural, non-toxic way to treat many conditions of ill-health. It is holistic, meaning it treats the whole person, embracing all levels of an individual: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Herbal medicines are widely preferred by some individuals all When exploring what is health, it looks at the idea of an individual being free from illness or injuries (World Health Organization 1948). WHO further explains that it is the state of complete: physical, mental, and social well-being and not the absence of disease or infirmity (health context, 2018) "}
