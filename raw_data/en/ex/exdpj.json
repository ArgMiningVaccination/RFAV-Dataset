Like hundreds of parents whose children are sufferers, he believes autism is becoming more common, and he suspects a link with measles vaccinations, particularly the three-in-one measles, mumps and rubella [A recent statement from the Medical Research Council](/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/04/10/nmmr10.html) said that there was no new evidence of a link. But, like the National Autistic Society (NAS), Mr Thrower insists that this does not rule out the possibility of a risk. |Taking nothing for granted: Charlotte Moore with Sam, eight (left), and George, 10 - both are autistic - and their younger brother Jake| On Thursday, the condition will be examined at a conference at Imperial College, London, organised by the NAS. Speakers are expected to include Dr Andrew Wakefield, the Royal Free Hospital gastroenterologist who first suggested a link between the vaccine, bowel disease and autism. At stake is public confidence in the childhood vaccination programme. Scare stories have already led to a decline in MMR take-up, and health officials fear a resurgence of measles. Meanwhile, there are more than 200 High Court cases under way claiming the vaccine has damaged children. The Health Department has repeatedly dismissed the association with MMR, the latest reassurance coming after the research council reported \"no new evidence to suggest a causal link between March 1998 and September 1999\". Oliver's autism started suddenly, as in other children whose parents point a finger at the vaccine. Mr Thrower, who has given up his job as a transport planner to do research into the issue, says: \"Oliver showed the first signs of withdrawal and odd behaviour at the age of 15 months, shortly after his measles vaccination. Slowly, he regressed, and today, we have a 13-year-old whose behaviour is, in effect, that of a two-year-old. \"Parents like me are not freaks. We know our children were not born with autism. With other autistic children, parents sense there is something unusual almost from birth. That was not the case with Oliver, or many other children like him. \"I believe there is a coherent pattern emerging alongside a substantial rise in prevalence of autism.\" However, he accepts that MMR may not be the whole explanation: \"Environmental triggers, interacting with genetic susceptibility or, perhaps, other conditions could also be relevant.\" Trying to get a scientific grip on what exactly is going on is difficult. About 500,000 people in this country are said to have a disorder within the \"autistic spectrum\", including Asperger syndrome. Some health and education workers attribute the apparent rise to improved public awareness and better diagnosis. Yet many parents still complain about delays in diagnosis. Mr Thrower says: \"Common sense suggests a rise in prevalence. We all know that 20 years ago there were not so many children affected.\" One major shortcoming is the lack of accurate figures on prevalence. The last big study was carried out in this country in the Seventies. That study looked at children with IQ levels below 70, and found an autism rate of 20 per 10,000. Smaller studies since have suggested much higher rates. They include a Swedish study of children with an IQ of 70 or above, which found a rate of 71 per 10,000. Mr Thrower's research found that the Wakefield Local Education Authority had five cases of autism in 1992 and 111 in 1999. He also reports that an audit of three-year-old boys in the East Surrey Health Authority disclosed a prevalence rate of one in 69 - \"that would be the highest rate in the world\" - while in West Surrey it was zero. Most recently, at the launch of a new all-party parliamentary group on autism, Dr Fiona Scott of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University described her latest findings for Cambridgeshire. Her study, to be published soon in The Lancet, showed a rate of one in 175 or around 60 in 10,000. One in eight children with special educational needs, she says, had an autistic spectrum disorder. Officially, the NAS describes all the new figures as \"interesting\", but stresses they do not provide a reliable prevalence rate: \"These issues will remain a matter for speculation unless we have a long-term health department-sponsored study.\" There is some good news. The Medical Research Council's recent announcement of a \u00a3330,000 study into the causes of autism - the largest ever attempted - was widely welcomed. Mr Thrower says: \"It is a step in the right direction. The scientists will look at medical records for clues to establishing a cause.\" However, he remains concerned, as does the NAS. A spokesman insists: \"We believe a key priority is an epidemiological study to establish whether or not there has been "}
