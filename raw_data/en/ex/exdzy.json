Article contents Mid-term follow-up after COVID-19 vaccination in adults with CHD: a prospective study Published online by Cambridge University Press: 11 April 2023 Abstract Long-term data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and acceptance in adults with CHD are lacking. This is a prospective study including adults with CHD patients undergoing COVID-19 vaccination from January 2021 to June 2022. Data on adverse events, antispike IgG titre, previous or subsequent COVID-19 infection, booster doses, and patients' attitude towards vaccination were collected. Four hundred and ninety CHD patients (36 \u00b1 13 years, 53% male, 94% with moderate/complex defects) were prospectively included: (0.6%) Janssen Vaccine; 310 (63%) received a booster dose. Median follow-up after vaccination was 1.53 [1.41-1.58] years. No major adverse event was reported. Eighty-two fully vaccinated patients contracted COVID-19 during follow-up after a median of 5.4 [4.3-6.5] months from the last dose. One patient with Ebstein's disease died from severe COVID-19. Symptoms' duration in patients who tested positive after vaccination was significantly shorter than in the group tested positive before vaccination (5.5 [3-8] versus 9 [2.2-15] days, p = 0.04). Median antispike IgG titre measured in 280 individuals (57%) at a median of 1.4 [0.7-3.3] months from the last dose was 2381 [901-8307] BAU/ml. Sixty patients (12%) also showed positive antinucleocapsid antibodies, demonstrating previous SARS-COV2 exposure. Twenty-nine percent appeared to have concerns regarding vaccine safety and 42% reported fearing potential effects of the vaccine on their cardiac disease before discussing with their CHD cardiologist. COVID-19 vaccines appear safe in the mid-term follow-up in adults with CHD with satisfactory immunogenicity and reduction of symptoms' duration in case of infection. - Type - Original Article - Information [Cardiology in the Young](/core/journals/cardiology-in-the-young), [First View](/core/journals/cardiology-in-the-young/firstview), pp. 1 - 7 - Copyright - \u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.
