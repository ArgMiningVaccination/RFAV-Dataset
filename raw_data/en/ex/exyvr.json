Doctors sometimes refer to them as alternative or complementary therapies. There is a growing interest in using energy therapies for a variety of health conditions. This article will cover different types of energy therapy and focus on Reiki, acupuncture, and acupressure. It will go over the common uses of energy therapy and the scientific evidence that supports them. People have used energy healing therapies for thousands of years. The principles of energy therapies [support](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349039163_Energy_Healing_Therapies_A_Systematic_Review_and_Critical_Appraisal) the idea that illnesses and imbalances are due to blocks or imbalances in the invisible biofield that [exists](https://www.counseling.org/news/aca-blogs/aca-counseling-corner/aca-member-blogs/2019/06/12/biofield-therapies#) in and around the body. Energy therapy techniques harmonize the energy fields in and around the body to promote health and well-being. They may also help encourage positive thoughts and emotions. A trained practitioner or healthcare professional performs energy therapy treatments using various noninvasive techniques. Often, people use energy therapies as a complementary treatment alongside conventional treatments. Popular types of energy therapy include [Reiki](/articles/308772), acupressure and [acupressure mats](/articles/acupressure-mat#acupressure). Reiki and acupressure Reiki is a [complementary](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/reiki) [Reiki](/articles/308772) include the belief that each individual has the innate energy to heal themselves. A Reiki practitioner can reportedly manipulate the universal life force energy of their client and encourage the natural healing process. A Reiki session involves the healer placing their cupped hands lightly on or near the recipient's body. Usually, the practitioner keeps their hands in one area for a minimum of 3 minutes, depending on the person's needs. Acupressure is another form of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) similar to acupuncture. Instead of needles, the technique uses manual pressure to stimulate acupoints, so that \"qi,\" or the body's energy,\" can move freely. A person can do this on their own or with a practitioner. [Acupuncture](/articles/156488#what-is-acupuncture) Acupuncture is a TCM practice that involves manipulating the body's energy. However, modern medicine has also proven its effectiveness by explaining the body's changes from the practice. [These changes include](https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/acupuncture-scientific-evidence/): - inflammatory responses - neurochemical responses, including dopamine, serotonin, and endorphin production - immune responses, such as white blood cell increase - circulatory responses This type of therapy involves inserting blunt-tipped needles in specific body acupressure points. It [stimulates](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth) A qualified and licensed acupuncturist must perform this type of therapy. These professionals must have completed a minimum of a master's degree, and many have doctorate degrees in acupuncture. They must also complete national board certification by the [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.](https://www.nccaom.org/) The goal of energy therapy is to promote the free flow of energy. People can use it to treat a specific condition or boost well-being, while some use a combination of energy therapies. Energy therapy sessions are often available at massage and wellness centers and traditional medical settings, including hospitals and clinics. Individuals often use energy therapy to treat: - sleep concerns - wound healing [blood pressure](/articles/270644)issues and vomiting](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/269511) [fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248002) While it is difficult to scientifically measure certain aspects of energy therapy, including the energy of the body, some evidence supports using these treatments for treating certain conditions.

It may also positively affect stress levels, well-being, and sleep quality. The practitioners gave the 30-minute sessions at close distance, and some included light, stationary touching. There are also specific research studies into acupressure, Reiki, and acupuncture below: Acupressure research Evidence from a [2021 trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32811182/) [labor pain](/articles/322308) and the duration of contractions. However, more high quality trials are necessary to verify these findings. A [2020 systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32379678/) - pain - disability - sleep The researchers concluded that acupressure is an effective, safe, and low cost nonsurgical method to treat chronic lower back pain. Reiki research A small [2021 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871054/) [back pain](/articles/172943) and improving daily activities in people with intervertebral [disk herniation](/articles/191979). The results suggest that Reiki is an inexpensive way to quickly relieve pain and improve daily activities.

A person can talk with a prospective practitioner to ask questions and discuss their treatment goals. They can also find out more about a practitioner's training and experience. However, a person should still speak with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment, especially if they plan to add it to their current treatment plan. To determine if this type of treatment will be suitable for them, an individual should also discuss using alternative treatments, such as energy therapy, if they are pregnant, taking medications, or have a medical condition. People should not use energy therapies as the sole treatment for serious or life threatening symptoms or conditions. Several energy therapies may be beneficial for enhancing health, including Reiki, acupressure, and acupuncture to treat mental and physical conditions. A person can also consult a healthcare professional for advice and recommendations, especially if they wish to add energy therapies to their current treatment plan. "}
