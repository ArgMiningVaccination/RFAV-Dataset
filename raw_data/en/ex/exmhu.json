South Louisiana Community Coll ege (SLCC) exceeded t hree of the college's f ive Student Success targeted measures. First to second year retention performance improved by 3.8 percentage points from Year 3 and exceeded the Ye ar 4 target. Same institution graduation rates also improved from 5.2% to 9.6%, exceeding the Year 4 target set for this measure. Percent change in program completers at the Associate degree level exceeded the college's target by 14.2 percentage points. Reporting year performance on p ercent change in program completers below the Associate degree level fell below the target established for this measure. However, performance on this measure for the most recent two years (average = 21.7% ) exceed ed average performance for prior reporting years (average = 21.3% ), indicating an acceptable level of performance on this measure for the reporting year. Reasons for a decline in reporting year performance on this measure are as follows : Decrease in Technic al Student Enrollment . Fall 2010 enrollment on the campuses of the former Acadiana Technical College (ATC) totaled more than 5,000 students. Enrollment on those same campuses dropped to 4,150 in Fall 2011 and 3,550 in Fall 2012. A variety of factors contributed to this enrollment decline, incl uding impact of the merger of ATC and SLCC, challenges associated with implementation of the Banner Student Information System , and Technical Program Redesign (see below) . The reduction in total number of students entering technical programs over the past three years has subsequently reduced the total number of student s eligible to earn degree credentials in those programs. The vast majority of certificates awarded by SLCC are in the technical program areas, so fewer students enrolled in those programs over time resulted in fewer certificates being awarded in the repor ting year. Technical Program Redesign . With t he merger of ATC and SLCC , a comprehensive overhaul of technical programs was launched. Low enrollment programs on individual campuses were eliminated and program offerings were consolidated among the seven te chnical campuses of the former ATC to improve institutional efficiency and instructional productivity. Additionally, moratoriums were placed on enrollment in a number of technical programs based on the availability of suitably qualified faculty . Collecti vely, these actions had an impact on the total number of students in the technical degree seeking cohort and, subsequently, the total number of credentials awarded. Award productivity performance for the reporting year fell 0.03 points below the targe t for this measure. However, award p roductivity levels for the most recent two years ( average = 0.35) exceeds average performance for prior three years ( average = 0.29) , indicating an acceptable level of performance on this measure for the reporting year. Award p roductivity levels in the reporting year were clearly impacted by the factors delineated above. Given the decline in technical program enrollment, a comparable decline in annual undergraduate FTE for the college would be expected. This was not th e case for SLCC in the current reporting year. Declines in technical program FTEs were more than offset by FTE gains in non - technical degree programs and non -degree seeking student instruction . Con sequently, the college's award productivity measure was n egatively impacted by this shift in FTE hour production from technical to non - technical program instruction . The college's performance in the number and percent change in program completers at the Associate degree level provides evidence that SLCC succe ssfully continues to pursue the goal of improving program completion and award rates. The college's performance with regard to completions at the less than Associate degree level and, subsequently, award productivity during the reporting year are a reflection of a fundamental redesign of the offerings of the college and not an indication of inattention to the college's fundamental charge o f successfully producing completers. Page 2 of 9 Student success policies/programs/initiatives implemented/continued during the reporting year. Policies Continued /Adopted South Louisiana Community College follows policies set forth by the Louisiana Community and Technical College System (LCTCS) and as well as the institution itself. These policies promote student success opportunities through recognition of student achie vement and completion of degree program s. LCTCS policies to help students acquire a degree include amnesty from past attempts in postsecondary education; cross enrollment opportunities for students with sch edule conflicts; awarding cre dit for past experiences and/or certifications; credit for high school courses that meet articulation agreements; and dual enrollment opportunities . The LCTCS policies include: 1.002 Delegation of Authority to Chancellors to S ign & Distribute Degr ees, Diplomas and Certificates. Effective date: May 10, 2000. 1.006 Academic Amnesty. Effective date: October 10, 2002. 1.010 Program Assessment of Effectiveness. Effective date: March 14, 2001. 1.014 Assessment. Effective date: Novemb er 14, 2001. 1.016 Cross Enrollment.

Effective date: August 14, 2002. 1.036 Cross Enrollment Agreement Between System Institutions Inter -Institutional Cross - Enrollment Form. Effective date: July 9, 2003. 5.025 Tuition Discounts and Waivers. Effective date: August 10, 2005. SLCC also adheres to policies set by the Louisiana Board of Regents [ Board of Regents Policies ]. These policies address matters directly related to student success. For example, the Board stipulates minimally acceptable placement test scores in mathematics, reading and English. Again, these policies are the policies of SLCC and are implemented effective with their passage by Regents. During the reporting year, SLCC adopted Policy BO 300 - Hardship Waiver of Tuition and Fees Policy - effective August 1, 2012 - supporting student retention and completion . SLCC also continued to f ollow a procedure adopted at the time of the ATC/SLCC merger, allowing former ATC students enrolled prior to the merger to complete their degree program at the tuition prices set by the former ATC. This ensured that no ATC student prior to the merger woul d be hindered from completion of their program based on changes in tuition rates resulting from the merger Initiatives Implemented During the reporting year, SLCC launched a number of initiatives supporting Student Success college -wide. Curriculum Redesign . A comprehensive review of degree programs in the college was launched during the reporting year. Programs were evaluated to determine how they might be streamlined to reduce the number of credit hours for completion and to identify opportunitie s for additional program exit points. Many of the college's technical programs were semesterized, providing clear paths for student progress and more timely completion of these programs . Page 3 of 9 Redesign of Student Support Services . A complete redesign of SLCC 's Student Support Services area was completed. The college established a Student Success Center which offers advising for incoming students and non -degree seeking students, tutoring services for all SLCC students, Disability Services , and testing. Servi ces offered by the Student Success Center were extended to all SLCC campuses in the Acadiana region. The college also appointed a Director of Student Activities to coordinate student organization and student life activities. Collectively, these and other changes to the college's Student Services area are directly tied to goals of increasing student retention and completion. Redesign of College Administrative Structure. In response to the merger of ATC and SLCC, the college's administrative structure wa s completely realigned during the reporting year. The appointments of vice chancellors, deans, department chairs, and program coordinators were made with the goal of optimizing academic program support, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Spec ial Initiatives. During the reporting year, the college launched t hree special initiatives to that will directly impact Student Success. Taskforces were appointed to investigate and generate recommendations in the following areas: o Learning Foundations . This taskforce evaluated SLCC's developmental education offerings and options for improving success rates and more timely completion of developmental education requirements. Findings of this taskforce were reported April 2014. o College Success . This taskforce is charged with evaluating SLCC's College Success course offering. The taskforce is considering course content and structure which will optimize its applicability and effectiveness for future SLCC students. Findings of this taskforce are expec ted Fall 2014 . o 15 Is Full -Time . This taskforce investigated benefits and challenges of encouraging students to enroll 15 hours per semester in order to complete programs in a timely manner . Findings of this taskforce were reported April 2014 and a num ber of recommendations by this group have already been addressed by the college. Initiatives Continued In order to enhance student retention, students in the entering cohort are assigned to full -time faculty advisors. Students in the retention cohort were clearly identified to ensure that advisors paid special attention to contacting and advising these students. Advisors also worked proactively with degree - seeking students wi th more than 30 credit hours to guide these students toward graduation. Additionally, academic advisors worked with the large number of students identifying themselves as degree seeking transfer students not planning to complete their degrees with SLCC to encourage them to earn an associate degree before transferring to a four -year institution. Staff from the LEA s and SLCC meet regularly to discuss ways to strengthen dual enrollment. Career Coaches have also been employed by the SLCC t o assist high -school students to identify career goals and utilize resources to accomplish the goals. In addition to collaboration on career diploma implementation, LEA's and SLCC partner on numerous activities to educate students on options available at t he postsecondary level. These include but are not limited to the following: 1) Campus tours by middle and high school students 2) SLCC participation in high school career days 3) Awarding of SLCC credentials to dually enrolled students upon high school graduation (AGS, TCA, CTS and TD) Page 4 of 9 In 2008 , SLCC partnered with the Lafayette Parish School System (LPSS) to establish the first Early College Academy (ECA), or middle college, in Louisiana. The ECA is a partnership enabling secondary school students to simultaneou sly earn a high school diploma and an associate degree. This associate degree is fully articulated with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL) and is transferrable state - wide . In 2013, Lafayette Parish Schools committed $1 million to the construc tion of a new building on SLCC's Lafayette campus that will include a dedicated wing for the Early College Academy. SLCC and LPSS's long -term goal is to grow ECA enrollment to 1,000 students. Data -based evaluation, including student performance, conducted to ascertain effectiveness during the reporting year. During the reporting year, SLCC's Office of Institutional Effectiveness generated historical trend data for all degree programs including program enrollment, retention, and completion measures. The college's Associate Vice Chancellor of Institutional Effectiveness then met with deans, campus coordinators, and department chair s to provide guidance on the analysis and interpretation of trend data provided. Program administrators evaluated the performance of each program by campus and college -wide and reported results to the President's Cabinet. Based on these analyses, program redesign (as described earlier) was initiated. Programs were consolidated, suspended or terminated if past and anticipated performance indices pointed to the need for these changes. During the reporting year, SLCC also completed a comprehensive redesign of its academic program review process. Beginning in 2014 and into the future, SLCC academic program reviews will include a comprehensive assessment of program curriculum, student performance, and personnel characteristics to ensure the viability, effect iveness, and relevance of all academic degree programs. Tracking/monitoring/reporting mechanisms implemented/continued during the reporting year. During the reporting period, SLCC continued with the implementation of the Banner student information mana gement system and associated COGNOS data reporting software . This system has provided faculty and staff with a wider range of student information than was available in SLCC's legacy systems and support s student performance monitoring and retention efforts college -wide . South Louisiana Community College re-focused efforts to maintain a central repository for compiling and sharing information on student program progress information. A dedicated drive on the college's intranet [career degree plan on 'apollo \\faculty -staff shared \\ faculty departments' (K:)], developed in reporting year 2, allow s sharing of a ll student advising information including degree program audits assessing student progress to applicable exit point s. SLCC's new Student Services team has targeted efforts to ensure that all information shared in this depository is complete and up -to-date. Development/use of external feedback reports during the reporting year. Each SLCC degree program has an advisory committee which meet s once or more each academic year. Included in agenda of these committee meetings is the assessment of student performance in the respective degree program. Additionally, SLCC's accreditation cycle has provided the College w ith a continuous feedback from program/discipline accreditation agencies on its performance in meeting program objects in preparing students. Success of transfer students is reported to SLCC by 4 -year institutions in the State via reports of transfer - in rates and subsequent student performance at those institutions.

Policy #3.001 - Electro nic Learning Statements and Initial Procedures Note: Full content of these policies may be found here: LCTCS Policies The SLCC Catalog has policies and procedures that relate to admission requirements, academic amnesty, course load recommendations, attendance, non -traditional credit, degree plans, transfer agreements, cross enrollment, developmental studies, learning labs, and the Academic Success Center. ( SLCC Catalog ) Student retention and graduation rate support is also provided through the services offered by the college's Academic Success Cente r. This center provides tutoring services and assistance to students with academic challenges. The Associate of Arts Louisiana Transfer, the Associate of Science Louisiana Transfer, and the Associate of Science in Teaching degrees were created through statewide meetings of faculty from both community colleges and universities to assist Louisiana students in the transfer process. These three programs guarantee students beginning at community colleges transferability as a junior to Louisiana public universities, as long as the student completes the degree with a minimum of a 'C' in all courses and meets the university's eligibility standards for the junior level. SLCC participated in the process of creating the statewide programs. SLCC meets periodically with representatives of four -year institutions (primarily University of Louisiana at Lafayette , UL-L) providing opportunities to address articulation and transfer issues as they relate to the AALT, ASLT, or AST degrees. A UL-L tran sfer coordinator Page 2 of 4 is on -site at SLCC 's Lafayette campus on a regularly -scheduled monthly basis and additionally as needed to address transfer issues as they arise. Advisors are also able to contact or refer students directly to the transfer coordinator at any time. Tracking/monitoring/reporting mechanisms implemented/continued during the reporting year, especially as they pertain to student transfer issues. During the reporting year, SLCC and UL -L scheduled and conducted meetings with each articulation program area as to ensure that students transferring from SLCC are ac ademically prepared to enter UL -L degree programs as a Junior -level student . SLCC is a member of the N ational Student Clearingho use. This allows the College to identify students and follow the progress of our students who transfer to other NSCH institutions , including University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Development/use of agreements/external feedback reports during the reporting year. During the reporting year, UL -Lafayette (UL -L) and SLCC entered into a formal agreement establishing the Ragin' Cajun Bridge Program . Students applying to UL -L who do not meet all admissions requirements are eligible to enter the Bridge Program. Students in the program enroll at SLCC at least half -time each fall and spring semester until meeting the requirements for transfer to UL -L. S tudents qualify for a transfer to UL -Lafayette when they complete at least 24 credit hours and maintain a 2.5 gra de-point average at SLCC . While at SLCC, Bridge P rogram students' academic progress is tracked and program participants are required to meet with an academic adviser at least once a semester. Bridge Program participants are also granted all regular UL -L student privileges while enrolled at SLCC. After transferring to UL -Lafayette, students will remain cross -enrolled at SLCC, making them eligible to receive a Certificate of General Studies upon earning 30 credits and an Associate degree after earning 60 credits as they continue to pursue a Bachelor's degree. In fall 2013, 86 students sought entry into the Bridge Program. Of those 86, 84 enrolled for courses at SLCC that semester. Monitoring of the progress of these students and cohorts entering in subsequent semesters is on -going. SLCC and UL -L periodically meet to consider course and program transfer agreements. The purpose of these meetings have been to enhance the number and success of transfer students between SLCC and UL -L and to improve the academic preparation of incoming first time freshmen. To achieve this purpose SLCC and UL -L are working together through the UL -L Transfer Task Force committee which began in the spring of 2011. As a result, a UL -L transfer coordinator on is regularly av ailable on the SLCC campus to answer questions for students with regards to transfer. Page 3 of 4 SLCC and University of Louisiana at Lafayette faculty and staff engage in discussions to determine best practices for referral agreements. Topics addressed included : Pre-Transfer advising including the addition of a ULL transfer advisor regularly meeting with students on SLCC campus UL-L student privileges Common UL/SLCC application process for cross -enrolled students Students not meeting UL -L admission criteria are advised enter the Bridge Program or to enroll at S LCC to either complete developmental coursework or complete an associate degree then transfer to UL -L Scholarship opportunities for students in these categories SLCC also participa tes in the statewide articulation process whereby general education courses are reviewed and articulated across the State. The Board of Regents Articulation Matrix aids in transferability of courses. Performance Objective 2: Element d.

During the reporting year, SLCC's Office of Institutional Effectiveness generated historical trend data for all degree programs including program enrollment, retention, and completion measures. The college's Associate Vice Chancellor of Institutional Effectiveness then met with deans, campus coordinators, and department chairs to provide guidance on the analysis and interpretation of trend data pro vided. Program administrators then evaluated the performance of each program by campus and college -wide and reported results to the President's Cabinet. Based on these analyses, programs were slotted for continuation, consolidation, suspension or termina tion based on past and anticipated performance indices. South Louisiana Community College (SLCC) monitors the completion rates of transfer degree and general education programs as identified by the Board of Regents. This information is analyzed by the campus Institutional Effectiveness Office to determine the reason for the low completion rate and to identify the need for program continuation or termination. Page 2 of 4 Activities conducted during the reporting year to identify/modify/ initiate programs that are aligned with current or strategic workforce needs as defined by Regents* utilizing Louisiana Workforce Commission and Louisiana Economic Development published forecasts. During the reporting period SLCC secured approval of all required governing bodies to offer a new program meeting a critical workforce need of the region and s tate. SLCC received full approval from the Board of Regents and the Louisiana State Board of Nursing to offer an Associate of Science in Nursing (ADN) degree program. This program will address the chronic shortage of nurses in the Lafayette and Acadiana region workforce. Final Board of Nursing approval is immediately pending and the initial cohort of students in this program is scheduled to enroll fall 2014 . Additionally, the college is also actively pursuing the development of two new degree programs in response to regional industry needs. New programs under development to be advanced for Regents' approval include Veterinary Technology and Helicopter Aviation . All SLCC occupational programs are expected to host advisory committee meeting s annually. These committees are comprised primary of representatives from business and industry. Committee members evaluate the curriculum for each program and determine its relevance to business and industry. Feedback from the advisory committee is used to ensure courses and programs are aligned with workforce needs. During the reporting year technical programs/courses were modified based on feedback from business and industry, BoR m andates, and US Department of Education regulatory updates. Activities conducted during the reporting year with local Workforce Investment Board. Other means of tracking students into t he workforce outside of the 2012 Employment Outcomes Report. Progra ms are reviewed by the WIB serving the region. Programs that do not meet the current workforce needs and do not meet minimum completion standards are not funded by the agency. This serves as a review of programs and prompts additional cause for discussio n on program continuation. All existing SLCC programs have been granted WIB approval. Tracking of students in the workforce by means other than the Employee Outcomes Report (EOR) was done during the reporting year in response to Perkins Funding reporting requirements. LCTCS secured student -level data for 2011 -12 SLCC and ATC completers fro m the Louisiana Workforce Commission, allowing the institution to assess employment and median wages by program area. Additionally, LCTCS conducted follow -up surveys with completers not appearing in Workforce Commission data to determine current employmen t status. At the institutional level, data from direct follow -ups with technical program completers was also used as a third source for verifying employment status and wages of completers.

With monies provided by a Perkins Career & Technical Education ( CTE ) Leadership Grant, a team from LCTCS is working on several projects designed to improve online instruction and enhance accessibility for CTE students. The project includes professional course re -design of 14 popular CTE courses. These courses will be ava ilable for any school within the system to use to get up and running quickly. In order to minimize the learning curve for at least 40 LCTCS CTE instructors, a six-week online teaching professional development course will be offered . All 700 LCTCS CTE f aculty members will be invited to a one day workshop designed to motivate them and introduce them to online teaching. Other products in development are an app for student mobile access and gaming -style learning activities to complement high-quality faculty i nstruction. These resources will provide a jumpstart to several colleges in adopting online learning and will provide some variety and improved quality for other school s. At the college level, SLCC has expande d use of the Tandberg video conferencing syste m with conferencing equipment installed in classrooms at all SLCC campuses . The Tandberg system allows Page 4 of 4 SLCC to offer course sections in these locations with a minimum enrollment as low as a single student without incurring the cost of a full section instr uctor salary. Performance Objective 3: Element c . Increase research productivity especially in key economic development industries and technology transfer . While SLCC is not a research institution, it does seek to support Louisiana's key economic development industries as demand and opportunities present themselves in the Acadiana region. For example, in December 2010 the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and CLECO announced plans to build a research center focused on exploring renewable energy sources. In anticipation of the workforce needs of this center as well as production facilities that will result from the center's research, SLCC worked with ULL to launch the development of a program to provide the general and technical education that will be required of technicians working in these facilities. Enrollment in SLCC's Alternative Energy and Process Technology Program began in fall 2012 of the reporti ng year. Performance Objective 3: Element d . Demonstrate progress in increasing the number of students placed in jobs . The Board of Regents' 201 2 Employment Outcomes Report report ed statewide employment rates by degree level eighteen months after degree completion for the 20 09-10 academic year. SLCC's 18-month employment rates exceeded state averages at all degree levels. SLCC's 2009 -10 completer overall employment rate exceeded th e state average by 8.5 percentage points (75.8% vs. 67.3%, respectively). Additionally, e mployment rates increased for the 2009 -10 cohort compared to the 2008 -09 baseline year cohort . 2009 -10 Program Completer Employment - 18 Months Following Degree Comp letion Degree Level Number of Completers SLCC % Employed State Avg. % Employed Certificate (One Year) 598 73.6% 63.6% Diploma -09 Baseline Year Transfer Program Completer Employment - 18 Months Following Degree Completion (former SLCC only) Degree Level Number of Completers SLCC % Employed State Avg. % Employed Certificate 202 70.3% 56.4% Associate 157 72.0% 72.5% Performance of Associate Degree Recipients Who Transfer to 4 -Year Universities Please refer to Elements 2.b. and 2.

Adhere to a schedule established by the institution's management board to increase nonresident tuition amounts that are not less than the average tuition amount charged to Louisiana residents attending peer institutions in other SREB states and monitor the impact of such increases on the institution. Progress Toward Increasing Non -Resident Tuition as Compared to SREB Averages On January 27, 2011, LCTCS s taff forwarded a plan for non -resident tuition increases for all LCTCS colleges in accordance with provisions of Act 741, (the GRAD Act) of 2010 . For FY 2010 -2011, the LCTCS Board approved nonresident increases for all colleges for the f irst year of the six year plan, associated with the G RAD Act. The plan submitted presented a schedule of nonresident increases for all LCTCS colleges for the next f ive years of the six year plan. In the sixth and last year, the nonresident tuition of all colleges is projected to be equal to the average nonresident tuition of SREB peer institutions . Per the schedule approved by the LCTCS Board, SLCC nonresident tuition is projected to increase at an average rate of approximately 10% annually in order to meet the SREB peer tuition rate by target year six. Since the baseline year, the difference between SLCC's non - resident tuition and the SREB average for institutions of comparable size has decreased significantly and is on track to reach the anticipated SREB average by Year 6 .

Increases in nonresident fees had negligible impact enrollment of nonresidents during the reporting year. Nonresident enrollment as a percentage of total enrollment has decreased marginally from the baseline year and this change is attributable, in part, to the SLCC / ATC merger . Additional revenu es generated from previous reporting year averaged $ 1,000 per nonresident student or $ 59,148 in total .
