Three times in the last year she suffered with pneumonia. Two months before her ap-pointment, she had another bout with bronchitis. Her parents knew her immune system was low, but how do you build that up amongst the Albuteral and Palmacort medications she was taking? Samantha and her mother were counseled by Amy Jo Howard, a Certified Naturo- path, at the Institute. Amy started her consultation by looking for any food sensitivities Saman- tha might have. Nearly all allergens begin in the gut due to incomplete digestion which causes irritation of the di- gestive tract lining. As Na-turopaths, we are taught that allergies correspond with the production of mu- cus, because the body pro- duces mucus as a means to soothe this irritation. The mucus is intended to protect the body from foreign invad- ers. One way in which we set up conditions for allergies is when we consume items that were never intended to be eaten, like food colorings and chemical flavorings. Also, there are some foods that our bodies simply cannot break down, depending on our individual body chemistry and constitution. When the body cannot break down these foods, it produces mucus as the protection mechanism, and then, allergy responses ensue. We, therefore, look to the food first when the body is over producing mucus and causing conditions like bronchitis and pneumonia. Samantha tested negative to consuming milk, cheese, coconut, potato, and a few other foods. The test-ing for this is very simple and non-invasive. Amy used a technique called Muscle Re- sponse Testing. No needles are needed to determine al-lergens of either food or environmental sources. It is also necessary for anyone suffering from allergies and respiratory weakness to avoid wheat products. Over the years, the wheat has changed due to aggressive farming technology. Unfortunately, it is not recognized by the body like the wheat of our fore- bears and actually, acts like a toxin to many people, espe- cially the blood type O's. Samantha's mother switched her to rice and soy milks and cheeses. She also used friendly bacteria to rebuild what had been lost from the use of medications. Amy suggested that Saman- tha use Echinacea in liquid form a few times per day and to apply the diluted oil blend of Thieves to her feet at bed time. This oil helps the body fight off bacteria and vi- ruses. Before long, Saman- tha began to improve. The great lesson about this story is the same lesson many of us must learn by experience. After doing great with the new changes, Samantha and her family were on a little vacation away from home. She consumed milk products that she hadn't had in a few months. Wham! The respira-tory system flared back up, and it looked like the bron- chitis was back in action. Wisely, without searching for suppressing medications, Samantha's mother simply removed the dairy products and went right back to \"non- dairy\" milks and cheeses. Samantha cleared back up. So many times, we know the changes we are making are for the best, but life gets busy, or we are on the road, and we eat things we know are bad or we fail to drink enough water. The best thing to do is to remember your own sensitivities and try to honor your body's responses by making decisions that help you stay healthy.

Although we have enjoyed our location on Mission Street, it's time for a little green gr ass and some windows! The new location is only two blocks west of Mission on Broadway. There is a large, private parking lot, and downtown is only a few blocks away. The new locati on will allow for a gift area at Herbs, Etc., will increase the classroom sizes for the Inst itute, as well as add an additional cooking classroom and an exercise area. We will also be able to host larger conferences and have some outdoor activities. Outdoor picnic and quiet areas will be added fo r students. Herbal gardens will evolve af- ter a few seasons. Special lunch and massage services will be more accessible to down- town patrons, and no one will mi ss the Mission Street traffic. Page 2 Naturopathic Institute Saturday, November 3rd - A One Day Conference This spring, the Institute will be offering a six course pro-gram on how to assist in natural childbirth. This program is not a midwife program but rather, a doula program. A doula is the mother's assistant during preg- nancy, birthing, and child-rearing. This six month program, plus internship, will include train- ing in nutrition, herbology, muscle testing, essential oils, homeopa- thy, the anatomy of birth, and more. Upon completion of this program, a graduate would be qualified to assist couples with a natural childbirth. Alumni of the massage and first year naturo- pathic program would be grand- fathered for classes already taken, such as nutrition, essen- tial oils, muscle testing, and her- bology. Beth Barbeau, an experi- enced midwife, will be oversee- ing the advanced classes of this course and sharing her experi- ence and expertise in this rap- idly growing field of natural health. Please call the Institute to be placed on a mailing list for further details and a schedule as soon as the course dates are finalized. background of the screen is black or \"dark,\" and your blood is illuminated from behind by a light. This allows you to see many small, fine details that might be missed on a white back- ground. The true benefit is that you can see the condition of your red blood cells and your white blood cells. This will show you how your immune system is functioning, if you are lack- ing any vitamins or minerals, and how you are digesting your food. You can also see if there is any bacteria, yeast, candida, or parasites in your blood. We prefer to videotape the live blood analysis session, so that next time you come, we have a \"before\" picture to compare to your current analysis so that you can see how the changes that you've been making with your health are truly benefiting you and your body. Live Blood Analysis is an ex-citing way to determine what is going on in your body. By taking one drop of blood from a finger and looking at it under a dark field microscope, you can see, for yourself, the health of your cells, and you're only as healthy as your cells are! Viewing the blood under a dark field microscope has many bene- fits. With this kind of analysis, the may also spread the repayment plan out for a period of up to fifteen years. While this is not suggested, it can make monthly payments as low as $50. Then, we recommend making larger payments as there is no penalty for early payoff. This new program allows for students to get started with their naturopathic or massage training right away. If you know of others We are excited to be working with a student loan organization for both the massage and naturopathic programs. Sallie Mae Loans is a credit-based, student loan. You can apply online, and approvals are typi-cally given within twenty-four hours. Loans can be deferred for the first year of school with a mini-mum monthly payment of only $10 for the first twelve months. Students interested in taking the program, this might be just the opportunity they were waiting for. Sallie Mae Loans will also lend additional funds for travel and lodging expenses.

Autumn denotes many things. The leaves turn into tumbling gems of color; th e sky furrows its brow with grayer clouds; the wind penetrates a little deeper. It also means transition in terms of going back to school or work and re-establishing a more regular routine. Unfortunately, fall can also be synonymous with fall aller-gies, kidney stones, and general immune system weaknesses. This is the time of year when everything in nature, including us, begins to turn inward, pulls in its reserves and stor es up for the coming winter. Although things may appear to be fading on the outside, life is still present deep within. As we breathe, taking in air, the lungs and mucus membranes serve as one of our first lines of de- fense. Especially if we have held in emotions of sorrow and grief, there will be a weakness in the lung and sinus areas. Then, as we try to transition into this new season, our immune system expresses its imbalance through fall allergies and sinus problems. In a similar fashion, fear is the emotion that most often causes us to turn inward. Fear, seen as a holding back or inability to go with the flow, affects the kid- neys. As our bodi es prepare for the transition of going inward, if there is a lack of fluidity, it creates a hardening frequently expressed by the body as kidney stones. That is why kidney stones usually occur in the fall months. Continue reading for natural solutions to a smoother transition. And, as we engage in the changing of the season, let us be more mindful of how we, physically, mentally, and emotionally, are transitioning. Autumn: Season of Transition By Amy Jo Howard Herbs Etc.

Liquid Allergies: Mold, Yeast, & Dust contains a blend of homeopathic remedies to relieve symptoms includ- ing nasal congestion, itchy nose, sneezing, itchy, watery eyes, head-aches, and sore throat. Whichever remedy you choose, it is When fall allergies become active, you can't find relief fast enough. Nature's Sunshine Products carry several different homeopathic com- bination remedies for quick relief. Liquid Allergy blend covers relief of the most common allergy symp- toms. It is helpful for a runny nose, watery eyes, coughing and itching. Liquid Allergies: Hayfever-Pollen is for when the body is reacting to a natural combination designed to help strengthen the body's immune system, thereby reducing and elimi- nating allergy symptoms. For severe symptoms, take 10-15 drops every 10-15 minutes. As symptoms improve, decrease to taking 10-15 drops every 1-2 hours, then 4 times per day. These are nice, safe and natural ways to find relief for fall allergies. Page 4 Homeopathic Highlight: Remedies for Allergies by Amy Jo Howard Herbs Etc. Herbal Highlight : Remedies for the Fall by Elizabeth Lo The body's natural rhythms flow in accordance with nature: as the season changes, so does the body. While the body is read- justing to the weather, it is not uncommon to have people ex- perience different symptoms affecting the respiratory tract. To assist the body with this change, consider the following herbal combinations: ALJ : a great formula for reliev- ing sinus and upper respiratory tract congestion associated with allergies. The herbs con- tained in this blend work to stimulate perspiration and the production of mucosal fluids. In doing so, the body is able to eliminate allergens and other toxins. ALJ will also increase circulation, improve lymphatic function, assist in the fight against infection, and soothe inflamed tissues. It is available in capsules, tablets or liquid for children and adults. Elderberry Defense : a blend to boost healthy functions of the respiratory and immune sys- tems. This blend helps prevent colds and flu, respiratory in- fections, ear and throat prob- lems. Elderberry is widely known for its ability to prevent illness and expel bronchial mu- cus while relieving inflamma-tion. This is an herb that is high in vitamins A and C, which will boost immunity to ill- nesses. In the defense against the flu virus, it has been dis- covered that Elderberry has two active ingredients that prevent the influenza virus from taking hold. Elderberry has been shown to be effec- tive against 8 different strains of influenza. It comes in cap- sules or a chewable for chil- dren. Four : this is a blend that works great for decongesting mucous membranes. The herbs in this formula work to dilate the bronchioles and peripheral blood vessels, improve the flu- idity of mucous in the respira- tory system, and relieve muscle spasms, especially those that lead to the need to cough. Four is helpful in assisting the body in dealing with arthritis, headaches, hysteria, insomnia, menstrual cramps, and rheuma- tism. Seasonal Defense : this is a blend for the \"cold and flu\" season. This blend contains herbs that stimulate the im- mune system and help prevent cold and flu. These herbs serve as decongestants, expecto-rants, and help to relieve coughs. They also contain anti- bacterial and anti-viral proper- ties. Use this blend for colds, flu, upper respiratory tract infections, and for coughs, fatigue, fever, and sore throat. That can be a real problem while visiting family during the holidays. Thankfully, when I know I am going to spend some \"quality time\" around my feline friends, I make myself an appointment for an allergy correc- tion. The Allergy Correction procedure uses the principles of acupressure from ancient Chinese medicine. The ancient Chinese considered that energy circulated in the body along specific channels, which they call meridians. These meridians corre- spond to different organ systems within the body. Based on this and applying muscle response testing, a person can be \"tested\" for which substances they are allergic to and then the allergic response can ei- ther be reduced or eliminated com- pletely by \"tapping\" specific merid- ian points. This simple and non- invasive procedure takes about half an hour and can reduce some of the We all know the signs: itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; runny nose and a general foggy headedness that accompanies allergies. When I was younger, allergies were a part of my daily life. Every morn- ing, I would wake up and sneeze ten times in a row. When my hus- band and I started dating, he learned to always wait for at least the third sneeze before saying, \"Bless you.\" It seemed anything could bring on an attack: cats, dogs, horses, freshly mown grass, dust, mold, cigarette smoke and even some types of food. In the years since, I started my naturo- pathic training and have changed my dietary habits, and now, my allergy symptoms have lessened considerably. I no longer sneeze every morning and when I do sneeze, it is generally only once or twice. But I'm still sensitive to certain allergens like cat dander. most common allergy symptoms. And, because many serious ailments can be related to allergies, when the allergies are corrected, the tis- sues affected by them will begin to heal and function better. Once an allergy to a certain substance is eliminated, the body will no longer need to produce mucus to protect itself against that substance, which means no more sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to put a damper on my holidays. So, if you have an allergy to a known or unknown substance, make an appointment for an allergy correction today to start your holi- day season with a clear head. Herbs Etc Allergy Correction by Kathryn Doran-Fisher Student Bodywork Therapies by Mary Booms Page 7 For the last two years, the stu- dents of NITE have been perform- ing massages and bodywork on the public. The massage sessions fill up almost every time they are avail- able; however, the other forms of bodywork don't always fill up. The students at NITE would like to see every available therapy full so they can get the practice and variety they need to excel in their profes- sion. Also, the clients are able to benefit from the many wonderful therapies they receive. Below is a description of each of the forms of bodywork available from the students. If you have fur-ther questions or would like to schedule an appointment, call Herbs, Etc at (989) 773-3636. CranioSacral is a therapy that is done over the clothes. It uses a very light pressure to release ten- sion and stress from the muscles along the spine and in the head. CranioSacral helps to relieve head- aches, migraines, back pain, ADD, autism and numbness in the hands and feet as well as aid the nervous system, provide overall balance, and proper spinal alignment. Reflexology : There are 7200 nerve endings in the bottom of each foot. These nerves, when stimu- lated, send signals to the brain and other areas and organs in the body. Reflexology uses the fingers and thumbs to stimulate these nerve end- ings therefore increasing circulation, relieving pain, relaxing the entire body, promoting balance, and healing the organs. Light Healing Touch is a therapy that works in the electromagnetic energy field surrounding the body, sometimes referred to as an aura. Often, when people feel pain, physical or emotional, it is stored in the energy field, causing reoccurring pain years after the injury. Light Healing Touch helps the body to remove the stored energies of stress and trauma and replaces them with a very calm, relaxed, peaceful feeling. See the NITE Section for a schedule. of carrier oil and rub primarily on the chest and bot- tom of the feet. R.C. R.C. is a blend of the single oils eucalyptus, myrtle, marjoram, pine, cypress, lavender, spruce, and peppermint. The properties of this oil blend make it extremely effective against allergies, colds, bronchi- tis, respiratory congestion, flu, cold sores, pneumo- nia, sinusitis, sore throats, mucus problems, and bone spurs. R.C. oil is very beneficial in the diffuser to decongest and relieve allergy-type symptoms, such as coughs, sore throat and lung congestion. To apply this oil topically, dilute with a carrier oil and massage on the chest, back, and feet. It can also be applied on the sinuses and nasal passages, ears, neck and throat. This oil is great for children as well, simply apply one drop diluted with carrier oil to their chest and feet before bed. Purification Purification is a blend of the single oils lemongrass, rosemary, melaleuca, lavender, and myrtle. This blend has powerful antiseptic, anti-bacterial, anti- fungal, and sanitizing properties. This makes it very useful in purifying and cleansing the air in your home. Purification oil can be beneficial in fighting not only cold and flu germs in the home, but also pet odors, cigarette smoke, mildew and other odors. It repels bugs, insects, and mice. Diffusing Purification oil in the home will help protect your family during the cold and flu season by cleaning your air. A spray bottle of Purification oil should also be kept in the house to use during cleaning duties. For example, 4 drops in a bucket of hot water will clean the kitchen and bathroom floors without the chemicals found in standard household cleaning products! Thieves Thieves is a blend of the single essential oils of clove, lemon, cinnamon, eucalyptus, and rosemary. This power- ful blend helps protect the body from the onset of flu, colds, viruses, etc. It was originally used by thieves (hence the name) in England to protect them from catching the plague when they were stealing from the sick and dying. Thieves oil influences the immune system to help pro- tect us from bacteria and vi ruses. It can be massaged onto the bottom of the feet, throat, stomach, and intestines. To do this, dilute one drop of Thieves oil in 15 drops of carrier oil such as sunflower oil, apricot oil, or even olive oil. After applying the oil, it is also benefi- cial to massage the thymus (just under the center breast bone) to stimulate the immune system and under the arms to stimulate the lymphatic system. Another effective use of Thieves oil is to dilute 25 drops into 2 ounces of water and use it as a spray mist over your body. This is very helpful to spray on children before they head off to school! We also carry Thieves oil throat lozenges. Sucking on one lozenge is enough to relieve throat inflammation for hours and is far better than the over the counter sprays with red food coloring that unfortunately, makes many children hyper. ImmuPower Immupower is a blend of the Idaho tansy. This oil blend is building, strengthening and protecting to the body and its de- fense mechanisms. The Frankincense is especially known for these qualities all the way back to the time of Christ. This blend helps to raise the energy of the immune sys- tem which helps the body overcome or prevent the flu, colds, respiratory problems, infections, etc. Many peo- ple have used it with great success on tumors. It also protects the body from chemical and environmental poi-sons. You can diffuse ImmuPower oil in the morning and again in the evening. This can be done by using an essen- tial oil diffuser or even putting 3 drops in a bowl of wa- ter in key rooms of the home. If applying ImmuPower oil directly to the skin, dilute 1 drop of oil with 15 drops Essential Oils for Allergies, Colds and Flu by Becky Fodor Page 8 HerbComing in 2008 Cooking, Exercise, Survival Skills, One Day Courses, Cleansing Clinics!
