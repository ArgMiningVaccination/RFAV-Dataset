Some studies have reported that anxiety is the most frequent psychiatric disorder, closely followed by mood disorders [ [2](#B2-kjpp-18-191)]. Despite a steady increase in the development of anxiolytics for anxiety, the prevalence of this disorder remains stable, which may be attributed to our poor neurobiological understanding of its pathophysiology or to the inconsistent efficacy of current treatments [ [1](#B1-kjpp-18-191)]. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ [3](#B3-kjpp-18-191)]. They result from exposure to stressful life events that evoke fear, helplessness, and horror. Indeed, chronic exposure to stressful life events is an established and important risk factor for the development and maintenance of many psychological or mental disorders, including anxiety, in humans [ [4](#B4-kjpp-18-191)]. The behavioral and physical responses to stress are especially initiated by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and this results in the release of catecholamines and stress hormones such as corticosterone (CORT) [ [5](#B5-kjpp-18-191)]. [6](#B6-kjpp-18-191), [7](#B7-kjpp-18-191)]. Repeated CORT administration may to profound maladaptive changes in anxiety-like behavior, thereby mimicking human mental disorders such as anxiety [ [8](#B8-kjpp-18-191)]. Previous studies have shown that chronic exposure to CORT increased the plasma CORT concentration, inhibited exploratory behavior, enhanced freezing behavior in fear conditioning, and induced changes in c-Fos expression in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus [ [9](#B9-kjpp-18-191)]. chronic axis dysregulation increases anxiety-like behavior [ [10](#B10-kjpp-18-191)]. [3](#B3-kjpp-18-191)]. Thus, much attention has been given to the use of naturally occurring compounds and their formulations as alternative therapeutic agents for the treatment of psychiatric disorders including anxiety [ [11](#B11-kjpp-18-191), [12](#B12-kjpp-18-191)]. [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)]. The compound has antioxidant, anticoagulant, antitumor, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting potential value for medicinal use [ [14](#B14-kjpp-18-191)]. Indeed, there are many AAS products, including tablets, capsules, and injections, available on the market. Recently, AAS has been reported to improve multiple physiological actions, produce a variety of pharmacological actions in the CNS, and modulate immune system function [ [15](#B15-kjpp-18-191)]. However, some of the studies on the anticonvulsant activity of AAS yielded only marginal effects [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191), [16](#B16-kjpp-18-191)]. Several studies have shown that the administration of AAS produced weak anticonvulsant activity during maximal electroshock seizures and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)], with antioxidant properties, such as those of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, against noise stress-induced changes in the rat brain [ [17](#B17-kjpp-18-191)]. In addition, AAS protected neurons against amyloid-beta (25-35)-induced neurotoxicity and spatial memory impairment by inhibiting the effects of nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in the hippocampus and temporal cortex [ [18](#B18-kjpp-18-191)]. Thus, AAS may act to alleviate anxiety-behavior in stress-related animal models. However, it remains unknown to date whether the therapeutic efficacy of AAS in alleviating anxiety-behavior following chronic stress-induced anxiety-like symptoms induced by repeated CORT injections in rats is mediated by the regulation of BDNF and TrkB. These observations resulted in the hypothesis that AAS may also be effective in improving stress-associated psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety. METHODS Animals Experimental groups [19](#B19-kjpp-18-191)]. CORT (40 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. St. Louise, MO, USA), which was dissolved in absolute ethanol and subsequently diluted in water to the final concentration of 10% ethanol, was administrated by subcutaneously (s.c) in a volume of 1 ml/kg once daily for 21 days [ [8](#B8-kjpp-18-191), [20](#B20-kjpp-18-191)]. This CORT dose was selected because it induces serum levels of the steroid comparable to those elicited by substantial stress [ [21](#B21-kjpp-18-191)]. The CORT and vehicle injections were given in the morning between 9 and 10 am once daily for 21 consecutive days. The standard doses of AAS in the rat and considering the long-term treatment used in the present study was based on previous study [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)]. AAS (50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) and the positive drug diazepam (1 mg/kg, DZP; Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) were administered by intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a volume of 1 ml/kg 30 min prior to the CORT injection for 21 days. All drugs were freshly prepared right before every experiment. The following parameters were measured to monitor the effects of the development of psychosomatic disorders by exogenous CORT administration: changes of body weight gains (at the beginning step of exogenous CORT administration), and serum CORT levels (after repeated CORT-induced anxiety-like symptoms). Behavioral testing for anxiety-like behaviors were done rightly after the end of the chronic physiological stress protocol. All rats sequentially performed to take the EPM test and HBT on the 21th day after repeated CORT injection. After the behavioral testing and body weighting, rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were immediately collected for experiments or stored at -70 for later use. Elevated plus maze test (EPM) Hole-board test [3](#B3-kjpp-18-191)]. The hole-board apparatus, raised to a height of 7 cm above floor level, was made of iron plate covered with dark Formica (62\u00d762\u00d736 cm) with 16 holes, each 4 cm in diameter, equally spaced in the floor. For the hole-board experiments, each rats was placed in the center of the hole-board and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 5 min. The number of head dips and the time spent head dipping were recorded by a video camera for later analysis. A head dip was scored when the head was introduced into the holes at least to the level of the eyes. Open field test CORT analysis Immunohistochemistry [22](#B22-kjpp-18-191)]. The stained cells for which intensities to a defined value above the background were only considered as immunopositive cells. The differences of brightness and contrast among raw images were not adjusted, in order to exclude any possibility of subjective selection of the immunoreactive cells. Total RNA preparation and RT-PCR analysis Statistical analysis RESULTS Effects of AAS on CORT-induced body weight loss and increase of serum CORT levels [23](#B23-kjpp-18-191)]. We measured the body weight of each rat in each group for 21 days. In the present study, body weight was evaluated daily for 21 days to identify whether the repeated administration of CORT (CORT group) would result in body weight loss (difference between daily weights and starting weight; [Fig. 1A](#F1-kjpp-18-191)). Analysis of the body weight values revealed a significant gradual reduction of body weight gain over 21 days in the CORT group relative to control rats (SAL group). Interestingly, the body weight of rats treated with AAS showed no significant differences compared to that of rats in the CORT group during 21 days. [Fig. 1B](#F1-kjpp-18-191); p<0.05). This indicated that repeated CORT injections were sufficiently stressful despite the evoked CORT response (physiological response) to repeated CORT injections being significantly greater than the response to a single CORT injection (data not shown). In these results, the exogenous CORT-induced anxiety-like symptoms were exploited to develop a chronic stress model in rats. Daily administration of AAS significantly inhibited the exogenous CORT-induced increase of serum CORT levels compared to the CORT group (p<0.05). Effects AAS on CORT-induced anxiety-like behaviors [Fig. 2A and B](#F2-kjpp-18-191)). Immediately after repeated CORT administration (days 7 and 14), an decrease in both the percentage of time spent and the number of entries into the open arms of the maze were observed in the experimental group as compared with the SAL group. Furthermore, on day 21 from repeated CORT administration, rats displayed showed a significant decrease in both the percentage of time spent (p<0.05) and the number of entries (p<0.01) into the open arms of the maze compared with the SAL group. Conversely, statistical analysis revealed that the number of entries into the closed arms was not effected by 21 days from repeated CORT exposure, as there were no significant differences among the groups (data not shown). [Fig. 3A](#F3-kjpp-18-191)). However, the rats in the CORT+AAS200 group showed a significant restoration of the percentage of time spent, formerly decreased by repeated CORT injection, in open-arm of the maze, as compared to that in the CORT group (p<0.05). Similarly, post hoc comparisons revealed a significant decrease in the number of entries into the open arms of the maze after the repeated administration of exogenous CORT for 21 days compared to the SAL group (p<0.01; [Fig. 2C](#F2-kjpp-18-191)). Rats in the CORT+AAS200 group also exhibited a significant restoration in the number of entries into the open arms of the maze compared to the CORT group (p<0.05). The lowest dose (50 mg/kg) decreased the percentage of entries in the open arms but did not change the percentage of entries in the closed arms. The highest dose (200 mg/kg) increased total arm entries, suggesting increased locomotor activity in the EPM test. Because no significant differences appeared in the number of closed-arm entries between groups in the EPM test, the observed anxiety-like behaviors of the rats receiving repeated CORT injections are likely not attributable to differences in their locomotor activities ( [Fig. 2D](#F2-kjpp-18-191)). AAS administration prior repeated administration of exogenous CORT did elicit anxiolytic or anxiogenic behavior in this study. These results reveal that the increase in the percentage of time spent into the open arms of the maze by the CORT+AAS200 group was almost comparable to those of the CORT+DZP group. Effects of AAS on CORT-induced exploratory behaviors [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)]. An increase in head-dipping behaviors in the hold-board test reflects an anxiolytic-like state [ [1](#B1-kjpp-18-191)]. In the present study, 200 mg/kg AAS significantly increased time spent of head dips (p<0.05). Diazepam (1 mg/kg) also produced a significant increase in head dipping, in agreement with a previous study [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)] ( [Fig. 2E and F](#F2-kjpp-18-191)). However, AAS-treated rats (200 mg/kg) displayed a significant increase in the total spent of head dips compared to the CORT group, indicating that anxiety-like behaviors in the CORT+AAS200 group was almost comparable to those of the CORT+DZP group. The data from the present study indicated that 200 mg/kg AAS has a significant anxiolytic-like effect in this paradigm. Effects of AAS on CORT-induced motor functions or exploratory behaviors [Fig. 2G](#F2-kjpp-18-191)). No significant differences appeared in locomotor activity (motor function) in the OFT among groups. However, rats receiving CORT injections displayed a significant decrease in the total number of line crossings compared to the SAL group (p<0.01). This finding suggested that CORT-treated rats subsequently produce exploration activities that are closely associated with anxiety-like behaviors in the OFT. However, AAS-treated rats (200 mg/kg) displayed a significant increase in the total number of line crossings compared to the CORT group (p<0.05). Effects of AAS on CORT-induced immunoreactivities 3A](#F3-kjpp-18-191)). The fibers in the PVN of the CORT group were increased by 208.18%. Analysis of the numbers of CRF-immunoreactive neurons values revealed that rats receiving repeated administration of exogenous CORT exhibited a significant increase of CRF expression compared to the SAL group (p<0.05). The number of CRF-immunoreactive neurons was significantly decreased in the PVN region of the CORT+AAS200 group compared to the CORT group (p<0.05). This finding suggested that the increased CRF-immunoreactivity induced by the repeated administration of exogenous CORT was significantly restored by AAS administration and that the number of CRF-immunopositive neurons in the CORT+AAS200 group was closely associated with that in the CORT+DZP group (p<0.05). TH-like immunoreactivity 3A](#F3-kjpp-18-191)). The the LC of the CORT group increased to 163.20%. Analysis of the numbers of TH-immunoreactive neurons values revealed that rats repeatedly exposed to exogenous CORT exhibit a significant increase of TH expression compared to the SAL group (p<0.01). The number of TH-immunoreactive neurons significantly decreased in LC of the CORT+AAS200 group relative to the CORT group (p<0.05). This finding indicated that the increase in the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in rats repeatedly treated with exogenous CORT was significantly restored by AAS administration. Effect of AAS on CORT-induced expression of BDNF and (GAPDH) an internal control. BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus in the CORT group was significantly decreased compared with that in the SAL group (p<0.01). The decreased expression of BDNF mRNA in the CORT group was significantly restored in the CORT+AAS200 group (p<0.05), and the restored level was similar to that of normal rats in the SAL group. Hippocampal expression of TrkB mRNA in the CORT group was also significantly decreased compared with that in the SAL group (p<0.05). The decreased expression of TrkB mRNA in the CORT group was significantly increased in the CORT+AAS200 group (p<0.05). This also indicated that the expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNAs in the hippocampus in rats receiving 200 mg/kg AAS administration was similar to that in rats receiving 1 mg/kg DZP administration. DISCUSSION [14](#B14-kjpp-18-191), [16](#B16-kjpp-18-191)]. Recently, several studies have shown that AAS inhibits the activity of hippocampal neurons and produces an antiepileptic effect in the CNS by enhancing tonic GABAergic inhibition [ [24](#B24-kjpp-18-191)]. Other studies have also reported that -asarone can attenuate neuronal apoptosis in rat hippocampus and cognitive impairment associated with conditions, such Alzheimer's disease [ [25](#B25-kjpp-18-191), [26](#B26-kjpp-18-191)], and can reduce the toxicity of excitatory amino acids and increase the expression of c-fos in the epileptic rat brain [ [27](#B27-kjpp-18-191)]. AAS has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and may act directly in brain nuclei to produce pharmacological effects in vitro and in vivo [ [28](#B28-kjpp-18-191)]. Thus, a new medicinal role is possible for AAS due to its anxiolytic action or anti-stress capabilities in the CNS, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for treating neurodegenerative or psychosomatic diseases in humans. Nevertheless, the reported pharmacological effects of AAS with respect to the anxiety-related symptoms seen in rats repeatedly exposed to exogenous CORT, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects, remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate the ability of AAS to heal chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in a rat model. [8](#B8-kjpp-18-191), [23](#B23-kjpp-18-191)]. [21](#B21-kjpp-18-191), [29](#B29-kjpp-18-191)]. Many studies have shown that chronic administration of high-dose CORT increased serum CORT concentrations in rats, in line with chronic stress models [ [30](#B30-kjpp-18-191)]. Accordingly, in animal models, forced sustainment of high CORT levels can affect anxiety-like symptoms under experimental conditions, and this might be related to the progression or exacerbation of chronically stressful conditions in humans [ [30](#B30-kjpp-18-191)]. The administration of AAS produced anxiolytic activity during the late period of AAS administration, suggesting that this therapy inhibited HPA axis-associated psychological dysfunction induced by decreased serum CORT levels. Thus, administration of AAS may modulate HPA axis dysregulation, indicating that it can influence endogenous CORT levels in the CNS, thereby normalizing behavioral and neurochemical responses. Similarly, serum CORT levels in rats treated with diazepam prior to performing the EPM test and HBT were lower than those of the controls, consistent with previous studies [ [3](#B3-kjpp-18-191)]. [31](#B31-kjpp-18-191), [32](#B32-kjpp-18-191)]. Although the EPM test is based on aversive contexts, conflicts, and the subsequent movement of the animal between an open and illuminated environment, the test includes two additional anxiety-provoking environmental parameters; height and open area [ [33](#B33-kjpp-18-191)]. In this test, it is assumed that animals feel safe in the closed arms but feel fear and anxiety during exploration of the open arms. In the present study, the administration of higher doses of AAS (200 mg/kg) prior to chronic CORT injections reduced anxiety-like behaviors significantly in the EPM test, as indicated by an increase in the number of entries into the open arms. Additionally, diazepam showed potential anxiolytic effects. However, in this study AAS at lower doses, 50 and 100 mg/kg showed no anxiolytic effect. Thus, these results suggest that the decreased anxiety-related behaviors following administration of AAS may be related to attenuated activity of the HPA axis. [34](#B34-kjpp-18-191)]. In the HBT, a pronounced inhibition of head-dipping behavior was observed in rats that had been exposed to stress stimuli [ [1](#B1-kjpp-18-191)]. Some studies previously reported that treatment with benzodiazepine anxiogenics or exposure to acute restraint stress produced a decrease in head-dipping behavior in mice [ [35](#B35-kjpp-18-191)]. These findings indicate that head-dipping behavior in the HBT is a good index for evaluating the emotionality of rodents. Our results indicated that higher doses of AAS (200 mg/kg) increased the time of head dipping behavior significantly, consistent with previous studies [ [3](#B3-kjpp-18-191)]. The dose-dependent activity of AAS (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was examined, and a dose of 200 mg/kg was the most effective in inhibiting chronic CORT-induced harmful effects in EPM test and HBT, which included anxiety-like behavior. The optimum dose determined in this study has been shown in a previous study [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)]. [36](#B36-kjpp-18-191)]. No significant individual differences in locomotor activity were observed between groups, suggesting that the administration of AAS had no effect on sensorimotor performance. However, the administration of AAS prior to chronic CORT injections significantly reduces anxiety-like behavior, as indicated by an increase in total number of line crossing in the OFT. Accordingly, these results suggest that the observed increase of total number of line crossing in OFT is similar to observed changes in behavioral performances in the EPM test and HBT, which these results were likely due to anxiolytic activity. [37](#B37-kjpp-18-191)]. Previous studies have shown that i.c.v. injections of CRF induced anxiety-like behavior, and increased plasma CORT via regulation of HPA axis hyperactivity [ [38](#B38-kjpp-18-191)]. The current data suggest that the CRF circuits in the PVN of the hypothalamus are activated by chronic CORT injections, leading to the observed anxiety-like activity in the behavioral tests [ [7](#B7-kjpp-18-191)]. These results show that the administration of AAS significantly blocked the increase in CRF immunoreactivity in the PVN. This suggests that anxiolytic effects following the administration of AAS are closely associated with CRF modulation in the PVN in the hypothalamus and activation of the HPA axis. [39](#B39-kjpp-18-191), [40](#B40-kjpp-18-191)]. These results are consistent with previous studies indicating that anxiety-like behavior induced by chronic stress is the result of changes in the CNS [ [41](#B41-kjpp-18-191)]. Moreover, we demonstrated that administration of AAS decreased TH-like immunoreactivity significantly in the LC of rats subjected to repeated CORT injection. Together, these findings suggest that AAS attenuated the behaviors and neurochemical responses associated with anxiety by modulating the HPA axis and the CNS, suggesting that administration of AAS, like diazepam, may indirectly alter catecholamine synthesis in the brain to produce physiological effects [ [13](#B13-kjpp-18-191)]. Thus, our results indicate that AAS acts by stimulating the CNS, suggesting that a dysregulated HPA axis may contribute to anxiety symptomology, and that the therapeutic action of the anxiolytic reverses this activity by increasing TH expression in the LC [ [42](#B42-kjpp-18-191)]. [43](#B43-kjpp-18-191)]. A clinical study demonstrated that stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety, are associated with reduced brain BDNF and its receptor TrkB levels [ [20](#B20-kjpp-18-191), [44](#B44-kjpp-18-191)]. In a recent experiment, chronic social defeat stress or treatment with exogenous CORT caused a significant decrease in BDNF expression in the hippocampus, a brain region that may be related to the pathogenesis of anxiety-like symptoms [ [20](#B20-kjpp-18-191), [45](#B45-kjpp-18-191)]. Consistent with these findings, we found the 3-week CORT injection decreased expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNAs in the rat hippocampus and anxiety-like behavior [ [20](#B20-kjpp-18-191)]. Decreased BDNF availability or reduced levels of the TrkB neurotrophin receptor could also reduce BDNF signaling [ [46](#B46-kjpp-18-191)]. However, administration of AAS restored the level of BDNF and TrkB mRNAs in the hippocampus of rats subjected to repeated CORT injection, suggesting that modulation of the BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling pathway may play a role in mediating anxiolytic actions of AAS.
