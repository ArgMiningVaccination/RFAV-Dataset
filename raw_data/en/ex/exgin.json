We discussed this in detail in a previous article I wrote called [Toxic Roulette - A new age challenge](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/detoxification/toxic-roulette-a-new-age-challenge). There was a great deal of interest and we received many requests for more information on the therapies that will actively lower your toxicity which has led me to add a part two with more specific information on the supportive and pro-active tools that you need to engage in to support your health and wellbeing in this toxic time. Unfortunately, wherever we go we are surrounded by toxins and each individual has differing abilities to detox effectively. This can be due to their genetic makeup, diet, lifestyle choices and environment etc. Many chemicals are tested for safety individually however the interactions between them are not readily tested! And if you've ever looked at a product you will notice a collection of chemicals listed which means a cocktail of toxins adding to your liver's workload. Never mind all the others sources of toxins in our environment, body by-products, food, water, body care products and even the air we breathe. \u00a9 Emma Lane. Previously Published in [PH Online Issue 260](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/detoxification/toxic-roulette-a-new-age-challenge) What Symptoms are Experienced by People Who have a Toxic Burden? Chronic exposure to harmful environmental toxins and other triggers interferes with the normal functions of your body and mind. - Brain fog, memory problems, loss of mental sharpness, trouble organising tasks or getting things done - Headaches, light/sound/touch sensitivity - Neuropathy, numbness, tingling, loss of coordination, paralysis, seizures - Fainting, dizziness or light headedness, vertigo - Insomnia, poor sleep - Anxiety, depression, irritability, emotional outbursts, mood swings, suicide - Fatigue, problems recovering from exercise or even daily activities - Muscle weakness, cramping and aching - Blood pressure issues - Frequent respiratory infections - Wheezing, allergy symptoms, shortness of breath, air hunger - Joint aches and stiffness - Diarrhoea or constipation - Nausea and vomiting, stomach upset - Frequent urination and increased thirst - Rashes, itching, prickling skin, blotching and redness - Heavy periods, irregular periods, PMS symptoms, difficult menopause, miscarriages This list may sound crazy, but it is a fact that people suffering from environmental exposure (toxin excess) suffer an astonishingly wide range of severe symptoms. In fact, though the list is long, it understates the devastating consequences of environmentally acquired illness. Please see my previous article [Toxic Roulette - A new age challenge](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/detoxification/toxic-roulette-a-new-age-challenge) for all the foundational support mechanisms I suggest that you can easily utilize for yourself. My aim in this article is to give you more information on the highly beneficial clinic-based detox and immune support therapies. Important Additional Support Mechanism Your body needs all the help it can get in today's toxic world and the following treatments and therapeutic approaches are extremely helpful in managing and reducing your toxic load. In Naturopathic clinics who specialize in environmentally acquired and chronic illness such as ours, you will find an array of detox and support detox therapies available to you that enable you to proactively take care of yourself. Certain treatments can be combined to give an enhanced response. I am not discussing any supplemental, cleanse or detox protocols in this article, it is solely for practical in-clinic therapies. I will not be able to cover all the beneficial treatments and therapies that are available to help manage and reduce toxic burden however I will endeavour to give a good overview. Professional Ionic Foot Spa The primary benefit of an ionic foot spa is that it enhances the body's own natural detoxification abilities. This allows the body to remove heavy metals and other toxic elements from the body more efficiently. Assisting the body's natural detoxification process results in a stronger immune system. What are the benefits of ionic detox foot baths? - Purging of heavy metals - A more balanced pH level - Reducing inflammation - Internal cleansing with full body purge - Liver, kidney cleansing/detoxifying - Enhancing the immune system function What Can I Expect after a Detox Foot Bath Session? Most people will feel relaxed, balanced and focused. There is usually no pain. People who suffer from excessive toxicity may experience some discomfort as their bodies release toxins from the tissues for elimination. After a detox foot bath, clients are encouraged to drink plenty of water to assist with making elimination easier and more comfortable. Some people may experience fatigue or headache after a session. How Does an Ionic Detox Foot Bath Work? Electrical current passes through a set of plates in a module that is immersed in the water inside the foot bath tub. The foot bath water contains a special sea salt, so it has the mineral concentration of water from the ocean. While the client's feet are in the water, positive and negative ions are emitted by the foot bath system. This re-energizes the body and the red blood cells. It eliminates toxins that are stored in fat, kidneys, liver, bowels and skin. The foot bath also triggers the body's lymphatic system, which helps with continuing detoxification for up to 24/48 hours after a session. MediCrystal Mat We are very proud that we are able to offer sessions utilizing this very effective healing modality. They offer so many functions and benefits that it is difficult to summarize succinctly, I will try my best! MediCrystal mats are a unique multi layered systems which have no harmful EMF emissions. The mat is composed to 20 layers of various biotech materials that produce far infra-red, deep far-infra red rays, negative ions and gentle magnetic fields (PEMF) that penetrate deep into tissues and organs. The Medi Crystal mat is filled with thousands of Grade A crystals that act as super conductors which stimulate the immune system and produce antibodies. The rays warm up the body and induce hyperthermia which triggers the bodies self-healing process. They have the following capabilities:- Far infra-red light, deep far infra-red rays which are amplified and geometrically structured through the release of thousands of natural grade A amethyst, agate crystals. The agate stones are domed shaped for optimal beneficial acupressure effect. Lines of ultra violet free (red light LEDs) are effective for added stimulation which is able to penetrate tissues and rejuvenate the skin. Bio-magnetic waves (PEMF) and negative ions that offer optimal healing What is PEMF/Bio-magnetism? Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, also known as low field magnetic stimulation uses small electrical current and magnetic fields. Both small electric current and magnetic fields naturally exist in the human body as part of an ongoing chemical reaction and biological processes such as digestive, respiratory, circulatory and general brain activity. The Medi Crystal emits PEMF fields that are nearly identical to these frequencies created by the cells, organs, bone and tissues to those found in the human body. These safe natural magnetic fields alternating at ultra-low frequencies are complementary to chemistry and functionality. The advantage of PEMF is in the dynamic properties of the field. Pulsation brings more energy and achieves a more powerful effect with the same or even lower intensity magnetic fields. You can think of PEMF as a battery recharger for those energies which empower us all day long. Our Medi Crystal mats have 6 PEMF coils distributed throughout the heating area of the mat. Why Do We Want to Support Negative Ions? Negative ions are oxygen atoms with an extra electron that tends to be found in abundance near waterfalls, rain forests and the ocean. They are produced every time an oxygen molecule breaks apart. Most often in nature due to sunlight, storms and moving air and water. Negative ions are important because they neutralize free radicals, they help to revitalize cell metabolism and maintain normal immune function. Amethyst contains some very potent piezoelectric properties which allows it to carry both positive and negative charge simultaneously. The super conductive properties of amethyst, which the far infra-red rays must pass through is what turns it into longer wave lengths that can penetrate deep into the body, in fact up to 8 inches. Ions are produced by amethyst when it is heated in the bio crystal mat. Negative ions are known to have a very positive effect on mental health and clarity, drowsiness, mental energy and are even known to improve migraines, sinus problems and allergies. The cell resting potential is the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell, which is mostly determined by the concentrations of the ions in the fluids on each side of the cell membrane. The abundance of negative ions has an overall alkalizing effect. When negative ions prevail, membranes are open and the nutrients uptake hydration and the excretion of cellular waste material goes up. Contrary - if the negative cell potential falls, membrane permeability gets worse. The nutrients oxygen and water cannot get into the cell, waste and carbon dioxide cannot get out and too much sodium stays in the cell. That is why the maintenance of a healthy negative cell potential is so essential to our wellbeing. Benefits of Far Infra-red Far infrared can safely raise the body's temperature and create a false fever due to the deeply penetrating heat. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, white blood cells, and interferon which help the body protect itself from harmful micro-organisms. - Ease minor muscle, joint pain, and stiffness; - Temporarily relieves muscle spasms, sprains and strains; - Improve sleep (if associated with pain relief); - Increase tissue oxygen (due to increased circulation where applied); - Increase blood circulation in areas where applied; - Reduce inflammation (where applied); - Reduce stress and fatigue; - Relax the muscles; - Soothes and relaxes promoting relaxation; - Supports the immune system. I know that was a lot of information, however you can now understand why we love these health re-balancing mats and why we offer them at our clinic. FSM - Frequency Specific Microcurrent FSM is a fabulous tool that can be used for a wide spectrum of challenges. In clinic I will use up to seven devices at a time to get a thorough and beneficial effect. FSM is a technique that uses an ultra-low level electrical current delivered to targeted areas of the body. A frequency is a specific rate at which a sound wave or electronic pulse is produced; different frequencies can be used to potentially reduce inflammation, repair tissue and reduce pain, support detox, immune modulation, organ function, vagal tone etc. FSM offers a wide treatment approach and benefits How does Frequency Specific Microcurrent (FSM) work? The technique is based on pairs of frequencies, low-level microcurrent amperage currents and the principle of biologic resonance. Each tissue in the body has its own distinct electrical frequency, which can be disrupted by injury or disease. Specific microcurrent frequencies can be applied to the affected area to restore the normal frequencies within the cells, resulting in an often remarkable improvement with removal of toxins, pain, inflammation and general function as a whole. How do the Frequencies Work? The research suggests that the frequencies change cell signalling by interacting with cell membrane receptors; this affects the cell's genetic expression and thereby the optimal cell function is restored. At the cellular level, microcurrent therapy stimulates a dramatic increase in ATP, the energy that fuels all biochemical functions in the body. It also increases protein synthesis, which is necessary for tissue repair. FSM practitioners have varied backgrounds. Some are physios, others are osteopaths, doctors or like myself a naturopath and we each tend to specialise our approach with FSM in line with our training and specialism. Chi Machine The Chi Machine was invented in the late 1980s by Japanese engineer, Keiichi Ohashi. It was designed for passive aerobic exercise, which involves applying constant movement and pressure to parts of the body through an outside force. The Chi machine offers several health benefits, which are said to enhance lymphatic function and therefore assist with detoxification, help in modulating the sympathetic nervous system which will have a beneficial effect on chronic inflammation and last but not least it may help relieve lower back tension. We combine a chi machine session with far infra-red therapy, so you are laid down on a FIR crystal mat with your ankles comfortably resting on the leg supports of the chi machine which is very relaxing. Chinese Cupping/ Cupping Therapy Cupping is an incredible tool and treatment, with a myriad of effects whilst its flexibility as a technique and instrument mean that its application can help with a wide range of local and systemic symptoms. Chinese medicine believes that illness, stress and pain can be caused by a blockage or stagnation of blood, lymph fluids and vital energy (known as chi). Cupping therapy can be effectively used to stimulate movement of blood, lymph fluids and essential chi in the body. The cells of the body use oxygen then give off carbon dioxide. When the energy is blocked the cell waste or carbon dioxide gets blocked. This is called acid or toxin build up. Physical pain implies that there is a blockage in the flow of energy through a particular area. When toxins or cell waste stagnate in the muscle or joints it can be very difficult for the body to get rid of this waste causing further blockage and discomfort. Utilising cupping techniques, we are able by vacuum or suction to pull the blockage out of the deep tissue and move it to the skins surface. Once on the surface it is much easier for the body to eliminate toxins through the superficial blood supply or capillary system. Since many types of illness, stress and pain are caused by blockages or stagnation in the circulation of these fluids and chi, cupping therapy often becomes an essential part of a therapy programme Propoltherapy (Propolis ioniser) Propoltherapy will enhance and help to modulate the immune system through short sessions of breathing through a specialized device and mask, therefore creating a greater healing capacity. Benefits of Propolis There are many benefits and uses for propolis. In regards propoltherapy (propolis ioniser unit) it is very helpful for immune defence and immune modulation. The reason for this is that propolis contains several valuable components - antioxidants, amino acids and bioflavonoids that create very beneficial effects in the body. The high antioxidant substances (antioxidants work with the immune system to slow down the advance of free radicals) will have an effect on cognitive abilities. Free radicals are partially responsible for the degeneration of old age, and by stimulating the use and creation of new neural pathways, propolis can keep cognitive disorders at bay and improve memory, retention, and interaction skills as we age. Also because of the high antioxidant level, propolis has been found to reduce the severity of allergic reactions by inhibiting the production of histamines. These antioxidants, bioflavonoids and amino acids have an anti-Inflammatory effect. Propolis has anti-fungal and antibacterial properties as well as a natural antiseptic quality. These are some of the supportive therapies and treatments you can utilize at various clinics around the UK. Please remember it is very important to support yourself on a daily basis with appropriate food, lifestyle choices and with self-care and toxin reducing practices that you can do at home. Here are Some Suggestions: One of my favourite detox supports which I do twice weekly is the moor mud bath because it has high levels of fulvic acids within the algae like mud solution. Fulvic acid is a very small molecule of low molecular weight and it penetrates the cell membrane and mitochondria. Therefore, fulvic acid's small molecular weight coupled with the fact that it is water soluble at all pH levels, makes it superior for working in the body to deliver nutrients (minerals) and bring antioxidant benefits. Fulvic acid has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties so is very beneficial for skin and very importantly fulvic acid bonds to and removes cellular waste products, toxins and heavy metals. So a relaxing bath is giving you a myriad of benefits. - Therapeutic baths - Regular movement throughout the day - at least one hour combined per day. - Skin brushing - Rebounding - Therapeutic coffee enemas - [https://www.holisticsonline.com/detoxification/detox-support/gerson-coffee](https://www.holisticsonline.com/detoxification/detox-support/gerson-coffee) - Castor oil packs It can be very disheartening to realize that toxins are everywhere around you in your daily life. However, there are a great many things you can do to support yourself and reduce your exposure by adding these approaches and therapies into your wellbeing daily practices.
