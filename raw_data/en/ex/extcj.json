These whole-person healing principles guide us in our philosophy of care. VIDEO DISCUSSION As health care providers, we often face the reality that physical healing for our patients is not always possible. In what ways can emotional or spiritual healing still take place? As a group, discuss innovative ways we deliver health care today, like our pioneers who used natural remedies for healing. PRAYER Thank You for giving us health principles in the creation story to guide Your healing ministry. We ask You to reach down and fill us with a love that only You can provide. Bless those we serve, providing courage and hope where needed. In Your name, AmenAdventists founded the health care institutions based on the Bible's principles of health outlined in the Bible's story of creation. Unlike the common thought of the day, they believed health care should treat the disease rather than just the symptoms. Adventists began to advocate the benefits of diet, water, exercise, adequate rest, and trust in God. This makes sense to us today, but more than 150 years ago it was a radical new approach. Healing Through The whole-person lifestyle\u2014CREATION Life principles\u2014has been featured in National Geographic, CNN, The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The Blue Zones, a New York Times best- seller book that describes the lifestyle habits of the world's longest living people.

Begun in 1958, these studies have covered topics such as diet, air pollution, religion, and health, and have gained the sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the World Cancer Research Fund. During a smallpox epidemic in 1870, nearly 10 of every 11 patients recovered from the unique treatments of the Adventist philosophy of natural remedies. In contrast, only one in five recovered under the care of other physicians using popular drug treatments of the day.Natural Remedies Natural Remedies 2:26 minutes youtu.be/k--h-tOVDDc DID YOU KNOW?
