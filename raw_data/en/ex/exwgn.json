I've tried Chinese medicine, which kept them controlled for a while, cut out alcohol and fats from my diet, and am now drinking plenty of water, but I still get indigestion, backache and sometimes fever. Do I need to have an operation to remove the gallbladder to stop these symptoms? Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, then secreted through bile ducts to the small intestine when it is needed for fat digestion. Stones form when the bile becomes too concentrated. The pain is caused by the ducts becoming irritated and inflamed. If pain is severe, or you get fever, nausea, vomiting or pale stools, a duct may be blocked and you should seek immediate medical advice. However, if the stones are small, you can control symptoms and prevent more from forming through diet and herbs. Gallstones are 80% cholesterol, so you are wise to cut out saturated fats and fried foods. Fibre from raw fruit, vegetables and whole grains removes cholesterol from the body. Omega 3 essential fatty acids improve the solubility of bile, stopping the growth of stones. Keep drinking water to make the bile less concentrated, and reduce sugar intake as this inflames the ducts. The herb milk thistle stimulates the liver and reduces cholesterol levels in bile; boldo tea taken three times a day will help to flush out small stones; alfalfa cleans the liver and supplies necessary nutrients, and soy lecithin reduces cholesterol production in the liver. I am a 41-year-old female and following a fall last year have had recurring cellulitis in my left leg. My doctor prescribes antibiotics and has also given me an antibiotic/steroid cream. I would rather treat this ailment without antibiotics - do you have any suggestions? Cellulitis is hot, tender and swollen skin caused by an infection of the deeper skin layers, usually due to the streptococcus bacteria. It would help to raise the leg and cool it with a cold compress. Boost your immune system with Echinacea Forte, by Bioforce, and 2,000mg vitamin C daily. Manuka honey is scientifically recognised for treating wounds: it has antibacterial activity four times greater than standard antiseptics and is active against the seven most common bacteria found in wounds, including the superbug MRSA. ManukaCare 18+, by Comvita, is potent and comes in a tube; it is available from good health stores, along with Echinacea Forte. I have had an itchy anus for years. Creams (for example, E45) relieve it for a while but don't solve the problem. It's not haemorrhoids, apparently, and is particularly bad at night, enough to wake me. You probably have worms, parasites that live in the intestinal tract. Other symptoms are loss of weight and appetite, diarrhoea, digestive disorders and anaemia. Worms can be picked up from dirty toilets or from eating uncooked or partially cooked meat or fish. You should take a high dose of multiminerals and vitamins because the parasites deplete the body of essential nutrients. Your GP will be able to recommend medication, otherwise garlic capsules (take two, three times a day) and pumpkin extract help to get rid of them. Eat only well cooked meats, avoiding pork, and be scrupulous with hygiene. \u00b7 Emma Mitchell is a natural health therapist.
