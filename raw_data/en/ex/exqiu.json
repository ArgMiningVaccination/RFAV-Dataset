America, and the entire civilized world, will face this threat for decades to come. We must confront the danger with open eyes and unbending purpose. \u2014President George W. Bush, February 11, 2004 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S BIOLOGICAL THREAT RISK ASSESSMENT The Committee on Methodological Improveme nts to the Department of Homeland Security's Biological Agent Risk Analysis was established by the National Research Council and convened in August 2006 to review the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) of 2006. The BTRA is a computer-based tool that has been applied by DHS to assess the risk associated with the intentional release of each of 28 biological threat agents categorized by the Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention. The threat posed by biological agents employed in a terrorist attack on the United States is arguably the most important homeland security challenge of our era. Whether natural pathogens are cultured or new variants are bioe ngineered, the consequence of a terrorist-induced pandemic could be millions of casualties\u2014far more than we would expect from nuclear terrorism, chemical attacks, or conventional attacks on th e infrastructure of the United States such as the attacks of September 11, 2001. Even if there were fewer casualties, additional second-order consequences (including psychological, social , and economic effects) would dramatically compound the effects. Bioengineering is no longer the exclusive purview of state sponsors of terrorism; this technology is now available to small terrorist groups and even to deranged individuals. The executive branch recognizes this grav e threat, as witnessed by the following: Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10): Biodefense for the 21st Century (The White House, 2004) calls for DHS to conduct biennial assessments of biological threats, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18 (HSPD-18): Medical Countermeasures Against Weapons of Mass Destruction (The White House, 2007) applies some of the basic assumptions underlying HSPD-10 to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, calling for an in tegrated CBRN risk assessment. DHS produced its report Bioterrorism Risk Assessment in 2006 (DHS, 2006). The BTRA of 2006 and the DHS (2006) report, which docum ents the analysis, respond directly to the requirements of HSPD-10 and of the National Strategy for Homeland Security (Office of Homeland Security, 2002) for DHS to assess the biological weapons threat. This committee has been called to provide an independent, scientific peer review of the methodology that led to the BTRA of 2006 and th at will be the foundation for future biennial ES-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION updates. At this writing, DHS is preparing a revi sion of its bioterrorism risk analysis responding to HSPD-18; this analysis will presumably appear, as directed, in 2008. The committee did not have the draft of the DHS report documenting the analysis of the BTRA of 2008, but it was briefed on some of the enhancem ents and changed procedures that will influence the BTRA of 2008 and considered all information pr ovided in the course of its review. The committee has identified a number of fundame ntal concerns with the BTRA of 2006, ranging from mathematical and statistical mistak es that have corrupted results, to unnecessarily complicated probability models and models with fidelity far exceeding existing data, to more basic questions about how terrorist behavior shou ld be modeled. All of these issues are covered in the body of this report. Rather than merely criticizing what was done in the BTRA of 2006, the committee sought outside experts and collected a number of proposed alternatives that it believes would improve DHS's ability to assess potential terrorist behavior as a key element of risk-informed decision making, and it explains these alternatives in the specific context of the BTRA and the bioterrorism threat. The committee set for itself the following gauge of success for its various deliberations and its final report: If DHS follows the committee's recommendations (drawn from the individual chapters of this report and presented as a compete set in the next section), the resulting product will more reliably assess the possible acts of te rrorists, will be better documented and understood by its clients, and will be more responsive and able not only to assess risk, but to effectively inform strategic investments in risk management. HSPD-10 states: Another critical element of our bi odefense policy is the development of periodic assessments of the evolving biological wea pons threat. First, the United States requires a continuous, formal process for conducting routine capabilities assessments to guide prioritization of our on-going investments in biodefense-related research, development, planning, and prep aredness (The White House, 2004). In accord with HSPD-10, the fundamental concerns of the committee are not only modeling or mathematical details, but the provision to homeland security policy makers of better tools to use when deciding how to invest huge su ms of money to protect this nation against a grave threat. THE CHARGE TO THE COMMITTEE The charge to the committee for this final report is as follows: Recommend how the methodology can incorporate changing probability distributions that reflect how various actors (e.g., terrorist s, first responders, public health community) adjust their choices over time or in different contexts; Recommend further improvements to the consequence analysis component of the methodology, including its models of economic effects; Identify any emerging methods for handling la rge degrees of uncertainty (e.g., fuzzy logic, possibility analysis) that merit consideration for future incorporation; Recommend further improvements to the transparency and usability of the methodology;Discuss in more detail beyond th e first report [the committee's Interim Report] how the methodology could be extended to risks associated with classes of agents, including enhanced or engineered ag ents that have yet to be developed; and ES-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Discuss in more detail beyond the first report the feasibility of extending the methodology to also serve as a framework for ri sk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats. In order to attend to this charge, this committe e reviewed all of the detail in the BTRA of 2006, interviewed its implementers, and called on outside experts. It also received briefings from DHS on planned improvements to the BTRA of 2008. During this process, the committee recorded deficiencies and recommended improvements in the assessment. DHS intended that the BTRA of 2006 be an \"end-to-end risk assessment of the bioterrorism threat\" with potential catastrophic consequences to human health and the national economy and that it \"assist and guide biodefense strategic planning\" (DHS, 2006, Ch. 1, p. 1) in response to the HSPD-10 directive to \"conduct bi ennial assessments of biological threats.\" Guided by DHS's customers for information from the assessment, the BTRA of 2006 was designed to produce assessments in the form of risk-prioritized groups of biol ogical threat agents. These prioritized lists could then be used to iden tify gaps or vulnerabilities in the U.S. biodefense posture and make recommendations for rebalancing and refining investments in the overall U.S. biodefense policy. DHS has assembled a confederation of researchers and subject-matter experts and is collaborating with national laboratories that can contribute to expanding the knowledge base of bioterrorism. RECOMMENDATIONS Overall Assessment The committee met on August 28-29, 2006, with representatives of DHS in response to a DHS request for guidance on its near-term BTRA development efforts. In November 2006, in response to that request and based on the inform ation it had received at the 2-day meeting with DHS, the committee electronically issued its In terim Report (reproduced as Appendix J in this final report). Subsequently the committee recei ved the full DHS (2006) report documenting the analysis in the BTRA of 2006. While DHS ag reed with the recommendations of the Interim Report and planned to address them, the committee did not learn of any progress up to the conclusion of its deliberations in May 2007 th at would obviate those recommendations, which require sustained work. However, the content of the DHS (2006) re port and information gained at additional meetings with DHS and national experts have significantly changed the committee's overall assessment of the BTRA of 2006. The committ ee identified errors in mathematics, risk assessment modeling, computing, presentation, and other weaknesses in the BTRA of 2006. It recommends against using this current BTRA for bi oterrorism risk assessment as presented in the BTRA of 2006 or proposed for 2008. Instead , the committee offers improvements that can significantly simplify and improve future risk asse ssments. The improved BTRA should be used for risk management as well as risk assessment, as intended by HSPD-10. The committee discusses the elemen ts of risk analyses, including risk management, and identifies the crucial differences between the use of risk analysis to assess and manage the risks of natural disasters and its use to assess and manage risks from terrorist attacks. Representing terrorist decision making exclusively as random variab les, as is appropriate in the case of natural disasters, is a fundamental problem with the BTRA.

All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Risk Analysis Lexicon The DHS (2006) report and DHS presentations of its content use inconsistent, imprecise technical language and do not define many key te rms. Clear and consistent risk analysis definitions are essential for precise technical work and clear communication with diverse stakeholders. The committee prepared a risk analysis lexicon for its own use (included as Appendix A in this final report) with definitions and their sources. It is intended to be an example of a lexicon to be used in future DHS reports and presentations. Recommendation: The Department of Homela nd Security should use an explicit risk analysis lexicon for defining each technical t erm appearing in its reports and presentations. Approach to Determining the Prob abilities of Terrorist Decisions DHS has made an important contribution by structuring a nominal bioterrorist attack and identifying the bioagents that should be a ssessed. The committee cl osely examined the assumptions and the mathematical details of the BTRA of 2006 and found that there are weaknesses in the model's conception, errors in some of the underlying mathematics and statistics, and unnecessary complexity. The BTRA represents adversarial decisi ons by means of probabilities assessed by subject-matter experts. However, when dealing w ith an intelligent, goal-oriented, and resourceful adversary (the terrorist), the exclusive use of subjectively assessed probabilities for terrorist decisions is inappropriate. For decision problems as complex as those dealt with in the BTRA, the probability that an adversary will choose a course of action should be an output of analysis, not an input. Accordingly: Recommendation: To assess the probabilities of terrorist decisions, DHS should use elicitation techniques and decision-oriented mo dels that explicitly recognize terrorists as intelligent adversaries who observe U.S. defensiv e preparations and seek to maximize the achievement of their own objectives. Simplifying the Assessment of Outcome Probabilities Decisions, by both terrorist attacker and U.S. defender, should be outputs of a decision support model. The determination of data sources and their reliability is outside the scope of this report. However, data concerning threats, resour ce levels, technological facts, and so forth are inputs. Adversarial decisions can be assessed by subject-matter experts, but these assessments must be conditioned on all of these inputs. This is a daunting task for any subject-matter expert. Appendix G of this report contains material on alternate methods that can be used to quantify uncertainty. This report explains in detail that pr obability theory is suited to the task and that no alternative is needed. However, this repor t discusses at length weaknesses in DHS's use of probability in theory, conception, and computation in the BTRA. Instead of directly assessing conditional probabilities for outcomes, DHS subject-matter experts are asked to assess conditional probability distributions over the probabilities of outcomes. This complication is shown to be unnecessary; the analysis would be unchanged if only the expected value of these distributions was used. ES-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION This simplification would significantly reduce data requirements and accelerate computation. The BTRA software implementa tion seems to the committee to be cumbersome and slow and requires tending by its creators to produce risk assessments. The committee advises simplification so that the BTRA can be used fo r responsive risk assessment and risk management. Recommendation: The event-tree probability elicitation should be simplified by assessing probabilities instead of probability distributions for the outcomes of each event. Regarding Normalization of Risk Assessment Results DHS has chosen to represent \"normalized \" relative risk, without specifying the normalization constant. This decision has obscu red the results of the analysis and made it impossible to understand the results, to reprodu ce any particular BTRA result, or to use independent means to assess the veracity of any result. Moreover, normalization provides insufficient information for risk assessment and risk management. Homeland security decision makers and stakeholders need to see the calcula ted probabilities and consequences to make risk- informed decisions. This is not to say that the committee believes that precise absolute levels of probabilities and consequences can be predicted or are needed. But risk managers and decision makers need some sense of the magnitude of th e probabilities and consequences, and that is not available after normalization. Recommendation: Normalization of BTRA risk assessment results obscures information that is essential for risk-informed decision making. BTRA results should not be normalized. Simplification of the BTRA Event Tree The committee finds Stage 1, Frequency of Initia tion [of an attack] by Terrorist Group, of the BTRA fixed-hierarchy event-tree sequence to be a distracting embellishment. Also, the representation of potential multiple (sequential) terro rist attacks in the BTRA of 2006 is incorrect, both technically and philosophically, and adds an u nnecessary layer of complexity to the analysis. The computation of the expected number of attack s is shown to be mathematically incorrect, and the (random) distribution of consequences of such repeated attacks is shown to be represented incorrectly. However, even if the mathematics were correct, the committee believes that, after the first terrorist attack, all assumptions and paramete r values in the BTRA would change, so that the previous risk analysis would no longer apply. Eliminating the BTRA multiple-attack feature would significantly simplify the model. The committee also finds that some of the stages in the BTRA ch aracterization of the steps leading to a terrorist attack might be aggr egated to the minimum number of stages necessary to calculate probabilities and consequences, maki ng data acquisition simpler without sacrificing fidelity. Recommendation: Two significant simplifications should be made to the BTRA of 2006 event tree: ES-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION DHS should eliminate Stage 1, Frequency of Initiation [of an attack] by Terrorist Group, and Stage 16, Potential for Multiple Attacks; and DHS should seek opportunities to aggregate some stages of the tree to only those essential to calculate probabilities and consequences with realistic fidelity. Need for Transparent, User-Friendly Decision Support System Risk assessment, such as the BTRA, has no direct impact on risk reduction. Only effective risk management strategies can reduce risk, and there are several barriers to the effective use of information from the BTRA in decision making. These include numerous stakeholders with different responsibilities, authority, and indicators of success; disparate data and data sources; and organizational friction and compartm entalization within and among stakeholders. To support risk-informed decision making and mitigate some of these problems, DHS needs transparent and user-friendly decision support mode ls. Accordingly, the committee makes the following three recommendations. Recommendation: Subsequent revision of the BTRA should increase emphasis on risk management. An increased focus on risk management will allow the BTRA to better support the risk-informed decisions that homeland security stakeholders are required to make. Recommendation: DHS should maintain a high level of transparency in risk assessment models, including a comprehensive, clear mathematical document and a complete description of the sources of all input data. The documentation should be sufficient for scientific peer review. Recommendation: Subsequent revision of the BTRA should enable a decision support system that can be run quickly to test the implications of new assumptions and new data and provide insights to decision makers and stakeholders to support risk-informed decision making. Rapid Assessment Strategy for New Information The committee has highlighted th e dynamic nature of the biological threat and was asked to show how the BTRA might be applied to e nhanced or engineered biological agents. The committee suggests a rapid assessment tool and pro poses a template that suggests how to quickly estimate the threat from emerging or suspected agents to determine whether a more detailed exigent study is necessary. It agrees that this is an important goal and makes the following recommendation: Recommendation: The BTRA should be broad enough to encompass a variety of bioterrorism threats while allowing for changing situations and new information. DHS should develop a strategy for the rapid assessment of newly recognized and poorly characterized threats. ES-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Existing Knowledge and the De tail in Consequence Models The committee examined the consequence analysis of the BTRA. It finds that the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered ( SEIR) model used to analyze the health consequences of a bioterrorist attack requires, with regard to pathogens, data that do not exist. There is scant empirical basis for pathogens that have only recently been di scovered in nature and with which there is little experience. Extremely limited clinical and epidemiologic data exist about many of the pathogens in the BTRA of 2006. The granularity of detail in the SEIR models is not supported by existing data on any pathogen on the BTRA list. Recommendation: The susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model adopted by DHS is more complex than can be supported by existing data or knowledge. DHS should make its SEIR model as simple as possible consistent with existing knowledge. Consequences Besides Mortality and Morbidity That Need to Be Modeled DHS is planning to include second-order economic effects in the BTRA of 2008. The committee highlights those effects, including impor tant agricultural effects, and discusses the use of cost-benefit analysis to provide a common measure. Recommendation: While human mortality and the magnitude and duration of morbidity should remain the primary focus of DHS bioterrorism risk analysis, DHS should incorporate other measures of societal loss, including the magnitude and duration of first- and second-order economic loss and environmental and agricultural effects. Methods for Improved Modeling of Intelligent Adversaries The committee attaches great importance to the realistic representation of the behavior of an intelligent adversary. BTRA probabilities are c onditioned on past events and are retrospective, whereas the terrorist is prospective, constantly adjusting tactics to exploit any evident weakness in U.S. defenses. To offer some concrete examples of how to credibly represent the behavior of an intelligent adversary, the committee presents three ways to represent adversarial decisions: (1) a \"bioterrorism decision model\" using off-the-shelf software; (2) a tri-level decision support model to allocate defensive investments (visible to the a ttacker) that represents an attacker's reasonable response to observing these preparations, and reac tions to any attack with the resources made available by the defensive investments; and (3) a game-theoretic model of the adversaries that randomizes expected consequences to capture the variability of outcomes. These are not mere theoretical tools, but rather substantive suggestions drawn from extensive research and experience in the military and in the private sector. These suggestions can significantly improve the credibility and usefulness of the BTRA. Recommendation: In addition to using event trees, DHS should explore alternative models of terrorists as intelligent adversaries who seek to maximize the achievement of their objectives. ES-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION ES-8 Use of Intelligent-Adversary Risk Analysis Techniques for Other Threat Areas The committee believes that each of its suggested extensions to realistically represent adversarial behavior is applicable to biological, chemical, and/or radioactive threats. Although distinct models may need to be developed for the analysis of each of these threats, the resulting analyses can be compared on a common conse quence scale to suggest and evaluate risk management strategies that encompass all terrorist threats. Regarding the Use of the BTRA in Its Present Form For the reasons noted in this report's r ecommendations and their justifying text, the committee believes that the BTRA in its present form should not be used to assess the risk of bioterrorism threats. For the same reasons, the committee does not recommend trying to extend the BTRA to the qualitatively different chemical and radioactive threats. Recommendation: The BTRA should not be used as a basis for decision making until the deficiencies noted in this report have been addressed and corrected. DHS should engage an independent, senior technical advisory panel to oversee this task. In its current form, the BTRA should not be used to assess the risk of biological, chemical, or radioactive threats. The committee takes very seriously the biot errorism threats and potential consequences that it has had to consider in this study. It is fully aware of the potential impact of its recommendations on the BTRA of 2008 and the stakeholders who await it. However, it believes that the failure to properly model intelligent a dversaries and a continuation on the path of unnecessary complexity in computer modeling and simulations will not help the United States defend against the bioterrorist threats in the 21st cen tury and will not meet the intent of HSPD-10. Therefore, the committee unanimously believes that an improved BTRA is needed to provide a much more credible foundation for risk-informed decision making.

Biological weapons attacks could cause catastro phic harm. They could inflict widespread injury and result in massive casualties and economic disruption. \u2014Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10: Biodefense for the 21st Century, 2004 THIS IS THE CHALLENGE The U.S. government has made the countering of biological weapons a top priority for well over a decade. With the international community, the United States recognizes that the biotechnology revolution, which promises a better qua lity of life for all people, also offers the capability for misuse. Biotechnology is powerfu l, relatively inexpensive, and increasingly accessible to U.S. adversaries, from nation-states, to nonstate actors including terrorists, to deranged individuals. Rapid advances in molecular biol ogy and genomics, including the introduction of new drug-resistant agents, mean that the threat is dynamic and adaptive and that attacks could be increasingly lethal. Defending ag ainst bioterrorism may be the greatest among U.S. national security challenges. THE THREAT IS GROWING Today the nation is a long way from being able to meet the challenges posed by a bioterrorist attack. The United States currently has little ability to prevent or detect a biological attack, and the nation's response systems are unproven. Biological weapons are easily concealed and hard to track. Biological attacks are poten tially repeatable, and attribution is extremely difficult, as was learned from the anthrax attacks in the United States in the fall of 2001. A National Intelligence Council assessment in 2004 c oncluded that \"over the next 10 to 20 years there is a risk that advances in biotechnology will augment not only defensive measures but also offensive biological warfare (BW) agent deve lopment and allow the creation of advanced biological agents designed to target specifi c systems\u2014human, animal, or crop\" (National Intelligence Council, 2004, p. 36). The report states further that \"as biotechnology advances become more ubiquitous, stopping the progress of offensive BW programs will become increasingly difficult\" (ibid.). Before Sept ember 11, 2001 (9/11), a report by the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st Century (commonly known as the Hart-Rudman Commission), New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century, was published; the report stated that serious threats \"may consis t instead of unannounced attacks by subnational groups using genetically engin eered pathogens against American cities\" (U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st Century, 1999, p. 2). Improving the U.S. capability to prevent, detect, and respond to the use of biological weapons is clearly a matter of national urgency. According to recent congressional testimony by 1-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION the Director of National Intelligence, al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups continue to show interest in these weapons (Negroponte, 2007).1 The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (referred to he rein as the WMD Commission) in March 2005 reaffirmed the complexity, gravity, and urgency of the threat, as well as the inadequacy of the government's response. \"We are concerned,\" th e report states, \"that terrorist groups may be developing biological weapons a nd may be willing to use them. Even more worrisome, in the near future, the biotechnology revolution will make even more potent and sophisticated weapons available to small or relatively unsophisticated groups. In response to this mounting threat, the Intelligence Community's perform ance has been disappointing\" (WMD Commission, 2005, p. 504). In short, the WMD Commission found that the U.S. government has been unacceptably slow to develop an effective strategic capability to prevent, detect, and respond to a biological attack. A decade ago, experts both inside and outside government argued for a strategic, collaborative, and integrated approach to risk assessment and risk management among federal, state, and local governments, law enforcement, th e military, the private sector, the media, and the medical, scientific, and academic communities (Drell et al., 1999, pp. 125-126). The steps taken by the federal government to develop a national strategy and the collaborative network to support it (see the next section) are still incomplete. The completion of these steps would require continuous multidisciplinary analysis and enga ge multiple stakeholders across functional disciplines as well as across federa l, state, local, and tribal governments. The anthrax attacks in the United States in the period after 9/11 added urgency to the need for such an effort. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION Executive and legislative actions taken since 9/11 have sharpened th e federal government's focus on bioterrorism. The Congress in November 2002 passed and the president signed the Homeland Security Act (Public Law No. 107- 296), which established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and gave it the r esponsibility for developing countermeasures to biological agents. In April 2004, President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10): Biodefense for the 21st Century , which directs DHS, \"in coordination with other Federal departments and agencies,\" to conduct assess ments of the biological threat (The White House, 2004). The first Department of Homeland Security bi oterrorism risk assessment\u2014referred to in this report as the Biological Threat Risk Assessment, or BTRA\u2014was completed on January 31, 2006. The report documenting the analysis, Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (DHS, 2006) was published on October 1, 2006, by the DHS Biological Threat Characterization Center (BTCC) of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC). This assessment and report satisfied the requirements of the National Strategy for Homeland Security (Office of Homeland Security, 2002) and of HSPD-10 for DHS to assess the biological weapons threat. DHS intended that the BTRA of 2006 be an \"end-to-end risk assessment of the bioterrorism threat\" with potential catastrophic consequences to human health and the national economy and that it \"assist and guide biodefense strategic pla nning\" (DHS, 2006, Ch. 1, p. 1) in response to the HSPD-10 directive to \"conduct biennial assessmen ts of biological threats.\" Guided by the primary customers for information from the assessment\u2014for example, the White House Homeland Security Council, the Department of Health and Human Services, various offices of 1 A critical assessment of the intelligence community's efforts, even after 9/11, to determine al- Qaeda's biological weapons capability is contained in WMD Commission (2005). 1-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These prioritized lists could then be used to identify gaps or vulnerabilities in the nation's biodefense posture and to make recommendations for rebalancing and refining investments in overall U.S. biodefense policy. National Strategy for Combating Terrorism (The White House, 2006) describes U.S. efforts against terrorism of all kinds, not just bioterrorism, and serves as guidance for the specific application of efforts against bioterrorism. The Department of Homeland Security has made the preparation against biological weapons attacks a priority and deployed the BioWatch Program to provide early warning of an outdoor pathogen release in selected areas across the United States (Congressional Research Service, 2003). The BioWatch Program has three main elements: sampling, analysis, and response. The Environmental Protection Agency maintains the sensors that collect airborne particles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coordinates analyses. Local jurisdictions are responsible for the public health response to positive findings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is designated as the lead agency for the law enforcement response if a bioterrorism event is detected. In January 2007, the White House issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18 (HSPD-18): Medical Countermeasures Against Weapons of Mass Destruction (The White House, 2007), which builds on HSPD-10 while \"maturing\" some of its basic assumptions and applying them broadly to the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) challenge. Significantly, HSPD-18 mandates more incremental, integrat ed, and flexible policies on preparedness and response to potential weapons of mass destruction attacks. It concedes that the development and stockpiling of medical countermeasures against ev ery possible biological threat is not feasible today, and it calls for an integrated CBRN risk assessment. THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL ESTABLISHED THIS COMMITTEE At the request of the Department of Home land Security, the National Research Council established the Committee on Methodological Impr ovements to the Department of Homeland Security's Biological Agent Risk Analysis to pr ovide a review, carried out in two reports (an interim report focused on near-term improvements and the final report to recommend longer-term improvements), of the methodology described in Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (DHS, 2006). The interim report, prepared by the committee in 2006, is included as Appendix J of the present report. To address its charge, the committee car ried out the following activities: It held four 2-day meetings at the Nati onal Academies in Washington, D.C., in August and November 2006 and in January and May 2007, used for information gathering and report organization and writing; It heard and discussed presentations from gove rnment, academic, and medical experts; It received briefings on risk assessment for biological pathogens from representatives of the White House Homeland Security Council, the DHS Office of Science and Technology, DHS's National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), Battelle Memorial Institute, and th e Homeland Security Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events; 1-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION It reviewed DHS's Bioterrorism Risk Assessment, published in October 2006; and Committee members visited the Battelle Me morial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, for further consultations on Oct ober 2-3, 2006, because NBACC contracted with Battelle to produce a computational engine to assess the \"normalized risk\" of 28 pathogens as that risk relates to death, morbidity, and direct economic costs.2 In federal fiscal year (FY) 2007, DHS directed Battelle to impr ove and refine its probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). COMPLETION OF THE INTERIM REPORT The seven tasks of the committ ee with respect to the inte rim report of December 2006 (see Appendix J) were as follows: To assess the adequacy of the DHS's current methodology as a foundation for the desired risk analysis capabilities; To identify any other risk analyses that re ly on the major components of the existing methodology, probabilistic risk analysis and multi-attribute risk analysis and which could guide DHS's future developments; To assess the feasibility of incorporating mode ls of second-order economic effects into the methodology during FY2007; To identify better methods, if any, for hand ling the high degrees of uncertainty associated with the risk analyses of biological agents; To recommend near-term improvements to e nhance the transparency of the method and its usefulness to decision-makers; To discuss how the methodology could be exte nded to risks associated with classes of agents, including enhanced or engineered agents that have yet to be developed; To discuss the feasibility of extending the me thodology to also serve as a framework for risk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats. In the interim report, the committee made three recommendations: DHS should establish a clear st atement of the long-term purposes of its bioterrorism risk analysis. DHS should improve its analysis of intelligent adversaries. DHS should increase its risk analysis me thodology's emphasis on risk management. The interim report also commented on the technical aspects of Battelle's technique and the broader suitability of PRA. At the time it was written and under the circumstances of the writing of its interim report\u2014that is, based solely on DHS presentations made at a single 2-day meeting and prior to committee receipt of any complete written documentation of DHS's methodology\u2014the committee was gua rdedly optimistic that DHS was on the right track. As is explained more fully in Chapter 3 of the present report, when the committe e was able to examine 2 In general usage, the distinction between \"direct\" and \"indirect\" costs is not precise. \"Direct\" refers to costs such as those associated with closing a facility or controlling an epidemic. Other, or \"indirect,\" costs are those that result from these actions, such as lost business or reduced productivity. 1-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION DHS's Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (DHS, 2006), which describes the methodology of the BTRA, it found underlying the analysis several aspects of the event-tree structure that inherently limit the ability to perform reliable risk assessmen t and to serve as a tool for risk managers. The committee pointed out in its interim report that the inability to model intelligent adversaries was a major weakn ess in the BTRA methodology, and it recommended that DHS remedy that failing. The committee agreed that other work planned by DHS for FY 2007, notably in improving the elicitation of information from subject-matter experts and improving the modeling of consequences, was of value, and so it did not believe that a wholesale course correction was needed in FY 2007. OVERVIEW OF THE FINAL REPORT AND OF ITS RECOMMENDED METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS Structure of the BTRA of 2006 Examined As indicated above, it was only after the issuance of its interim report that the committee was provided with a copy of the DHS (2006) report documenting the BTRA methodology. The committee then gained additional information at subsequent meetings (as well as at focused visits to Battelle in Columbus, Ohio, with DHS personne l) that allowed specific examination of the technical content of the DHS (2006) report. This revised and more detailed picture assembled by the committee revealed that PRA, as used in the BTRA of 2006, is the wrong framework for modeling risks that are inherently dependent on the choices made by intelligent adversaries. The normalized risk assessments produced by such a process can be biased in ways and magnitude that cannot be determined. In Chapter 3, the committee examines the stru cture of the BTRA of 2006 more closely, explains the need to model intelligent adve rsaries, and addresses other mathematical and structural weaknesses of the BTRA. The detailed and careful mathematical description and assessment of the BTRA described in Chapters 3 and 7, representing a major activity of the committee, were not completed in time to be incl uded in the committee's interim report. As a result, the last recommendation in Chapter 7 of this final report represents a significant change in the overall assessment of the BTRA from that made on page 12 of the interim report: \"DHS's current methodology is ade quate but incomplete.\" Chapter 4 establishes the need for risk management, in part by looking at the \"stakeholders,\" or various users of DHS's assessment information, and recommends that the DHS risk analysis be part of a decision support system. In Chapter 7 and in Appendixes D, E, and F, the committee provides three methods of doing this modeling. Hypothetical Anthrax-Attack Scenario Employed Thoughtfully developed, scenario-based exercises can provide unique insights of value to public- and private-sector decision makers responsib le for the prevention of, preparation for, and response to bioterrorism. The notional scenario th at the committee employs in this report, taken from Homeland Security Council (2004), can be used to add specificity to discussions throughout the report. This scenario, involving an aerosol anthrax attack in a highly populated U.S. city, begins with a single aerosol anthrax attack de livered by a truck using a concealed improvised spraying device in one densely populated urban city with a significant commuter workforce. Anthrax spores, delivered by aerosol, result in inhalation anthrax, which develops when the spores are inhaled into the lungs and germinat e into vegetative bacteria capable of causing 1-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A progressive infection follows. Attacks are made in five separate metropolitan areas in a sequential manner. Three cities are attacked in itially, followed by two additional cities 2 weeks later. The crisis stresses and breaks the res ponse capabilities of all relevant public and private institutions, rapidly leading to 328,400 exposures; 13,200 fatalities; and 13,300 other casualties. The full political, psychological, social, and econom ic impacts of the attack adversely affect national financial markets and consumer confid ence, devastate the local and regional economy, and cause public faith in government to plummet across the country. Lexicon of Risk Terminology Developed This final report stresses the importance of clarity, precision, and consistency in defining risk terminology. To ensure internal consis tency in its own report, the committee developed a lexicon (Appendix A) which serves as an example of the sort of clear terminology that DHS should develop, adopt, and perhaps dissemina te for government-wide use. The committee employs the broad term \"risk analysis\" to incorpor ate the elements of problem formulation, risk assessment, risk communication, and risk mana gement. The committee regards the following four principles as central to the risk analysis of the bioterrorism threat: Risk analysis needs to address bioterrorism uncertainties: Probabilistic risk assessment is a proven technique that can be used for managing the risks from bioterrorism. Bioterrorism risk analysis requires access to multidisciplinary expertise: Key disciplines include biology, epidemiology, psychology, public communications, decision analysis and risk analysis, operations research, probability, and statistics. Risk analysis must be responsive to dynamic terrorism threats: Risk analysis must take into account changing threat conditions a nd their resource implications over time. Intelligent adversaries will adjust their strategies and tactics to counter the U.S. ability to detect, prepare for, and respond to their att acks. Therefore, the nature of risk is a continuing evolution and will always be difficult to estimate. The purpose of risk assessment is to support risk management: Policy makers should develop risk mitigation measures that are in formed by risk analysis, including assessment of social, psychological, direct, and indirect economic impacts, and should apply such measures in a manner that consciously seeks to avoid unintended consequences. Technical and Process Improvements Recommended This final report is intended to help DHS evaluate its progress on and to improve its methodological approach to biological agent risk assessment. The committee's charge, addressed in this report, is as follows: Recommend how the methodology can incorporate changing probability distributions that reflect how various actors (e.g., terrorist s, first responders, public health community) adjust their choices over time or in different contexts; Recommend further improvements to the consequence analysis component of the methodology, including its models of economic effects; Identify any emerging methods for handling la rge degrees of uncertainty (e.g., fuzzy logic, possibility analysis) that merit consideration for future incorporation; 1-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Recommend further improvements to the transparency and usability of the methodology; Discuss in more detail beyond the first report how the methodology could be extended to risks associated with classes of agents, including enhanced or engineered agents that have yet to be developed; and Discuss in more detail beyond the first report the feasibility of extending the methodology to also serve as a framework for ri sk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats. In January 2006, the Office of Manageme nt and Budget (OMB) issued technical guidance for risk assessment. A report from th e National Research Council (NRC, 2007) entitled Scientific Review of the Proposed Risk Assessm ent Bulletin from the Office of Management and Budget identified, in the OMB guidance, many of the same problems cited in the present report: unclear technical definitions, improper uncertainty analysis and use of expected values, and poorly conceived consequence analysis. The present report recommends technical and process improvements that are intended to make DHS ri sk assessment methodology more understandable, more credible, easier to communicate, and both defensible and useful at every major decision- making point in a comprehensive and effective risk management system. In Chapter 2 the committee examines the br oader context of the risk assessment methodology; in Chapter 3 it examines the im plementation of the BTRA by the Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio; and in Chapters 3 through 7 the committee recommends improvements in the methodology. The report's 13 appendixes provide the following: A: A lexicon containing the technical terms used in this report; B: A concise mathematical description of the 2006 BTRA event tree; C: A numerical example illustrating th e simplification of probability assessment; D: An alternative model for risk assessment using decision trees: E: An alternative model for risk assessment using mathematical optimization; F: An alternative model and example of risk assessment using game theory; G: A discussion of alternative means to quantify uncertainty; H: A discussion of the role of interdependencies in managing risk; I: An independent review of the BTRA of 2006; J: A reprint of the committee's interim report; K: The meeting agendas of the committee; L: A list of acronyms used in this report; and M: Biographies of committee members. In the committee's view, it is imperative that the bioterrorism threat risk assessment be used to facilitate a coherent strategy of risk management against a grave and growing threat to U.S. security.

The list of \"stakeholders,\" or primary public-sector customers, as identified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is presented in Chapter 4. Although the comm ittee does not know the uses to which these stakeholders will apply the Biological Threat Ri sk Assessments (BTRAs) of DHS, it is confident that these uses and the two explicitly mentioned in HSPD-10 will require the use of the BTRA as the basis of a risk analysis system. This ch apter examines the components of such a system, especially as they relate to health risk analysis. RISK ANALYSIS IS THE DISCIPLINE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SHOULD USE The risk analysis framework consists of five elements: Problem formulation, Risk assessment, Risk perception, Risk communication, and Risk management. 1 Risk analysis offers (1) a framework for a pplying scientific knowledge and the data to examine risk management decision making when the consequences of alternative decisions are uncertain and (2) a systematic method of revising decisions in the light of new information or events. The hazards to be analyzed (e.g., physi cal, chemical, nuclear, radiological, and biological agents) may result from natural events (e.g., earthquakes and hurricanes), technological events 1 For more details on the risk analys is framework, see Kunreuther (2002). 2-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION (e.g., chemical accidents) and human activity (e .g., the design and operation of engineered systems or an attack by a terrorist). In Bioterrorism Risk Assessment , the DHS (2006) report describing the methodology of the BTRA of 2006, DHS used only two of these elements, problem formulation and risk assessment, as described in Chapter 3 of the presen t report. However, the committee believes that all five steps listed above should be unified and taken with the u ltimate goal of effective risk management. Problem Formulation To undertake any systemic risk analysis, it is necessary to clarify the problem being studied, the key stakeholders, their relationship to one another and to the problem being solved, and their values and goals (Keeney, 1992). Stakeholders may have different objectives, depending on the potential type of attack bei ng considered: for example, for some, prevention may be the primary concern; for others, response and mitigation may be primary. Without a clear understanding of stakeholder objectives with respect to alternative terrorist tactics, risk management strategies may be developed that are unl ikely to be implemented. In the context of the bioterrorism problem, the key interested parties are the relevant public-sector agencies concerned with this risk, the terrorists (who would like to discover U.S. assessments and policies), those who will be directly and indirect ly attacked by the terrorists, those adversely affected economically and physically (through adve rse health effects), and the taxpayer, who will have to pay for the risk management and some of the losses. In order to make the best choices, public and private decision makers may require inputs from biologists, public health care professionals, decision analysts, risk analysts, economists, political scientists, policy analysts, psychologist s, sociologists, statisticians, and related professionals. Since by the committee's definition almost everyone in the U.S. population is a stakeholder in BTRA information, it is important to develop strategies to reconcile differences among subpopulations. These subpopula tions will perceive risk on the basis of their own goals and objectives. Techniques such as value-tree analysis (von Winterfeldt, 1987) may be useful in bringing out and reconciling these differences. Risk Assessment Risk assessment is the process of identifying h azards and targets and quantifying the risks that the hazards pose (magnitude, spatial scale, duration, and intensity) and the associated probabilities, including the uncertainties surrounding these estimates. 2 The primary goal of risk assessment is to produce information to improve risk management decisions by identifying and quantifying cause-and-effect relationships betw een alternative risk management decisions and their consequences and by identifying decisions that may increase the probabilities of preferred outcomes. Risk assessment may include a descr iption of the cause-and-effect links between different hazards, and the nature of the interd ependencies, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Once the problem has been formulated, risk assessment begins with hazard identification: the process of specifying the scope of the assessment and summarizing the available empirical evidence showing that a specific \"hazard\" (such as exposure to a specific pathogen in a specific environment) causes specifie d adverse health effects. Hazard identification can serve the following purposes: 2 See Haimes (1998) for a comprehensive summary of recent work in risk assessment. 2-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Rapid screening of potential hazards by identifying whether available data support the hypothesized relationship between the hazard and specific health effects, possibly using formal statistical methods of causal analysis ( Shipley, 2000 ); Identification of causal relationships betw een identified hazards and specific adverse human health effects; and Identification of risk factors, behaviors, and exposure conditions that increase risks to specific exposed populations (e.g., the old, the young). Studies to identify specific hazards, their proba bility of occurrence, and the probability of occurrence of their associated consequences are a part of risk assessment. In these studies, experts can provide insight into terrorists' va lues and objectives\u2014along with their assessments of associated risks\u2014but the experts need to take special care not to filter these estimates through their own values. Health risk assessments are specializations of the methods described above. They typically use explicit analytic models (e.g., sta tistical models, probabilistic simulation) of causal relationships between actions and their probable health effects. Exposure models describe the transport and distribution of hazardous materials through different media and pathways (e.g., air, foods, drinking water) leading from their source(s) to members of the exposed population. Because different exposures lead to different h ealth outcomes, a successf ul exposure assessment should describe the frequency distribution of expos ures of different parts of the population. Dose-response models ideally quantify th e conditional probability of illness caused by each level of exposure as well as the degree of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. For some biological agents, it may be necessary to fit separate dose-response models to \"normal\" and \"susceptible\" subpopulations at risk and to acc ount for interindividual variability in dose- response relations. In general, risk assessment requires a description of the severities as well as the frequencies of adverse health outcomes caused by exposures and the potential value of gathering additional information to reduce th e uncertainty surroundi ng these risk estimates. One useful graphical way to capture th e extent of expert knowledge about a particular risk is to construct an exceedance-probability (EP) curve. An EP curve specifies the probability that a certain level of losses will be exceeded. The losses can be measured in terms of dollars of damage, fatalities, illness, or some other unit of analysis. If one views the loss as a random variable, the EP is simply the complementary cumulative distribution of the loss. For example, suppose one were interested in constructing an EP curve for direct dollar losses from the first bioterrorism attack described in the aerosol anthrax scenario employed in this report (see Chapter 1). Event trees and fault trees, 3 used as part of probabilistic risk assessments, would identify the set of conditions and subsequent events that could produce a given dollar loss, determine the resulting probabilities of exceeding losses of different magnitudes, and combine the results. Based on these estimates, the mean EP curve, depicted in Figure 2.1, could be constructed. Suppose that one focuses on a specific loss, L i. One can see from Figure 2.1 that the likelihood that losses will exceed Li is given by p i. The x axis measures the loss in dollars and the y axis depicts the probability that losses will exceed a particular level.4 It is much easier to construct an EP curve for natural disasters and chemical accidents than for bioterrorist activities. But even for t hose more predictable accidents or disasters, there 3 See the Lexicon in Appendix A for definitions of event tree and fault-tree analysis. 4 A detailed discussion of how one constructs an EP curve and incorporates elem ents of uncertainty on these estimates appears in Grossi and Kunreuther (2005, Chapters 2 and 4). 2-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Providing information on the range of th is uncertainty associated with risk assessments should increase the credibility of the expert estimates of these numbers. The model used for the DHS BTRA of 2006, full y described in Chapter 3 of this report, was used to determine the relative risk of th e terrorist use of each of 28 specific pathogens, identified in other sources. Risk Perception Risk perception is concerned with the psychological factors, including emotional factors, that have been shown to have an enormous impact on behavior (Slovic, 2000). Risk perceptions can be influenced by personal knowledge, experien ce, and beliefs, and they can be affected by an individual's changing recognition of the threat, the vulnerabilities, and/or the consequences. Risk perception may be influenced by new information about hazards, ri sk assessments, risk policies, and risk management decisions. In a set of pathbreaking studies begun in the 1970s, psychologists began measuring laypeople's concerns about different types of ri sks. These studies showed that those hazards for which a person had little knowledge and which were also highly dreaded were perceived as being the most \"risky\" (e.g., most probable). For some technologies such as nuclear power and activities such as storing radioactive waste, there was a wide disparity between the general citizenry's view and the experts' view of the ri sk\u2014that is, of both the hazards and their associated probabilities. The finding that laypeople and th e scientific community see the world differently also raised a set of questions as to the nature of the decision-making process for dealing with risks. For some time those in the scientific community felt that it was appropriate to ignore the public's perception of the risk if it differed significantly from their own estimates. It is now known that the public did not believe the expert s' assessments because those assessments were not communicated well, the assumptions on which they were based were not stated well, and there was little understanding by the public of the reasons for disagreement among the experts. In recent years, there has been increased sympathy for including the psychological and emotional factors involved in perception of risk as part of risk assessment. Recent studies have confirmed this view of how the public perceives risk by showing that the public will assiduously avoid certain activities because they are perceived to be unduly dangerous. More specifically, there is a stigma associated with technologies, places, and products if the public perceives them to be hazardous (Fly nn et al., 2001) even though in many of these cases the scientific evidence s uggests that there is little to be concerned about. Stimulated by media reporting, the public's perception of the risk is often amplified in ways that are difficult to explain solely by a technical risk assessment (Kasperson et al., 2001). The problems associated with risk perception are compounded because of the difficulty individuals have in making a decision requiring th e interpretation of very low probabilities. In fact, there is empirical evidence that people ma y not even want data on the probability of an event's occurring (Huber and Wider, 1997). There is now a large body of evidence that individuals' risk perceptions are affected by judgmental biases. The availability heuristic is one of the most relevant biases for dealing with ex treme events: here people estimate the probability of an event by the ease with which they can imagine or recall past instances (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973). In cases where the information on an event is salient, so that individuals fail to take into account the base rate, there w ill be a tendency by many to overestimate the probability of the event's occurring. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), many people refused to fly because they perceive d a high probability of bein g hijacked. This was true even though it could be argued that the probability of being hijacked was extremely low, given the increased vigilance and added protection by the federal government. 2-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION There is also a growing body of evidence that emotions play an important role in an individual's decision processes. Such behavior is not irrational. Rather than basing one's choices simply on the probability and consequences of different events, as normative models of decision making suggest, individuals are also influenced by emotional factors such as fear, worry, and love (Finucane et al., 2000; Loewenstein et al., 2001). Risk Communication The importance of risk communication in the overall risk management process is emphasized in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (The White House, 2004): A critical adjunct capability to mass casualty care is effective risk communication. Timely communications with the general public and the medical and public health communities can significantly influence the success of response efforts, including health- and life-sustaining interventions. Risk communication is used by risk analysts, decision makers, policy makers, and even intelligent adversaries to provide data, informa tion, and knowledge designed to change or to shape the risk perceptions of individuals and orga nizations and to cause them to assess the risk in a different way than they otherwise might. Well-designed risk communication facilitates the effective participation and interaction of technical experts, stakeholders, and decision makers in risk management decision processes and deliberatio ns. Risk communication is also used to present the results of risk analyses to stakehol ders, decision makers, participants, and other audiences. Communication and deliberation drive much of the risk management decision process in many risk management applications and are essential for successful outcomes. The relationship of risk communication to risk mana gement is examined in the National Research Council (NRC) report entitled Understanding Risk , which states: \"the process (of risk characterization) must have an appropriately diverse participation or representation of the spectrum of interested and affected parties, of d ecision makers, and of specialists in risk analysis, at each step\" (NRC, 1996, p. 3). The most common goals for risk communication programs are these: To provide information to individuals and groups about risks so that they can make better-informed decisions or seek more information; To influence people to change their behaviors, their attitudes, and beliefs about hazards and their acceptance of risk management decisions and policy recommendations; To involve affected parties in the decision process; and To facilitate their participation in conflict-resolution, consensu s building, and collective decision making about risk management. The field of risk communication provides guidelines for the accomplishment of these goals, derived mainly from experience, analysis of surv ey data, and experiments, and for sharing risk information among stakeholders and decision makers. As noted above, a number of studies have shown that people have difficulty processing data regarding low-probability ev ents. This raises the problem of effectively communicating information on risk to the public, especially information involving very low or high probabilities\u2014an important component in any risk communication strategy for dealing with the bioterrorist threat. The use of EP curves such as that shown in Figure 2.1 can indicate the 2-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION uncertainties surrounding a particular risk. However, as pointed out above, laypeople are not likely to process these data in the formulaic ma nner that scientists and engineers might. Risk communication approaches must recognize the difficulties that individuals have in collecting and analyzing data from experts, particularly with respect to low-probability events. The format and presentation of risk information and the framing of associated questions or surveys can greatly affect the manner in whic h recipients respond to, assimilate, and act on the information. For example, in medical decisions, people are more likely to elect a medical procedure when it is described as \"99 percent safe\" than when it is described as having \"a 1 percent chance of complications\" ( Gurm and Litaker, 2000 ). Presenting relative risks rather than absolute risks and using loss framing instead of gain framing make it more likely that patients will adopt screening procedures. In presenting economic risks, the language used may trigger speculations about the presenter's motives and unde rmine his or her credibility with the target audience ( MacGregor et al ., 1999 ). Understanding such effects can help in preparing the presentation of factual information in ways th at are likely to elicit desired responses. A striking insight from the framing literature is that there may be no neutral way to present risk information . Any presentation carries with it potential presentation and framing effects and biases that may affect the recipients' attention, interpretation, and actions. Presenting the same information in different ways and emph asizing fact-rich displays (e.g., cumulative risk profiles) that are not strongly associated with known presentation biases may come as close as possible to providing the information needed for rational decision making without biasing the decision. However, such displays may be difficult to understand, as they may lack the brevity and focus that are most effective in an action-oriented presentation. The challenge of biological agent risk analysis is daunting because it requires inputs from multiple disciplines and, if properly in tegrated into risk management, will engage a vast network of stakeholders across every le vel of government, the private sector, the medical community, and the media. Progress to ward this goal will require that the diverse population of stakeholders share a common language and terminology with respect to concepts of risk analysis. This concept has yet to be translated into reality. Precise terminology has a special urgency in the case of biological agent risk analysis. As is always the case in science, the absence of a precise definition of terms frustrates the effort to improve methodologies because experts may use the same words or phrases differently. For example, the word \"risk\" may be interpreted in very different ways by different individuals. The committee stresses the importance of term inology. Because the BTRA is meant to provide a basis for critical planning and decision ma king, some of it very costly and with its own risks, imprecision in terminology can have seri ous consequences. In the briefings that the committee received, there was ambiguous, conflicting, and incorrect use of some technical terms. The committee has made an effort to provide authoritative definitions of all of the relevant terms used in this report and includes the lexicon that it developed as Appendix A. This can serve as a model for a DHS lexicon. Recommendation: The Department of Homela nd Security should use an explicit risk analysis lexicon for defining each technical t erm appearing in its reports and presentations. Risk Management 2-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Risk management is the process of construc ting, evaluating, implementing, monitoring, and revising strategies for reducing (or distributi ng) losses from future hazards and dealing with the recovery process should a hazard occur. Ri sk management takes scientific information obtained from risk assessment and factors influencing risk perception as inputs, along with value judgments and with policy goals and constraints, and proposes alternative strategies for reducing losses from future hazards and dealing with the r ecovery process should a disaster occur. Risk management strategies include a combination of options such as the provision of information (i.e., risk communication); the offering of economic incentives (e.g., subsidies, fines); prevention or avoidance (e.g., by reducing exposures); the mitigation of consequences (e.g., by appropriate clinical screening, diagnosis, and treatment pro cedures); and/or the transfer of risk (e.g., insurance and compensation). As with the other elements of risk analysis, it is important to identify the key stakeholders and their values a nd goals as well as their short- and long-term priorities. How do they perceive the risks, and what do they need from the risk assessment in order to make better resource allocation decisions? In combination with risk communication st rategies, one can employ economic incentives to encourage individuals to take protective me asures against the bioterrorism threat. Fines coupled with specific regulations or standards can be used to encourage the adoption of protective measures, although there needs to be a sufficien tly high probability that any negligent individual or firm will get caught. Otherwise the person or manager is likely to respond to incentives different from those intended (i.e., ignore the re gulation). If the probability is low enough and/or the fine is small enough, a person may decide that it may pay in the long run not to take protective action. The behavior in such cases is similar to the decision not to put a quarter in a parking meter because one figures that there is a small chance of getting a ticket and in any case the ticket doesn't cost much. Risk management strategies can be evaluated by undertaking cost-benefit analyses to determine the trade-off between the reduction of ri sk and the costs of undertaking such measures. In evaluating a risk management strategy, one n eeds to be concerned with the way that resources are allocated (i.e., efficiency considerations) as well as the impact of these measures on different stakeholders (i.e., distribution or equity considerations). A successful risk analysis shows the estimat ed changes in the frequencies and magnitudes of adverse consequences resulting from different risk management decision options. Risk analysis uses probability distributions, confidence intervals, and other displays to show the uncertainties about the human health consequences of different decisions. It identifies a subset of decision options leading to preferred probability di stributions of health risks and other outcomes. The outputs of a health risk analysis should allow a risk manager to answer the following questions for each risk management decision alternative being evaluated or compared: What change in human health risk would resu lt from each risk management intervention? If the risk management option or action being assessed is implemented, how will the adverse human health effects (e.g., expected numbers of mild, modera te, severe, and fatal illnesses per year; expected numbers of illness-da ys, duration, and latency) change, both in the entire population and in subpopulations with distinct risks? How certain is the change in human health risk that would be caused by each risk management action? Instead of a single value, that is, a point estimate of risk, uncertain risks are characterized by intervals or probab ility distributions indicating how closely the change in human health risk caused by a pr oposed risk management intervention can be predicted. Might management action cause further damage, such as from unforeseen effects of large-scale inoculation or the administration of antidotes? There are several technical options for expressing uncertainty around point estimates (e.g., plausible upper and lower bounds, confidence limits, coefficients of variation). 2-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION What are the key drivers of hazards and uncertainties for each option? The analysis should make clear to the planner the main reasons why the estimated risk from each decision option is as high or low as it is. Are the results driven mainly by predicted exposure levels, by the responses of sen sitive subpopulations, by genetic or epidemiological data that establish tight cons traints on the plausible values, or by other factors? Sensitivity analyses plotting the ch ange in estimated risk as input assumptions and estimates vary within plausible ranges (e.g ., within a few standard deviations of their median or mean values) and can help to identify the combinations and range of input values that drive the main conclusions. TERRORIST THREATS DIFFER FROM NATURAL HAZARDS AND FROM OTHER HUMANLY MADE HAZARDS A special challenge in developing risk assessm ents for a terrorist attack involves human action and reaction. Although terrorist activities and natural disasters can both be characterized as extreme events, there are crucial differences between them, 5 in areas including the following: the availability or lack of historical data, dynamic uncertainty, shifting of attention to unprotected targets, the existence of negative externalities, and governmental influence on the risk. These characteristics are discussed below. Large historical databases on losses from natural hazards are available in the public domain. These data have been utilized by modeling firms in conjunction with estimates by scientists and engineers on the probability and consequences of future disasters in specific locations. In contrast, data on terrorist groups' activities and current threats are normally kept secret for national security reasons. Moreover, while some time-series data on terrorist acts over the past years are in the public domain, they may not reflect the changing expectations of planned activities of terrorist groups today. Because terrorists are likely to design their strategies as a function of their own resources and their knowledge of the vulnerability of their specific targets, the nature of the risk is continuously evolving. The proba bility and consequences of a terrorist attack are determined by a mix of actions and counteractions developed by a range of involved parties and changing over time. This leads to what is called dynamic uncerta inty (Michel-Kerjan, 2003). In contrast, actions can be taken to reduce damage from future natural disasters with the knowledge that the probability associated with the hazard will not be affected by the adoption of these protective measures. For instance, the probability of an eart hquake of a given intensity in a specific location will not change if property owners d esign more quake-resistant structures. In addition, there are issues of interdependent security that need to be considered when predicting or planning involves the actions of each individual at risk from a bioterrorist attack (Heal and Kunreuther, 2006). This interdep endence, as well as issues of perception and communication, was recognized in an earlier NRC report, Terrorism and the Chemical Infrastructure (NRC, 2006). Even if an individual or firm has taken protective actions, there is still some chance that that entity can be contam inated or infected by others who have not undertaken similar measures and hence are at risk. For example, if a person has been vaccinated or taken preventive medicine against a disease, he or she may still contract the illness from others if the vaccine or medicine is not 100 percent eff ective. Even if modifications to a single unit of an organization can reduce the chance of a bioterrorist attack to its own operations, that chance can still be adversely affected by a second unit that did not undertake similar protective measures. In these cases, where there ar e complementarities or positive externalities created by an individual taking protective measures, there is more incentive for one unit to invest in protective 5 For more details on these differences, see Parn ell et al. (2005) and Golany et al. (2007). 2-8 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION measures if the other units have taken similar ac tions. In fact, investing in security is most effective if all elements of the system obtain protection; weak links may lead to suboptimal behavior by everyone (Heal and Kunreuther, 2006; Bier, 2007). Information sharing about risk due to terror ism is clearly different from information sharing about risk due to natural hazards. In the latter case, new scientific studies normally are common knowledge, so insurers and the individuals and businesses at risk, as well as public-sector agencies, all have access to these findings. Howe ver, information on terrorist groups' activities, possible attacks, or current threats is kept secret by government agencies for national security reasons. There are also more fundamental differences between the catastrophic modeling of natural hazards and the modeling of megaterrorism. The issue of effectively modeling the actions of intelligent adversaries by other than probabilistic estim ates is central to this report and is addressed more fully in the remainder of the report. Intern ational terrorism is a matter of national security as well as foreign policy. The government can influen ce the level of risk of future attacks through appropriate counterterrorism policies and international cooperation as well as through adequate crisis management to limit the c onsequences should an attack occur. Some decisions made by a government as part of its foreign policy can also affect the will of terrorist groups to attack the country or its interests abroad (Lapan a nd Sandler, 1988; Lee, 1988; Pillar, 2001). A government can also devote part of its budget to the development of specific measures on national soil to protect the country. The creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002 confirms the importance of this role in ma naging the terrorist risk. In that sense, terrorism risk is partly under the government's control, and it will change depending on at least two complementary strategies by the defenders: the first entails protective measures that could be adopted by those at risk; the second consists of actions taken by the government to enhance the general security and to reduce th e probability that attacks will occur. Hence protection from terrorism is a mixed private-public good. Table 2.1 summarizes the distinctions between risks from natural hazards and those from a terrorist attack. Tables 2.2 and 2.3 particularize th ese distinctions to apply to anthrax, as in the hypothetical scenario used for this report, and smallpox.

Risk of occurrence Reasonably well defined: Well-developed models exist for estimating risks based on historical data and expert estimates. Considerable ambiguity: Terrorists can purposefully adapt their strategies depending on their knowledge of a target's vulnerabilities.

As a natural disease, smallpox is not catastrophic to U.S. interests, although it could have significant mortality and economic consequences . No historical data: There is no prior experience with smallpox dispersed as a modern, large-scale attack. Fatalities could be in the hundreds or perhaps even low thousands (but since the vaccine can be usefully administered up to 7 days after exposure, early detection of an attack would be invaluable). Risk of occurrence No risk: Essentially zero risk of occurrence exists. Some uncertainty: The creation or acquisition of smallpox is well within the technical reach of a determined and well-resourced terrorist, but it is not clear that such a terrorist would pursue smallpox over a radiological device or investment in conventional weapons. Geographic risk Limited risk: There is almost zero risk of occurrence, except possibly in Eritrea. Containment difficult: A successful aerosol dispersion would require sophisticated technology and could fail owing to malfunction, weather conditions, or other factors. However, if an attack was carefully planned, containing the disease to the area of attack would be very difficult. Information All in public domain: Essentially all information on naturally occurring smallpox is in the public domain. Asymmetry of information: If some group has created a weaponized version of smallpox, that would be a closely held secret. Similarly, technology for dispersion would be secret. If counterintelligence discovered that a terrorist group was preparing a smallpox attack, the decision on how to use that 2-13 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Event type Natural event: Historically, most natural outbreaks were not extreme and \"burned out\" within a few months (much more rapidly in developed regions). Event unlikely: The very public preparation in the United States against the possibility of a smallpox attack has probably changed the climate for terrorist thinking. Given that this nation has now stockpiled significant quantities of vaccine, and given that smallpox is slow to progress and easy to diagnose, it seems unlikely that a rational terrorist would choose this attack over comparably difficult but more consequential alternatives. Preparedness and prevention Smallpox eradicated: The eradication of natural smallpox was a great public health success. Vaccination possible: Swift vaccination could protect all of the U.S. population except those affected in the first wave of an attack. 2-14 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The methodology, an instance of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), is described in Bioterrorism Risk Assessment, a report from the DHS Biological Threat Characterization Center of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (DHS, 2006). DHS credits seminal work on nuclear reactor safety as the basis for its risk assessment, citing \"NUREG-1150\" (case studies of probabilistic risk assessment) (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1991) and \"NUREG-1489\" (a tutorial on probabilistic risk assessment) (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1994) as basic re ferences. The committee also found valuable an earlier foundation work, \"NUREG 75/014\" (U .S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1975), widely known as the Rasmussen Report, which estab lishes the theoretical and policy foundations on which the 1991 and 1994 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports a nd later applications depend. The principal product of the BTRA of 2006 was a ranking of the risk posed by bioagent use based on calculated probabilities of expected fatalities. DHS chose to assess threat by ranking bioagents because government stakeholders had advised DHS that they \"expected the primary assessments to be in the form of risk-p rioritized groups of biological threat agents\" (DHS, 2006, Ch. 1). Although a terrorist's choice of agent is just one step in a sequence of events leading to a potential attack, for practical purposes the BTRA of 2006 evaluates each agent separately. A probability is computed for each sc enario involving that ag ent. Risk is then calculated as the product of these probabilities and the associated consequences. The overall risk associated with each agent is the integrated risk distribution over all possible scenarios involving that agent. The product of the analysis by the BTRA of 2006 is displayed in a figure (such as Figure 3.2) that shows, for each agent, a normalization (whose normalization constant is not defined) of three estimated parameters of the distribution of consequences of agent attack in terms of expected fatalities: 1 The 5th percentile, The expected value (or mean), and The 95th percentile. 1 The analyses presented in DHS ( 2006) are based entirely on estimat ed fatalities. However, DHS has conducted assessments based on illnesses and direct economic consequences as well. 3-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE For each agent, the estimate of the 5th percentile and of the 95th percentile of expected fatalities is displayed as a tick mark on a vertical line on a logarithmic ordinate scale of (normalized) consequences. The mean of expected fatalities is displayed as a dot. A typical display shows 28 parallel vertical lines, one for each agent. The specific numbers and rankings of agents by risk are functions of the assumptions underlying each of the many steps in the model's execution. Before results are presented in DHS (2006), a normalizing constant is computed by multiplying, for each agent, the conditional e xpected consequence of the agent's use by the probability of its use, and then summing over all th e agents. All statistics are divided by this constant to force the normalized means to sum to 1. This critical normalization constant is not displayed in the DHS (2006) report, so no absolute (versus relative) consequence can be recovered from the analysis presented there. Therefore, the normalization method cannot be verified by the committee. The normalization step is a curious one, in that it damages the results irreparably for purposes of decision making about, for instance, risk management. The committee conjectures that the normalization may reflect a well-intentioned but nonetheless an unfortunate effort to mitigate the stark nature of the estimated risks reported. DHS (2006) also contains some qualitative an alysis distinguishing between most-, less-, and least-\"worrisome\" bioagents. As for the quantitative analyses, c onsequences include only immediate numbers of expected fatalities. Future assessments have been promised with estimated casualties and indirect economic conse quences. The committee does not know whether such estimates will also be normalized, but it hopes not. DETAILS OF THE MODEL USED TO PRODUCE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S BTRA OF 2006 The process that produced the estimates in th e BTRA of 2006 consists of two loosely coupled analyses: (1) a PRA event-tree evaluation and (2) a consequence analysis (Figure 3.3). DHS has conducted \"Material Threat Assessments\" for single bioagents. \"These are plausible, high consequence scenarios used to estimate the potential number of exposed individuals, their exposure levels, contaminated areas, and other collateral effects.\" 2 Presumably, the results of these assessments were used to inform the BTRA of 2006, but the committee was not briefed on them. DHS (2006) does not contain mathematical definitions of all of the parameters and variables used in the BTRA and does not present a complete mathematical model. (A complete mathematical model would show how each input is used to produce each output.) In response to the committee's request for that information, DHS has developed a lexicon and a mathematical model. Informed by discussions with DHS anal ysts, the committee's understanding of the details of the BTRA of 2006 is presented in this chapter using its own technical lexicon (Appendix A), which cross-references the terms used by the comm ittee and those used in the DHS lexicon, when relevant. Readers interested more in the policy implications and potential uses of BTRA than in the technical details might want to skim the text of this chapter and read the four recommendations interspersed in the text below.

Each random-event branching node is followed by the possible random-variable realizations, called outcomes, or arcs, with each arc leading from the branching, predecessor node, to the next, successor-event node (and it can be said without ambiguity that the predecessor event selects this outcome, or, equivalently, selects the successor event) . With the exception of the first event, or root node, each event is connected by exactly on e outcome of a preceding event. A node with no successor event is called a final event, or leaf. From each event, it is possible to trace a unique path back through alternating predecessor outcomes a nd events to the root event. The path from the root to a particular leaf is called a scenar io. Each successive random event in a scenario path has a probability depending on all preceding outcomes in the path, and the probability of this scenario is the joint probability of the intersection of the outcomes on the path and is the product of these outcome probabilities. A natural way to co nstruct an event tree is to place events in the chronological order in which they occur, if this order is known (e.g., Pat\u00e9-Cornell, 1984). This committee's concise mathematical defin ition of the BTRA event tree and associated computations are given in Appendix B. Figure 3.3 shows some of the events in the BTRA tree. The \"Frequency of Initiation\" box at the extreme left consists of only one event\u2014the beginning of a terrorist attack, which includes the terrorist's choice of frequency of attack, a random variable with four possible outcomes. Each frequency selected leads to a ne w event in the \"Target Selection\" box, as shown in Figure 3.3, and each of these four events is a random variable with eight possible outcomes, leading to a total of 32 events in the \"Bioagent Selection\" box. Each of these events is a random variable with 28 possible outcomes, depending on which of the 28 agents is used. Although not shown in Figure 3.3, there is a sequence of 17 such boxes in the BTRA event tree, enumerated and named in Figure 3.4, with each box corresponding to a different stage in the chronology of a terrorist attack. A complete listing of all the possible outcomes for these random variables is given in the BTRA documentation but not in this report of the committee. In the remainder of this chapter, the committee uses th e term \"stage\" to mean all of th e possible events at each step. As can be inferred from the names given to the stages (see Figure 3.4), each corresponds either to a terrorist decision (e.g., Bioagent Selection), or to a U.S. decision (e.g., Mitigation). It is a fundamental property of the BTRA of 2006 that every event, whether representing a terrorist decision or a U.S. decision, has a probab ility of occurrence associated with it. As indicated above, Figure 3.4 displays the succession of 17 stages of the BTRA event tree. The BTRA represents epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge) by using a distribution of event probabilities from which a particular probability is sampled; that is, adopting the convention that from a node, each branching outcome \"selects\" a successor event, each such event leading to an outcome has a probability distribution over its probability of selection. For events in all but the first stage, each event leading to an outcome is chosen with a probability drawn from a distribution of probabilities for that outcome. The selection of outcomes from the only event in the first stage, \"Frequency of Initiation by Terrorist Group,\" is the rate at which terrorists are anticipated to ma ke attempts during a time horizon over which this rate applies; each such rate and time horizon has an associated probability. 3 An 18th stage has been added to Figur e 3.4 by the committee to represent the \"Consequences\" random variable. If the probabilit y of an outcome depends on outcomes from an event in a preceding stage, the prior stage number is shown in column 3. The number of possible outcomes for each event in a stage is shown in column 4. The maximum cumulative number of paths into each stage is shown in column 5. Because outcome probabilities are conditional upon some preceding outcomes, column 6 shows the maximum number of such dependencies\u2014this 3 Given that the number of opportunities for such attempts is huge and the probability that any particular opportunity will be pursue d is tiny, this is a Poisson rate. 3-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE helps convey the complexity and sheer number of probabilities that must be reckoned for the BTRA. In practice in the BTRA, the event tree is not actually evaluated as shown in Figure 3.4; each of the 28 agents (outcomes of events in Stage 3) is analyzed in isolation, yielding 28 sets of, in theory, as many as 350 million paths based on as few as 5,448 distinct probabilities for each agent. Although the maximum number of possibl e scenario paths is large (i.e., exponential in problem size), agent-by-agent, the event tree has many paths terminated early with no attack (e.g., by failure to manufacture an agent, by successful in terdiction, and so on), while others continue to completion. Among the 28 event trees, each corresp onding to the selection of a different agent, DHS (2006) reports one agent with only 1,184 scenario s, and another, the largest agent tree, with 192,928 scenarios. The individual agent results are merged a posteriori into a distribution using probabilities for the selection of each agent and target. With the exception of this separation of event trees by agent, BTRA treats each of these successive even ts in ascending order of the stage in which it occurs. For example, Figure 3.5 shows the outcomes for each event in Stage 2. After the frequency of attack has been chosen, the terrori st can choose among eight types of target to pursue. The BTRA represents the selection of each such outcome as an arc chosen randomly, with a selection probability that may depend on out comes of events in prior stages. In this example, the outcome probabilities from events in Stage 2 may depend on the outcomes chosen for prior events in Stage 1. The BTRA analyzes each of the 28 agents as follows: 1. The selection probability of the agent under st udy is set to 1 for each event in Stage 3. All other probabilities for events in Stage 3 are set to 0. (Stage 3 consists of agent- selection events; there are 32 events that r esult in agent-selection outcomes.) It is important to note that no attack using multiple agents is considered. 2.The tree for this agent is Monte Carlo genera ted, with outcome probability distributions conditioned upon outcomes from events in St ages 1 and 2 as well as on the knowledge of which agent is being modeled. BTRA represents epistemic uncertainty by using a distribution of outcome probabilities from which a particular probability is sampled. These epistemic probability distributions over outcome probabilities are elicited from subject-matter experts for each individual possible outcome, although there are thousands of such conditional outcomes. 3. A set of outcome probabilities is gene rated, and the resulting probabilistic risk assessment event tree is solved. That is , each leaf (terminal event) with nonzero probability is associated with a conseque nce distribution, from which the leaf- probability-weighted consequence distributions are sampled to produce a sample unconditional consequence distribution. The BTRA does this 500 times, thus generating a random sample of 500 PRA trees and associat ed consequence distributions. For each of these trees, the resulting 5th and 95th percentiles and the average of the consequences are computed. This sampling of multiple realizations from the same starting conditions represents aleatory uncertainty \u2014the influence of pure randomness. 4. The outcome of each random-sample scenar io is captured by the distribution of expected consequences; the expectation is over purely aleatory randomness. 5. The 28 agent statistics are merged, after the fact, using the agent-selection probabilities. The committee's hypothet ical scenario, introduced in Chapter 1, may be approximately described by a number of possible sequences of outco mes in the BTRA event tree.

Target sel ection (Figure 3.5) would be a \"Large Outdoor Space.\" That this space is hypothetically filled with commuters conditions the consequences, but it is not clear where these commuters would app ear in the BTRA; they are evidently rolled up along with a host of other considerations for s ubject-matter experts to consider when rendering opinions about consequences. Event by event, outcomes that support this scenario can be identified, although many nuances (e.g., steps to concentrate, process, and introduce additives to \"weaponize\" the anthrax spores for better dispersal) may be hard to unambiguously identify (i.e., the attackers have either weaponized a lot of an thrax, or they have produced an even larger quantity of crude anthrax to use). Regardless, the base mission of the BTRA is to automatically generate hosts of scenarios, including ones that resemble the committee's hypothetical scenario, and rank them in terms of expected risk (i.e., fatalities). Three short papers (DHS, 2007a, b, c) presen ted to the committee give details on and contain versions of Figure 3.6. In this tree, th e starting event is at the extreme left, followed by two stages of events representing the terrorist choice of agent and then choice of target. A complete scenario in this reduced example is ch aracterized by a left-to-right scenario path from starting event to final event and is documented by the successive outcomes, or arcs, in this scenario path. For instance, a path with arcs labeled \"P A1, 1-P T1\" leads to scenario s2 with consequence distribution , where x represents fatalities. The notation \"P A1\" represents, at once, the selection of Agent 1 and its probabilit y of selection. Although not shown in Figure 3.6, each successive probability could depend on ever ything that precedes it in its scenario path. So, in example scenario path \"P A1, 1-P T1,\" the probability P T1 can depend on the prior choice of event P A1. 2(| )cx s As noted above, a fundamental property of the event trees used in the BTRA is that every decision by a bioattacker (e.g., choice of an agent) or by a defender (e.g., choice of a countermeasure) is considered to be an uncerta in event\u2014hence associated with an outcome selection probability. In fact, the BTRA uses pure probability trees, and no decision tree at all. A statement in a presentation to the committee: \"An ev ent tree (decision tree) is a visual tool . . .\"4 indicates confusion on this point. The dis tinction between event and decision trees is fundamental, not semantic. In event trees, all outcomes are modeled as random events determined by some probability distribution; deci sion trees allow the possibility that outcomes are chosen by the defender or attacker to achie ve some objective. Decision trees as tools for modeling terrorist threats are discussed in Chapter 7. In step 3 above, for each outcome from each event, the probability of selection has been elicited as the consensus of a group of subject-matter experts in the form of an expected probability, and reportedly some additional guidance (such as the 5th and 95th percentile of this outcome probability) that has been transformed by some unspecified means into a variance for each probability. Each of these outcome selection probability solicitations is converted into a marginal probability density of probabilities for selecting the particular outcome. Documentation indicates that most subject-matter experts for the BTRA of 2006 were experts from Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio, but that s ubsequent work will draw from a much wider pool of experience. Some observations by the committee about the details in these steps follow. In step 2 above, the Monte Carlo simulation generates probabilities for each event one outcome (arc) at a time in some fixed sequence of outcomes. For each successive outcome, a marginal probability 4 Richard S. Denning, Battelle Memorial Institu te, \"DHS 2006 Bioterrorism Risk Assessment Methodology,\" presentation to the committee, August 28, 2006, Slide 8. 3-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE distribution over the probability for selecting this outcome is used. The probability distribution for each successive outcome is conditioned on the probabilities already realized for this event. Because the outcome probabilities must sum to 1, the marginal distributions for each should be constrained to have their expectations sum to 1. Although the original marginal distributions are, for instance, beta densities, the successive conditioning by sampled outcomes means that outcomes are really sampled from some multivariate density for which the marginals are not beta, and in fact are not characterized at all in closed form, and not mentioned at all in DHS (2006). The DHS procedure selects the last outcome proba bility so that the sum of outcome probabilities emanating from this event is 1 (i.e., the last marginal probability distribution is not used at all). However, the outcome probabilities should have a joint distribution that captures their dependencies (the most important being that they sum to 1). Even if the present method were not technically superfluous (as is s hown below), subject-matter experts typically cannot assess such high-dimensional distributions (Moskowitz and Sarin, 1983). In step 3, the 500 sets of outcome probab ilities for each agent event tree are obtained using a Latin Hypercube Sampling design (Stein, 1987), a sampling technique applied in earlier years to probabilistic risk analysis of nuclear safety. However, the committee notes that this sampling design produces unbiased estimates of the mean and quantiles with asymptotic sample size. Further, see Stein (1987, p. 144, Equation (3) and Section 5) and McKay et al. (1979, Section 8.3). Moreover, the variance may be decreased or increased by this design, depending on the covariance structure of the distributions samp led. Note that the proofs of unbiasedness for quantiles are for independent random variables. There is no evidence that the efficacy of the particular BTRA sample design has been established. The BTRA of 2006 Does Not Use Event Trees for Consequence Analysis Consequence models characterize the probab ility distribution of consequences for each scenario. The BTRA employs a mass-release model that assesses the production of each bioagent, beginning with time to grow and produce, preprocess and concentrate, dry, store and transport, and dispense. The net result is a biological agent dose that is input to a consequence model to assess casualties. One equation from the m odel is produced here to give a flavor of the computations. MR = MT x QF 1 x QF 2 x QF 3 x QF 4 x QF 5 where MR is bioagent mass release, MT is target mass, and QF i are factors to explain production, processing, storage, and so on and are random variables conditioned on the scenario whose consequences are being evaluated. The complete model computes, for an attack with a given agent on a given target, how much agent has been used, how efficiently it has been dispersed (a nd, for an infectious agent, how far it spreads in the target population), and the potential effects of mitigation efforts. For the BTRA of 2006, all of these factors were assigne d values by eliciting opini ons of subject-matter experts in the form of subjective discrete probability distributions of likely outcomes, and by some application of information on the spread of infectious agent, atmospheric dispersion, and so on. The BTRA consequence analysis is qualitativ ely different from its event-tree analysis. Subject-matter expert opinions are developed much like case studies, and there is less clear dependence on specific events leading to each con sequence. Thus, each consequence distribution should be viewed as being dependent on every event leading to its outcome. However, an 3-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE examination of the underlying analysis in the DHS (2006) report suggests that there is really only a single consequence distribution for each scenario: one that depends not on the complete scenario but only on a subset of parameter va lues. (Indeed, \"Consequence uncertainty was omitted due to the overwhelming processing requirements.\"5) A Monte Carlo simulation of 1,000 samples was used to estimate each conse quence distribution in the BTRA of 2006. committee has no details about how this was accomplished. The THE EVENT TREE CAN BE IMPROVED The Approach to Determining the Probabilit ies of Terrorist Decisions Is Incomplete The BTRA of 2006 uses probabilities to represent adversarial decisions. These are conditional probabilities, but the condi tioning is retrospective, rather than prospective. Consider that if the consequence model for a bioagent is completely changed to reflect some new discovery about the efficacy of the bioagent, this would ha ve no influence at all on the BTRA probabilities; neither the terrorist nor the United States would change probabilities in response. When dealing with an intelligent, goal-orie nted, and resourceful adversary, not with a force such as nature that randomly determines whether unwanted events occur, this committee believes that the use of probabilities to represent bioterrorism decisions must be tempered by a thorough understanding of how these probabilities ha ve been assessed (whether by means of formal game-theoretical models , elicitation of subject-matter experts, of other means). For decision problems as complex as those motivating BTRA, the assessment of the probabilities that adversaries will choose courses of action should be the outputs of analysis, not required input parameters. The BTRA has reversed this preferred approach by requiring that subject-matter experts predict, a priori, how adversaries will be have. For this approach to make sense, the subject-matter experts must grasp nuances of alternatives and outcomes and render opinions founded on an analysis of the entire decision process, which would be very difficult for a process this complex. The committee saw no evidence that this level of analysis was used. Moreover, the static probabilities used are not appropriate when terrorists can observe and react dynamically to any earlier decisions made by the United States. Recommendation: To assess the probabilities of terrorist decisions, DHS should use elicitation techniques and decision-oriented mo dels that explicitly recognize terrorists as intelligent adversaries who observe U.S. defensiv e preparations and seek to maximize the achievement of their own objectives. It should be noted that this recommendation does not require the prediction of terrorist actions, a difficult task at best. Its intent is to evaluate risk on the basis of hypothetical terrorist attacks against U.S. defenses that have been designed to thwart terrorist goals. Thus, its implementation will produce a conservative estimate of risk. In Chapter 7, the committee offers alternate modeling techniques to accomplish this more complex assessment. The Mathematics Used by the BTRA in Modeling Multiple Attacks Has Errors 5 Traci Hale, Battelle Memorial Institute, \"2008 DHS Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: Planned Improvements,\" presented to this committee on February 10, 2007, Washington, D.C. 3-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE Given a successful attack, the PRA tree's Stage 16, Potential for Multiple Attacks6 (see Figure 3.4) presents an opportunity for the terrorist to mount more such attacks. The probability for succeeding at each additional attack is given as '(implying that the attacks that are attempted first are no more likely to succeed than those postponed until the first attempts have failed), and the expected number of attacks before interdiction is given in the DHS (2006) report and presentation to the committee as 1 2(' ) 1(1 )f=++. This expectation is multiplied by the consequence distri bution for such attacks. During a site visit to Battelle in Columbus , Ohio, in October 2006, the committee pointed out that this equation must be in error (e.g., if '1=, the expected number of re-attacks should go to infinity, but 1( ' 1) 1.25f== ). Subsequent briefing materials. (Battelle Columbus Operation, 2007) featured a new expectation: 2 2(' ) 1(1 )f=+. This expectation is also wrong. Given one su ccessful attack, the total number of successful attacks before an interdiction with prob ability of success for each additional attack ' is 3 0'1( ') 1 [ | '] 1 ( ') ==+ =+ =+ = . Figure 3.7 shows these expressions as a function of . This has a significant influence on the expected consequences of multiple attacks. For '0 . 9= 10f= . For this numerical example, the two expectations respectively would underestimate and overestim ate consequences by an order of magnitude. If each repeated attack is independent, the distribution of total consequences across all attacks will presumably be additive. The distribution of this sum is characterized by a statistical convolution, not by mere multiplicatio n by the expected number of re-attacks. It is not very realistic to assume an infinite supply of potential attacks that all have equal probabilities of success. Judging from U.S. actions taken after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the committee believes that all of the probabilities ass essed in the event tree will change following any attack. 6 \"Multiple attacks\" refer to att acks in sequence. \"Simultaneous multiple attacks\" are considered by the BTRA to be a single attack. 3-8 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE Thus, the implicit, homogeneous steady-state Poisson process underlying the rate used for \"Frequency of Initiation by Terrorist Group\" will almost surely be rendered invalid by any detected attack, whether successful or not, and whether interdicted or not. Subsequent to any such event, the BTRA analysis would be rendere d inapplicable until a host of key parameters could be reestimated and the BTRA then repeated from scratch. The BTRA multiple-attack feature is an embellishment that has been incorrectly implemented both mathematically and statistically, and even if correctly implemented would be based on a questionable underlying model. The 2006 BTRA's Assessment of Outcome Probabilities Is Unnecessarily Complex Each node in the PRA tree offers two or mo re outcomes leading to successor events, each selected with an epistemic probability density th at is used to generate an aleatory outcome probability to be used to solve the event tree. Each of these outcome densities is typically a beta density function, formed somehow from averages elicited from subject-matter experts, whose means sum to 1. It is straightforward to show that, when given a distribution over outcome probabilities, the means of these distributions suffice to completely capture the unconditional distributions over any consequence . For example, suppose that i= probability that outcome i will occur, i = probability distribution over outcome X, given that outcome i occurs. If the values of i are known, then the unconditional distribution over consequences X is 1(|) ( )n ii ifxf == x. However, the epistemic approach considers i to be a random variable, and therefore a random vector. Letting be the (joint) probability distribution over the elements iof the random vector , the unconditioned distribution over consequences becomes i i i ii ifx fx d fx d fx d fx E ( ) == === = = . Therefore, even when using a general (and possibly highly dependent) joint distribution, all that is needed is the expectation ()iE of the epistemic distribution; the rest of the distribution is 3-9 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE irrelevant to determining the unconditional distribution of conse quences (and, in particular, its moments, percentiles, and so on). Because of this, the consequence distribution can be calculated without sampling from the outcome probability distributions. Appendix C provides a self-contained, simplified example of this point. For an event tree the size of the one used in the BTRA of 2006, this represents a significant computational simplification and would also significantly simplify the BTRA exposition; both of these results are desirable. What is lost in the simplification is the family of risk curves\u2014i.e., one curve for each possible outcome. However, no analysis in the BTRA of 2006 and no improvement in analysis recomme nded by the committee can make meaningful use of the information available in the family of risk curves, beyond that provided by their expectation. Further, given the planned impr ovements to the BTRA incorporating additional consequence measures and utilit y functions, the committee does not anticipate analyses that require the family of risk curves. If the conditional consequence distributions are given in parametric form, or in numerical lookup tables, calculation of the risk distribution can be done exactly, without resorting to estimating these distributions from the outputs of Monte Carlo simulations. This computation is easy and fast, and the result is the distribution \u2014not merely an estimate of its features. For these reasons, the committee's finding is th at the epistemic features of the BTRA probabilistic risk assessment are unnecessary and that they increase computation time and complicate exposition, analysis, and understanding of results. Recommendation: The event-tree probability elicitation should be simplified by assessing probabilities instead of probability distributions for the outcomes of each event. BTRA Results Should Not Be Normalized by an Unspecified Constant The absence of a normalization constant in DHS documentation and presentation irretrievably obscures those BTRA results wh ere normalization is employed, rendering those results essentially useless for further analyses, especially for risk management. As an illustrative example, suppose that the United States discovers how to make a reliable biological agent alarm the size and cost of a smoke detector and how to connect such detectors to local area networks; educates the U.S. populace to shelter in place on alarm; implements effective, immediate cordoning and quarantine procedures; and thus attains an estimated threefold reduction in expected consequences from terrorist use of all biological agents. This improved capability of detection and response would not change a single normalized result presented in the BTRA of 2006. The committee wonders how senior leadership has interpreted a normalized fatality scale (with no units) in the DHS (2006) report and presentation materials: the committee does not know why this normalization was applied, and esp ecially why its essential details are absent from all underlying documentation. The normalized results are classified, as would be the non- normalized results, and this one step\u2014normalization\u2014has made it impossible for anyone to reproduce any BTRA result or for anyone to use independent means to assess the accuracy of any BTRA result. Most important, risk management deals with risk, not normalized risk. The BTRA needs to report risk, not normalized risk. 3-10 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE Recommendation: Normalization of BTRA risk assessment results obscures information that is essential for risk-informed decision making. BTRA results should not be normalized. The BTRA Event Tree Can Be Simplified The BTRA is a risk assessment. (The committee argues in Chapter 4 that mere risk assessment is inadequate, but for purposes of this chapter the committee adopts the purely probabilistic BTRA view with the objective of improving the exposition of the methodology used.) The committee thinks that the entire BTRA analysis can be envisioned, implemented, carried out, and documented more simply and clearly as a single, unified probabilistic risk analysis with a single PRA tree that incl udes conditional consequence distributions. The fixed sequence of 17 stages (or 18, including the committee's additional stage) drives the BTRA. The analysis has been frustrated by th e sheer size of the PRA tree for all biological threat agents, and as a practical matter, the BTRA separates the 28 agents and solves each PRA tree in isolation. But given that selection of agen t is the third stage in the fixed hierarchy of the BTRA event sequence, and that this selection de pends on both prior stages, this approach has complicated the analysis and exposition of results . Fixed adherence to the 17 sequential stages in the BTRA event tree leads to large PRA trees that have had to be separ ated by 28 individual agents. That the choice of agent is not a first-st age event, or even a second-stage one, but rather a third-stage event, causes some difficulty in recovering results after the fact. Recommendation: Two significant simplifications should be made to the BTRA of 2006 event tree: DHS should eliminate Stage 1, Frequency of Initiation [of an attack] by Terrorist Group, and Stage 16, Potential for Multiple Attacks; and DHS should seek opportunities to aggregate some stages of the tree to only those essential to calculate probabilities and consequences with realistic fidelity. The elimination of probability elicitation for terrorist decisions will greatly simplify the model. Additional simplifications are also possible. For instance, Stages 7 through 11 (successively: Location of Production and Processi ng, Mode of Agent Production, Preprocessing and Concentration, Drying and Processing, and Additives) appear to reflect a somewhat artificial taxonomy and permutation of decisions in a pro liferation effort. Similarly Stages 14 and 15 (Interdiction During Transport and Storage, and Inte rdiction During Attack) might be aggregated. It should be noted, however, that the level of de tail shown in Figure 3.4 may coordinate with the steps that the FBI and the National Counterterrori sm Center consider in evaluating an attack, because in many cases these steps can be associated with specific technical capabilities and as a result can be tied to intelligence assessments of what capabilities and activities have occurred. The committee has received no briefings on this aspect of the evaluation of the bioterrorism threat. ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S BTRA OF 2006 3-11 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE Reporting Results According to DHS (2006), given the use of a particular agent, the probability of a typical scenario on the BTRA event tree may be on the order of 10-10. A typical end-state consequence may be on the order of tens of thousands of fa talities or more. The product of this probability and consequence represents a particular scenario's contribution to the total expected consequence associated with the use of that agent. The sum of these repr esents that agent's \"relative importance,\" given that it is selected for use. The result of multiplying these infinitesimal probabilities by large numbers of casualties yields risk, which is represented with the 5th percentile, mean, and 95th percentile of this risk, normalized by the total expected risk of all agents. DHS need not focus exclusively on using the rank of relative (expected) risk (and presents only 3 statistics, i.e., 5th percentile, m ean, and 95th percentile, per agent) as the final result of all this analysis. With a pure event tr ee, more information and insight can be obtained by a more thorough analysis. It would be easy to illustrate on the same plot (similar to Figure 3.2, with a probability above or below each vertical bar representing an agent) that (for the BTRA of 2006), for example, the agent selection probability estimated by one subject-matter expert was greater than 40 percent, by another almost 30 percent, by a third greater than 10 percent, by a handful of others about 5 percent, with the rest much smaller. Th at is, one of the \"most likely\" three agents was selected with 80 percent probability. The comm ittee believes that presenting the prior probability of agent selection\u2014a key subject-matter expert opi nion\u2014on the same plot with the level of risk associated with the use of each particular agent would help determine whether these estimates by subject-matter experts are credible and would help interpret whether agent-selection probability is a significant factor leading to agent risk. This is extremely valuable information that is not easy for the reader to recover from analyses presented in DHS (2006) (and cannot be recovered at all from the Executive Summary of DHS [2006]). Similarly, it would be easy to show the number of scenarios (i.e., successful attack paths) associated with each of the 28 agents. This and other simple gauges would lend insight into the robustness of each PRA tree with respect to either U.S. or terrorist decision represented in the tree. \"Prioritization\" with a strict ranking by specific agent may not be the best way to present results. For instance, if one simple, cheap action can remediate the consequences of a number of infectious agents, none of which appears in the top tier of qualitatively identified \"worst\" ones, the rank-ordering would not reveal this. Th e BTRA of 2006 does not anticipate prescriptive covering of multiple-agent risks by a single action or set of actions. In subsequent chapters the committee recommends the pursuit of a resource-cons trained optimization of DHS investments to maximize total risk mitigation, and suggests some examples in Chapter 7. Tailored Risk Assessments The BTRA of 2006 conducts a series of \"ta ilored\" risk assessments that address, in particular: High-consequence (i.e., high-fatality) events . Because these events are of keen concern to decision makers, consequence distributions are truncated below a threshold number of fatalities, and the conditioned risk rankings are presented. Prioritization of agents for purposes of research . This analysis seeks to identify particular discoveries that might have a large influence on risk. 3-12 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE Prioritization of agents for purposes of development of medical countermeasures . This analysis seeks to identify improvements in medical countermeasures that could impact expected fatalities. \"The metric for asses sing the potential impact of countermeasure development research is based on two crite ria: baseline fatality risk and current countermeasure efficacy. This prioritization does not consider the current state of research on each agent, i.e. how close current countermeasure research is to a countermeasure breakthrough on individual agents\" (DHS, 2006, Ch. 3, p. 11). Analysis of Sensitivity and Risk The BTRA of 2006 offers an additional set of results that investigate (1) how much key assumptions contribute to the results of the risk analysis and (2) how much alternative risk mitigation strategies might reduce overall risk. Sets of runs systematically vary the epistemic outcome probabilities. Key assumptions are examined by varying parameters for agent selection and acquisition, production, and utilization; risk mitigations are examined by varying parameters related to interdiction and medical mitigati on. In Chapter 4, th e committee discusses the importance of sensitivity analysis and the difficu lty of accomplishing sensitivity analysis with BTRA. Critical Knowledge Gaps and Biodefense Vulnerabilities Critical knowledge gaps provide the grea test opportunities for the reduction of uncertainty in risk analysis, while critical biode fense vulnerabilities provide the greatest areas for the reduction of risk. The BTRA of 2006 identifies three areas of critical knowledge gaps: (1) intelligence and terrorist organization preferenc es, (2) event detection and response, and (3) biological threat agent properties. The possi bility of using these threat agent properties to aggregate current and potential biological agents is discussed in Chapter 5. Two areas of critical biodefense vulnerabilities are examined: (1) threat-related vulnerabilities and (2) consequence- and/or m itigation-related vulnerabilities (Figure 3.8). Planned Improvement for the BTRA of 2008 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18: Medical Countermeasures Against Weapons of Mass Destruction (The White House, 2007) states: The Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop a strategic, integrated all-CBRN risk assessment that integrates the findings of the intelligence and law enforcement communities with input from the scientific, medical, and public health communities. Not later than June 1, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, which shall summarize the key findings of this assessment, and shall update those findings when appropriate, but not less frequently than every 2 years. With this guidance, the following BTRA activity was undertaken in 2007 to support the future DHS report on the BTRA of 2008. The co mmittee offers a few comments, not anticipated in its charge, shown in italics. 3-13 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CHANGE The consequence models will employ epistemic sampling, and there will be more than 10 consequence bins in the discrete consequence distributions. A library of consequence models will incl ude a Leontief model of indirect economic consequences, a water contamination model, agricultural disease models, a differential equation model of the spread of infection and the effects of medical countermeasures, atmospheric dispersion forecasts, air circulati on models within buildi ngs, and others. The specific means by which outputs from these mode ls will be converted into consequence distributions has not been presented to the committee. Chapter 4 of the present report cautions against including excessive detail in these models where there are insufficient supporting data. DHS plans to develop its own model of food supply contamination in cooperation with various other agencies and BTSafety, LLC, 7 and anticipates cooperating with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use EPA's existing models of waterborne contamination (EPA, 2007). DHS is developing a detailed susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model for the spread of infectious agents, using STELLA,8 to simulate disease transmission and medical mitigation measures through the soluti on of systems of differential equations. In Chapter 6, the committee cautions that there may be insufficient scientific knowledge to verify or validate these models. In addition to indoor aerosol dispersion m odels, DHS is particularly interested in modeling an agent release and spread in a subway system. DHS plans to cooperate with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (2006) and the National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease (FAZD) at Texas A&M University.9 BTRA plans to incorporate more agents, including anti-agricultural, engineered, and emerging agents. Although the committee agrees that some a dditional human-threatening agents and agricultural agents may warrant a ttention, the committee recommends less detail in future BTRA analyses, rather than more. Chapter 5 suggest s aggregate categorization of agents. Such simplification would not materially damage mode l credibility or fidelity, given the enormous volume of assumptions and estimates required to instantiate any given event tree. Simplification would yield more insights, accessible results, faster computation, and thus better responsiveness to requests for information, as addressed in Chap ter 4. Insightful analysis explaining the \"why\" of results is much more important than add itional detail cluttering the \"what\" of results.

High-priority, Category A agents include organisms that pose a risk to national security because they can be easily disse minated or transmitted from person to person, they result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impacts, they might cause social disruption, and they require sp ecial action for public health preparedness. Category B, the second-highest priority, includes agents that are moderately easy to disseminate, that result in moderate morbidity rates and lo w mortality rates, and that require specific enhancements of CDC's diagnostic capacity an d enhanced disease surveillance.

Reducing uncertainty in risk analysis results has no direct impact on risk reduction; only the implementation of effective risk management strategies can reduce risk. \u2014Department of Homeland, Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment , 2006 RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES TIMELY, ACCURATE INFORMATION Those who, for reasons enumerated in previ ous chapters, have need of information from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rega rding the risk of terrorist acts need that information to be accurate, timely, and valid. In 2002, the General Accounting Office (now Government Accountability Office) described the need to acquire and use the following information about the risk of terrorist acts in order to achieve homeland security goals and objectives: (1) Who will do what and for what reas on? (2) How (in what form), where, and when will they do it? and (3) What will they use in order to do it? (GAO, 2002). Additionally, for bioterrorism, stakeholders and decision makers need answers to several types of questions (Danzig, 2003; Fischhoff et al., 2006; Whitworth, 2006): What is the probability of a particular biological terrorist threat and how imminent is an event? What would the consequences of the event be, characterized in terms of when, where, and in what populations? Can real-time detection be achie ved to determine if an event has already occurred, if it is part of a larger plan, or if it is a false al arm (perhaps intentionally generated by terrorist actions)? How many ill and/or affected people would be expected for attacks by different agents? How fast would different infectious agents in a bioterrorist attack spread? How fast would people die from different agents? How sick would survivors be? What are the most effective ways to manage that risk? How effective and feasible are different strategies for the prevention, containment, and reduction of consequences of a bioterrorism event? Would public health me asures be able to limit the spread of the infection to a small proportion of the total population? What impact would the availability and delivery of effective interven tions have on potential consequences? How much lead time (i.e., response time) is need ed to implement effective interventions? How much lead time will surveillance provide? What assets should be pre-positioned where and when to reduce and or manage the risk? Are transportation and communication resources sufficient to handle the surge in usage? How many and what type of staff would be needed to prevent, respond to, contain, or manage the consequences of a bioterrorist attack? How should clinics be designed for optimal provision of services in a crisis (e.g., mass vaccination, drug dispensing, patient triage, flow, and care) to effectively minimize the consequences of a biological terrorism attack? 4-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION These questions lead to further questions. For example, what specific interventions would be needed (i.e., vaccination for smallpox versus antibiotics for anthrax)? How fast should they be delivered? What staff and supplies will need pre-positioning? (Cooper, 2006). In reviews of unsuccessful past attempts to pr event, prepare for, or respond efficiently to terrorist attacks, the inability to put the right in formation into the hands of key decision makers at the right time and in an understandable format has been identified as a major factor in those failures. Failure can result in increased suffering and fatalities through setting the wrong priorities and policies, in the underfunding of important programs, and in poorly conceived plans (Aaby et al., 2006). Several barriers to the effec tive use of information in decision making for the prevention of, preparedness for, and response to bi oterrorism have been identified (Ware et al., 2002): There are many stakeholders with vary ing degrees of authority for making and implementing decisions (e.g., the responsibilities for domestic bioterrorist attacks in the United States may involve more than 100 different government organizations). Authorities, roles, responsibilities, tasks, and indicators of success frequently are unclear and poorly understood or coordinated. High volumes of different types of data and information (e.g., subjective judgments, objective observations, historical data, anal ytical data, probabilistic data, modeling, simulation results) from disparate sources are presented in nonstandard and often poorly understood formats, flooding the system as crises are unfolding. Significant organizational friction frequently exists among the producers, owners, stakeholders, and consumers of information. Critical information is frequently owned or held by public and/or private organizations, accompanied by a general reluctance to share information across these sectors. The producers and owners of important inform ation often compartmentalize it in order to protect security or to protect sources, at the expense of the timely and integrated sharing of data and interpretation of information. Decision makers often have widely varyi ng objectives and frequently little understanding of the medical and scientific background needed to inform their decisions. THE BIOLOGICAL THREAT RISK A SSESSMENT SHOULD SUPPORT RISK MANAGEMENT The GAO (2002) report identified risk assessment as an important tool and source of information for strategic decision making for the prevention of bioterrorism, risk reduction, preparedness, and response to bioterrorism. As described in Chapter 3 of this report, the DHS Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) of 2006 is one of the first terrori sm risk assessment efforts to integrate information from a variety of sources to meet information needs. Further, the BTRA of 2006 presents sensitivity analyses that permit an examination of the impact of different measures that could be taken to mitigate identified consequences of interest (i.e., morbidity and mortality). However, as noted in Bioterrorism Risk Assessment , the DHS 2006 report that describes the BTRA methodology, with finite resources for biodefense, the United States must decide how to invest optimally to best mitigate bioterrorism risk. As that report points out, risk assessment alone has no direct impact on ri sk reduction; \"only the implementation of effective risk manageme nt strategies can reduce risk\" (DHS, 2006). 4-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Recommendation: Subsequent revision of the BTRA should increase emphasis on risk management. An increased focus on risk management will allow the BTRA to better support the risk-informed decisions that ho meland security stakeholders are required to make. The BTRA provides information to many stakeholders. DHS identifies the primary customers for information from the BTRA as follows:1 White House Homeland Security Council: relative risks and overall vulnerabilities; Department of Health and Human Services: medical countermeasures needs; Department of Homeland Security/Infrastructure Protection: relative risks of different attack scenarios; Department of Homeland Security/O ffice of Intelligence and Analysis: intelligence Homeland Security/Science and Technology: high-leverage scientific gaps; Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services: food security; Environmental Protection Agency: water security; and Department of Agriculture: agricultural agents and protection of the food supply. DHS stakeholders need risk analysis, includi ng risk management, for strategic planning, operations, and forensics. Further, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10): Biodefense for the 21st Century (The White House, 2004) states that the \"United States requires a continuous, formal process for conducting routine capab ilities assessments to guide prioritization of our on-going investments in biodefense-related research, developm ent, planning, and preparedness. These assessments will be tailored to meet the requirements in each of these areas. Second, the United States requires a periodic senior-level policy net assessment that evaluates progress in implementing this policy, identifies continuing gaps or vulnerabilities in our biodefen se posture, and makes recommendations for re- balancing and refining investments among the pillars of overall defense policy.\" To the extent that the BTRA of 2006 (with its subsequent improvements and revisions) is used for risk analysis, the committee believes that it is most applicable to supporting strategic decisions (those that address the setting of priorities and policies, the acquisition and pre-pos itioning and/or allocation of resources, and the development of infrastructure), but that it is not designed to support operations or forensics. In 1997, the Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management (1997 a, b; Omenn, 2003) agreed on a framework for environmental health risk management, which is applicable to managing risk s involved with bioterrorism. This framework has six stages: (1) formulate the problem in a broad public health context, (2) analyze the risks, (3) define the options to address the risks, (4) ma ke sound risk reduction decisions, (5) implement those actions, and (6) later evaluate th e effectiveness of the actions taken. The BTRA of 2006 focused on risk assessme nt, which addresses stages 1 and 2 above. However, DHS intends for its BTRA to be used by risk managers to \"test and evaluate risk mitigation strategies and their impact on bioterrorism risk\" (DHS, 2006, Ch. 1, p. 3). To broaden the focus to include risk management, stages 3 a nd 4 must be addressed. Stage 3, defining the 1 Rear Admiral Jay Cohen, Undersecretary of Science and Technology, Department of Homeland Security. 2007. \"DHS Science and Technology: Enabling Technology to Protect the Nation.\" Briefing to the committee, February 9, 2007, Washington, D.C. 4-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

So that the risk assessments provided by the BTRA can be effectively used, each potential countermeasure must be mapped to a set of parameters within the model. Stage 4, making sound risk reduc tion decisions, requires several related activities (Boardman et al., 2006): Estimation of risk reduction (in, for example, expected lives, life-years, or quality- adjusted life-years) obtained by allocating c ountermeasures, as discussed in Chapter 2 of this report; Optimization of the allocations , which identifies, for each given resource level or budget, the allocation of countermeasures that maximize s total risk reduction (or equivalently, for a given level of risk reduction, identifies the least-cost deployment of countermeasures for achieving a particular level of risk), as discussed in Chapter 7 of this report; Optimization of risk-benefit, which, given the optimal allocation of resources for different budget levels and a willingness-to-pay value for incremental risk reduction, identifies the best overall level of resources (and corresponding best allocation); and Valuation of options , or consideration of how the results from the previous stages are likely to change if additional countermeasur es are added, and using this information, making decisions about which additional c ountermeasures are most worth developing. TRANSPARENCY OF RISK ASSESSMENT IS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL RISK MANAGEMENT Transparency , as described by Oliver (2004), has been defined in different dictionaries as \"free from guile,\" \"candid or open,\" or \"forthright,\" and has been applied to business and organizations as \"allowing others to see the truth w ithout trying to hide or shade the meaning or altering the facts to put things in a better light.\" Oliver summarizes the current use of the word transparency as \"letting the truth be available for others to see if they so choose, or perhaps think to look, or have the time, means, and skills to look,\" and involving \"active disclosure.\" Whether and how often risk assessment models are used in risk management will depend on the level of confidence that stakeholders have in the model's methods, the validity of assumptions and data used to develop the model, and the level of understanding of the model's outputs. Lack of confidence can be caused by an insufficient understanding of or disagreement with relationships hypothesized among variables, the mathematical foundations of the model, and/or the validity of assumptions and values assigned to the model's parameters. All of these problems can be mitigated by improved transparency. RISK ASSESSMENT TRANSPARENCY IMPROVES CONFIDENCE In contemplating a complex problem involving uncertainty and risk, such as that involved with the threat of bioterrorism, mental arithmeti c can be riddled with error, while risk assessment models enable repeatable calculations, including sensitivity analyses, which explore the effects of uncertain parameters on important consequences. However, risk assessment models can fail to include important knowledge that is not readily quantified and/or understood, potentially compromising the validity of model outputs (Fischhoff et al., 2006). The accuracy of quantitative bioterrorism risk assessment models and the confidence placed in them depend on the validity of the assu mptions and the availability of sound data for 4-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION each of the biological agents being analyzed. A good model based on strong data, such as the one reported in Whitworth (2006) that describes th e difference between a response for an anthrax attack and that for a smallpox attack, can inform judgment about the effectiveness of different interventions (i.e., antibiotics for anthrax ve rsus vaccinations for smallpox) and the pre- positioning of staff and supplies to respond to an attack effectively. Conversely, the lack of data and/or uncerta inty in model parameters also can have important implications for the degree of confidence placed in the results of risk assessment models (Elderd et al., 2006). Unfortunately, data for key parameters of many biothreat agents of concern are not available. 2 If decision makers understand and tr ust the model, they will be more likely to use it with different assumptions and to test different response strategies (Fischhoff et al., 2006). While transparency is a major factor in est ablishing confidence and trust in the methods of and outputs from risk assessment models, modeling is an important step toward transparency as it requires that assumptions be made explicit. However, achieving transparency also requires the careful, explicit documentation of a model's ma thematical and structural foundations and of the sources of data used in the analysis\u2014a prerequisite for any scientific study\u2014for the purpose of facilitating external review. It is essential th at analysts document th e following: (1) how they construct risk assessment models, (2) what assumptions are made to characterize relationships among variables and parameters and the justifica tions for these, (3) the mathematical foundations of the analysis, (4) the source of values assigned to parameters for which there are no available data, and (5) the anticipated impact of uncerta inty for assumptions and parameters (Brisson and Edmunds, 2006). When working with classified or sensitive information, as is the case with bioterrorism prevention, preparedness, and response, there may be need to restrict the access to some information to certain groups of users to protect overall security. However, security or confidentiality concerns that can negatively affect the level of transparency reached in risk assessment modeling include the following: The compartmentalization of model developm ent, algorithms, and execution for security concerns and to protect in formation and data sources; Private-sector reluctance to share informa tion, commonly due to the protection of proprietary considerations, across sectors; and The need to balance civil liberties of citizens against the need to keep important classified and sensitive information out of the hands of terrorists. Given the importance of establishing the confidence of decision makers and stakeholders in risk assessment models, it is essential to strive for th e highest level of transparency possible while being sensitive to the need to restrict access to those with a need to know. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER WAYS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE 2 Marc Lipsitch, Harvard School of Public Health. \"Notes to the National Research Council Committee on Methodological Improvements to the DHS's Biological Agent Risk Analysis.\" Written communication to the committee, February 2007. 4-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION The confidence of decision makers in the information generated by a risk assessment model can be increased in several ways, and in creased confidence will heighten the likelihood that the information will be used. Decision makers can be engaged iteratively during model development; this is critical in order to incr ease their understanding of how the model is being constructed and to ensure that their informati on needs will be met. Complex systems can be simplified to more-readily-understood scenarios and coupled with the capability of conducting real-time sensitivity analyses. In addition, e xperts can conduct independent, periodic external reviews; doing so is critical in order to assure st akeholders that the appr opriate inputs and models are being used for risk assessment. If the risk assessment model and/or its assumptions are not accurate or appropriate, the results of a model and accompanying sensitivity analyses can give a false sense of security in the results, may lead to inappropriate policy decisions (Brisson and Edmunds, 2006), and ultimately will lead to a lack of confidence in the use of these models. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S BTRA OF 2006 WAS NOT TRANSPARENT As described in Chapter 3 of this report, the model used in the BTRA of 2006 is extremely complex, with 17 stages and thousands of parameters for each of 28 biothreat agents of concern (DHS, 2006). The considerable data that are lacking for many of the parameters and probabilities in the model may lead to questions a bout the validity of the model's output and to a lack of confidence and trust in the results. More over, the results of simulations are presented in graphs, charts, and tables that are also co mplex and difficult to interpret and use. The committee also finds the documentation for the model used in the BTRA of 2006 to be incomplete, uneven, and extremely difficult to understand. The BTRA of 2006 was done in a short time frame. However, deficiencies in doc umentation, in addition to missing data for key parameters, would make reproducing the results of the model impossible for independent scientific analysis. For example, although La tin Hypercube Sampling is mentioned in the description of the model many times as a key feature, no actual sample design is specified. Although antithetic sampling methods (e.g., matc hed samples or reused random number streams) evidently are employed, insufficient details are provided on how or where these numbers are generated, precluding a third party, with suitabl e software and expertise, from reproducing the results\u2014violating a basic principle of the scientific method. Finally, the current BTRA implementation must be run on a custom computer cluster in a DHS contractor facility taking many hours to compute; also the data are cumbersome to prepare. This makes answering \"what-if\" questions of the type that stakeholders are likely to ask an expensive and slow process. During the course of this study, in response to technical questions posed by three members of the committee, DHS provided the co mmittee with a technical document (DHS, 2007) that includes answers to the questions po sed and which became an essential piece of documentation missing from the original publications provided to the committee. In addition, the committee asked another expert 2 to make an independent review of the methodology employed for the model used in the BTRA of 2006 using the originally published material and the technical addendum. The independent review is reproduced in this report as Appendix I. The author of that review encountered difficulties similar to t hose described here; one of three suggestions in Appendix I is \"to report future results in a scientif ic fashion than can be reviewed by scientists\"\u2014 a suggestion that is echoed in the next recommendation of this committee (see below). 2 Alan R. Washburn, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Operations Research, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. 4-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Some of the probabilities of important conse quences in the model used in the BTRA of 2006 were extremely close to zero. When risk is expressed in numerical form, whether or not decision makers are motivated to take action will frequently depend on how confident they are in the number. Human beings are known to have difficulty in rationally processing numbers and probabilities (Paulos, 1988; Tversky and Kahneman, 1973, 1974), and when probabilities are extremely small, decision makers will often give them greater weight than is appropriate or possibly ignore them altogether, at great peril when there are potentially significant and large consequences. Thus, extreme caution is needed to avoid an under- or overinterpretation of results that may cause errors in decision making when pr obabilities of consequences are estimated to be near zero, such as is the case w ith the model used in the BTRA of 2006. Systematic use of well- grounded models can guide decision makers to account for these probabilities correctly. Recommendation: DHS should maintain a high level of transparency in risk assessment models, including a comprehensive, clear mathematical document and a complete description of the sources of all input data. The documentation should be sufficient for scientific peer review. To carry out this recommendation, DHS should do the following: Slicit input from multiple stakeholders invol ved with the prevention of bioterrorism (whether directed at humans or at agricultu re), preparedness, and response throughout the development of the model in order to enha nce their understanding of and therefore their confidence in the model, its data inputs, and its results; Clearly state the objectives and carefully define the input variables, sources of data, and associated consequence models; make assump tions explicit; and justify the values that are assigned to variables, parameters, and probabilities; Provide a guide to facilitate the interpretati on of results, especially in the context of important outcomes that are estimated to o ccur with probabilities approaching zero; and Conduct a scientific, periodic external review of the validity of the risk assessment model's development and analysis; carefully and completely document how the model is developed and its mathematical foundations, using terms from a widely accepted, standard technical lexicon in understandable language, such that an independent, external panel of experts can duplicate the results; have an independent blue team perform complete scenario dissection for selected path s through the entire event tree; and take care to allow the widest possible review subject to security requirements. THE BTRA SHOULD BECOME A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM Decision support systems (DSSs) are interactive information technology platforms that facilitate the use of information in complex deci sion making. The goals of DSSs are to improve the efficiency with which users make decisions a nd to improve the effectiveness of their decisions (Shim et al., 2002; Pearson and Shim, 1995). DSSs are especially helpful in decision-making situations where there are multiple decision ma kers with different roles, functions, and responsibilities, and different types and sources of data and databases. There are many different designs for DSSs, but in general they include the following components: (1) database management capabiliti es that provide access to relational databases, information, and knowledge from a variety of sources; (2) modeling and modeling management 4-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION functions; and (3) a simple user-interface compone nt that supports interactive queries, reporting, and graphic functions (Marakas, 1999; Druzdzel a nd Flynn, 2002; Shim et al., 2002; Ware et al., 2002). DSSs have been developed to support sp ecific decisions involved with bioterrorism prevention, preparedness, and response (Bravata et al., 2002, 2004; Ware et al., 2002). Bravata et al. (2002) identified 217 information technology DSSs that were of potential use to clinicians and public health officials in the even t of a bioterrorism event. One example of a DSS that facilitates data-based decision making for resource allocation problems and emergency response planning is a stand-alone, large-scale DSS, called RealOpt. RealOpt pairs a flexible simulation component with a set of analytical, decision-making algorithms. The system comprises three integrating components: A simulation manager that runs simulations with changes in input parameters in order to investigate behavior and bottlenecks in the sy stem for different scenarios, and calculates various outcome statistics (e.g., average wait time, queue length, and utilization rates); An optimization manager that stores algorithms and fast heuristics and iteratively calls on the simulation manager to resolve and upda te resource-allocation statistics (e.g., to maximize throughput, to minimize staff usag e to satisfy a specified throughput); and A user-interface manager and linker module that connects the input of data to a display of results, including a graphics algorithm that allows users to design specific floorplans of different patient care and dispensing facilities for vaccinations and different medications (Lee et al., 2006). The characteristics of DSSs that are effec tive in giving decision makers access to the understandable information that they need a nd can use for decision making are as follows: The DSS clearly states its objectives and desired outcomes (i.e., timely, quality decisions); It addresses consequence and identifies key questions of stakeholders who were involved in framing the problems; It is user-friendly for a variety of stakeholders and does not require sophisticated information technology skills for its operation; The DSS is flexible, efficient, and includes an easy-to-access help desk and documentation; It is portable across different computer platforms and personal digital assistants; It provides results that are well matched to decision objectives. Decision makers can ask for and easily get results of new simulations reflecting different assumptions on how an event will present alternative responses and inte rventions leading to different outcomes; The DSS requires minimal computation time for simulation\u2014seconds or minutes versus hours for individual simulation runs; It provides accurate results and informati on that can be used to gauge how much confidence can be placed in model outputs. Systematic checks of data quality are built in to the analysis system and display of results; It has displays that are simply designed with high-resolution data; it has relevant information presented and conveyed in an un derstandable way and accessed easily; and its tables and graphs are well labeled. Th e DSS's displays should be accompanied by annotation, details, other supplements, including limitations, aids to interpretation of risk, confidence limits around risk, and confidence in solutions. 4-8 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Recommendation: Subsequent revision of the BTRA should enable a decision support system that can be run quickly to test the implications of new assumptions and new data and provide insights to decision makers and st akeholders to support risk-informed decision making. Use Scenarios A successful DSS, as described above, w ould facilitate the use of scenarios. Mathematical models (e.g., risk assessment models) often are so complex that their results are not easily understood, met with confidence, and u sed. Decision makers commonly deal with the uncertainty of future events by using \"what-if \" scenarios, which can bound uncertainty and bring multiple stakeholders together to consider a shared, selected set of hypothesized chains of events in narrative form, and to consider alternatives (P omerol, 2001). Scenarios can make abstract or nebulous threats more concrete, which can help d ecision makers avoid becoming lost in trying to assimilate large numbers of variables, relati onships, and parameters with extremely small probabilities. Scenarios are especia lly useful when decision makers are inexperienced in systems thinking. They may help inexperienced systems thinkers avoid using unrealistic assumptions, which can lead to the development of incomplete , infeasible, or ineffective plans (Whitworth, 2006). Danzig (2003) described a number of situati ons in which planning scenarios could be used. First, they can bring awareness to sets of specific circumstances and hypothesized chains of events, which, if understandable and conveyed in a compelling manner such that the decision maker has confidence in the method, will have a greater likelihood for resulting in action. Second, they can help in the development of coordinated actions and plans among multiple stakeholders by keeping everyone focused on the same narrative or alternative. Third, a planning scenario can serve as a reference case against whic h alternative strategies can be compared and tested. Fourth, planning scenarios can be used to establish resource and other requirements needed to prevent or respond to potential events. Critics of scenarios are concerned that their use may make assumptions unclear or inexplicit, complicating external review and assessment and making their validity difficult to assess. When insufficient detail is provided, di fferent stakeholders may arrive at different perceptions of a scenario and end up coming to incompatible conclu sions or developing uncoordinated or incompatible plans. For this reason, scenarios must reflect the most complete, explicit, and transparent details available and allow for a ready comparison of perceptions among the various stakeholders. Finally, scenarios can become too rigid. They require continual updating as new information becomes available. However, effectively planning for these possibilities can mitigate these organization problems . The committee recognizes the difficulty in preparing and validating accurate and useful scenario s. For that reason, it suggests that, as with other BTRA documentation, any such scenarios be peer reviewed. Sensitivity Analysis Is Important for Validation Sensitivity analysis has been defined as the determination of how \"uncertainty in the output of a model (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input\" (Saltelli and Tarantola, 2002). The purposes of sensitivity analyses are to (1) give users of risk assessment models information that they can use to identify key parameters and explore a range of impacts that can be expected with changes in input and parameter values, and 4-9 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION to evaluate the confidence they can place on model outputs; (2) identify sources of uncertainty in the model when assumptions and parameters vary across possible scenarios; (3) aid planners in comparing alternative strategies and test how a given plan would work should assumptions be wrong; (4) help decision makers make the best possible decisions in the presence of uncertainty; and (5) set priorities for the collection of a dditional information (Meltzer, 2001; Whitworth, 2006). Because considerable data are lacking for ma ny of the parameters and probabilities in the model used for the BTRA of 2006, there may be an accompanying lack of confidence in the results. Thus, being able to conduct a sensitivit y analysis is an essential feature of the BTRA model if it is to be used for decision making. Although the BTRA was apparently developed so that the impact of different parameters on c onsequences of importance could be assessed through sensitivity analysis, the process for running sensitiv ity analyses currently is not interactive and appears quite \"user-unfriendly \" and cumbersome. To see results of the model for different scenarios (changing values for parameters and in different branches of the tree for different agents), changes in values must be submitted to analysts who rerun the model. Results are then evidently available hours to days later, maki ng the sensitivity analysis process difficult for decision makers to use immediately. Finally, th e results of simulations are presented in graphs, charts, and tables that are complex and difficult to interpret and use. For these reasons, the committee questions wh ether the results of the 2006 Biological Threat Risk Assessment model are answering the highest-priority questions of different decision makers; whether they are being conveyed in th e most understandable, useful, and compelling manner possible; and whether the current sensitivity analysis feature is meeting information needs. User-friendly sensitivity analysis could also be a part of any DSS. The uncertainty or lack of data and/or errors in measurement for many key variables and parameters in risk assessment models for potential bioterrorism events can affect the confidence that decision makers place on the output of the model. Accepted good modeling practices require that models be continually tested and validated by evaluating the effect of uncertainties with regard to values of parameters a nd probabilities of the model. Sensitivity analysis has become an accepted and important approach to the testing and validation of risk assessment models of complex systems (Borgonovo, 2006). In the future, it will be important to move the sensitivity analysis from questions about risk assessment (for example, Ho w does uncertainty about the infectious dose for this agent change my expected consequences?) to questions about risk management (for example, If I had improved knowledge about the infectious dose for this agent, would I adopt different countermeasure strategies?). Currently, simulation runs take an extended period of time to run owing to the complexity and size of the model a nd its input data; outputs from the model are not presented in easily used, interactive, understanda ble and compelling formats. Strategies for reducing the complexity of the model are presente d in Chapter 7; strategies for tools that are easier for users to employ are presented in the next subsection. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis will a ffect the method to use for the analysis. Borgonovo (2006) described three families of an alytic techniques (i.e., variance-based, input- output correlation, and moment-independent analyses), the choice of which would depend on the stated purpose of the sensitivity analysis. Precautions must be taken when drawing c onclusions from sensitivity analyses, as the accuracy of the information is conditional on the validity of the underlying model structure and the methods used to exercise it. If the structure of the risk assessment model and/or the assumptions used in the model are not accurate or appropriate, then the results of a sensitivity analysis can give a false sense of security in the results and may lead to inappropriate policy decisions (Brisson and Edmunds, 2006). Extreme caution also is needed to avoid a misinterpretation or overinterpretation of resu lts and the making of errors in decision making when valid data for parameters or probabilities are lacking. 4-10 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A comp rehensive and continua lly updated set of guidelines, protocols, and checklists that provide essential details on clear courses of actions that decision makers would make, conditional on the in formation made available to them from risk assessment models analyzing a set of structured scenarios, must be developed, tested, and in place. These materials should be prepared for di fferent stakeholders and should include a range of possible decisions and actions, by scenario, for different authorities, roles and responsibilities, desired outcomes, and benchmarks for tr acking progress for different scenarios. Different strategies and protocols should be practiced as tabletop and TOPOFF3 exercises to identify areas where additional attention, pl anning, resource acquisition and allocation, and practice are required. A trained workforce with in and across multiple sectors, agencies, and institutions in the public and private sectors is essential. Relevant, accurate, timely information that is available in unde rstandable formats and terms, with guides to the interpretation of outcomes, is critical. Environments that support the use of data in decision making are those in which the right resources (e.g., staff, drugs, vaccines, respirators, other) are pre-positioned strategically and available to the right staff at the right time.

However n ecessary the focus on risk associated with known biological agents is, the committee strongly believes that it is not sufficient. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) of 2006 only considers threats already known and at least partially characterized. However, the biological threat spectrum is dynamic (Petro et al., 2003; IOM and NRC, 2006) and therefore requires a proactive approach. Some agents on the Category A list 1 (such as several of the hemorrhagic fevers) of the Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) were discovered only within the past few decades, and there are undoubtedly many more pathogens still undiscovered in nature (IOM, 1992, 2003; Morse, 1991, 1995). Some of them may be similar to agents already known. Others, such as Nipah virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (discovered in 2003), may have completely unexpected char acteristics. In addition, previously unknown pathogens will continue to be discovered or to evolve from natu re. Some may be adopted by adversaries as \"bioweapons of convenience,\" just as the current biothreat agents were all zoonotic diseases (animal diseases that can be transmitte d to humans) adopted by older bioweapons programs because their biological or physi cal characteristics made them suitable. So far, with respect to biothreat agents, natu re has been the greatest source of novelty, but the rapid advances in molecular biology and biotechnology and the increasing understanding of pathogenesis (the mechanisms by which these or ganisms cause disease) cannot be ignored. These advances suggest that the future will be even mo re complex and uncertain (IOM and NRC, 2006). Agents can be modified for new properties in a va riety of ways. Discoveries in this area in the past few years have included the following: Poxviruses with an IL-4 gene insert that can cause severe disease in immunized or genetically resistant animals (Jackson et al., 2001). IL-4 (interleukin-4) is a mammalian protein that serves as one of several important regulators of immune response. Ectromelia (mousepox) virus is similar in lethality and contagio usness to smallpox in 1For the CDC list, see www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp#a .

As with human smallpox, mice can be protected by the same vaccine that is used to protect humans against smallpox. However, when immunized mice are infected with the IL-4 modified mousepox virus, the effects are severe and similar to those in uni mmunized mice. In addition, strains of mice that normally would be genetically resistant are not resistant to the modified virus, but become sick in the same way that more susceptible mice do. Fortunately, for reasons not clearly understood, these engineered strains do not transmit well to others. However, one can anticipate that a future technically adept adversary could solve this problem. Anthrax modified with a gene insert from a nonpathogenic relative that can defeat a live anthrax vaccine (Pomerantsev et al., 1997). Inserting a particular gene from a relatively harmless anthrax relative, Bacillus cereus , made anthrax able to infect and kill animals (hamsters) that had been immunized with the standard live vaccine used in Russia for human protection. This live vaccine, known as STI, is generally considered highly effective, and (although comparative data are l acking) is widely thought to be equivalent in efficacy to the protective antigen (PA) protein-based vaccine used in the United States and United Kingdom. Earlier, at the 1995 International Anthrax Meeting in Salisbury, United Kingdom, the same Russian group ha d reported developing multi-drug-resistant anthrax. Although a vaccine strain was used for this experiment, it could just as easily have been done with virulent anthrax. Reconstruction of viable 1918 pandemic influenza virus (Tumpey et al., 2005). The virus responsible for the most notorious influen za pandemic in recorded history (with an estimated 50 million human deaths worldwide) was recently reconstructed from several different sources using molecular techniques. This tour-de-force of molecular biology (by Jeffery Taubenberger and colleagues) ma de it possible to study the 1918 pandemic virus for the first time. The virus could be gr own and tested in several animal species, in which it caused severe disease. The purpose of the work was constructive, to better understand how the 1918 pandemic virus caused such serious disease. Even more recently, it was shown that two specific amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of the H5N1 avian influenza virus would enable it to bind to human, rather than avian, tissues, a necessary first st ep in being able to readily infect humans (Yamada et al ., 2006). The motives for all the work cited here are ostensibly benign: to better understand these dangerous pathogens. But it is easy to imagine how the same techniques could be applied to other uses. At present, conducting this work re quires specialized laboratory expertise at the postgraduate level or above, and the influenza ge netic system is currently beyond the technical capabilities of all but a few experts. However, advances in biotechnology will make all of these techniques more accessible in the future (IOM and NRC, 2006). The powerful molecular technique for selectively copying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was so esoteric in the early to mid-1990s that performing it required painstaking technique by experienced scientists. PCR has now become so widely used and routine that it is commonplace in high school science projects a nd is even taught to schoolchildren visiting museum exhibitions. As another example, the complete chemical synthesis of the poliovirus genome (a small ribonucleic acid [RNA] virus) re quired several years of work by experts, including overcoming a number of technical diffi culties (Cello et al., 2002). Since then, the George Church Laboratory at Harvard University has devised microchips that could be used to synthesize even larger genomes with far less effort (Tian et al ., 2004), and other large-scale rapid DNA synthesis methods are at the advanced devel opment stage. There h as also been academic interest in \"synthetic biology,\" a kind of engin eering using biological component parts to make 5-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It is clear that future possibilities will be limited more by imagination than by technical obstacles. Very few individuals today are capable of us ing these techniques, and it is likely to be some time before other than state-sponsored terrorists will be able to take advantage of such technological advances. In the meantime, conve ntional threats are likely to predominate. Nevertheless, if the history of PCR and other sci entific advances is any indication, the use of biotechnology to engineer novel threats will come in time. It has been suggested that engineering \"advanced bioweapons\" is a natural extension of advancing biotechnology. In the words of the authors of a recent publication on this subject (Petro et al., 2003, p. 161): Advances in biological research likely will permit development of a new class of advanced biological warfa re (ABW) agents engineered to elicit novel effects . . . Such new agents and delivery systems would provide a variety of new use options, expanding the BW paradigm. Although ABW agents will not replace threats posed by traditional biological agents such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and Variola (smallpox), they will necessitate nove l approaches to counterproliferation, detection, medical countermeasures, and attribution. In consideration of these possibilities, th e White House recently released Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18 (HSPD-18): Medical Countermeasures Against Weapons of Mass Destruction (The White House, 2007) as a follow-up to the original biodefense strategy embodied in HSPD-10 (The White House, 2004). HSPD-10 is the document that, among other tasks, instituted the regular thr eat assessment that constitutes the main thrust of this committee's work. Setting out the outlines of the U.S. biodefense strategy, HSPD-10 states that \"[t]he essential pillars of our national biodefense progr am are: Threat Awareness, Prevention and Protection, Surveillance and Detection, and R esponse and Recovery.\" HSPD-18 takes this strategy a step farther, mandating that \"[o]ur Nation will use a two tiered approach for development and acquisition of medical counterm easures, which will balance the immediate need to provide a capability to mitigate the most catastrophic of the current CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) threats with long-term requirements to develop more flexible, broader spectrum countermeasures to address future threats.\" The biodefense tasks are divided into \"Tier I: Focused Development of Agent-Specific Medical Countermeasures\" for current and anticipated biological threats and \"Tie r II: Development of a Flexible Capability for New Medical Countermeasures\" (The White House, 2007). The latter specifically recognizes the diversity of possible future biological threats, both natural and engineered, and the need for broad-spectrum solutions. The BTRA of 2006 does not lend itself readily to the rapid assessment of new threats. Cybersecurity presents similar contrasts of compre hensiveness versus flexibility. Buckshaw et al. (2005) developed a quantitative risk model based on the adversary's attack preferences instead of the adversary's probabilities of attack. This has certain advantages (e.g., Buckshaw at al. [2005, p. 24] note, \"Adversary attack preferences are easi er to measure and help develop the mitigation strategy. We need to consider all attacks si nce a capable and adaptive threat will constantly change their actions in response to our assurance activities.\"). However, Buckshaw et al. (2005, p. 36) also note the same drawback of needi ng large amounts of reasonably accurate data: \"Data are the benefit and bane. . . . If time is spent to get the data required of a quantitative risk model, then one can produce insightful and clear recomme ndations for the decision maker. Because the data requirements are so large, we recommend that [this] be used only on critical information systems.\" 5-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECTTO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION INCLUDING UNKNOWN AND ENGINEERED AGENTS IS CHALLENGING BUT POSSIBLE There are several possible ways to deal with the unpredictable and dynamic future for both natural and engineered agents: Concentrate on known agents, and develop new risk assessments as each new threat is identified (e.g., from intelligence). While this avoids speculation about future possibilities and possibly unnecessary work, it has several potential weaknesses. Risk assessment models such as the BTRA of 2006 require large amounts of specific information about the agent and its properti es. Even with such well-known agents as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) or Yersinia pestis (plague), the critical data are approximate at best, with uncertainties that have proven elusive to quantify (indeed, some data may vary by strain of organism and conditions of assay). Obtaining these data for newly recognized or newly engineered agents is likel y to be even more difficult, and to exact a significant time lag. Attempt to identify every potential future threat. The committee believes that both the complexity of nature and unforeseen advan ces in biotechnology will make this task infeasible and may lead to a false sense of security by leaving the United States unprotected against newly engineered pathogens. There are too many theoretical possibilities and, barring reliable intelligence in formation, prioritization is likely to be exceedingly difficult. Consider \"more-generic\" categorization of agents and risks into groups by various properties, identifying the most critical variables. This would provide a general framework that could be used to classify ne wly identified threats as they appear on the basis of even limited information. In ad dition, this approach may suggest mitigation strategies that already apply to existing pathogens. The committee favors this open- ended approach for new and emerging pathogens. What are some possible standard situations or classifications to use in an effort to anticipate future threats? Consider the analogy presented by grouping threats in information assurance analyses. McCumber (1991) introduces a qualitative model for information security that incorporates the three concep ts of information characteristics, information states, and security countermeasures. DHS could seek, with its custom ers, multiple classification schemes that are most useful to each of its customers' end-u ser communities. Rather than requiring specific numbers (such as R 0, or infection rate), identifying combinations of key variables as qualitative categories would also help model vulnerabilities a nd prioritize concerns that have not yet been foreseen by existing analyses. Although analyzing newly emerging threats may seem a daunting task, it actually appears to be quite feasible. While the number of a ll possible combinations of characteristics is enormous, it would not be necessary to deal with su ch vast numbers of combinations in practice, because the analysis would be limited to a number of key characteristics at relatively broad qualitative levels. The high, medium, and low threat categories appear meaningful to some users and might be sufficient. Several efforts have been made to define th e weapon or terrorist potential of microbial agents. For example, Casadevall and Pirofski (2004) recently attempted to identify the 5-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECTTO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION characteristics that might contribute to the weapon potential of an agent. Such efforts have repeatedly identified several of th e same characteristics\u2014for example: Ease of acquisition, Transmissibility, Mode of spread (person to person or by direct exposure only, or both), Case fatality rate, Ease of dissemination, Frequency of serious sequelae (e.g., blindness or neurological disease) in survivors, and Availability and efficacy of countermeasures (vaccine or other prophylactic measures) and therapeutic measures. All of these criteria are included in the BTRA of 2006. However, a true quantitative estimate is virtually impossible for newly rec ognized or poorly characterized agents. The committee has prepared a rapid assessment tool that can be applied to any newly recognized agent for which there are only very limited specific data, and it suggests that DHS consider development of such a tool. Such a rapid assessment tool could use attributes similar to those listed above, with the agent qualitatively categorized as being a low, medium, or high threat with respect to each attribute; these categories could be assigned numerical scores (e.g., 1, 2, and 3) and these scores used as a signature to comp are with known pathogens. Although such qualitative assessments cannot replace detailed risk assessment, the use of such a rapid assessment tool can aid DHS in focusing on ar eas where further expansion of possibilities and more evaluation are needed. 2 The committee's rapid assessment tool is an adaptation of the Multi-Attribute Risk Analysis (MARA) step 1 used in the devel opment of the DHS risk assessment process as described in the DHS report Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (DHS, 2006, Ch. 6, pp. 1-28). In MARA, there are 28 attributes, each scored 0 through 4 by a panel of experts. Aggregating these categories to broadly reflect several key character istics, such as those listed above, could form the basis for a rapid assessment tool. Although results would, of course, be approximate, this rapid assessment would help DHS and its partner agen cies determine whether a newly identified agent is a high priority for additional consideration. As a hypothetical illustration of this sort of rapid assessment, a template and some worked examples are shown in Table 5.1. While engineered agents are by definition no vel, an engineered agent will likely be designed for a specific function. The committee th erefore anticipates that the evaluation of such agents would be similar to the ev aluation of novel natural agents. Additionally, rigorous sensitivity analyses applied to the BTRA (as recommended by the committee elsewhere in this report) can help identify the key characteristics for a rapid assessment and should be done regularly and on a variety of parameters. Since many of the parameters input to the BTRA result from the elicitation of expert opinion, the threats that emerge may only reinforce general expert consensus. Alternative con sequence analyses of different routes of administration (such as large-scale food contamination) should be rigorously tested to ensure that these results are robust. It is also possible that even improvised suboptimal routes used by an adversary may cause significant mo rbidity and mortality, or mental health consequences. This issue is further examin ed in Chapter 6, \"Improving Bioterrorism Consequence Assessment.\" 2 T.

The committee recommends expanding present approaches to form the basis of a more proactive strategy to face future threats. Recommendation: The BTRA should be broad enough to encompass a variety of bioterrorism threats while allowing for changing situations and new information. DHS should develop a strategy for the rapid assessment of newly recognized and poorly characterized threats. REFERENCES Bio FAB Group, D. Baker, G. Church, J. Collins, D. Endy, J. Jacobson, J.

Although in the BTRA of 2006 an analysis was conducted for the three measures of consequences, the overall risk-informed agent prior itization is based only on mortality . In presentations to the committee, DHS reported th at it intends to take into account indirect economic costs (e.g., medical mitigation, emergency response, cleanup, and business loss) as well. Some projected improvements for fu ture BTRAs are described in Chapter 3. Assessing an infectious agent's impact on a population is challenging. In order to measure the health consequences, currently defi ned as the number of fatalities and of ill people, DHS has implemented a susceptible, exposed, infect ed, and recovered (SEIR) model using an off- the-shelf software package called STELLA, 2 which is run for each scenario. SEIR is a deterministic, \"compartmental\" model; it categorizes individuals as being in one of four compartments, representing the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and those who have recovered. The model parameters specify the transition rates between the compartments\u2014for example, the attack rate\u2014as susceptible people become infected. SEIR models can provide useful insights into the mechanics of many common infectious diseases and into the effectiveness of control st rategies. However, SEIR and similar modeling approaches have limitations. Even the simplest model requires a minimum amount of parametric data: in particular, the attack rate or risk of tr ansmission per contact, the incubation period of the disease, the number of potentially infectious contacts that a person has per unit of time, and the duration of the transmissible period. Models that assess the health consequences of the pathogens of concern for bioterrorism are difficult to parameterize owing to the lack of an adequate empirical base. Many diseases are relatively obscure and are associated with extremely limited Note: The committee thanks Jason Matheny, Ellis McKenzie, Marc Lipsitch, and Michael Boechler for reading this chapter. 1 \"Direct economic costs\" here refer to the cost s of hospitalization and funerals and exclude the cost of decontamination, loss of worker productivity, and so on. 2 See www.iseesystems.com .

Thus, estimates of the key parameters for most bioterrorism agents must reflect a very large variance. The anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001 demonstrated low correlation between environmental exposure and infection risk. Given the great uncertainty associated with model inputs, it is important to acknowledge that genera ted predictions are rough approximations at best and, while useful in helping to understand a problem, should not be regarded as more than rough approximations. Ex acerbating this lack of certainty in model outputs, the increasing availability of sophisticated computer software allows researchers to create highly artificial models, sometimes based on weakly defended assumptions, where the complexity and precision of results can be mistaken for accuracy4 (May, 2004). Even when data for well-studied pathogens (e.g., influenza viruses) are available, predicting the propagation of infection in a pop ulation requires understanding how individuals, as well as medical and public health teams, will r espond to a threat. Again, there are limited empirical data to inform models regarding medical and public response capacity and human 3 Marc Lipsitch, Harvard School of Public H ealth. \"Notes to the National Research Council Committee on Methodological Improvements to the DHS's Biological Agent Risk Analysis.\" Written communication to the comm ittee, February 2007. 4 In May (2004), Lord May writes, \"the increasing speed and sophistication and ease of use of computers enables an increasingly large number of life scientists who have no substantial background in mathematics to explore 'mathematical models' and draw conclusions about them. Such activity usually consists of representing sensible and evidence-based assumptions as the starting point for a complicated and usually nonlinear dynamical system, assigning particular parameters (often in an arbitrary way), and then letting this complicated system rip. This represents a revolutionary change in such theoretical studies. Until only a decade or two ago, anyone pursuing this kind of activity had to have a solid grounding in mathematics. And th at meant that such studies were done by people who had some idea, at an intuitive level, of how the original assumptions related to the emerging graphical display or other conclusions on their computer. Removing this link means that we arguably are seeing an increasingly large body of work in which sweeping conclusions\u2014 'emergent phenomena'\u2014are drawn from the alleged working of a mathematical model, without clear understanding of what is actually going on. I think this can be worrying (p. 790).\" Lord May further substantiates his argument in favor of simpler models over complex ones by citing the example of HIV/AIDS models developed in the mid-1980s to estimate the likely demographic impact in some central African countries: \"The main unknown at that time was the probability, \u00df, that an infected individual would infect a susceptible partner. Available data suggested that \u00df depended relatively little on the number of sexual acts within a partnership. On this basis, we used a relatively simple model to suggest that the future demographic impact of HIV/AIDS could be severe in some such countries. In contrast, the World Health Organization and the Population Council in New York produced models that we re much more complex, including very detailed demographic data, but where HIV transmission probability was treated as if for measles, compounding independently and randomly for each individual sex act. Thus, in effect, their models assumed that, knowing nothing of the infective status of individuals, 1 sex act with each of 10 different sex partners was effectively equivalent to 10 acts with 1; our data-governed, but otherwise much simpler, model saw the former as roughly 10 times more risky. So it was not surprising that the later models, apparently 'more realistic' by virtue of their computational complexity, suggested a less gloomy view than ours. Sadly, but understandably, our predictions have proved more reliable (p. 793).\" [The excerpts from May (2004) in this footnote are reprinted with permission from AAAS.

As point ed out in Ferguson (2007), there are fundamental limitations in how models can capture the key social parameters of human behavior. The manner in which people alter their behavior in an attemp t to reduce their risk when faced with lethal or novel pathogens is difficult to predict and may signi ficantly alter the consequences of an attack. Models are unlikely to capture behaviors that si gnificantly reduce social contact, as seen in Hong Kong and Singapore during the epidemic of sever e acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, or potential unintentional contact- increasing behavior after the occurrence of a widely publicized bioterrorism attack. Soon after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), several prominent infectious-disease modelers undertook studies to assess the likely magnitude of smallpox epidemics under various response strategies. The U. S. government was particularly interested in determining whether, in the aftermath of an a ttack, vaccination of likely contacts of infected persons (\"ring vaccination\" or \"traced vaccina tion\") would be as effective in containing an outbreak as would mass vaccination. At that time, soon after 9/11, vaccine was in limited supply. The former strategy would require fewe r vaccinations and, due to the capability of smallpox vaccine to induce a reaction, would be asso ciated with less morbidity. Despite available quantitative data from past smallpox epidemics, there was considerable disagreement about the likely adequacy of the various r esponses. It took several years and considerable debate to understand that the differences in models' conclusions rested mainly on assumptions about the timing of transmission relative to symptoms and about the likely speed of the public health response (i.e., the capacity of public health work ers to enact targeted versus mass vaccination campaigns) (Cooper, 2006). Substantial di fferences between public health capabilities in different jurisdictions present more variability. Thus, the site of the attack may significantly influence its consequences. In summary, response logistics matter just as much as epidemiology in determining the outcome of a bioterrorism attack (Kaplan et al., 2003). Although consequence models are imperfect, they clearly can contribute to planning and mitigation. An appropriate estimate of the da mage that the United States could experience is critical to allocating resources and developing mitigation strategies to the numerous possible different threats. \"Intuitive judgment\" alone is inadequate, as it focuses on only a handful of salient cues (and not necessarily the right ones), often weighed in a simple linear fashion (Hammond, 2006). However, models should ta ke into account the intuitive judgments of informed and experienced health professionals. A \"structured discussion\" approach is also useful in driving consensus. However, structured discussion is subject to small-group dynamics and may reflect primarily the biases of the most vocal, argumentative, or influential individuals (Janis, 1989). Both intuitive judgment and structured judgment can be useful adjuncts to the modeling process but, like modeling itself, are not sufficiently robust and free of bias and error to stand alone. 5 Recommendation: The susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model adopted by DHS is more complex than can be supported by existing data or knowledge. DHS should make its SEIR model as simple as possible consistent with existing knowledge. The complexity of the consequence models presented by DHS seems too great given the data available. The use of a complex model when adequate data are unavailable is probably detrimental to the quality of conclusions, and their use may be dangerously misleading. The complexity compromises the ability to elicit sensible estimates, uncertainty ranges, and 5 An encompassing summary of forecasting using expert judgment can be found in Armstrong (2001). 6-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Hence the uncertainty of the model will likely be incorrectly estimated. In addition, complex models do not lend themselves well to independent validation and verification by other modelers. OTHER CONSEQUENCES NEED TO BE MODELED Bioterrorist attacks create direct impacts, which occur immediately after the event, and indirect impacts, which may be much longer term in nature. More specifically, direct impacts are damage and losses that can be directly attributed to the attack, such as injuries, loss of life, and damage to property and infrastructure as well as to natural habitats and fish and wildlife populations. Indirect or secondary impacts occur over time and include, for instance, family trauma and social disruption, business interrupti ons, and shortages of critical human services. From a societal point of view, a large number of cases of a disease, perhaps with a long period of latency, can have far more serious implications than the consequences of a large number of deaths from the same disease.6 Any measure of health consequences must, at a minimum, combine considerations of morbidity and mortality. Two such measures of \"health utility\" commonly used are the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) and the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The more commonly used DALY is computed as ( N x L ) + (D x DW x DD), where N = number of deaths, L = life expectancy in years, D = number of disabilities, DW = disability weight, and DD = duration of disability in years. The disability weight is defined by a panel of clinicians. Some DALY models also apply age-weights and discount rates. The scaling is such that 1 DALY represents the loss of 1 year of equivalent full health. 7 Estimates of morbidity should also include psychological effects. Fear is a terrorist's \"force multiplier.\" Fears about biological agen ts, which are not readily identifiable and are generally misunderstood, heighten the real or pe rceived threats of terrorism. After the anthrax letter attacks in the United States in October 2001, millions of people were made anxious opening their mail; and there have been numerous reports of persons opening a letter or package, finding a powdery substance (later found to be harmless), and having a psychological and physical reaction that required medical attention (Wessely et al., 2001). Silver et al. (2002) point out that the long-term social and psychological effects of a biological attack may be as damaging as the acute ones, that they may remain high for years, and that they may exacerbate preexisting psychiatric disorders and further heighten the risk of mass sociogenic illness. A distrust of medical experts and government officials, who cannot provide blan ket assurances of no lasting harm, may result. The response to bioterrorist events may involve the distribution of medical therapeutics and vaccines, isolation of symptomatic individuals , observation of potentially exposed people by public health officials, and other actions that are guaranteed to generate anxiety in the population. The ongoing risk of exposure, possible evacuation from contaminated areas, and the perceived or real risk of death or permanent health consequences are all contributory. If government and public health officials do not properly manage risk communication, there is potential for civil disruption and further business and economic losses. DALY would be an appropriate measure of psychological distress, as it is already used in mental health. Bioattacks can also have serious environmen tal consequences. For example, Gruinard Island in the United Kingdom became contaminated with anthrax spores after testing occurred on the island in 1942; the island was quarantined for almost 50 years. Decontamination was finally 6 For a more detailed discussion of the importance of incorporating indirect or secondary impacts in evaluating alternative programs, see Heinz Cent er for Science, Economics, and the Environment (1999). 7 These and other measures of population health are discussed in NRC (1998). 6-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, four major cleanups were required: at th e American Media, Inc. (AMI), building in Boca Raton, Florida; the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) offices in New York City; the U.S. Capitol complex in Washington, D.C.; and at two facilities of the U.S. Postal Service. 8 Agricultural consequences also need to be considered. Economic activity of U.S. agriculture has been estimated to exceed $1 trillio n annually, with exports valued in excess of $50 billion. Protecting U.S. agriculture is critical to the global economy and to the ensuring of an adequate and safe food supply in the United Stat es and other countries. Several assessments of agricultural consequences have shown that livest ock and poultry populatio ns are vulnerable to biologic attack. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified viruses and bacteria capable of causing widescale morbidity and mortality of livestock and poultry that would result in a cessation of international trade and exports costing the United States billions of dollars. 9 Recommendation: While human mortality and the magnitude and duration of morbidity should remain the primary focus of DHS bioterrorism risk analysis, DHS should incorporate other measures of societal loss, including the magnitude and duration of first- and second-order economic loss and environmental and agricultural effects. Some direct impacts of bioterrorist attacks are relatively easy to quantify because they are easy to measure in dollars: insured losses to homes, businesses, and industry; bridge and highway repairs; equipment replacement or repairs; crop loss; and so on. The costs of other direct impacts and many indirect impacts are less easy to de termine and quantify\u2014for example, psychological distress and family instability. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been proposed as a way of combining direct and indirect effects of alternative programs. If one undertak es CBA, it is necessary to monetize each of the direct and indirect impacts to provide a co mmon metric for ranking the risks of different bioagents. Monetization means assigning values in dollars. Mortality and morbidity (including psychological distress) could be monetized by setting 1 DALY or 1 QALY equal to the \"value of a statistical life-year\" or to 1 year of income (typically on the order of $50,000). The value of environmental impacts is measured in terms of willingness to pay by using contingent valuation techniques and has been a source of debate by economists over the years. The total social cost of a bioterrorist att ack can be estimated by combining direct and indirect economic costs with the monetization of mortality, morbidity, and environmental costs. Some critics of CBA are unwilling to attach moneta ry values to life, environmental impacts, or other non-economic consequences from different events. One then has to use other methods of analysis such as cost-effectiveness analysis or multigoal analysis. 10 8 See news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1457035.stm .

Additi onally, the attacker and defender are both limited by technological and resource constraints which influence the choices that they make when committing attacks and arranging defenses. These two aspects are not properly captured by the probabilistic risk assessment adopt ed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in its Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) of 2006. Probabilistic risk assessment has its roots in event-tree risk assessments\u2014used to assess failures of engineered systems, purely random hazards, or acts of nature (e.g., storm damage or nuclear reactor accidents). The excessive complexity of the BTRA assess ment of the probability of terrorist decisions is a significant weakness\u2014especially cons idering that such complexity is not necessary (see Chapter 3). Below, the committee introduces th ree models in which terrorist decisions are just that, decisions\u2014not prior estimates of probabilities. The models represent different trade-offs and assumptions in addressing the risk management problem, but any of the three approaches would improve the methodology currently used by the BTRA or other simple extensions. Event trees can help focus attention in cases where uncertainty is high or new defense investment can have maximum impact. Event trees also admit flexible calculation\u2014the event outcomes contain the conditional probabilities obtained from any or all of these sources: expert opinion, mathematical equations, or complex simulations. Event trees model sequential time effects, but in the bioterrorism application asses sed here, events may occur in parallel or at unknown times. Since credible data are more available and probabilities are more assessable for some conditional distributions than others, the conditional probability distributions are seldom assessed in the chronological order of the event tree. In the BTRA of 2006, however, probability assessment for each event in the tree was done by requiring a chronological ordering of events, using assumptions about dependence on so me of the previous events. Some events of the BTRA of 2006 represent deliberate decisions made by a terrorist, but such events are modeled as random events. Ot her events represent defensive choices, but these, too, are modeled as random events. The BTRA of 2006 does not properly model intelligent adversaries. Its probability assessment of terro rist decisions is independent of the potential consequences of the attack. As the attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) clearly illustrated, terrorists adapt their means and select targets that have a high probability of attaining the consequences that they hope to achieve. Consideration of terrorist objectives introduces something entirely new to the BTRA, implying a decision theoretic or game-theoretic pe rspective (Golany et al., 2007). Both decision 7-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In attacker-defender models and other game- theory applications, a rough symmetry between attacker and defender is assumed; that is, what the defender seeks to minimize, th e attacker seeks to maximize. This is supported by evidence that al-Qaeda wants to maximize any damage that the United States would rather minimize (e.g., see the captured \"Al Qaeda Training Manual,\" [FAS, 2007]), so if the key U.S. consequence for risk in the BTRA is expected fatalities, then for al-Qaeda it is the first choice to maximize (but other terrorists may have different priorities). No te that if the terrorist uses some other objective but the defender still favors minimizing fatalities, this improves the results for the defender. The overly complex consequence models used by the BTRA of 2006 to assess fatalities at terminal events are another weakness (Chapter 6). For example, the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model used to est imate the size of a smallpox epidemic started by a single infected individual accounts for every possible disease-transmission pathway. Because of the large uncertainties throughout the model and the uncertainties in the parameters that describe smallpox transmission, the detail a nd precision reported by this embellishment are illusory. SEVERAL METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR IMPROVED MODELING OF INTELLIGENT ADVERSARIES Ultimately, the defending of the United States from terrorist attack boils down to choices of investment to prevent, protect against, r espond to, and recover from terrorist attacks. The committee has suggested improvements that, if used to simplify, clarify, streamline, and improve the BTRA, would yield more realism, more accuracy, more transparency, and faster computation; additionally the rankings of bioagents by risk woul d be more credible than those now produced. The BTRA might then be useful to decision makers for purposes of risk management as well as risk assessment and, most important, for exploring homeland security strategic investment choices. In an earlier recommendation\u2014see Chapter 3, the subsection entitled \"The Approach to Determining the Probabilities of Terrorist Decisions Is Incomplete\"\u2014the committee advises DHS to model terrorists as intelligent adversaries. Here the committee reinforces that crucial recommendation and provides alternatives for its accomplishment. Recommendation: In addition to using event trees, DHS should explore alternative models of terrorists as intelligent adversaries who seek to maximize the achievement of their objectives. The committee does not underestimate the difficulty in producing a dependable and reliable bioterrorism risk analysis that responds to its 13 recommendations. Three appendixes, D, E, and F, in this report present modeling appro aches that can be used with the existing BTRA structure to improve the risk analysis. Table 7.1 evaluates these approaches against the 13 recommendations. None of these approaches alone ma y be an adequate and complete solution to the problem, and any implementation may present unforeseen difficulties. However, the committee believes that a suitable combination of these approaches, and possibly others, is feasible and will yield a risk analysis that sa tisfies the demands that this committee sees as necessary. 7-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

But, for instance, although Top Officials 3 (TOPOFF 3) was the most comprehensive terrorism res ponse exercise ever conducted in the United States,1 it was an exercise in blue (defender) response to a ttacks scripted in advance. Red teaming can be used for the enhancement of such exercises and for analysis. Red teaming (i.e., terrorist role playing) is a robust and well-understood anal ysis technique for assessing adversarial risk in complex, dynamic environments. However, red teaming only reveals vulnerabilities and does not directly support decisions about investment trade-offs among different kinds of defenses. In red-teaming exercises, people are assigned to play the roles of terrorists. It is essential that the adversary's point of view is pursued when considering adversary actions and reactions. The red team must be immersed in enemy culture , tactics, and beliefs. There may also be an opposing blue team playing the roles of defenders. Each of the adversaries has certain resources, certain information, and certain goals. They pl ay out their scenarios, and results can show how bounded human intelligence, nonstanda rd thinking, and group dynami cs may affect the kinds of attacks that are attempted and the kinds of defen ses that are successful. By trying to win the encounter for the adversary, the terrorist (or red) team helps to better elucidate defender responses for each adversary course of action. In principle, red-teaming exercises can beco me large and complex, depending on the number of different roles, the degree to which the scenario is unstructured, and the number of independent replications that are completed to assess variability in outcome. Nonetheless, this is a relatively inexpensive way for decision makers to learn what they have overlooked about their opponents. Homeland Security Presidential Dir ective 10 (The White House, 2004) cites red teaming as a technique for better understanding potential enemy actions, and the committee suggests red teaming to DHS as a useful validation test for scenarios favored by the BTRA. Red teaming is just as applicable in improving risk analyses based on decision trees, optimization, and game theory (Reichart, 1998). Decision Trees Can Model Bioterrorist Threats In addition to having event nodes whose random outcomes are determined by a probability distribution, a decision tree has decision nodes, whose outcomes are chosen to maximize (or minimize in the case of the defender) the expected consequence from that node forward. The BTRA event tree could be converted to a \"bioterro rist decision tree\" with four important changes: Convert each node representing a terrorist decision into an expected-damage maximizing decision node, Assess probabilities of outcomes of random events, rather than probability distributions of outcomes, Eliminate nodes representing frequency of attack and potential for multiple attacks, and Employ a simple, random-consequence model at each event node in the last stage of the tree. 1 Information on TOPOFF exercises is available at www.dhs.gov/xprepresp/programs/editorial_0896.shtm .

Appendix D presents two figures, Figure D. 1 showing the modeling choices made by DHS and Figure D.2 showing alternatives that coul d be used by the BDM. Using these alternate choices, the Bioterrorist Decision Model can be relatively quickly implemented for bioterrorism risk assessment and risk management because it uses existing techniques (Parnell, 2008), it is a direct modification of the 2006 BTRA event tree, and it uses commercially available, off-the-shelf software. Much of the work done by DHS on segmenting the bioterrorism attack for modeling and on probabilit y assessment and consequence modeli ng for the BTRA of 2008 can be retained. The framework represented by the BDM has the potential to resolve all of the major deficiencies that have been identified in the curre nt BTRA. This is a model from the terrorist's point of view. Because U.S. actions and random events are uncertain to the terrorist, these are modeled as events in the decision tree, but terro rist decisions are modeled as decision nodes. Huge BTRA data demands are mitigated by deleting the two most problematic stages (frequency of attack and multiple attacks) and by using proba bilities rather than probability distributions for each outcome of each event. The model improves transparency by using commercially available software with extensive graphic visualization and with built-in features to perform sensitivity analyses. Finally, the model can be modified for use in risk management. After risk management decisions are implemented and the probabilities of the random events are changed conditional on these decisions, BDM can be rerun for recalibration. Attacker-Defender Optimization Can Unify Risk Management, Risk Assessment, and Resource Allocation Terrorists cannot afford to invest in developing attacks using every major pathogen. Nor can the United States afford every possible defen se. Decision makers on both sides have limited resources and seek to optimize their \"payoff\" subjec t to these constraints. Appendix E offers an optimization model that unifies risk management, risk assessment, and resource allocation in what is called a \"tri-level, defender-attacker-defe nder\" optimization. After 9/11, U.S. law was changed to allow the U.S. Department of De fense to devote resources to defending the United States within its borders, and the authors of Appendix E 2 were asked to convert military \"attacker-defender\" models in which the United States is the attacker, to \"defender-attacker\" models in which the United States defends its cr itical infrastructure from attacks. They have developed more than a hundred such prototypical applications since then, presenting a new one in Appendix E crafted to the exact needs of DHS for bioterrorism. The three decision stages are these: 1. DHS commits strategic defense investments, chosen from alternate program portfolios each consisting of a compatible set of defense options, to minimize the maximum expected damage from any attack; these investment are of such magnitude that they are necessarily visible to the attacker; 2. The attacker, after observing these defense investments, chooses attack alternative(s) to maximize expected damage; and 3. The defender mitigates damage from the att ack(s) with resources already in place as a result of prior strategic investments. 2 Gerald G. Brown, W. Matthew Carlyle, and R.

Using the hypothetical scenario from Chapter 1, one defense option might be to procure 100 million doses of anthrax protective antigen (P A) vaccine, and another to purchase the same number of doses of Russian (STI) live vaccine (s ee Chapter 5). No defense strategy would include both of these defense options. One attack alternative would be the anthrax attack hypothesized in Chapter 1. Mitigation efforts af ter this attack would include distributing and using a vaccine, but only if such vaccine has already been put in place by a defense strategy. This is a very conservative model for th e defender because the defender must protect against the worst possible set of attacks. But that is what good management does. Denote the defense strategy d , the attack alternative a, and the mitigation effort m. A key input is , the expected damage if defense strategy d has been followed and terrorist attack alternative a is chosen. This is a BTRA output from its suite of consequence models. Denote another input as , and suppose that if defense strategy d has been followed and terrorist attack alternative a has been chosen, then mitigation effort m (enabled by d) is put in full force, and the expected damage is reduced by this amount. ,dadamage ,,dammitigate Constraints on capital budget for defensive optio ns in any affordable defense strategy govern defender decisions, as do any synergistic or antagonistic interactions among defense options in any defense strategy portfolio that together dictate what results, and any other technological or resource limit on the defende r. Similarly, limits on terrorist capital and technology are incorporated directly into the attacker model as conventional optimization constraints. These data are precisely the same as tho se that the BTRA now presents to subject- matter experts to elicit their opinions on event probabilities. Here, exactly one defense strategy is chosen, with its defensive option portfolio, but te rrorists are allowed to mount fractional attack alternatives, and mitigation efforts may be allocat ed fractionally within resource limits put in place by a defense strategy. The result is that probabilities emerge as outputs from the optimization, that is, as recommended optimal mi xed strategies, rather than posing required, subjective inputs from subject-matter experts. ,dadamage Appendix E presents a simple illustrative exampl e in detail sufficient for any reader with adequate off-the-shelf modeling and optimization software to re peat the exercise. Appendix E also establishes two key theoretical results that permit the full, 18-stage BTRA model to be solved as a tri-level one. Noting that the first (d efense strategy) stage is a linear integer program, because choice of strategy is necessarily binary, but that all subsequent stages feature continuous (i.e., perhaps fractional) decisions, mimicking the BTRA of 2006: Result 1: Any sequence of contiguous continu ous stages of defender decisions, or of attacker decisions, can be colla psed into a single stage; and Result 2: The order of continuous attacker stages, or continuous defender stages, makes no difference to the optimization, so with no loss in generality all continuous attacker stages from the BTRA can be aggregated into a single, second-stage attacker model, and all continuous defender stages can follow in the third stage. Beyond this, Appendix E shows how to solve this tri-level optimization model at large scale with conventional methods and off-the-shelf software; that is, there is little need for aggregation or sacrifice of essential fidelity to render a smaller model more amenable to solution. Further insights arise from these models. Fo r instance, as the nation spends more and more money on better and better defe nses, terrorists are forced to optimally spread their efforts 7-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION among more and more attack alternatives, a nd the United States responds with increasingly diverse mitigation efforts. This dilution of terro rist effort may bring collateral advantage to the defender and afford more and better opportunities fo r detection and interdiction. (E.g., terrorists, even those committed to suicide att acks, fear capture more than death, so the defenders want to increase the apparent risk of detection, interdiction, and capture.) These models also lend insight into the utility of secrecy and deception. Although strategic defense investments are assumed to be so large that they cannot effectively be hidden (the committee notes without irony that some curre nt DHS efforts can be profiled quickly on the World Wide Web and in the press, and in more detail via open academic literature), the resulting mitigation capabilities are another thing. If the United States knows how well it can mitigate but the terrorist does not, the United States can use this to its advantage. Some such insights are trivial to observe, while others may take additi onal analysis with optimization. For instance, suppose that (i.e., unmitigated risk) is ordered from worst (largest) to best. That is, an ordinal set of ( d,a) pairs is created. If the best (largest) mitigation effort for each ( d,a) pair would not change this ordering, then there is little sense in taking extraordinary efforts to secret this. Conversely, substantive mitigation abilities th at would change this risk ordering are worth keeping secret. See Appendix E for more suggestions about secrecy and insights on deception. ,dadamage The optimization introduced by Appendix E bears many resemblances to game theory\u2014 in particular, to alternating-play, extensive -form games\u2014and there are deep connections not pursued here. Suffice it to say that the op timization proposed accommodates highly detailed technological constraints and resource limits on the opponents (to the extent that they are known), and the solution method offered is completely ne w and can actually solve these problems at large scale. Game Theory Models Can Help with Risk Management Appendix F describes an analysis that combines game theory and statistical risk analysis in the context of a counterbioterrorism example. It is similar to the approach taken in Appendix E, which uses a linear program to solve the underl ying game-theory decision making. The main difference is that the method in Appendix F generates many random payoff matrices for the game-theory problem and estimates the proportion of times that a given decision is optimal, as opposed to solving a single game that uses the expected values of the risk distributions as the entries in the payoff matrix. This has the advantage of not overlooking threats that are nearly equal in terms of expected risk, and it provides managers with a comparative view of different defense options. (Appendix F does not address the resource allocation issue treated in Appendix E, but the optimization developed in Appendi x E could be transferred to Appendix F.) More generally, game theory is useful fo r analyzing the dynamics between terrorist activity and the reactions of defenders when ther e are interdependencies and weak links in the system. The key point in this model of interdependent security is that the incentive which an agent has to invest in risk reduction measures de pends on how that agent expects the other agents to invest in security. The agent may change the incentive to invest, or not to invest, depending on the investment of others in security. Consequen tly, there can be a perverse equilibrium in which no one invests in protection, even though all would be better off if they had incurred this cost. This situation does not have the structure of a prisoner's dilemma game, although it has some similarities (Heal and Kunreuther, 2006). A ppendix H develops a more formal model of interdependencies for a two-person game and illust rates situations in which there can be two equilibria\u2014both individuals invest or neither of them takes protective action. To illustrate in the context of a real-world event, consider the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. In Malta, terrorists checked a bag containing a bomb on Malta Airlines, 7-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION which had minimal security procedures. The bag was transferred in Frankfurt, Germany, to a Pan American feeder line and then loaded onto Pan Am Flight 103 in London's Heathrow Airport. The transferred piece of luggage was not inspected at either Frankfurt or London, the assumption in each airport being that it was inspected at the point of origin. The bomb was designed to explode above 28,000 feet, a height normally first attained on this route over the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, failures in a peripheral part of the airlin e network, Malta, compromised the security of a flight leaving from a core hub, London. Terrorists may follow similar behavior with respect to a bioterrorist attack by finding a weak link in the system that could have severe direct and indirect consequences to a much wider population. The behavior of terrorists is also affected by what their adversaries will do. More specifically, terrorists may respond to security measures by shifting their attention to more vulnerable targets. Keohane and Zeckhauser ( 2003), Sandler (2005), and Bier et al. (2007) analyze the relationships between the actions of po tential victims and the behavior of terrorists. Symmetrically, rather than investing in additional security measures, firms may prefer to move their operations from large cities to less populated ar eas to reduce the likelihood of an attack. Of course, terrorists may then choose these less protect ed regions as targets if there is heightened security in the urban areas. Terrorists also may ch ange the nature of their attacks if there are protective measures in place that would make th e probability of success of the original option much lower than another course of action (e.g., switching from hijacking to bombing a plane). The impact of endogenous probabilities on the nature of the game-theoretic equilibrium is discussed more fully in Appendix H and in Heal and Kunreuther (2006). Risk Management Strategies The three models considered here all treat adversaries as intelligent adversaries that seek to maximize their objectives. Some of the implications are that distributed networks of protection, across different agencies or airlines or firms, may not lead to solutions that are as good as can be obtained with leadership and central direction. For example, if different defender agents ar e reluctant to adopt protective measures to reduce the chances of losses from terrorism due to the possibility of contamination from weak links in the system, there may be a role for the pr ivate and public sectors to play in addressing this problem. A trade association can play a coordinatin g role by stipulating that any member must follow certain rules and regulations, including th e adoption of security measures. For example, the National Association of Chemical Distri butors has developed a code of responsible distribution, mandated third-party auditing of code compliance, and actually terminated membership for noncompliance. Other chemical-in frastructure industry organizations such as the American Chemistry Council, Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, American Petroleum Institute, and National Pe trochemical and Refiners Association can also play key roles in this regard. There may also be a role for governmental st andards and regulations coupled with third- party inspections and insurance to enforce th ese measures. More specifically, third-party inspections coupled with insurance protection can encourage decentralized units in the supply chain to reduce their risks from accidents and di sasters. Such a management-based regulatory strategy shifts the focus of decision making from the regulator to individual units that are now required to do their own planning to meet a set of standards or regulations. The combination of third-party inspections in conjunction with private insurance is a powerful combination of two market mechanisms that can convince many units of the advantages of implementing security measures to make their operations more secure. As a result of these units taking action, the remaining ones can be encouraged to comply w ith the regulations to avoid being caught and 7-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This is a form of tipping behavior noted in Appendix H. In other words, without some type of inspection, low-risk units that have adopted risk-reducing measures cannot credibly distinguish themselves from the high-risk ones. With the delegation of part of the insp ection process to the private sector through insurance companies and certified third-party inspectors, a channel would exist through which the low-risk units could speak for themselves. If a unit chose not to be inspected by certified third parties, it would more likely be perceived as high -risk rather than low-risk. If a unit did get inspected and received a seal of approval that it was protecting itself against catastrophic vulnerabilities, the unit would pay a lower insurance premium than that of a unit not undertaking these actions. In this way, the number of audits needed would be reduced because units that had received seals of approval from private third-party inspectors would already be known. As observed in the safety arena with the Na tional Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and in the security arena with the 9/11 Commission, an effective system will also i ndependently and publicly investigate when catastrophic failures occur. Investigations exam ine the root and contributing causes, including the sufficiency of policies, practices, and oversi ght in the private and public domains. Such future investigations could possibly incorporate a \"testing\" of the model, or at a minimum provide data about interdependent security. THE EXISTING BTRA FRAMEWORK SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE RISK ANALYSIS OF BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, OR RADIOACTIVE THREATS National decision makers and DHS leaders w ill need to allocate scarce resources to prevent, prepare for, and respond to all types of terrorist attacks. Clearly there is a wide variety of potential terrorist attack alterna tives (conventional, biological, chemical, and radioactive3). Each of these attack alternatives h as different attack signatures, detection technologies, and mitigation options. While biologi cal agents can, perhaps, be usefully compared (e.g., by considering whether to invest in vaccin es for some specific agent rather than others), there is no analogous comparison for nonbiological agents. For nonbiological agents, the defense of particular locations or facilities against a ttack and the preparation of mitigation resources should such an attack occur assume a more important role than in the case of biological attack, in which the biological agent used is a primary cons ideration. In principle, the committee believes that the most simple, meaningful, and useful way to compare biological agents (e.g., anthrax) to chemical agents (e.g., chlorine) and radioactive threats (e.g., a dirty bomb) is by comparison of the potential consequences given a terrorist attack an d, when possible, the likelihood of an attack. However, throughout this report the committee has noted many weaknesses in risk analysis, modeling of intelligent agents, con sequence assessment, and presentation of assessment results that it believes make the BTRA of 2006 problematic even for assessing biological agents, let alone other classes of threats. Because of these weaknesses, the rankings produced by the BTRA of 2006 are likely to be biased or skew ed by a magnitude that cannot be assessed. Conventional peer review, or periodic reviews by an independent, senior technical advisory panel would almost surely have revealed these BTRA problems earlier. The committee believes that outside oversight will be crucial to correcting these deficiencies. 3 The committee uses the term \"radioactive\" to include both \"radiological\" (i.e., involving radioactive decay such as in a dirty bomb) and \"nuclear\" (i.e., involving complete fission as in an atomic bomb). Although these two threats are not identical, th e committee believes that its recommendations and suggestions concerning the BTRA methodology used to evaluate the risk of these threats apply to either. 7-8 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Recommendation: The BTRA should not be used as a basis for decision making until the deficiencies noted in this report have been addressed and corrected. DHS should engage an independent, senior technical advisory panel to oversee this task. In its current form, the BTRA should not be used to assess the risk of biological, chemical, or radioactive threats. INTELLIGENT-ADVERSARY RISK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED ON RADIOACTIVE AND CHEMICAL THREAT S AS WELL AS ON BIOLOGICAL THREATS Although the committee has recommended that in its present form the BTRA of 2006 and 2008 not be extended to radioactive and chemical risk, it believes that the intelligent-adversary modeling improvements recommended in this report can be applied. Risk management strategies to protect the U.S. chemical infrastructure ar e discussed in detail in the National Research Council report Terrorism and the Chemical Infrastr ucture: Protecting People and Reducing Vulnerabilities (NRC, 2006). Models for anticipating th e actions of intelligent adversaries and for optimizing the allocation of defensive res ources can be extended across these areas because all involve similar problems of warning, respon se, and recovery, and the consequences can be measured in the same consequence units, for example, fatalities. The models suggested here can be applied using risk assessment methods devel oped specifically for radioactive and chemical risks. Probabilities and consequences in the hypoth etical biological scenario used in this report with the probabilities and consequences in radi oactive and chemical scenarios can then be compared. These models can then be used to assess the risk reduction (reduction in probability and/or reduction in consequences) for the resources required for risk management options. Risk management options can then be compared by comparing probability and consequence reduction in each of the three threat areas\u2014biological, chemical, and radioactive. Many risk management alternatives (e.g., vaccines for bioagents, radia tion sensors for nuclear threats, and chemical sensors for chemical threats) will only affect the primary threat area. In some cases\u2014for example, recovery options and communication systems\u2014risk management options may result in consequence reductions in all threat areas. In other cases, risk management options may only result in the adversary's shifting or modifying the attack to achieve the same or similar consequences. Achieving this integrated risk assessment a nd risk management capability is critical in order for risk-informed decisions to achieve this nation's national security objectives of reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction.

Without a clear and consistent use of language in this technical aren a, there will be a tendency for conclusions to be misinterpreted and for policy recommendations based on these conclusions to be misguided. Because many of the terms in this lexicon (Tab le A.1) are found in everyday usage, often with implications or meanings different from those presented here, it was suggested that the committee also include \"lay definitions\" in or der to provide a comparison and to help in interpreting various loosely written documents a nd statements made available to the committee (and the public). However, the committee has intentionally not done this, in order to avoid giving credence to analyses that might be flawed by im proper use or interpretation of various technical terms. The committee recommends that any governmental agency issuing a report on or engaging in a discussion of risk analysis consider using terms as defined in this lexicon, or establish from the beginning reasons fo r using alternative definitions. ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT There is an unfortunate (but readily dealt with) inconsistency in usage between two communities importantly involved in understandi ng the risk of terrorist events: intelligence analysts and risk analysts. In the intelligence community it is customar y first to gather information about an opponent's intentions and ca pabilities and then to use this information to present a statement of the current situation. The fi rst step is usually called \"analysis\" (indeed, employees assigned to information gathering are called intelligence analysts), and the second step is called an \"assessment\" of the situation. The risk and decision community reverses these definitions: the first step of gathering information (in particular, obtaining information about the uncertainty of events and their possible consequences) is usually called \"assessment,\" while the second step\u2014the process of using this information and combin ing it in such a way that a decision maker can make better decisions\u2014is usually called \"analysis.\" For this reason, in the lexicon the committee has taken pains to break out the various components of \"risk analysis\" as used in its report. ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION S FOR \"RELATIVE RISK\" A-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION The term \"relative risk\" has a well-accepte d definition in the biomedical community: \"The risk of harm among a population exposed to a potentially damaging substance, compared to the risk amongst an unexposed population.\"1 The term may also be used to describe the ratio: {cumulative incidence rate in the exposed po pulation}/{cumulative incidence rate in the unexposed population}. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has chosen to use the term for a completely different c oncept. In particular, \"relative risk\" for a particular agent is determined as follows:2 For each agent i an expected consequence E(C i) is calculated (by Monte Carlo simulation), Probability pi is assigned to the event {agent i will be used}, An overall \"total\" expected consequence (or \"risk\") is computed R = piE(C i), The relative risk for agent i is Ri = piE(C i)/R. That is, \"relative risk\" is the proportion of the to tal expected risk contributed by a particular agent. Since this definition is quite different from that used by the biomedical community, it presents a major source of potential confusion and misinterpretation, particularly among readers who are knowledgeable in epidemiology. COMMENTS ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF THE LEXICON Since the committee's primary objective is to provide consistency among the various terms, the terms are cross-referenced as need ed. Column 1 provides synonyms and cross- references for the terms defined. It also gives quoted definitions from the DHS document entitled \"A Lexicon of Risk Terminology and Methodological Description of the DHS Bioterrorism Risk Assessment\" (DHS,2007) References are given in footnotes to the tabl e. Rather than using highly theoretical sources, the committee chose to rely on widely accepted introductory or basic texts 3 or more contemporary but focused re ferences (e.g., Meyer and Booker4). Where appropriate, selected Web sites from well-regarded sources have also been used. However, the committee has intentionally a voided the use of glossaries and lexicons readily available on the World Wide Web but developed for promoting commercial software packages, consulting services, and su ch.

The main portion of the lexicon (Part A.1.A), although developed for biological risks, can also be appropriately applied to nonbiological (chemical, radioactive, agricultural, and other) threats. The second part of the lexicon (Part A.1.B), specifically, the terms used in susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered ( SEIR) modeling, applies only to biological risk analysis. Although the committee recognizes the long philo sophical history of the controversy surrounding the nature of uncertainty, it takes the position that, for the purposes of policy development and decision making (the eventual goal of DHS's risk analysis), all uncertainty (subjective, frequency-derived, and so on) must eventually be encoded into probabilities. The entry \"[None]\" in second column, \"Committee's Recommended Definition,\" indicates a conclusion by the committee that it is not necessary (or it is potentially confusing) to provide a definition. Ind eed, the committee recommends that such terms not be used in any formal discussion of met hods, results, and so on, unless they are used as exemplars of what not to say. Due to the (committee) process by which the lexicon was developed, it may not include terms that some readers might find importa nt; further, choices among alternative accepted definitions were made where necessary.

The sum of n numbers divided by n. e,f,g The average is a simple arithmetic operation, requiring a set of n numbers. It is often confused with the mean (or expected value), which is a property of a proba bility distribution. One reason for this confusion is that the average of a set of realizations of a random variable is often a good estimator of the mean of the random variable's distribution. conditional expected risk See also agent-conditional expected risk. Expected risk computed using conditional probabilities. The conditioning event is typically the choice of agent; however, it could be other events such as good weather, successful manufacture, or ineffective countermeasures. conditional probability See also probability. The probability of an event supposing (i.e., \"conditioned upon\") the occurrence of other specified events. In the aleatory theory of probability, the conditional probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of the joint occurrence of events A and B divided by the probability of event B, if the probability of event B is not zero . (After Feller [1968], g DeFinetti [1974],h and Lindley [1965].i) It is important to note that subjectively assessed probabilities are based on the state of knowledge that holds at the time of the probability assessment. conditional relative risk The proportion of the total expected risk contributed by a particular conditioning event.

Risk computed using conditional probabilities (follows from the definition of conditional probability). The expected risk associated with a particular agent, as measured by the expected number of deaths, may be conditioned upon (for exam ple) the direction of the wind. confidence interval See also uncertainty range. A range of values [ a,b] determined from a sample, using a predetermined rule chosen such that, in repeated random samples from the same population, the fraction of computed ranges will include the true value of an unknown parameter. The values a and b are called confidence limits; is called the confidence coefficient (commonly chosen to be .95 or .99); and 1- is called the confidence level. (Adapted from SRA. b) Confidence intervals should not be interpreted as implying that the parameter itself has a range of values; it has only one value. The confidence limits a and b, being computed from a sample, are random variables, the values of which (for a particular sample) either do or do not include the true value a of the parameter. However, in repeated samples, a certain fraction of these intervals will include the parameter, provided that the actual population satisfies the initial hypothesis. consequence Synonym: outcome A description of a scenario, in terms of measurable factors, that decision makers may consider in assessing preferences over different scenarios; these factors are often random variables. (Adapted from McCormick [1981], j with \"damage\" replaced by consequences.\") For DHS risk analyses, typical and important consequence measures are lives lost, morbidities, direct and indirect dollar losses, and others. continuous random variable See also cumulative distribution function, probability density function. A random variable that has an absolutely continuous cumulative distribution function. i,e cost-benefit analysis \"A formal quantitative procedure comparing costs and benefits of a proposed act or policy.\" b SRA also includes in its definition: \"To determine a rank ordering of projects to maximize rate of return A-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A better procedure is to plot the costs and benefits associated with each possible decision and then to present the results to decision makers to assess the trade-offs, which may (or may not) result in the linear or multiplicative functions inherent in the cost-benefit computations. cumulative distribution function (CDF) Synonyms: cumulative distribution, distribution function See also probability distribution, probability density function, probability mass function. The function f(x) whose value is the probability that a random variable, X, will be less than or equal to a value x; written as P{X x}. e,g,k The cumulative distribution function always exists for any random variable; it is monotonic and nondecreasing in x, and (being a probability) 0 P{X x} 1. If P { X x } is absolutely continuous in x, then X is called a \"continuous\" random variable; if it is discontinuous at a finite or countably infinite number of values of x, and constant otherwise, X is called a \"discrete\" random variable. decision tree See also event tree, fault-tree analysis. A tree with event nodes that are random variables or decision nodes that represent decisions of an active agent. Each branch (path of event and decision nodes leading to a terminal node) may have consequences (e.g., in dollars, lives, utility) associated with its terminal node. The operations used in a d ecision tree are elementary: expectation over consequences at event nodes and maximization (or minimization) at decision nodes.

Lexicon: \"arising from limited state of knowledge\" a \"A representation of uncertainty about propositions due to in complete knowledge. Such propositions may be about either past or future events.\"c Some examples of epistemic probability are (1) the assigning of a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true; (2) determination of the probability that a terrorist will use a particular agent, based on evidence presented. estimation (of parameters in probability models) Also see approximation. \"A procedure by which sample data are used to assess the value of an unknown quantity.\" f Estimation procedures are usually based on statistical analyses that address their efficiency, effectiveness, limiting behaviors, degrees of bias, etc. The most common methods of parameter estimation are maximum likelihood and the method of moments.

Each node is followed by the possible random variable realizations, called outcomes, and their probability distributions conditional on outcomes of previous random variables in the tree. The outcomes are represented as arcs leading from one event to the next. The joint probability of the intersection of events that constitute a sequence (or scenario) is found by multiplication.

(Adapted from McCormick [1981] j with \"damage\" replaced by \"consequence.\") The committee strongly recommends that, wherever possible, the term \"expected risk\" be replaced by the specific measure of consequences, such as \"expected deaths,\" \"expected loss of income,\" \"expected illnesses.\" If these measures are combined in some functional way, for example via a utility function, then \"expected risk\" should be replaced by \"expected utility.\" One difficulty with defining \"expected risk\" is the historical reality that the discipline of probabilistic risk assess ment arose from an understanding of the risks associated with nuclear reactors, chemical plants, and such. In these situations, expected risk is defined to be [expected frequency of occurrence of an event] times [expected consequences of that event]. expected value Synonym: expectation See also mean. The first moment of the probability distribution of a random variable X; often denoted as E(X) and defined as x i p(xi) if X is a discrete random variable and x f(x)dx if X is a continuous random variable.g,e The arithmetic average of random samples taken from the distribution converges to the mean for all sufficiently large sample sizes, under certain conditions. Ironically, in many cases the expected value of a random variable is a numerical value that the random variable can never take on . For example, if a random variable X has P {X = 0} = .5 and P {X = 100} = .5, then E(X ) = 50, even though X can only take on values of 0 or 100. There is also a common confusion between expected value and average, due to the fact that, in the limit, as the sample size becomes very large, the average of a set of observations of a random variable will approach the mean of the random variable's probability A-10 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Brown, Ph.D. Distinguished Professor of Operations Research Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California An event tree can be defined as a directed -out-tree (i.e., a connected di-graph that contains no cycle with exactly one, distinguished , root node with in-degree 0, and every other node with in-degree 1).1 Each node represents some event, and each directed out-arc represents a randomly-chosen outcome that selects a successor even t node. Every directed path in this tree starts with the root node, and ends at a node w ith out-degree zero (a leaf node). Each directed path from the root node to a leaf node in the event tree represents a possible sequence of alternating events and outcomes (i.e., a scenario). Figure B.1 defines the Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) event tree mathematically, and shows how to solve for all path probabilities. This event tree is a restriction of a completely general one: This tree consists of successive stages, or echelons of events, with each stage restricted to offer the same branch opportunities. Figure B.2 defines the BTRA risk analysis mathematically . If we attach a set of mutually-exclusive, exhaustive probabilities to the arcs branching out of each node, we can trace each directed path in the event tree and reckon its joint probability of selection by multiplying the successive arc selection probabilities on the path. Note that we need not assume independence among successive probabilities, and can in fact condition each arc probability on all prior outcomes in its path. If we associate a consequence (i.e., a measured outcome) with each end state node, we can assess the total expected con sequence of each path by multiplying this consequence by its path probability. We can also generalize to a distribution of consequences for each end state node, and accumulate an expected distribution of consequences. Many of the scenario paths terminate earl y (e.g., due to interdiction), so the actual number of paths terminating with non-zero consequences is in the thousands, rather than billions. The distributions of consequences for all scenar ios (paths) share the same \"bin structure\" (discrete intervals), and random sampling of paths can be used to induce a random sampling of consequence distribution. From this expected consequence distribution, we can estimate, for instance, the 5th and 95th percentiles. 1E.g., R. Ahuja, T. Magnanti, and J.

In particular, we consider: the addition of an 18th stage to represent distributions of alternate consequences; and replacing distributions of arc probabilities by expected values of the probabilities. We work from the event tree in Figure C.1. For simplicity, we assume a single initiating event. For concreteness, we assign uncertainty distributions to each of the arc probabilities: P A1 ~ Beta(2,2); P T1 ~ Beta(4,1); and P T2 ~ Beta(3,2). In addition, we also know the distributional form of each consequence distribution. Using the notation c(x|s1) to denote the consequence distribution associated with the first arc, we assign the following distributions to consequences: c(x|s1) ~ Gamma(8000,2); Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The line with circles is the estimate from the methodology employed in the BTRA of 200 6, which can also produce risk curves.

The line with crosses is calculated assuming a parametric (or tabular) form is known for the consequence distributions and requires no simulation. Notice the good agreement between the four estimates. For an event tree as complex as the one pr esented in the BTRA, this approach is infeasible. As we understand it, the approach implemented in the BTRA is as follows: Draw 500 samples from each arc probability; Calculate 500 sets of scenario probabilities; Draw 1000 samples from each consequence distribution; Represent each consequence distribution as a histogram; For each of the 500 sets of scenario probabiliti es, calculate a weighted average of the mass in each bin of the histogram, and call this one \"sampled risk curve\"; Calculate the average over all 500 risk curves.

Parnell, Ph.D. Professor, Department of Systems Engineering United States Military Acad emy, West Point, New York INTRODUCTION The foundational risk analysis method used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) methodology is event trees. Event trees are a proven probabilistic risk analysis technique that h as been effectively used for risk analysis of natural and man-made hazards (D illon-Merrill, Parnell, and Buck shaw, 2007). The body of this report has shown weaknesses in the use of event trees to model terrorist actions since event trees do not model the actions of an intelligent adversary. To address these concerns, we convert the DHS bioterrorist event tree to a bioterrorist decision tree by changing terrorist decisions to decision nodes, removing two nodes that are problematic and unnecessary, dramatically reduc ing the complexity by assessing probabilities for each arc for each event instead of probability di stributions for each arc for each event. In addition, we describe several alternatives fo r consequence modeling including separate and aggregated consequences. MANY BTRA MODELING ALTERNATIVES EXIST Several risk analysis modeling decisions must be made to provide effective and efficient risk analyses that support national homeland security decision-makers. Figure D.1 is a strategy generation table (Parnell, Driscoll, and Hende rson, 2008) used to identify possible modeling decisions. The column titles of Figure D.1 id entify some of the most important modeling decisions. The analysis responsiveness (model run time) determines the flexibility of the model and the usefulness to support risk assessment and risk management decision making. The model's transparency increases the understanding and credibility of the model to stakeholders and decision makers. The assumed time period significantly impacts the data collection. The longer the time period, the more challenging it will be to provide credible data assessments. The next three columns (terrorist decisions, U.S. decisi ons, and uncertain events) are the decisions and events that must be modeled. The types of consequences are major modeling decisions since models will need to be developed for each type of consequence. Finally, the consequences can be modeled individually or combined . Combining enables an integrated assessment but takes more modeling and analysis to credibly combine the consequences. D-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION The columns below the modeling decisions id entify several possible techniques for each modeling decision. For example, analysis responsiveness can be real-time, hours, days, weeks, or months. Years are possible but probably not very us eful. Using the strategy generation table, we can shade one (or more) box(es) in each column to describe or develop a BTRA modeling alternative. Figure D.1 describes the BTRA of 2006 and Figure D.2 describes the Bioterrorist Decision Model developed in this appendix. The shading in Figure D.1 shows the committee's understanding of the 2006 BTRA modeling. Battelle developed its own software instead of usually commercially available software to perform the event tree analysis. Due to the complexity, the BTRA model runs in days and requires special software and specially trained analysts to perform the analysis. Some sensitivity analysis capability has been devel oped and performed. The BTRA model is not transparent. The model is very complex and uses a mixture of best available existing models and new, unvalidated models. The first event in the BTRA event tree is the frequency of attacks. This approach requires specification of a time peri od and the prediction of the number of attacks with each agent. BTRA event tree models terro rist decisions, U.S. decisions, and uncertain events as probabilities. The methodology greatly increases its complexity and data requirements by assessing probability distributions on each branch of the event tree. The primary consequence modeling was on mortality but some modeling of morbidity and economics was done. The consequences were analyzed individually and not combined. USING DECISION ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE THE TERRORIST'S ATTACK DECISION Based on the committee's assessment, severa l improvements are needed. First and foremost, the methodology must consider the terro rist as an intelligent adversary that will select the best attack strategy to maximize their strategic objectives. Second, the methodology must be transparent. A key goal should be the use of co mmercially available software that has built-in sensitivity analysis features to improve understa nding and transparency. The method should eliminate unnecessary complexity and demands fo r data that will have no meaning if one bioterrorism attack is made on the United States, e.g., the attack frequency for each agent. Finally, the methodology should be easily modified to support the analysis of risk management alternatives. Decision analysis offers the potential to make many of the improvements we have discussed. Decision analysis is closely related to probabilistic risk analysis (Pat\u00e9-Cornell and Dillon, 2006). Single objective decision analysis with decision trees has been used since 1968 (Raiffa, 1968; Clemen, 1996). Multiple objective d ecision analysis has been used since 1976 (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976; Kirkwood, 1997). Maxw ell (2006) summarizes the large selection of commercially available decision and risk analysis software.

Si nce they are uncertain to the terrorists, U.S. decisions (e.g., interdiction) and uncertain events (e.g., detection) would be modeled using probability distributions. Any of the consequences that have cred ible models could be used. Decision trees can be used to find the terrorist strategy (a sequential set of decisions) that maximizes the terrorist objectives by averaging out and rolling back the decision tree. The decision tree can be solved multiple times for each single objective or can be solved once with combined consequences (Parnell, 2007). There are at least three ways of combining the consequences: converting each consequence to do llars, using a multiple attribute value model to normalize and weight the consequences, or using a multiple attribute utility model to normalize and weight the consequences. Each of the techniques has different assumptions and data requirements. All have been used on major national studies. AN ILLUSTRATIVE BIOTERRORIST DECISION MODEL USING DECISION TREES The 18 node event tree (with consequences) could be simplified especially if credible data are not available from subject matter experts. However, in order to use as much as possible of the existing 2006 BTRA event tree method, we directly converted the event tree to a decision tree. Using a format similar to Figure 3.4 in Chap ter 3 of this report, Figure D.3 lists one possible set of assumptions that could be used to convert the DHS event tree to the bioterrorist decision tree. The figure adds new node numbers, type of node, rationale, average branches, and probability distributions to be assessed. The phases are the sa me but are not included due to space limitations on the page. Several assumptions were made in Figure D. 3. First, the old nodes numbers 1 (frequency of attack) and 16 (potential for multiple attacks) were deleted for the reasons discussed above. Second, we converted all terrorism decisions to decision nodes.1 That left six chance nodes: four interdiction nodes, one detection node, and on e consequence node. Each of these would be uncertain to the bioterrorist. Third, we adde d the consequence model to the decision tree as the end node. In decision analysis software, this w ould be implemented using an equation in the end node that uses scenario parameters common to a ll agents and parameters (agent decision and chance node outcomes) that depend on the path throu gh the decision tree. If the consequences are not combined, a decision tree would be created for each consequence using a different consequence model. THE BIOTERRORIST DECISION MODEL CAN PROVIDE RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The decision analysis model that we have d escribed would identify the terrorist's best strategy to maximize the consequences of an att ack. Senior decision makers and stakeholders would be provided a one to n list of the agents that have the potential to create the most harm to the United States. Since decision analysis also calculates the cumulative consequence distribution for each strategy, absolute risk could easily be displayed for each agent. 1 While agent selection is an obvious decision, some of the later decisions could be modeled as uncertain nodes early in the terrorist planning cycle. The actual nodes that would be decision or chance nodes would depend on the knowledge of subject matter experts. D-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Decision analysis models are transparent. Commercial decision analysis tools provide a range of powerful sensitivity analysis tools (Clemen, 1996) to increase understanding and improve credibility. The model can be quickly reso lved if any stakeholder provides an alternative set of data assumptions. Sensitivity analysis bar charts (Tornado diagrams) can be used to show the most significant data assumptions. Value of information calculations can be performed to find out what uncertainties have the most impact on the agent risk. THE BIOTERRORIST DECISION MODEL ALSO SUPPORTS RISK MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING So far we have focused on the use of decision analysis as a modeling framework to support bioterrorism risk assessments. The Bioterrorist Decision Model would provide the baseline risk for the bioagents analyzed. Since th e model can be run quickly, it could be a very useful tool to support DHS risk management decision making. The bioterrorism risk is impacted by the U. S. ability to reduce the threat (prevent an attack or interdict an attack in progress), reduce the nation's vulnerabilities, and mitigate the consequences given that an attack has occurred. Government agencies, including the intelligence community, the Department of Homeland Security , and the Department of Health and Human Services, expend significant resources each year to increase security against attacks on our nation, including bioterrorist attacks. In the Bioterrorist Decision Model, U.S. capabilities are reflected in the probabilities assigned to the uncertain nodes (the interdiction, detection, and consequence nodes). To assess the risk reduction of risk mana gement alteratives we can modify the model to change the probabilities for each risk management alternative or set of alternatives. Due to the complexities of risk assessment mentioned in Chapte r 2 of this report, the results may be initially non-intuitive. For example, a large reduction in the consequences of the highest-risk bioagent may not have a large reduction in overall risk since the second-highest-agent consequences might not be affected. In some cases, we would have to consider sets of alternatives since, in general, the risk reduction would not be additive. Some risk management alternatives may be synergistic (impact greater than the sum of their individual benefits) or complementary (impact less than the sum of their individual benefits). INSIGHTS FROM THE BIOTERRORI ST DECISION MODEL APPROACH There are several important insights from the an alysis presented in this appendix. First, converting the event tree to a decision tree grea tly simplifies the probability assessment tasks. Second, the decision tree should allow the tree to be solved using commercially available software using complete enumeration or Monte Ca rlo simulation. Third, the new challenge is how to develop consequence models that use the decision parameters in the decision tree that will allow for rapid evaluation of the decision tree for each path. Fourth, further opportunities exist to simplify the decision tree. For example, if a decision does not impact the consequences, it can be removed from the decision tree. THE BIOTERRORIST DECISION MODEL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS OF THE BTRA OF 2006 D-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION In the introduction we listed the most fundamental concerns with the 2006 BTRA methodology: not considering in telligent adversary decision maki ng, huge data demands, more complexity than the available data support, lack of transparency for decision makers/stakeholders (see Chapter 3), and lack of a clear linkage to DHS risk management decision making. The Bioterrorist Decision Model effectively addresses each of these concerns. The Bioterrorist Decision Model solves the problem of modeling an intelligent adversary by selecting the bioagents that will maximize the objectives of the terrorists. The model greatly reduces the huge data demands by converting terro rist decisions to decision nodes, deleting the two most problematic nodes\u2014frequency of a ttack and multiple attacks\u2014and not using probability distributions for each arc on each node. Finally, the model improves transparency by using commercially available software with built-in sensitivity analysis capabilities. REFERENCES Clemen, R. 1996. Making Hard Decisions , 2nd edition.

Brown Distinguished Professor, Department of Operations Research Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California W. Matthew Carlyle Associate Professor, Department of Operations Research Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California R. Kevin Wood Professor, Department of Operations Research Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is investing billions of dollars to protect us from terrorist attacks and their expected damage (i.e., risk). We present prescriptive optimization models to guide these investments. Our primary goal is to recommend investments in a set of available defense options; each of these options can reduce our vulnerability to terrorist attack, or enable future mitigation actions for particular types of attack. Our models prescribe investments that minimize the maximum risk (i.e., expected damage) to which we ar e exposed. Our \"Defend-Attack-Mitigate risk- minimization model\" assumes that terrorist attackers will observe, and react to, any strategic defense investment on the scale required to protect our entire country. We also develop a more general tri-le vel \"Defender-Attacker-Defender risk-minimization model\" in which (a) the defender invests strategically in interdiction and/or mitigation options (for example, by inoculating health-care wo rkers, or stockpiling a mix of emergency vaccines), (b) the attacker observes those investments and attacks as effectively as possible, and (c) the defender then optimally deploys the mitigation options that his investments have enabled. We show with simple numerical examples some of the important insights offered by such analysis. As a by-product of our analysis we elicit the optimal attacker behavior that would foll ow our chosen defensive investment, and therefore we can focus intelligence collection on telltales of the most-likely and most-lethal attacks. INTRODUCTION Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has marshaled significant resources to assess the risk to our populace from terrorist attacks of all kinds. The work we report here is directly motivated by just one such risk assessment: pursuant E-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10) (The White House, 2004), DHS has conducted an extensive bioterrorism risk-assessment exercise, referred to here as the Biological Threat Risk Assessment (BTRA) (DHS, 2006). BTRA estimates risks of many bioterror attack possibilities, and classifies a list of particular bioterror agents as most -, intermediate -, and least - threatening. The BTRA risk assessment depends upon subject-matter experts (SMEs) advising, with perfect knowledge, the probability that the \"attacker\" (terrorist or terrorist group), or \"defender\" (the federal government), will choose some particular option at each stage of an 18-stage probability risk assessment tree. We contend that representing intelligent adver sarial decisions with static probabilities elicited from SMEs is an untenable paradigm: No t only can experts make mistakes, but static probabilities make no sense when the attacker can observe and react, dynamically, to any earlier decisions made by the defender. We also hold that the business of DHS lies not just in assessing risks, but also in wisely guiding investments of our nation's wealth to reduce these risks. These are strategic decisions that must be made now, in a deliberative fashion. Here, we try to adopt the same problem context as BTRA to recoup its estimable investment in risk modeling. But, we distinguish between (a) strategic investment decisions that DHS makes that are visible to terrorists, (b) the decision a terrorist makes to attempt an attack and, finally, (c) the after-attack mitigation efforts that prudent DHS investments will have enabled. Our work applies equally well to any category of threat that concerns DHS enough to warrant investments so significant they cannot be hidden from our taxpayers, and thus not from terrorists, either. Such threats cover biological , tadioactive, chemical, and conventional attacks on our infrastructure and citizens, as well as seali ng our borders against illegal immigration, and a host of military topics. The modeling presented here has been motivated and validated by more than one hundred worldwide infrastructure vulnerability analyses conducted since 9/11 by the military-officer students and the faculty of the Naval Postgradua te School (Brown et al., 2005a; Brown et al., 2006a). Some of these studies have been develope d into complete decision-support systems: Salmer\u00f3n et al. (2004) have received DHS a nd Department of Energy support to create the Vulnerability of Electric Grids Analyzer (VEGA), a highly detailed, optimization- based decision-support system. VEGA can evaluate, on a laptop computer, the vulnerability and optimal defense of electrical generation and distribution systems in the United States, where risk is measured as e xpected unserved demand for energy during any repair-and-recovery period. We have developed a decision-support system to advise policy makers regarding the interdiction of a proliferator's industrial project to produce a first batch of nuclear weapons (Brown et al., 2006b, 2007). The U.S. Navy has developed a decision-support system to optimally pre-position sensor and defensive interceptor platforms to protect against a theater ballistic missile attack (Brown et al., 2005b). The message here is that, with experience, we have gained confidence that these new mathematical methods produce results that exhibit the right level of detail, solve the right decision problems, and convey useful advice and in sight to policy makers. Such capabilities have not been available before. E-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Our focus is prescriptive, rather than descriptive: our models suggest prudent investment and mitigation plans for biodefense, and we strive to provide a realis tic representation of the attack decisions made by an intelligent adversary. As the defender , we seek to allocate a limited budge t among biodefense investment options to form a defense strategy that minimizes the maximum risk from the actions of a terrorist attacker. We might define risk as the expected number of fatalities, or as the expected 95th percentile of fatalities, or as any other gauge that appeals. Risk is a somewhat ambiguous term when used to discuss our bilateral view of c onflict between intelligent adversaries, so we hereafter substitute \"expected damage to the defender.\" We assume that an intelligent adversary will attempt to inflict maximum expected damage . The following, simplified model minimizes a reasonable upper bound on expected damage ; we discuss generalizations later.

The coefficient in the objective accounts for any interdiction effects that strategy d has on attack a, effects that are independent of any mitigation activities. (For example, vaccinating emerge ncy and health-care providers falls under the category of \"interdiction\": after an attack, no follow-up mitigation efforts apply to this vaccination.) The right-most minimization term, over ,dadamage ,dmy, subtracts from expected damage if a mitigating effort has been enabled by the defense plan, and if some amount of that mitigation is applied. For simplicity of exposition, we assume that mitigation results are additive and restricted to sum to some value not exceeding total e xpected damage. (See the definition of mitigate d,a,m.) Constraint (D1) simply limits the defender to c hoosing one defense strategy. Constraint (A1) limits the attacker to choosing a mixed attack strategy, which of course admits a pure attack as well. Constraints (M1) are joint resource cons traints on mitigation efforts; constraints (M2) stipulate that mitigation efforts are permitted only if the enabling defense strategy has been chosen. Constraints (M1) subsume those of type (M2), but we keep these separate for later clarity. The attack variables, x a, and the mitigation variables, yd,m, are continuous. If the attacker variables are restricted to be integer (for instance, they might be binary variables indicating whether or not the terrorists decide to fully de velop and deploy a particular pathogen in an attack), then the resulting analysis becomes signi ficantly more complicated than that which we present here. Although dealing with bioterrorist attacks might be most naturally modeled using integer attacker variables, our model with continuous attack ( y a) variables will at least provide a conservative estimate of the defender's objective; i.e., the attacker's abilities to inflict damage are over-estimated by our model. Discussion of MXM Figure E.1 depicts a tree showing the sequential actions of the defender (selecting a defense strategy), the attacker (choosing attack alternatives), and the de fender (mitigating damage with resources put in place by the defense strategy ). (We use the generic term \"tree\" to represent the sequence of defender and attacker decisions we model. The \"decision tree\" of Raiffa [1968] pits a single decision maker against Mother Nature , while here we have two opponents trying to shape an outcome governed by Mother Nature. The term \"game tree\" [Kuhn, 1953] is a more appropriate term for our bioterro r situation.) Each defense strategy has an immediate effect on the maximum damage of any attack, reflected in ; it can also enable the capability to reduce after-attack damage by as much as , if the chosen defense strategy permits a full allocation of mitigation resources to mitigation action m. Given a fixed defense strategy, we assume the attacker will first observe this strategy and then respond with a mixed strategy over the set of possible attacks. As we have said , this might be a relaxation of the original optimization problem faced by the attacker, and therefore grants him or her more attack capability than the attacker really has in this sequentia l decision-making. In general we cannot tell how weak this relaxation is, but for specific cases (especially those with a moderate number of feasible attacker decisions) we can use enumeration to bou nd the effect of this relaxation on the optimal objective function value. ,dadamage ,,dammitigate A \"mixed attack strategy\" means that the optimal attacker decision includes multiple attacks and then we choose mitigation responses, and this results in some damage that can only be estimated, and some part of that estimation can involve an expectation. (For example, the E-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, integrating damage over one or more probability distributions yields an objective function that measures \"expected damage.\" Solving MXM Temporarily fixing in MXM, we take the linear-programming dual (hereafter referred to simply as \"the dual\") of the innermos t minimizing linear program, using dual variables ww= k for constraints (M1), and ,dm for constraints (M2).

Given optimal incumbent solution w*, we recover the attacker's optimal strategy x* by solving MAX- ATTACKER-LP( w*). A Numerical Example of MXM We provide a small numerical example to illustrate the features of MXM. We introduce a number of defensive investment options , programs that can be composed in groups into defense strategies. Table E.1 displays defensive investment options and costs. In our example, the defensive investment options are denoted \"i01,\" \"i02,\" and \"i03.\" From this set, policy makers ha ve determined 6 combinations that comprise the subset of admissible defense strategies whose implementation will depend on the available budget; see Table E.2. Table E.3 displays expected damage resulting from each defense strategy and each attack alternative, i.e., the terms . ,dadamage Figure E.2 illustrates the generic relationship re lating investment options to the ability to reduce expected damage from any terrorist attack before it is carried out, and/or mitigate damage after an attack occurs. This is a complicated function, neither convex nor concave, but our sampling of representative points can be used to represent this in characterizing component investment options in defense strategies. Damage estimates in Table E.3 include an y synergies among or interference between component investment options in each defense strategy preparing for each attack. This is key. BTRA makes a point of such dependencies, and we represent these in complete, realistic detail here. Table E.4 represents estimated mitigati on capabilities. These mitigation estimates correspond to a single, \"full-strength\" mitigation effort being applied to a single attack E-7 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If the attacker chooses a mixed att ack strategy, we may need to spread mitigation effort across multiple activities, reducing the exp ected effectiveness of each activity accordingly. The choice of defense strategy is limited by a total budget, which we vary over the integers from 0 to 11. We allow full employment of either mitigation effort, or any convex combination of them. Because the defender is minimizing the optimal objective function value of a maximization problem, the optimal solution invests to reduce the expected damage, given future mitigation capability, of the most-threatening mixed attack. This requires that the defender invest in a defense strategy that enables him or her to mitigate several very-damaging attacks, and not just the worst one. Figure E.3 shows minimized maximum expected damage as a function of total defense budget, and Table E.5 summarizes the solutions for each budget break-point. For instance, with a budget of 3, the optimal defense plan in MXM is to choose defense option \"d02.\" The terrorists' optimal attack is a mixed strategy, with a proba bility of 0.50 of choosing \"a02\" and probability 0.50 of choosing \"a03.\" The resulting expected damage , after mitigation, is 6.5. Analysis of this simple case reveals that we have optimally allo cated our mitigation effort among the two worst attacks, reducing the expected damage in each attack to the same value, 6.5. We can do no better than this, given our conservative approximation. Generalizing Beyond Tri-level Decision Problems The DHS biological threat risk assessment (B TRA) consists of an 18-stage probability risk assessment tree, where each decision has been replaced by an a priori probability, as shown in Chapter 3 of this report. In the case of the each opponent, these probabilities are determined by subject-matter experts assessing how terrorists might make each decision, and how well DHS will do thwarting a bioagent attack at some intermediate stage of its development. We could instead model the BTRA as a 19-st age defender-attacker-defender model, with a new stage zero describing how DHS can invest in strategic biological defense strategies, and each of the intermediate stages represented by a set of decision variables that prescribe attacker or defender behavior, and solve a multi-stage defender-attacker-defender(-attacker-...) model to determine optimal stage-zero investment decisions to minimize expected damage assuming each opponent makes the optimal decision at each node of the corresponding tree. To fully represent the sequential nature of these decisions, we would require all decisions (except maybe those in the final stage) to be modeled with integer variables. However, solving such a model for just two stages of integer decisions is difficult. We do not have the technology to handle three, much less 18, stages of alternating integer decisions. Allowing continuous decision variabl es in each of the stages except stage zero (our defense decision variables) would again be a relaxation of the restrictions on the attacker, and could, in some cases, yield extremely weak bounds on our defensive capability. We now show in the case of a two-stage m odel how this relaxation from integer to continuous variables reduces the sequential decision problem to a simultaneous two-person zero- sum game.

D1 B2 0 0.TT Tybc y AQ y g x Dy d y + () LLDA This formulation is equivalent to (D LAL), and is also a linear program. We observe that () LLAD and () LLDA are linear programming duals of each other, and thus (assuming both are feasible) have the same optimal objective-function values, which is the same as the optimal objective value of (A LDL). Therefore, the sequence in which the decisions are made (either attacker first, followed by defender, or defender first, followed by attacker) has no impact on the optimal objective-function value. We have therefore proved the following: Theorem 1: For any attacker-defender model in the form (A LDL), we can exchange the order of decisions without affecting the optimal objective function value. Theorem 1 is a simple extension of von Neumann's (1928) minimax theorem for polyhedral feasible regions using a proof technique similar to Ville (1938), but using the more modern technology of linear programming duals di rectly. This exchange argument, along with the observation that any two consecutive decision stages controlled by the same decision maker are equivalent to a single stage (since both stages are either a maximization or both are a minimization over a set of decision variables, this is equivalent to a single maximization, or minimization, over all of those variables simulta neously), can be repeated for any number of consecutive stages with continuous decision variabl es. The final model obtained in this manner is a simple maximization or minimization problem. Specifically, if we were to apply this to the 18-stage BTRA model (i.e., the model we would solve for any fixed, known defense decision in stage zero), we would aggregate adjacent attacker stages (and adjacent defender stages, if there are any) and reduce the 18-stage BTRA tree to 8 stages. We would then require that all decision variables be continuous, and then swap adjacent defender-attacker pairs of stages until we obtain a model having all of the attacker decisions in stage 1 and all of the defender d ecisions in stage 2. This resulting model is equivalent to model (A LDL), above, and hence is equivalent to a simultaneous game. The optimal solution would prescribe mixed st rategies for the attacker and defender, eliminating the sequential nature of the real decisi ons that must be made. In general, the results from such an analysis might not be very accurate, as every relaxation of a block of integer variables to continuous and the subsequent interchange and aggregation of adjacent stages can result in a significant relaxation of attacker restrictions; in some models these approximations could get significantly less informative with each additional stage exchanged in this manner. However, if the sequencing of two adjacent attacker-defender stages is not a critical component of the formulation, then the optimal solution of the relaxation might not be far off from that of the original model. As a simple example, if the attacker chooses which pathogen to load into a truck, and the defender then c hooses whether or not to emplace transportation blockades, relaxing the decision variables and exchanging these two stages might not be as E-10 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In the former case the blockades will work against the truck regardless of the pathogen chosen, wh ile in the second example committing to use the vaccine before a pathogen is released is clearly a bad idea, and allows the attacker to cause significantly more damage. How to Generalize BTRA to a Decision Model Prescribing Defense Investments If we are to leverage the considerable effort that went into the development of the BTRA, we must use the data obtained, and elicit subject -matter-expert input, to develop a two- or three- stage sequential decision model of defensive inv estments, attacks, and mitigation responses such that the relaxation obtained by allowing continuous attacker variables, as in MXM, is at least a reasonable approximation. If we are successful in our new modeling effo rt, then the decisions at each stage except our new stage-zero will be continuous (and, more specifically, interpreted as mixed strategies), but now the values of these mixe d-strategy probabilities will be prescribed by the optimization model: for the stage under control of th e terrorists, these will represent the worst-case mix of attack decisions the terrorists can devise; in the mitigation stage, under DHS control, these will represent the best response to each of the attacker 's possible decisions in the previous stages. It is not lost on us that some of the BTRA probabilistic risk assessment tree's probabilities exhibit dependence on the outcomes of some prior stages in the tree. A reformulation to a two- or three-stage sequential decision model would necessarily require some reworking of these data. For brute-force permutation of (potentially aggregated) stages, we could unwind the conditional probabilities with Bayes' theorem (just as DHS already does when it splits the single BTRA tree into 28 independent trees, one for each bioagent, where selection of bioagent is the third terrorist stage in the original tree). However, we hope to move away from subject-m atter-expert (SME) elicitations of highly dependent probabilities as follows. These dependenc ies are presumably due to the influence of prior stages on the state of the terrorist (or DHS) in terms of exhaustion of limited resources. MXM would explicitly guide strategic defensive investment in stage zero , and subsequently offer all the explicit resource-limiting features of a linear program for all the attacker decisions, and in parallel all the defender's mitigation decisions th at consume the mitigation resources provided by stage zero . Linear programming has long been widely applied to planning industrial and military operations that precisely mimic a bioterror-age nt production program, or a defense plan. We recommend eliciting from SMEs an explicit assessment of the resources and capabilities of each opponent, and the way and rate at which various alternate activities would consume these. This is, in fact, the way that the BTRA reports that the SMEs explained their reasoning to support probability assessments. We advise using these technological estimates as explicit inputs, and letting MXM determine attacker mixed-stra tegy probabilities and expected consequences as outputs. This would be much more transparent modeling, provide better documentation, and be less likely to be influenced by poor SME guesses about high-dimensional decisions governed by complicated resource limitatio ns. This also avoids the current step where SMEs convert capabilities assessments into just a few discrete, qualitative probability classes (e.g., \"not likely\" = 0.2, \"likely\" = 0.5, \"very likely\" = 0.8). The initial linear integer program and subsequent pair of linear programs afford us a great deal of flexibility and fidelity in describing th e actions of each opponent, and we can solve these at very large scale with off-the-shelf optimization software. Also, solutions to such optimization models can be analyzed to discover the \"why\" as well as the \"what\" of each plan. Powerful, E-11 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

We represent defensive investment strategy selection simply, as we think realistic and politically palatable during this early phase of hom eland security capital planning. We anticipate that this will eventually mature to more closel y resemble classic military capital planning (e.g., Brown et al., 2004). We present a deterministic model that minimizes the maximum expected risk. If stochastic evaluation proves essential, our model can be used within a simulation. Banks and Anderson (2006) demonstrate such exogenous si mulation with a two person, zero-sum game. Tintner (1960) shows this for a linear program. Our integer linear program is amenable to such simulation. Secrecy in Planning If, as the defender, we strongly believe that we are able to conceal some of our defensive capability from the attacker, then the transparency of model MXM is likely to be inappropriate for determining optimal defense decision s. Instead, we find ourselves in an asymmetric conflict: the attacker and the defender do not agree on the objective function . This more general case falls in the domain of bilevel and multi-level progra mming (see, for example, Candler and Townsley [1982], Bard and Moore [1992], and Migdalas et al. [1998]), and the associated mathematical models are more difficult to solve than those we have presented here. In an extreme case, for example, we might be lieve that even though the attacker can observe our strategic defensive investments, he or she is completely unaware of our mitigation capabilities. We could then assume that the a ttacker will make decisions based only upon the damage d,a values, whereas, given that we are perfectly aware of our mitigation capabilities, we will make our investment decisions based on damage d,amitigate d,a,m values. This would be formulated as a tri-level integer programming model, the most general versions of which are difficult to solve. However, a straightforward heuristic for solving our problem would solve an attacker-defender version of the problem with no mitigation options (i.e., by fixing y d,m = 0), and then choose the optimal mitigation decision for whatever defense and attack decisions are made. Clearly this can lead to a suboptimal defe nse investment, especially when there are defense options that do not directly reduce expected damage (i.e., damage d,a might be high for those defenses) but that enable mitigation efforts that are significantly more effective than those available under other defensive investments. We can use the stockpiling of a vaccine as an example; creating the stockpile will not reduce the damage of any attack, but the mitigation activity of distributing the vaccine and inoculating the susceptible population can be extremely effective. In this case, the optimal defense a nd the resulting worst-case attack damage can differ significantly from the myopic defense. There ar e other, more effective heuristics for multilevel optimization in the literature, the breadth of which is beyond the scope of this appendix. In the case where the \"secret\" objective valu es maintain the same relative ranking between each pair of feasible defense and att ack combinations as discloseded by the \"public\" objective function, then the optimal defense a nd resulting worst-case attack do not change. For example, if the mitigation effects mitigate d,a,m are always a fixed percentage of damage d,a, then the optimal defensive investments, and the corresponding worst-case attack, will be the same, and the overall expected damage will be reduced by that fixed percentage. In this case (and similar cases, in which the mitigation efforts do not produce drasti cally different results from each other relative to the defense-and-attack combination they ar e applied to), it makes no sense to take extreme measures to conceal our mitigation capability. In fact, we should broadcast it widely, in hopes that it will deter attacker efforts. E-12 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION However, in the case where our mitigation capabilities are much more (or less) effective for one (or a small number of) attacks than for th e rest, and this fact fundamentally changes the worst-case attack decision for each of our defense options, then we conjecture that we should conceal this capability to mainta in our advantage (or conceal our weakness) for that attack, and hopefully \"shape\" the attacker's decisions toward the attacks that we are more capable of handling. However, every situation is different, a nd it is extremely hard to predict what the effect any given \"secrecy policy\" will have on the optimal outcome, much less on the actual attacker behavior. More research in this area is required. Solving MXM at Very Large Scale with Decomposition Although we have solved large att acker-defender models of the same form as MXM (Brown et al., 2005b), if instances of MXM become too large to solve using commercial off-the- shelf integer linear programming software, we can use (and have used) a version of Benders decomposition (e.g., Bazaraa, Jarvis, and Sherali, 1990, pp. 366-367) to solve MIN-ILP, with integer stage-zero investment decisions and c ontinuous mitigation decisions in the master problem, and the resulting attacker LP subproblems . Israeli and Wood (2002) explicitly develop such a decomposition for the case of shortest-path network interdiction problems. We modify MIN-ILP, replacing equations (D ILP1) with a set of constraints (DILP- CUTS), and calling the resulting model MIN-ILP-DECOMP( }Nx{ ), where }Nx{ ,Nn represents the set of all attacker plans from completed decomposition iterations: } { 1,..., aa a da d dam dm da damdamage w x mitigate x y n N = .

()w }Nx{ MIN-ILP-DECOMP( ) is easy to solve, but might get more challenging if embellished with too many more linear constraints. Fo r a difficult instance, or at very large scale, we can solve MIN-ILP-DECOMP( }Nx{ ) with an approximate, but ve ry fast heuristic, and our decomposition is still valid. The iterative behavior of the decomposition is instructive. Set a defense plan, and observe the attack response. Set another defense plan that is r obust with respect to the attack response observed, and then observe another attack response. As such iterations continue, the defender learns more about the attacker, and refine s his defense plan accordingly. Ultimately, the defender learns enough to declare that his best defense plan is ( -) optimal against the best possible attacker plan, and attains a mathemat ical certificate of the quality of his defense preparations. (See Table E.6.) The decomposition mathematically represents tw o opposed sets of subject-matter experts: a Blue Team (defender), and Red Team (attacke r). The decomposition iterations mathematically mimic a wargame between these opponents, where the defender suffers the disadvantage of not being able to hide the defense strategy, but the players play the game again and again, honing their respective strategies, until neither opponent can improve. At ultra-large scale, we can nest decom positions. We do not anticipate this will be necessary for this application. E-14 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All model instances have been solved optimally. The complete implementation is available from the authors. How Do We Get Here from a Descriptive Risk Assessment (e.g., DHS BTRA)? First, we must recognize and accept that each event-tree path in the BTRA consists almost exclusively of a set of decisions \u2014these are not random events. There are 18 successive \"events\" in the National Research Council rendition of BTRA (Tables E.3 and E.4). From start to finish, we show each event number, using pare ntheses to distinguis h defender actions, and brackets for Mother Nature at the end: the BTRA seque nce addresses selection of agent, target method of dissemination, and acquisition; the next att acker sequence involves details of agent production and processing; the following attacker sequence describes transport and storage; and the last estimates repeated attacks. These attacker se quences are interrupted by opportunities for the defender to interdict. The last stage [18] repr esents Mother Nature in fluencing consequences. For our purposes, there are merely four alterna tions from attacker to defender, followed by one truly random event governed by Mother Nature at the end. Second, we decide how to reckon as a function of defense strategy d and attack alternative a. This is not a glib statement, but rather a meta-design guide to return to the foundations of BTRA and critically review the assumptions of sequence-dependence and level of detail. ,dadamage In theory, this could be achieved by setting a defender option d, and estimating the consequences of this action on BTRA for each pure a ttacker response. This is no harder than for BTRA, and if we concentrate on estimating as a function of defense option d and a more palatable (i.e., unlike BTRA, a less minutel y-detailed and less ove rwhelmingly numerous) set of attack alternatives a, we would create a risk-calculation engine that is at once credible and efficient. ,dadamage By whatever means, we must estimate for each defense option d and each attack alternative a. If we cannot estimate risks at this fidelity, we have no business doing risk analysis. ,dadamage We would prefer to be able to choose a number of defense strategies, rather than just one. But, current risk analysis produces a single damage estimate distribution for each attack scenario. We assume these damage estimates are neith er additive nor separable between and among attacks, so we must rely on the simplified risk analysis we have. Accordingly, we endow each defense strategy with the number of defense i nvestment options reflected in each BTRA path. Our attack alternatives have not specified any particular agent. Our methods can accommodate attacks by classes of agents that include engineered and future agents not yet known. Solving the tri-level model achieved here isolat es an optimal defense strategy, and all its component investment options. Because this op timal strategy dominates every attack by any agent, we have presented an intrinsic risk anal ysis that highlights the most-critical, achievable defense strategy. We can trivially rule out this best strategy, and solve for the second-best, and so forth. This renders an explicit, unambiguous prio ritization of defense strategies. .

Banks Professor, Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences Duke University, Durham, North Carolina Steven Anderson Director, Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland Abstract: Federal agencies have finite r esources. Even for critical purposes related to counterterrorism, resources must be allocate d in the most effective ways possible. Statistical risk analysis can help by accounting for uncertainties in the costs and benefits of particular efforts, and game theory can help by accounting for the fact that terrorists adapt their attacks in response to homeland defense initiatives. This paper describes a procedure that uses risk analysis to generate random payoff matrices for game theory solution, and then pools the solutions from multiple realizations of the payoff matrix to estimate the probability that a given play is optimal with respect to one of several criteria. The strategy is illustrated for risk management in the context of a simplified model of the threat of smallpox attack. 1. INTRODUCTION The U.S. government wishes to invest its r esources as wisely as possible in defense. Each wasted dollar diverts money that could be u sed to harden crucial vulnerabilities, prevents investment in future economic growth, and increases taxpayer burden. This is a classic conflict situation; a good strategy for the player with fewer resources is to le verage disproportionate resource investment by its wealthy opponent. That strategy rarely wins, but it makes the conflict sufficiently debilitating that the wealthy opponent may be forced to consider significant compromises. Game theory is a traditional method for choosing resource investments in conflict situations. The standard approach requires str ong assumptions about the availability of mutual information and the rationality of both opponent s. Empirical research by many people (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky, 1972) shows that these assumptions fail in practice, leading to the NOTE: Reprinted with permission, from Statistical Methods in Counterterrorism: Game Theory, Modeling, Syndromic Surveillance, and Biometric Authenticationon .

This paper considers both traditional game theory (minimax solution for a two-person zero-sum game in normal form) and also a minimum expected loss criterion appropriate for extensive-form games with prior probabilities. However, we emphasize that for terrorism, the zero-sum model is at best an approximation; the valuation of the wins and the losses is likely to differ between the opponents. Game theory requires numerical measures of payoffs (or losses) that correspond to particular sets of decisions. In practice, those pa yoffs are rarely known. Statistical risk analysis allows experts to determine r easonable probability distributions for the random payoffs. This paper shows how risk analysis can support game theory solutions, and how Monte Carlo methods provide insight into the optimal game theory solutions in the presence of uncertainty about payoffs. Our methodology is demonstrated in the context of risk management for a potential terrorist attack using the smallpox virus. The analysis we present here is a simplified version that aims at methodological explanation rather than analysis or justification of specific healthcare policies. As a tabletop exercise, the primary aim is only to provide a blueprint for a more rigorous statistical risk analysis. The underl ying assumptions, modeling methods used here, and any results or discussion of the modeling are based on preliminary and unvalidated data and do not represent the opinion of the FDA, the Depart ment of Health and Human Services or any branch of the U.S. government. 2. GAME THEORY FOR SMALLPOX The smallpox debate in the United States has focused upon three kinds of attack and four kinds of defense. The three a ttack scenarios suppose that there might be: no smallpox attack a lone terrorist attack on a small area (similar to the likely scenario for the anthrax letters) a coordinated terrorist attack upon multiple population centers. The four defense scenarios that have been publicly considered by United States agency officials are: stockpile smallpox vaccine stockpile vaccine and develop biosurveillance capabilities stockpile vaccine, develop biosurveilla nce, and inoculate key personnel provide mass vaccination to non-immunocompromised citizens in advance. Although there are many refinements that can be considered for both the attack and the defense scenarios, these represent the possibilities discussed in the public meetings held in May and June 2002 (McKenna, 2002). Suppose that analysts used game theory as one tool to evaluate potential defense strategies. Then the three kinds of attack and four kinds of defense determine a classic normal- form payoff matrix for the game [see Table 1]. The C ij entries are the costs (or payoffs) associat ed with each combination of attack and defense, and we have used abbreviated row a nd column labels to identify the defenses and attacks, respectively, as described before.

All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION For each of the 12 attack-defense combinations , there is an associated cost. These costs may include dollars, human lives, time, and other resources. For our calculation, all of these costs are monetized, according to principles detaile d in Section 3. And the monetized value of a human life is set to $750,000, following the Depa rtment of Transportation's human capital model that estimates value from average lost productivit y (non-market approaches tend to give larger values). Note that there is very large uncertainty in the Cij values. Portions of the cost (e.g., those associated with expenses already entailed) may be known, but the total cost in each cell is a random variable. These random variables are not i ndependent, since components of the total cost are common to multiple cells. Thus it is appropria te to regard the entire game theory table as a multivariate random variable whose joint distributi on is required for a satisfactory analysis that propagates uncertainty in the costs through to uncertainty about best play. Classical game theory (cf. Myerson 1991, Chapter 3) determines the optimal strategies for the antagonists via the minimax theorem. This theorem asserts that for any two-person cost matrix in a strictly competitive game (which is the situation for our example), there is an equilibrium strategy such that neither player can improve their expected payoff by adopting a different attack or defense. This equilibrium strategy may be a pure strategy, in which case optimal play is a specific attack-defense pair. This happens when the attack that maximizes the minimum damage and the defense that minimizes the maximum damage coincide in the same cell. Otherwise, the solution is a mixed strategy, in which case the antagonists pick attacks and defenses according to a probabilit y distribution that must be calculated from the cost matrix. There may be multiple equilibria that achieve the same expected payoff, a nd for large matrices it can be difficult to solve the game. Alternatively, one can use Bayesian decision th eory to solve the game. Here a player puts a probability distribution over the actions of the opponent, and then chooses their own action so as to minimize the expected cost (cf. Myerson 1991, Chapter 2). Essentially, one just multiplies the cost in each row by the corresponding probability, sums these by row, and picks the defense with the smallest sum. This formulation is easier to solve, but it requires one to know or approximate the opponent's probability distribution and it does not take full account of the mutual strategic aspects of adversarial games (i.e., the assigned probabilities need not correspond to any kind of \"if I do this then he'll do that\" reasoning. ) Bayesian methods are often used in extensive- form games, where players make their choices over time, conditional on the actions of their opponent. In developing our analysis of the sma llpox example we make two assumptions about time. First, we use only the information availabl e by June 1, 2002; subsequent information on the emerging program costs is not included. This keeps the analysis faithful in spirit to the decision problem actually faced by U.S. government policy-makers in the spring of 2002 (their initial plan was universal vaccination, but ultimately they chose the third scenario with stockpiling, biosurveillance, and very limited vaccination of some first responders). Second, all of the estimated cost forecasts run to October 1, 2007. The likelihood of changing geopolitical circumstances makes it unrealistic to attempt cost estimates beyond that fiscal year. 3. RISK ANALYSIS FOR SMALLPOX Statistical risk analysis is used to estimat e the probability of undesirable situations and their associated costs. In the same way that it is used in engineering (e.g., for assessing nuclear reactor safety; cf. Speed, 1985) or the insurance industry (e.g., for estimating the financial costs associated with earthquakes in a specific area; cf. Brillinger, 1993), this paper uses risk analysis to estimate the costs associated with different kinds of smallpox attack/defense combinations. F-3Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Risk analysis involves careful discussions with domain experts and structured elicitation of their judgments about probabilities and costs. For smallpox planning, this requires input from physicians, public health expert s, mathematical epidemiologists, economists, emergency response administrators, government accountants, and other ki nds of experts. We have not conducted the in-depth elicitation from multiple experts in each area that is n eeded for a fully rigorous risk analysis; however, we have discussed the cost i ssues with representatives from each area, and we believe that the estimates in this section are suffi ciently reasonable to illustrate, qualitatively, the case for combining statistical risk analysis with ga me theory for threat ma nagement in the context of terrorism. Expert opinion was typically elicited in the following way. Each expert was given a written document with background on smallpox epidemiology and a short description of the attacks and defenses considered in this paper. The expert often had questions; these were discussed orally with one of the authors and, to the extent possible, reso lved on the basis of the best available information. Then the expert was asked to provide a point estimate of the relevant cost or outcome and the range in which that valu e would be expected to fall in 95% of similar realizations of the future. If these values disagreed with those from other experts, then the expert was told of the discrepancy and invited to alte r their opinion. Based on point estimate and the range, the authors and the expert chose a distribu tion function with those parameters which also respected real-world requirements for positivity, in teger values, known skew, or other properties. As the last step in the interview, the expert was given access to all the other expert opinions obtained to that point and asked if there were any that seemed questionable; this led to in one case to an expert being recontacted and a subsequent revision of the elicitation. But it should be emphasized that these interviews were intended to be short, and did not use the full range of probes, challenges, and checks that are part of serious elicitation work. The next three subsections describe the risk analysis assumptions used to develop the random costs for the first three cells (C 11, C21, C31) in the game theory payoff matrix. Details for developing the costs in the other cells are av ailable from the authors. These assumptions are intended to be representative, realistic, and plausibl e, but additional input by experts could surely improve upon them. Many of the same costs ar ise in multiple cells, introducing statistical dependency among the entries. (That is, if a given random payoff matrix assumes an unusually large cost for stockpiling in one cell of the random table, then the same high value should appear in all other cells in which stockpiling occurs.) 3.1 Cell (1,1): Stockpile Vaccine/No Attack Scenario Consider the problem of trying to estimate the costs associated with the (1,1) cell of the payoff matrix, which corresponds to no smallpox attack and the stockpiling of vaccine. This estimate involves combining costs w ith very different levels of uncertainty. At the conceptual level, the cost C 11 is the sum of four terms: C11 = ET dry + ET Avent + ET Acamb + VIG + PHIS, where ET dry and ET Avent are the costs of efficacy and safety testing for the Dryvax and Aventis vaccines, respectively; ET Acamb is the cost of new vaccine production and testing from Acambis; VIG is the cost of producing sufficient doses of vaccinia immune globulin F-4Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION to treat adverse reactions and possible exposur es; and PHIS is the cost of establishing the public healthcare infrastructure needed to manage this stockpiling effort. There is no uncertainty about ET Acamb; the contract fixes this cost at $512 million. But there is substantial uncertainty about ET dry and ET Avent since these entail clinical trials and may require follow-on studies; based on discussions with experts, we believe these costs may be realistically modeled as inde pendent uniform random variables, each ranging between $2 and $5 million. There is also large uncertainty about the cost for producing and testing sufficient doses of VIG to be prepared for a smallpox attack; our discussions suggest this is qualitatively describ ed by a normal random variable with mean $100 million and a standard deviation of $20 million. And there is great uncertainty about PHIS (which includes production of bifurcated inoculation needles, training, storage costs, shipment readiness costs, etc); based on the five-year operating budget of other government offices with analogous mi ssions, we assume this cost is normally distributed with mean $940 million and standard deviation $100 million. 3.2 Cell (2,1): Biosurveillance/No Attack Scenario Biosurveillance programs are being piloted in several major metropolitan areas. These programs track data, on a daily basis, from emergency room admission records in order to quickly discover clusters of disease symptoms that sugg est bioterrorist attack. Our cost estimates are based upon discussions with the scientists working in the Boston area (cf. Ross et al., 2002) and with the Pittsburgh team that developed monito ring procedures for the Salt Lake City Olympic games. The cost C 21 includes the cost C 11 since this defense strategy uses both stockpiling of vaccine and increased biosurveillance. Thus C21 = C11 + PHIB + PHM + NFA \u00b7 FA where PHIB is the cost of the public health infrastructure needed for biosurveillance, including the data input requirements and software; PHM is the cost of a public health monitoring center, presumably at the Centers for Disease Control, th at reviews the biosurveillance information on a daily basis; NFA is the number of false alarms from the biosurveillance system over five years of operation; and FA is the cost of a false alarm. For this exercise, we assume that PHIB is normally distributed with mean $900 million and standard deviation $100 million (for a five-year funding horizon); this is exclusive of the storage, training, and other infrastructure cost s in PHIS, and it includes the cost of hospital nursing-staff time to enter daily reports on em ergency room patients with a range of disease symptoms (not just those related to smallpox) . PHM is modeled as a normal random variable with mean $20 million and standard deviation $4 million (this st andard deviation was proposed by a federal administrator, and may understate the real uncertainty). False alarms are a major problem for monitoring systems; it is difficult to distinguish natural contagious processes from terrorist attacks. We expect about one false alarm per month over five years in a national system of adequate sensitivity, and thus FA is taken to be a Poisson random variable with mean 60. The cost for a single false alarm is modeled as a normal random variable with mean $500,000 and st andard deviation $100,000. F-5Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If chosen, this number is sufficiently large that severe adverse reac tions become a statistical certainty. The cost of this scenario subsumes the cost C 21 of the previous scenario, and thus C31 = C21 + (NKP x IM/25000) + (PAE x NKP x AEC) where NKP is the number of key personnel; IM is the cost of the time and resources needed to inoculate 25,000 key personnel and monitor them for adverse events; PAE is the probability of an adverse event; and AEC is the average cost of one adverse event. We assume that NKP is uniformly distributed between 400,000 and 600,000 (this reflects uncertainty about how many personnel would be designated as \"key\"). The IM is tied to units of 25,000 people, since this is a one-time cost and represents the number of people that a single nurse might reasonably inoculate and maintain records upon in a year. Using salary tables, we approximate this cost as a normal random variable with mean $60,000 and standard deviation $10,000. The probability of an adverse event is ta ken from Anderson (2002), which is based upon Lane et al. (1970); the point estimate for all adverse events is .293, but since there is considerable variation and new vaccines are coming into produc tion, we have been conservative about our uncertainty and assumed that the probability of an adverse event is uniformly distributed between .15 and .45. Of course, most of these events will be quite minor (such as local soreness) and would not entail any real economic costs. The AEC is extremely difficult to estimate. For purposes of calculation, we have taken the value of a human life to be $2.86 million (the amount used by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in cost-benefit analyses of safety equipment). But most of the events involve no cost, or pe rhaps a missed day of work that has little measurable impact on productivity. After several calculations and consultations, this analysis assumes that AEC can be approximated as a gamma random variable with mean $40 and standard deviation $100 (this distribution has a long right tail). 4. ANALYSIS The statistical risk analysis used in Secti on 3, albeit crude, shows how expert judgment can generate the random payoff matrices. The values in the cells of such tables are not independent, since many of the cost component s are shared between cells. In fact, it is appropriate to view the table as a matrix-v alued random variable with a complex joint distribution. Random tables from this joint distribution can be generated by simulation. For each table, one can apply either the minimax criterion to determine an optimal strategy in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), or a minimum expected loss criterion to determine an optimal solution in the sense of Bayesian decision theory (cf. Myerson 1991, Chapter 2). By doing this repeatedly, for many different random tables, one can estimate the proportion of time that each defense strategy is superior. Additionally, it seems appropriate to track not just the number of times a defense strategy is optimal, but also weight this count by some measure of the difference between the costs of the game under competing defenses. For example, if two defenses yield game payoffs that differ F-6Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION only by an insignificant amount, it seems unrealistic to give no credit to the second-best strategy. For this reason we also use a scoring algorithm in which the score a strategy receives depends upon how well-separated it is from the optimal strategy. Specifically, suppose that defense strategy i has value Vi on a given table. Then the score Si that strategy i receives is Si = 1 - Vi/{max Vj} and this ensures that strategies are weighted to reflect the magnitude of the monetized savings that accrue from using them. The final rating of the strategies is obtained by averaging their scores from many random tables. 4.1 Minimax Criterion We performed the simulation experiment d escribed above 100 times and compared the four defense strategies in terms of the minimax criterion. Although one could certainly do more runs, we believe that the approximations in the cost modeling are so uncertain that additional simulation would only generate spurious accuracy. Among the 100 runs, we found that the Stockpile strategy won 9 times, the Biosurveillance strategy won 24 times, the Key Personnel strategy won 26 times, and the Vaccinate Everyone strategy won 41 times. This lack of a clear winner may be, at some intuitive level, the cause of the widely different views that have been expressed in the public debate on preparing for a smallpox attack. If one uses scores, the results are even more ambiguous. The average score for the four defense strategies ranged between .191 and .326, indicating that the expected performances were, on average, quite similar. From a public policy standpoint, this may be a fortunate result. It indicates that in terms of the minimax criterion, any decision is about equally defensible. This gives managers flexibility to incorporate their own judgment a nd to respond to extrascientific considerations. 4.2 Minimum Expected Loss Criterion The minimax criterion may not be realistic for the game theory situation presented by the threat of smallpox. In particular, the normal-form game assumes that both players are ignorant of the decision made by their opponent until comm itted to a course of action. For the smallpox threat, there has been a vigorous public discussion on what preparations the United States should make. Terrorists know what the United States has decided to do, and presumably this will affect their choice of attack. Therefore the extensive-form version of game theory seems preferable. This form can be thought of as a decision tree, in which players alternate their moves. At each stage, the player can use probabilistic assessments a bout the likely future play of the opponent. The minimum expected loss criterion requires more information that does the minimax criterion. The analyst needs to know the proba bilities of a successful smallpox attack conditional on the U.S. selecting each of the four possible defe nses. This is difficu lt to determine, but we illustrate how one can do a small sensitivity anal ysis that explores a range of probabilities for smallpox attack. Table 2 shows a set of probabilities that we tr eat as the baseline case. We believe it accords with a prudently cautious estimate of the th reat of a smallpox attack. To interpret Table 2, it says that if the United States were to only stoc kpile vaccine, then the probability of no smallpox F-7Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION attack is .95, the probability of a single attack is . 04, and the probability of multiple attacks is .01. Similarly, one reads the attack probabilities for ot her defenses across the row. All rows must sum to one. The minimum expected loss criterion multiplies the probabilities in each row of Table 2 by the corresponding costs in the same row of Table 1, and then sums across the columns. The criterion selects the defense that has the smallest sum. As with the minimax criterion, one can simulate many payoff tables and then apply the minimum expected loss criterion to each. In 100 repetitions, Stockpile won 96 times, Biosurveillance won 2 times, and Vaccinate Every one won twice. The scores showed roughly the same pattern, strongly favoring the Stockpile defense. We now consider two alternative sets of pr obabilities, shown in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3 is more pessimistic, and has larger attack probabilities. Table 4 is more optimistic, and has smaller attack probabilities. A serious sensitivity analysis would investigate many more tables, but our purpose is illustration and we doubt that the quality of the assessments that underlie the cost matrix can warrant further detail. For Table 3, 100 simulation runs found that Stockpile won 15 times, Biosurveillance won 29 times, Key Personnel won 40 times, and Vaccinate Everyone won 16 times. In contrast, for Table 4, the Stockpile strategy won 100 times in 100 runs. The scores for Table 3 ranged from 18.2 to 38.8, which are quite similar. In contrast, for Table 4 nearly all the weight of the score was on the Stockpile defense. These results show that the optimal strategy is sensitive to the choice of probabilities used in the analysis. Determining those probabilities requires input from the intelligence community and the judgment of senior policy-makers. 5. CONCLUSIONS This paper has outlined an approach combin ing statistical risk analysis with game theory in order to evaluate defense strategies that have been considered for the threat of smallpox. We believe that this approach ma y offer a useful way of structuring generic problems in resource investment for counterterrorism. The analysis in this paper is incomplete: 1. We have focused upon smallpox, because the problem has been framed rather narrowly and quite definitively by public discussion. But a proper game theory analysis would not artificially restrict th e options of the terrorists, and should consider other attacks, such as truck bombs, chemical weapons, other diseases, and so forth (which would get difficult, but there may be ways to approximate). It can be completely misleading to seek a local solution, as we have done. 2. Similarly, we have not fully treated the options of the defenders. For example, heavy investment in intelligence sources is a strategy that protects against many different kinds of attacks, and might well be the superior solution in a less local formulation of the problem. 3. We have not considered constraints on the resources of the terrorists. The terrorists have limited resources and can invest in a portfolio of different kinds of attacks. Symmetrically, the U.S. can inv est in a portfolio of defenses. This aspect of the problem is not addressed\u2014we assume that both parties can fund any of the choices without sacrificing other goals. 4. The risk analysis presented here, as discu ssed previously, is not adequate to support public policy formulation. F-8Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

First, it is easy to improve the quality of the result through better risk analysis. Second, it automatically raises issues that have regularly emerged in policy discussions. And third, it captures facets of the problem that are not amenable to either game theory or risk analysis on their own, because classical risk anal ysis is not used in adversarial situations and because classical game theory does not use random costs. NOTES: BACKGROUND ON SMALLPOX Although the probability that the smallpox virus ( Variola major ) might be used against the U.S. is thought to be small, the public health and economic impact of even a limited release would be tremendous. Any serious attack w ould probably force mass vaccination programs, causing additional loss of life due to adverse reactions. Other economic consequences could easily be comparable to those of th e attacks of September 11, 2001. A smallpox attack could potentially be initia ted through infected humans or through an aerosol (Henderson et al., 1999). In 12-14 days af ter natural exposure patients experience fever, malaise, body aches, and a body rash (Fenner et al., 1988). During the symptomatic stages of the disease the patient can have vesicles in the mouth, throat, and nose that rupture to spread the virus during a cough or sneeze. Person-to-person spread usually occurs throug h inhalation of virus-containing droplets or from close contact with an infected person. As the disease progresses the rash spreads to the head and extremities and evolves into painful, scarring vesicles and pustules. Smallpox has a mortality rate of approximately 30%, based on data fro m the 1960s and 1970s (Henderson, 1999). Various mathematical models of smallpox spread exist and have been used to forecast the number of people infected under different exposure conditions and different public health responses (cf. Kaplan, Craft, and Wein, 2002; Me ltzer et al., 2001). There is considerable variation in the predictions from these models, partly because of differing assumptions about the success of the \"ring vaccination\" strategy that has been planned by the Centers for Disease Control (2002), and this is reflected in the pub lic debate on the value of preemptive inoculation versus wait-and-see preparation. However, the models are in essential agreement that a major determinant of the size of the epidemic is the num ber of people who are exposed in the first attack or attacks. The current vaccine consists of live vaccinia or cowpox virus and is effective at preventing the disease. Also, vaccination can be performed within the first 2 to 4 days post exposure to reduce the severity or prevent th e occurrence of the disease (Henderson, 1999). But vaccination is not without risk; the majo r complications are serious infections and skin disease such as progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia, and encephalitis. Approximately 12 people per million have severe adverse reactions that require extensive hospitalization, and a bout one-third of these die\u2014vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) is the recommended therapy for all of these reactions except encephalitis. Using data from Lane et al. (1970), we estimate that 1 in 71,429 peopl e suffer postvaccinial encephalitis, 1 in 1 suffe r eczema vaccinatum, and 1 in 3,623 suffer generalized vaccinia. Additionally, 1 in 1,656 people suffer accidental infection (usually to the eye) and 1 in 3,289 suffer some other kind of m ild adverse event, typically requiring a person to miss a few days of work. (Other studies give somewhat different numbers; cf. Neff et al., 1967a, 1967b). People who have previously been successful ly vaccinated for smallpox are less likely to have adverse reactions, and peopl e who are immunocompromised (e.g., transplant patients, those F-9Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Centers for Disease Control, 2002, Guide B, parts 3, 5, and 6). Because the risk of smallpox waned in th e 1960s, vaccination of the U.S. population was discontinued in 1972. It is believed that the effectiveness of a smallpox vaccination diminishes after about 7 years, but residual resistance persists even decades later. It has been suggested that people who were vaccinated befo re 1972 may be substantially protected against death, if not strongly protected against contracting the disease (cf. Cohen, 2001). The U.S. currently has about 15 million do ses of the Wyeth Dryvax smallpox vaccine available. The vaccine was made by scarificati on of calves with the New York City Board of Health strain and fluid containing the vaccinia vi rus was harvested by scrap ing (Rosenthal et al., 2001). Recent clinical trials on the efficacy of dilu ted vaccine indicate that both the five-fold and ten-fold dilutions of Dryvax achieve a take rate (i.e., a blister forms at the inoculation site, which is believed to be a reliable indicator of immuniza tion) of at least 95%, so the available vaccine could be administered to as many as 150 million people should the need arise (cf. Frey et al., 2002; NIAID, 2002). The disclosure by the pharmaceutical company Av entis (Enserink, 2002) of the existence in storage of 80 to 90 million doses of smallpox vaccine that were produced more than 30 years ago has added to the current stockpile. Testing is being done on the efficacy of the Aventis vaccine stock, including whether it, too, could be diluted if needed. Contracts to make new batches of smallpox vaccine using cell culture techniques have been awarded to Acambis. The CDC amended a previous contract with Acambis in September 2001 to ensure production of 54 million doses by late 2002. Another contract for the production of an additional 155 million doses was awarded to Acambis in late November 2001, and the total cost of these contracts is $512 million. After production, additional time may be needed to further test the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine (cf. Rosenthal et al., 2001). REFERENCES Anderson, S.

Singpurwalla Professor, Department of Statistics George Washington University, Washington, D.C. PREAMBLE This appendix consists of two pa rts. In Part 1, we overview some commonly used approaches for quantifying uncertainty. The overview is necessarily terse, but adequate references are provided. Herein we introduce the notions of chance, probabilit y, likelihood, belief, and plausibility, terms that commonly arise in the context of risk analysis. Al so mentioned here are the notions of consequences and utilities, both of which are germane to risk analysis and risk management. Part 1 can serve as a supplement to the \"Lexicon of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Terms\" given in Appendix A of this report. In Part 2 we put forth some thoughts and ideas for enhancing PRA (Probabilistic Risk Analysis) with some statistical and decision th eoretic methodologies that are available in the literature, and which could be adva ntageously invoked. We close this section by alluding to the possibility of some new research in PRA, namely, the development of an architecture for adversarial risk analysis and decision making in vague (or fuzzy) environments . It is our hope that this appendix will fill in any gaps of interpretation of the Lexicon that is given in the text, so that this appendix and the Lexicon of Appendix A are linked. To better facilitate a broad based appreciation of the ma terial presented here, this appendix has been deliberately cast in a conversational style. Th at is, mathematical notation has been avoided. PART 1. APPROACHES TO QUANTIFYING UNCERTAINTY Introduction From a layperson's point of view, the term \"risk\" connotes the possibility that an undesirable event will occur. However, the modern technical meaning of the term is different. Here, risk is the sum of the product of one's personal probabilities (or the objective chances) of all possible outcomes (also known as consequences ) of an action, and the utilities of each outcome. Probabilities and chances are ways to quantify uncertainty (i.e., the possibility mentioned above), and quantification is a neces sary step for invoking the logical argument. Utilities are numerical values of the consequences of each outcome, on a zero to one scale. Indeed, utilities are probabilities and must therefore obey the rules (or the calculus) of probability G-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION (cf. Lindley [1985], p. 56). They quantify one's preferences between consequences. Thus the modern notion of risk entails the twin notions of probability (or chance) and utility. Its computation via the sum of products rule men tioned above (cf. Morgeson et al. [2006] for a detailed application of this principle to terrorist risk assessment) is a consequence of the calculus of probability. The quantification of uncertainty by probability is, according to de Finetti (1972) and Lindley (1982), the only satisfactory way. Alternatives to probability, like Zadeh's (1979) possibility , do not lead to a prescription for the quantification of risk; this is one of its biggest drawbacks. Chance and Probability: Metrics for Quantifying Uncertainty The use of probability as a metric for quantif ying uncertainty dates back to the 16th century. However, discussions about its meani ng and interpretation continue until today. The distinction between chance and probability (cf. Good [1990]) is a consequence of such debates and discussions. In his review article, Kolmogorov (1969) wholeheartedly subscribes to probability as an objective chance that is agreed upon by all even though it can never be observed. It is defined as the limit of a relative frequency; the operational word being \"limit.\" To Kolmogorov, chance and probability were synonymous, and thus the word chance does not appear in his writings. To de Finetti (1976) and others, like Savage (1972), probability is subjective and personal, and encapsulates ones disposition to a two-sided bet. De Finetti (1972) goes further by connecting chance and probability via his theorem on exchangeable sequences with the thesis that probability is to be seen as a two-sided bet about the unknown chance. The algebra (or the calculus) of probability is subscribed to by all (save the axiom of countable additivity which to de Finetti is unnecessary). Whereas an unobservable chance can be estimated via observed data (if available), probability can be made operational by monitoring one's disposition to a series of bets. One needs to monitor a series of bets to ensure that the bettor adheres to the calculus of probability; i.e. the bettor needs to be coherent. Likelihood: A Weighting Function The term likelihood has often been used as a substitu te for chance and probability. However, the technical meaning of the term is diffe rent. Indeed, it can be seen that a likelihood is not a probability (or chance), and that a likelihood does not obey the calculus of probability. The notion of a likelihood arises in the context of making assessments of uncertainty in the light of new evidence (or data) using Bayes' Law. The likelihood is simply a weighting function that can be assigned either subjectively or via a probability model. The matter is subtle and warrants a detailed discussion that cannot be given here. We refer the reader to Singpurwalla (2006), Section 2.4.3, or to Singpurwalla (2007) for a more complete picture. The essence of this sub- section is that like chance and probability, the likelihood is, from a technical point of view, a distinct construct. Thus, caution should be used when it is used with the first two. Probabilistic Risk Analysis Probabilistic risk analysis\u2014henceforth PRA\u2014is a systematic way to assess and to invoke the calculus of probability. Its origins can be traced to the work done at Bell Telephone Laboratories on the launching of missiles (cf. Wats on [1961]), and to the work done at the Boeing G-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Scientific Laboratories on assessing the reliability of airplanes (cf. Hassl [1965]). The prominence of PRA grew with the dawning of the nuclear reactor era when it became the dominant tool for assessing the safety of nuclear reactors (cf. Barlow, Fussell, and Singpurwalla [1975]). The driving tools behind a PRA are the event trees and fault trees , which are a graphical portrayal of the causes that lead up (or down) to an event of interest. At the terminus of such trees are the causes that trigger the even t of interest; such causes are called the basic events of the trees. PRA is attractive to engineers and other scientists because of their inherent graphic feature, just as Bayesian Belief Nets (BBNs) are attractive to computer scientists. When all is said and done, both the PRA and the BBN are simply tools for assessing probabilities, and invoking the calculus of probability. They are devices fo r good book-keeping prac tices in probability calculations. The distinction between chance and probability is germane to PRA, because each leads to a different paradigm for assessing risk. The former leads to the frequentist (or sample-theoretic) approach, the latter to the subjectivistic Bayesian approach. Under the frequentist approach, PRA can only be done when hard data on the basic ev ents are at hand, and preferably a substantial amount. Such data could be easy to come by when one deals with conceptually repeatable events like failures in a population of items such as valv es, electronics, and other such small gadgets. PRA under frequentist paradigm is most suitable for engineered systems like airplanes, automobiles, tanks, and nuclear reactors. By contrast, under the Bayesian approach to PRA, probabilities of the basic events need to be subj ectively obtained via the elicitation, codification, modulation, and the fusion of expert testimoni es (see, for example, Singpurwalla [2006], Chapter 5). Because terrorist risk related events are not considered to be repeatable (to constitute an ensemble ), PRA under the subjectivistic Bayesian paradi gm appears to be relevant, not only in the contexts of biological agent risk analysis and ot her modes of terrorist risk (cf. Morgeson et al. [2006]), but also for human health risk assessme nt from environmental hazards (cf. Nayak and Kundu [2001], who also allude to a distinc tion between chance and probability vis a vis \"variability\" and \"uncertainty\"). The Dynamic Nature of Subjective Probability With the above in place, some caveats about the subjective probabilities and their assessments need to be stated. Unlike chance\u2014an objective entity\u2014that is fixed for all time and agreed upon by all, subjective probability is personal to an individual (or a group acting as one), and can change from person to person. More important, it can change over time even for the same person. In other words, subjective probability is dynamic . It is assessed at some fixed point in time and the assessment is presumably based on th e information at hand at that fixed point in time. As time marches on, new information c ould become available, and with it a possible change of probability. The position that subj ective probability can be dynamic takes a more dramatic stand via the claim that it is not mere ly the availability of new information over time that brings about a change in probability. A change in probability could also be the result of a change in the psychological disposition of the i ndividual whose betting behavior is assessed (cf. Ramsey [1926]). It is because of the above caveats that de Finetti (1974) in the introduction of his famous two-volume book on probability declares that: \"Probability Does not Exist.\" Alternatives to Chance and Probability G-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION One, among the several, of Kolmogorov's (1933) notable achievements was that he freed probability from the debates and discussions of in terpretation. He did this by axiomatizing probability. (The call to axiomatize probabilit y can be traced to the German mathematician David Hilbert, Kolmogorov's dissertation supervisor, and to Sergei N. Bernstein). However, in order to axiomatize probability, Kolmogorov had to introduce an architecture, and it is aspects of this architecture that have paved the way fo r an entrance of alternatives to probability. The mathematical architecture upon which the axiomatization of probability rests consists of a sample space (i.e., the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon), and a many to one mapping (or a function) from the sample space to the real line. The mapping is known as a random variable . Probability is another mapping defined on the subsets of the sample space. It takes values between 0 and 1, and it abides by the addition and multiplication rules of probability. Kolmogorov's architecture subscribes to the law of the excluded middle . The essence of this law is that every element of the sample space can eith er belong, or not belong, to a particular sub-set of the sample space. In other words, any el ement of the sample space cannot simultaneously belong and not belong to any sub-set of the sa mple space. This happens when the sub-sets are sharp; that is, their boundaries are well defined. Objections to Kolmogorov's architecture stem from two directions. The first is that in practice, especially when it comes to linguistic information, the law of the excluded middle turns out to be a restriction. In other words, requi ring that sub-sets of the sample space have sharp boundaries is restrictive. One needs to entertai n the possibility that the boundary of the said sub- sets could be vague or fuzzy. The second objection pertains to the requirement that the mapping from the sample space to the real line may be many to one. In practice, scenarios can arise wherein the said mapping needs to be one to many . Such scenarios can generally arise in the context of forensics, accident investigation, or failure diagnosis. The need to entertain fuzzy sets has led Za deh (1979) to propose an alternative to probability, namely, possibility theory . The calculus of possibility theory is different from that of probability theory; it parallels that of operations with fuzzy sets. Thus fuzzy set theory and possibility theory are often mentioned in the sa me vein. Regrettably, and despite Zadeh's persistent efforts, there has been no justification of the calculus of possibility theory. By contrast, the axioms of probability theory\u2014the Kolmogorov axioms\u2014have a foundation that is rooted in behavioristic phenomena. As a consequence, possibility theory has failed to provide a prescription for calculating risk. More important, it has been recently argued (cf. Singpurwalla and Booker [2004]) that it is possible to endow fuzzy sets with probability measures. This has made the role of possibility theory unnecessary. The need to entertain scenarios involving one -to-many mappings has motivated Dempster (1968) to propose a generalization of probability measures, which he calls belief and plausibility; some details about these can be had from Singpur walla and Wilson (2007) and the references therein. The net effect of these measures is that probability, instead of being a single number, is bounded above and below by what are known as upper and lower probabilities (also see Walley [1991]). A proposal for decision making based on upper and lower probabilities has been made by Giron and Rios (1980). Whereas this proposal lacks the force of coherence that decision making based on probabilities has, it may serve as a basis for risk analysis based on belief and plausibility. This possibility remains to be explored. PART 2. ENHANCING PRA WITH BEST PRACTICES The material of this part is linked with that of Part 1 wherein it was stated that probability and utility are two components of risk analysis, and that PRA was a tool to facilitate the G-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A prescription for computing risk was also given, and it was stated that in the context of biological agent risk analysis PRA under the subjectivistic Bayesian pa radigm would be the desired approach. The dynamic nature of subjective probability was men tioned and the need to ensure coherence of elicited probabilities was emphasized. The prescrip tion for calculating risk as the sum of the product of probabilities and utilities was a consequence of the calculus of probability, and the fact that utilities are probabilities. In the context of managing risk, one chooses th at action for which the calculated risk is a minimum. This prescription for taking actions constitutes the basis of decision making under uncertainty (cf. Raiffa and Schlaifer [1961]) wherein decision trees play a role analogous to that of fault and event trees. That is, decision trees facilitate good book-keeping in the context of making decisions. Decision theorists are attracted to decision trees for the same reason that engineers liking fault trees, event trees, and PRA; graphics is the virtue of both. The important point to note is that generally, decision trees pertai n to the flow of actions and events that are of relevance to a single decision maker. With the above as a perspective, the following enhancements to the current methods of using PRA for risk analysis and management can be suggested. 1. The elicited subjective probabilities should be tested to ensure coherence via more than a single query of the \"expert.\" 2. The assessed subjective probabilities should be modulated to make adjustments for any inherent biases that the experts may have. 3. When the assessed subjective probabilities enta il more than one expert\u2014and this on principle should always be attempted\u2014the expert testimonies should be fused in a manner that accounts for the correlations ( positive or negative) among the experts. Steps 2 and 3 above should be done formally via the cal culus of probability. Details about how this can be done are given in Singpurwalla (2006, Chapter 5), wherein references to the original sources can be found. Some researchers (Cooke, 1991) argue strongly in favor of calibrating probabilities against empirical data as an alternative to modulation. Th e author disagrees that proper Bayesian methods for modulating assessed probabilities are not available. Philosophical issues aside, the calibration method suggested by Cooke requires empirical data; and in the absence of such data, modulating the assessed probabilities based on one's assessment of the expert ise of the experts is a desirable option. 4. To many, a routine use of subjective proba bilities and their accompanying paraphernalia of Bayesian methods in the context of PRA are objectionable; see, for example, Nayak and Kundu (2001). This is particularly acut e when it comes to matters of public policy wherein some sense of objectivity becomes para mount. Thus whenever hard data on the basic events are available, frequentist methods should also be used, for no other reason than as a means of calibrating the Bayesian results. 5. Risk calculations based on subjective proba bilities and Bayesian methods should be investigated for their robustness and sensitivity against the priors and the coding, modulating, and fusing mechanisms. 6. Much of the current work in PRA uses stylized metrics such as dollars or lives lost, for utilities. Statisticians routinely use squared e rror or the absolute error as the metrics of utility. Such metrics, while easy to implemen t, may not reflect the true preferences of a decision maker. Thus formal methods of utility elicitation as prescribed in the von Neumann-Morgernstern (1944) interpretation of utility should be considered. Endowing a PRA with utilities that are formally elicited w ill be a major step forward. This seems to be lacking. G-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In the context of terrorist risk assessment, be it biological or otherwise, the layered defense and attack concepts used in military science could be valuable; an inkling of these appears in Morgeson et al. (2006). Unde r a layered defense, the probability of penetration goes down with the number of layers, resulting in lower probability of a successful attack on an asset. The effect of a ll this would be an expansion of the event and fault trees and the assessment of several conditional probabilities. 8. Even though alternatives to pr obability have often been men tioned in the context of a PRA, there do not seem to be at hand concre te examples and illustrations demonstrating the viability of such alternatives. A possible reason behind this state of affairs could be the lack of awareness about the availability of some tools that are able to deal with decision making in a fuzzy environment, and in the presence of a one-to-many map. Singpurwalla and Booker (2004) and Giron and Rios (1980) allude to such tools. These tools, albeit unproven, offer a pathway towa rd enhancing the current PRA technology, and are worth attempting given the repeat ed calls for PRA under alternatives to probability. It was mentioned before that the traditio nal decision trees which provide a prescription for action to mitigate the possibility of an adverse outcome were pertinent to a single decision maker. More important, the decision maker's oppone nt is considered to be nature, a benevolent adversary. The same is also true of fault trees and event trees, the staple tools of a PRA. Game theory comes into play when the adversary is no t benevolent, like a terrorist. When such is the case the static decision, fault, and event trees need to be enhanced to incorporate adversarial behavior. Thus the graphics and the underlying ma thematics of a PRA need to be modified so that they encapsulate adversarial actions. Howeve r doing so under the umbrella of standard game theory would be problematic because of the matter of infinite regress (see for example, von Neumann and Morgenstern [1944]). A possible compromise would be to consider the use of an adversarial decision tree. An adversarial decision tree (cf. Lindley [1991, 1993]) portrays the schemata of adversarial decisi on making when the actions of each adversary are sequential. The layered attack and defe nse scenario mentioned above would serve as a suitable model that calls for an adversarial event, fault, and decision tree. Since the adversarial actions change over time, the unde rlying probabilities will need to be reassessed over time, and the dynamic nature of subjective probability allows for this constant reassessment. To get some sense of what an adversarial decision tree would look like, consider Figures G.1 and G.2. The former has a single decision node, D 1, wherein D1 encapsulates the actions of D1, a single decision maker. Figure G.1 portrays the scenario of non adversarial decision making. By contrast, Figure G.2 which consists of two decision nodes D1 and D2, portrays the contemplated sequential acti ons of two decision makers, D1, and his/her adversary D2. The latter will supposedly (to D1) act in the light of the actions of D 1 and their possible consequences. However, the decision tree itself pertains to the actions that D1 should take, taking into consideration the possible actions of D 2. The overall aim is for D1 to maximize his/her expected utility. Figure G.2 can be extended to cover the repeated actions of D1 and D2 over several cycles. However, the total number of cycles must be finite, or else the matter of infinite regress will begin to creep back. The decision nodes D i, the decisions d i, i = 1, 2, and the random node R of Figures G.1 and G.2 are conventional (see, for example Raiffa and Schlaifer [1961]).

Death is the obvious example: an individual's death is irreversible and unrepeat able. More mundane examples are bankruptcy, being struck off a professional register, and other discrete events. In addition there are other events that can in principle occur twice but that are so unlikely and/or so dreadful that one occurrence is all that can reasonably be consid ered. The events of September 11, 2001, are perhaps of this type. A set of coordinated anthra x attacks in several highly populated regions is another. The fact that such events are typically probabilistic, taken together with the fact that the risk that one agent faces is often determined in pa rt by the behavior of others, gives a unique and hitherto unnoticed structure to the incentives that agents face to reduce their exposures to these risks. The key point is that the incentive that any agent has to invest in risk-reduction measures depends on how he or she expects the others to behave in this respect. For cases where there are complementarities or positive externalities, if the ag ent thinks that they will not invest in security, then this reduces the incentive for the agent to do so. On the othe r hand, should the agent believe that they will invest in security, then it may be best for it to do so also. So there may be an equilibrium where no one invests in protection, even though all would be better off if they had incurred this cost. Yet this situation does not have the structure of a prisoner's dilemma game, even though it has some similarities. A fundamental question that needs to be po sed is \"Do individuals and organizations invest in security to a degree that is adequate from either a private or social perspective?\" In general the answer is no, for reasons that are described below. COMMON FEATURES OF THE PROBLEM There are several different versions of this problem of interdependencies, and all have certain features in common. In what follows a payoff is assumed to be discrete and binary. A Note: This appendix is based on material appearing in Heal and Kunreuther (2006). H-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION bad event either occurs or does not, and that is the full range of possibilities. You die or you live. A firm is bankrupt or not. An anthrax attack is successful or not in a densely urban city. A plane crashes or not. Another feature common to these in terdependent problems is that the risk faced by one agent depends on the actions taken by others\u2014there are externalities. The risk of an airline's plane being blown up by a bomb depends on the thoroughness with which other airlines inspect bags that they transfer to this plane. Th e risk that an anthrax attack in an urban city is successful depends on the nature of our system fo r preventing, detecting, and responding to the threat of biological weapons. Finally there is a stochastic element in all of these situations. In contrast to the standard prisoner's dilemma paradigm where the outcomes ar e specified with certainty, the interdependent security problem involves chance events. The ques tion addressed is whether to invest in security when there is some probability, often a very sma ll one, that there will be a catastrophic event that could be prevented or mitigated. The risk depends in part on the behavior of others in the system. The unfavorable outcome is discrete in that it either happens or does not. IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM STRUCTURE These three factors\u2014non-additivity of damages, dependence of risks on the actions of others, and uncertainty\u2014are, as we shall see, suffici ent to ensure that there can be equilibria at which there is underinvestment in risk-pre vention measures. The precise degree of underinvestment depends on the nature of th e problem. To illustrate the nature of interdependencies we focus on two examples: airlin e security and computer security. If an airline accepts baggage that contains a bomb, this need not damage one of its own planes: it may be transferred to another airline before it explodes. So in this framework one agent may transfer a risk fully to another. It may of course also receive a risk from another. There is a game of \"pass the parcel\" here. The music stops when the bomb explodes. It can only explode once so only one plane will be destroyed. The structure of this game is quite different in the case of computer networks. Here it is commonly the case that if a virus (or hacker) enters the network through one weak point, it (or he or she) then has relatively easy access to the rest of the network and can damage all other computers as well as the entry machine (Kearns, 2005). In this case the bad outcome has a characteristic similar to a public good: its consump tion is non-rivalrous. Its capacity to damage is not exhausted after it has inflicted damage once. A bomb, in contrast, has a limited capacity to inflict damage, and this capacity is exhausted after one incident. The computer network problem is similar to what might happen in a bioterrorist attack such as anthrax or smallpox where it is possible fo r contamination to spread across individuals. Even if an individual or firm has taken protectiv e actions, there is still some chance that it can be contaminated or infected by others who have not undertaken similar measures and hence are at risk. For example, if a person has been vaccinated or taken preventive medicine against a disease, he or she may still contract the illness from others who have the disease if the vaccine or medicine is not 100% effective. In these cases where there are complementarities or positive externalities created by an individual taking prot ective measures, there is more incentive for one unit to invest in protective measures if the othe r units have taken similar actions. In fact, investing in security is most effective if all el ements of the system obtain protection and weak links may lead to suboptimal behavior by everyone. In both cases, the airline and computer secur ity problems, the incentives depend on what others do. Suppose that there are a large number of agents in the system. In Kunreuther and Heal (2003) we show that in the computer security problem, if none of the other machines are protected against viruses or hackers then the in centive for any agent to invest in protection approaches zero. For airline security, if no ot her airline has invested in baggage checking H-2 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION systems and there is a high probability that bags will be transferred from one airline to another, the expected benefits to any airline from this investment approaches 63% of what it would have been in the absence of contagion from others. As we show below there can be a stable equ ilibrium where all agents choose not to invest in risk reduction measures, even though all would be better off if they did invest. An interesting property of some of these equ ilibria is the possibility of tipping as described by Schelling (1978). How can we ensure that if enough agents will inv est in security that all the others will follow suit? In some cases there may be one agent occupying such a strategic position that if it changes from not investing to investing in protection, then all others will find it in their interests to do the same. And even if there is no single agent that can exert such leverage, there may be a small group. Obviously this finding has significant implications for policy-making. It suggests that there are some key players whom it is particul arly important to persuade to manage risks carefully. Working with them may be a substitute for working with the population as a whole. CHARACTERIZING THE PROBLEM: TWO-AGENT PROBLEM We now set out formally the framework to study interdependent security (henceforth denoted IDS). Consider two identical airlines, A 1 and A 2, each having to choose whether or not to invest in a baggage screening system. Each faces a risk of a bomb exploding on its plane, causing a loss of L. There are two possible ways in which damage can occur: a bomb can explode either in a bag initially checked onto the airline's ow n plane or in a bag transferred from the other airline. The probability of a bomb exploding in luggage initially checked on a plane of an airline that has not invested in security is p. The expected loss from this event is pL . If the airline has invested in security precautions then this risk is assumed to be zero. Even if an airline has invested in a baggage screening system there is still an additional risk of loss due to contagion from the other airline if it has not invested in security. The probability of a dangerous bag being accepted by one airline and then being transferred to the other is denoted by q. With respect to the chances of contagion, q is the likelihood that on any trip a dangerous bag is loaded onto the plane of one airline and is then transferred to another airline where it explodes. We assume that there is not enough time for an airline to examine the bags from another airline's plane before they are loaded onto its own plane. These probabilities are interpreted as follows. On any given trip there is a probability p that an airline without a security system loads a bomb that explodes on one of its own planes. For the airline scenario, thorough scanning of baggage that an airline checks on its own plane will prevent damage from these bags, but there could still be an explosive in a bag transferred from another airline. There is thus an additional risk of loss due to contagion from another agent who has not invested in loss prevention, denoted by q . If there are n 2 airlines, the probability per trip that this bag will be transferred from airline i to airline j is q/(n - 1). Note that the probability per trip that a bag placed on an airline without a security system will explode in the air is p + q. We assume throughout that the damages that result from multiple security failures are no more severe than those resulting from a single failure. In other words, damages are not additive. In the airline baggage scenario, this amounts to an assumption that one act of terrorism is as serious as several. In reality, having two bombs explode on a plane is no more damaging than just one. The key issue is whether or not there is a failure, not how many failures there are. Indeed as the probabilities are so low, single occurrences ar e all that one can reasonably consider. One could think of the definition of a catastrophe as be ing an event so serious that it is difficult to imagine an alternative event with greater con sequences. We focus first on the case of two airlines, each of which is denoted as an agent. This example presents the basic intuitions in a simple framework. We then turn to the multi-agent case.

All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION To illustrate the framework in the context of a real-world event, consider the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988. In Malta te rrorists checked a bag containing a bomb on Malta Airlines, which had minimal security procedures. The bag was transferred at Frankfurt to a Pan Am feeder line and then loaded onto Pan Am 103 in London's Heathrow Airport. The transferred piece of luggage was not inspected at either Frankfurt or London, the assumption in each airport being that it was inspected at the point of or igin. The bomb was designed to explode above 28,000 feet, a height normally first attained on th is route over the Atlantic Ocean. Failures in a peripheral part of the airline network, Malta, compromised the security of a flight leaving from a core hub, London. Assume that each airline has two choices: to invest in baggage screening, S, or not to do so, N. Table H.1 shows the payoffs to the ag ents for the four possible outcomes. Here Y is the income of each airline before any expenditure on security or any losses from the risks faced. The cost of investing in security is c. The rationale for these payoffs is straightforward. If both airlines invest in security, then each incurs a cost of c and faces no losses from damage so that their net incomes are Y - c. If A 1 invests and A 2 does not (top right entry) then A 1 incurs an investment cost of c and also runs the risk of a loss from damage emanating from A 2. The probability of A 2 contaminating A 1 is q, so that A 1's expected loss from damage originating elsewhere is qL. This cost represents the negative externality imposed by A 2 on A 1. In this case A 2 incurs no investment costs and faces no ri sk of contagion but does face the risk of damage originating at home, pL. The lower left payoffs are just the mirror image of these. If neither airline invests, then both have an expected payoff of Y - pL - (1 - p )qL. The term pL here reflects the risk of damage origin ating at one's own airline. The term qL, showing the expected loss from damage originating at the other airline, is multiplied by (1 - p) to reflect the assumption that the damage can only occur once. So the risk of contagion only matters to an airline when that airline does not suffer damage originating at home. The conditions for investing in security to be a dominant strategy are that c < pL and c < p(1 - q)L. The first constraint is exactly what one would expect if there were only a single airline: the cost of investing in security must be less than the expected loss. Adding a second airline tightens the constraint by reflecting the possibility of contagion. This possibility reduces the incentive to invest in security. Wh y? Because in isolation investment in security buys the airline complete freedom from risk. With the possibility of contagion it does not. Even after investment there remains a risk of damage emanating from the other airline. Investing in security buys you less when there is the possib ility of contagi on from others. This solution concept is illustrated below with a numerical example. Suppose that p = .2, q =. 1, L = 1000 and c = 185. The matrix in Table H.1 is now represented as Table H.2. One can see that if A 2 has protection ( S), then it is worthwhile for A 1 to also invest in security since its expected losses will be reduced by pL = 200 and it will only have to spend 185 on the security measure. However, if A 2 does not invest in security (N), then there is still a chance that A 1 will incur a loss. Hence the benefits of security to A 1 will only be pL(1 - q) = 180 which is less than the cost of the protective measure. So A 1 will not want to invest in protection. In other words, either both airlines invest in secu rity or neither of them does so. These are the two Nash equilibria for this problem. THE MULTI-AGENT IDS CASE The results for the two-agent case carry over to the most general settings with some increase in complexity. In this section we review briefly the main features of the general cases, H-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION without providing detailed proofs of the results. These can be found in Kunreuther and Heal (2003). There are two key points that emerge from the discussion of the general case with respect to the IDS problem. One is that the main feature of the two-agent case carries over to n agents: the incentive that any agent faces to invest in security depends on how many other agents there are and on whether or not they are investing. Other agents who do not invest reduce the expected benefits from one's own protectiv e actions and hence reduce an agent's incentive to invest. Secondly there is a new possibility that emerges from the multi-agent case. There is the possibility of a tipping phenomenon.1 In some cases there may be one firm occupying such a strategic position that if it changes from not inves ting to investing in protection, then all others will find it in their interests to follow suit. And even if there is no single firm that can exert such leverage, there may be a small group. Heal and Kunreuther (2007) show when this can happen and how to characterize the agents with great le verage. Obviously this point has considerable implications for policy-making. It suggests that there are some key players whom one needs to persuade to manage risks carefully. EXTENDING THE ANALYSIS The choice of whether to protect against even ts where there is interdependence between your actions and those of others raises a number of interesting theoretical and empirical questions. We mention some of these in this section. Differential Costs and Risks The nature of Nash equilibria for the proble ms considered above and the types of policy recommendations may change as one introduces di fferential costs across the agents who are considering whether or not to invest in security . Consider each airline deciding whether to invest in a baggage security system. In Heal and Kunreuther (2007) we have shown that if there are differential costs and/or risks between companies, we would expect to find some airlines investing in baggage security systems and others who would not. Furthermore, as we discussed above, the airline which creates the largest negativ e externalities for others should be encouraged to invest in protective behavior not only to reduce these losses but also to make it profitable for other airlines to follow suit, thus inducing tipping behavior. Multi-Period and Dynamic Models Deciding whether to invest in security normally involves multi-period considerations since there is an upfront investment cost that needs to be compared with the benefits over the life of the protective measure. An airline that invests in a baggage security system knows that this measure promises to offer bene fits for a number of years. Hence one needs to discount these positive returns by an appropriate interest rate and specify the relevant time interval in determining whether or not to invest in these actions. There may be some uncertainty with respect to both of these parameters. From the point of view of dynamics, the decision to invest depends on how many others have taken similar actions. How do you get the process of investing in security started? Should one subsidize or provide extra benefits to those willing to be innovators in this regard to encourag e others to take similar actions? 1 See Schelling (1978) for a characterization of a number of tipping problems. H-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION Endogenous Probabilities The above analysis assumed that the risks faced by the airlines are independent of their own behavior. In reality if some airlines are known to be more security-conscious than others, they are presumably less likely to be terrorist ta rgets. In this sense the problem of investing in security has similarities to the problem of theft protection: if a house announces that it has installed an alarm, then burglars are likely to turn to other houses as targets. In the case of airline security, terrorists are more likely to focus on targ ets that are less well protected. This is the phenomenon of displacement or substitution, documented in Sandler (2005). Keohane and Zeckhauser (2003) and Bier (2007) also cons ider the case of endogenous terrorist risks. For the case of endogenous probabilities in th e airline security problem, Heal and Kunreuther (2007) show that an airline is more likely to invest in security when probabilities are endogenous than when these probabilities are e xogenous because of the increased likelihood of being a target when others invest in protecti on. In addition, if one makes the reasonable assumption that the total externality imposed on any non-investing firm de creases as the number of investing firms increases, then this should lead more firms to invest in protection. For both these reasons it should also now be easier for a coa lition to tip the other firms into investing in security than if the probabilities were exogenous. Future research should examine how changes in endogenous probabilities impact on IDS solutions and the appropriate strategies for improving individual and social welfare. Behavioral Considerations The models discussed above all assumed that individuals made their decisions by comparing their expected benefits with and w ithout protection to the costs of investing in security. This is a rational model of behavior. As pointed out in Chapter 2 of this report, there is a growing literature in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals make choices in ways that differ from the rational model of choice . With respect to protective measures there is evidence from controlled field studies and laborator y experiments that many individuals are not willing to invest in security for a number of reasons that include myopia, high discount rates and budget constraints (Kunreuther, Onculer, and Slovic, 1998). In the models considered above there were also no internal positive effects associated with protective measures. Many individuals invest in security to relieve anxiety and worry about what they perceive might happen to them or to others so as to gain peace of mind (Baron et al., 2000). A more realistic model of interdependent security that incorporated these behavioral factors as well as people's misperceptions of the risk may suggest a differe nt set of policy recommendations than a rational model of choice. FUTURE RESEARCH ON RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR IDS PROBLEMS We conclude by suggesting a set of problem s that involve interdependent security and suggesting the types of risk management strategi es that could be explored for addressing them. Types of Problems The common features of IDS problems are the possibility that other agents can contaminate you and your inability to reduce this ty pe of contagion through investing in security. H-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION You are thus discouraged from adopting protectiv e measures when you know others have decided not to take this step. Here are some problems that fit into this category, some of which have been discussed in this paper: Investing in airline security Protecting against bioterrorist attacks Protecting against chemical and nuclear reactor accidents Making buildings more secure against attacks Investing in sprinkler systems to reduce the chance of a fire in one's apartment Making computer systems more secure against terrorist attacks Investing in protective measures for each part of an interconnected infrastructure system such as electricity, water or gas so that ser vices can be provided to victims of a disaster In each of these examples there are incentives fo r individual units or agents not to take protective measures but there are large poten tial losses to the unit making a decision (e.g., individual, organization. city) as well as to society. In the case of bioterrorism, if each unit takes protective action it will create positive externalities to others in the system and to society. Furthermore, the losses from these ev ents are sufficiently high that they are considered to be non- additive. One can only get a specific disease once (e.g., smallpox, anthrax), an airplane can only be destroyed once; a building can only collapse once;. You can only die once! These IDS problems can be contrasted with others that do not have these features. One that is discussed in more detail in Kunreuther a nd Heal (2003) is theft protection where there are negative externalities to others from your taking pr otection. In the case of theft protection, if you install an alarm system that you announce publicly with a sign, the burglar will look for greener pastures to invade.2 Risk Management Strategies For each IDS problem there are a range of risk management strategies that can be pursued by the private and public sectors for encouraging agents to invest in cost-effective protective measures. Collecting information on the risk and costs (e .g., constructing a scenario so that one can estimate p, q, L, and c with greater accuracy); Developing more accurate catas trophe models for examining the risk of terrorist attacks and other large-scale disasters;3 Designing incentive systems (e.g., subsidies or taxes) to encourage investment by agents in protective measures; Developing insurance programs for encouragin g investment in protective measures when firms are faced with contagion; 2 Once could make a similar argument with respect to cities taking protective measures against bioterrorism. For example, if certain cities were equi pped with sensors to detect biological attacks, the terrorist might focus his or her attention on those urban areas that did not have this form of protection. 3 For more details on the challenges in developing catastrophe models and appropriate strategies for dealing with them, see Grossi and Kunreuther (2005).

It may be desirable to integrate several of these measures through public-private risk management partnerships. For example, banks a nd financial institutions could require that firms adopt security measures as a conditio n for a loan or mortgage. To ensure that these measures are adopted there may be a need for third party inspecti ons or audits by the private sector. Firms who reduce their risks can be rewarded through lower in surance premiums. If there are federal or state reinsurance pools at reasonable prices to cover large losses from a future terrorist attack, then private insurers may be able to provide te rrorist coverage at affordable premiums.

Background . The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has produced a 2006 bioterrorism study, and is working on subs equent versions. DHS has asked NAS to assess the 2006 work, which I will refer to here after as \"the 2006 work.\" I have become acquainted with the work through contacts with the NAS committee, and have been invited to provide a review. This is the review . It is intended for a scientific audience, so I will not hesitate to use the language of probability in describing what I think was done in 2006, or in how things might be handled di fferently in the future. Random variables are uppercase symbols, P() and E() are the probability and expect ed value functions, respectively. My Qualifications. After working five years for the Boeing Company, I joined the Operations Research faculty at the Naval Postgraduate School in 1970, where I did the usual academic things until retiring in 2006. My teaching includes probability and decision theory, which are relevant here. See my resume at http://www.nps.navy.mil/orfacpag/resumePages/washbu.htm for details. I have no biological or medical qualifica tions. My acquaintance with the work is mainly through the references listed at the end of this review. Event Trees. The fundamental idea behind the 2006 work is an event tree. As I will use the term in this review, an event tree is a branching structure whos e root corresponds to the assertion that some event has occurred, the event in this case being what I will call an \"incident.\" The tree branches repeatedly unt il a \"scenario\" is encount ered, at which point one will find a probability distribution that determines the consequence of the incident, a random variable that I will call Y. I think of consequences as being \"lives lost,\" but any other scalar measure would do. Each node of the tree has a set of successor arcs, and there is a given probability distribution over these arcs. One can imagine starting at the root and randomly selecting an arc at each node encountered until finally the consequence is determined. In addition to Y, the event tree involve d in the 2006 work is such that every path from root to consequence also defines two other random variables: A, the biological agent, one of 28 possibilities, and I-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION S, the scenario. The scenario might be null in the sense that Y is 0 because the incident is terminated prematurely, but is noneth eless always defined. DHS determines the consequence dist ributions through Monte Carlo simulation based on expert input. The results are collecte d into decade-width histograms. I will not comment further on the methodol ogy for producing the consequence distributions, since I have not examined it in detail. DHS has modified the above definition of an event tree in three senses. One is that the initial branches from the root are rate s, rather than probabil ities. Call the rate on branch i i, and let the sum of all of these rates be . If one interprets these rates as independent Poisson rates of the various kinds of incident, then it is equivalent to think of incidents as occurring in a Poisson process with rate , with each incident being of type i with probability i/. These ratios can be the first set of branch probabilities, so this is all equivalent to the standard event tree defi nition, except that we must remember that incidents occur at the given rate . This first modification is thus of little import. The second modification is that an inci dent might involve multiple attacks, each with separate consequences. This is a more significant modification, and will be discussed separately below. The third and most significant modificat ion is that the branching probabilities (DHS on occasion also calls them \"branch fractions\") are not fixed, but are instead themselves determined by sampling from be ta distributions pr ovided indirectly by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Let be the collection of branching probabilities. In each incident we therefore observe ( , A, S, Y ), with determining the event tree for the other three random variables. This modificatio n will also be discussed separately below. The Second Modification: Repeated Attacks per Incident. The vision is that a cell or group of terrorists will not plan a single attack, but will plan to continue to attack until interrupted, with the entire gr oup of attacks constituting an inci dent. The effect of this is to change the distribu tion of consequences of an incide nt, since a successful attack will be accompanied by afterattacks, th e number of which I will call X. I believe that the formula used for calculating E( X) is incorrect. Specifically, let be the probability that any one of the afterattacks will succeed, assume that afterattacks continue until one of them fails, and assume that the failed afterattack terminates the process and itself has no consequences. Then the average value of X is E( X) = /(1 ), the mean of a geometric- type random variable. This is not the formula in use. Using the correct formula would be a simple enough change, but I believe the numer ical effect might be significant. Other changes may also be necessary to implement the original vision. If the afterattacks all have independent conse quences, then the distribution of total consequences is the (1 + X)-fold convolution of the consequence distribution, a complicated operation that I see no evidence of . The documentation is mute on what is actually assumed about the independence of after attacks, and on how the E( X) computation is actually used. Simply scal ing up the consequences of one attack by the factor (1 + E( X)) is correct on the average, regard less of independence assumptions, but will not give the correct distribution of total consequences.

All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION The Third Modification: \"Random Probabilities.\" DHS has accommodated SME uncertainty by allowing the branch probabilities themselves to be random quantities, with the SMEs merely agreeing to a distribution fo r each probability, rather than a specific number. I will refer to each of these probability distributions as a \"marginal\" for its branch. If a node has N branches, the e xperts contribute N marginals, one for each branch. Except at the root, these marginals ar e all beta distributions on the interval [0 1], and each therefore has two parameters, alpha ( ) and beta ( ). Each of these distributions has a mean, and since the pr obabilities themselves must sum over the branches to 1, the same thing must logically be true of the means. The same need not be true of the SME inputs, but DHS seems to have disciplined the elicit ation process so that the SME marginal means actually do sum to 1. Th at is true in all of the data that I have seen. However, summing to 1 is not suffi cient for the SME marginals to be meaningful. This is most obvious when N = 2. If the first branch has probability A, then the second must have probability 1 - A, and therefore the second probability distribution has no choice but to be the mirror image of the first. If the experts feel that the first marginal has = 1 and = 1, while the second has = 2 and = 2, then we must explain to the experts that what they are saying is meaningless, even though both marginals have a mean of 0.5. The second marginal has no choice but to be the mirror image of the first, and must therefore be the first, by symmetry. Any ot her possibility is literally meaningless, since there is no pair of random variables ( A 1, A2) such that A i has the ith marginal distribution and also A 1 + A2 is always exactly 1. I think DHS recognizes the difficulty when N = 2, and has basically fixed it in that case by asking the SMEs for only one marginal, but the same difficulty is present for N > 2, and has not been fixed. The sampling procedure offered on page C-81 of Department of Homeland Security (2006) will reliably produce probabilities A 1, ..., AN that sum to 1, and which are correct on the average, but they do not have the marginal beta distributions given by the SMEs. This is most obvious in the case of the last branch, since the N th marginal is never used in the samp ling process, but I believe that the marginal distribution is correct only for the first branch. There is a multivariable distribution (the Dirichlet distribution) whose marginals are all beta distributions, but th e Dirichlet distribution has only N + 1 parameters. The SME marginals require 2N , in total, so the Dirichlet dist ribution is not a satisfactory joint distribution for A1, ..., A N. Estimation of the Spread in Agent-Damage Charts. I have defined Y to be the consequence and A to be the agent. Define Ya to be the consequence if A = a, or otherwise 0, so that the 28 random variables Ya sum to Y. Most of the DHS output deals with the random variable E(Y a|), the expected consequen ce contribution from agent a, given the sampled branch probabilities . This quantity is random only because of its dependence on , the natural variability of Ya having been averaged out. A sample E(Ya|j), j = 1,..., 500 is produced by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of the branch probabilities, each sample including the standa rd average risk computations for the event tree. A sample mean estimate of E( Ya) is then made by aY500 1(1/ 500) ( | )aa jYE Yj == . agents are then sorted in order of decreasi ng sample mean, and displayed in what I will I-3 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The sample means are normalized before being displayed, probably by forcing them to sum to 1. The normalization destroys information that is relevant to the decisions being made. I do not know the motivation for doing so. The spreads display the epistemic variability due to SME uncertainty about , but suppress all of the al eatoric variab ility implied by the event tree. If there were no uncertainty about , all of the spreads would collapse to a single point (the mean) for each agent. I am not sure how the variabili ty displayed in agent-damage charts is supposed to relate to decision making, but I gue ss that the graphs ar e intended to support conclusions such as the following: \"I know th at the mean damage for agent 1 is larger then the mean damage for agent 2, but I stil l think that we ought to spend our money defending against agent 2 because of its hi gh associated variability. Even a small prospect of the high damages associated with agent 2 is not acceptable.\" If that is the kind of logic that the agent-damage charts are intended to support, then they should include aleatoric variability. Without it, th e spreads associated with each agent are too small. This issue affects infectious agents more than the other kind, since infectious diseases will have especially high damage variances. The agent-damage charts are intended for a high level of decision-making audience, and devote considerable space (one of the two available dimensions) to showing the spread associated with each agen t. Without the need to show spread, they could be replaced by bar charts or simple ta bles. If spread is important enough to be displayed, then it ought to be displayed in a manner that facilitates good decisions. I doubt that that is currently the case. Even without the aleatori c issue, I still have concerns about the spread that is displayed. The object ought to be to display the mean and fr actiles (the spread) of the random variable E( Ya|) for each value of a. The mean of E( Ya|) is simply E( Ya) by the conditional expectation theorem, and is estimated by . DHS claims graphically that the LHS sample fractiles are also the fractiles of the random variable E(Y a|). I suspect that this claim is false. LHS is basically a variance reduction technique that makes the variance of smaller than it would be with ordina ry sampling. While this effect is welcome, LHS also has an unpredictable effect on variability. The spread that is shown for each agent may not be a good estimate of the spread of the random variable E( Ya|). aY aY One final point on estimation. As long as there is no dependence between the branch probabilities at different nodes, as ther e is not in the 2006 wor k, it is characteristic of an event tree that P( Ya y ) = E(P(Y a y|)) = P( Ya y|E()). The first equality is due to the conditional expecta tion theorem, and the second is because no event tree probability enters more than once into calculating the probability of any scenario. In other words, all information pe rtinent to the distribution of Ya could be obtained without sampling error by simply replacing the margin al branch distributions by their means. This information includes E( Ya), which is currently being estimated (with sampling error) by . (Note added in June 2007. Let me expand the notation to clarify this final point, since it has caused some confusion. Let = (Q1, ..., Qn), where n is the number of nodes and Q i is the collection of branch probabilities at node i. Also let Qij be the jth branch probability at node i. In the sampling procedure used by DHS to obtain , Qij and Q kl are independent random variables as long as i and j are not the same, which is all that is aY I-4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION required for my conclusion to be true. While it is certainly true that the branches chosen at nodes i and j are in general dependent, the branch probabilities are not.) Use of SMEs. It is inevitable in a project like this that probabilities will have to be obtained from Subject Matter E xperts, rather than experime ntation. The important thing is that the SMEs at least know what they are estimating, and that estimates be used correctly once they are obtained. I have already mentioned that SME estimates of the marginal branch distributions are not repr oduced by the sampling procedure. Another concern is at the third stage of the event tr ee, where SMEs are asked to deal with agent selection. At that stage there are 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 nodes in the event tree where an agent might be selected, each of which has 28 branches. I can certainly understand DHS's reluctance to conduct 896 interviews with SMEs, each to determine one of the needed beta distributions. Some kind of a short cut is needed, but I wonder whether the one adopted is a good one. The SMEs are first aske d to determine an \"input regarding known preferences of terrorists\" for each agent. If I were an SME and somebody asked me to determine the quoted expression for agent a, I would announce my estimate of P( A = a), the probability that agent a is actually selected in an in cident. Given all of these SME inputs, DHS then goes over the 896 branches, some of which have a logical 0 for the agent, and assigns probabilities using the rule that the probability is either 0 or else proportional to the SME's agent input, the propor tionality constant being selected in each of the 32 cases so that th e probabilities sum to 1. My objections are that The quoted expression above does not ma ke it clear that the SME input is supposed to be P( A = a). There is a danger of every SME making a different interpretation of what is being asked for. If the SME does input the probabilities P( A = a), and if DHS app lies the shortcut procedure to fill out the third stage of the event tree, and if the probabilities of the 28 agents are then computed from the tree, they will not necessarily agree with the SME's inputs. This would be tr ue even without my next objection. The SME's inputs are subsequently modifi ed by various formulas involving agent lethality, etc. What is an SME who is already acquainted with agent lethality to think of this? Should he adjust his input so that the net result of all this computation is the number that he wanted in the first place? If one is going to elicit SME inputs on probabilities, then it s eems to me that one ought to use them as they are intended. Given that the agent probabilities strongly influence the agent- damage charts, the procedure for eliciting and using them should be an object of concern in future work. Tree Flipping? The process described earlier for generating agent-damage charts may not be a correct statement of what DHS act ually did in 2006. The DHS documentation in several places, after describing a single event tree with 17 ranks, states that a separate analysis was actually done for each agent (paragraph C.3.4.2 of Department of Homeland Security [2006], for example). Now, it is possi ble to end up with the single-tree analysis described earlier by doing that. The e ssential step is to first calculate P(A = a) for each agent, and then make a new tree where the agent is selected at the root, with the agent I-5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTION selection probabilities on the 28 branches fr om the root. The second and third ranks of the tree would then be what were originally the first and second, with new probabilities as computed by Bayes' theorem, and the rest of the tree would be unchanged. Since the agent is at the root of the re sulting \"flipped\" tree, using the flipped tree is in effect doing a separate analysis for each agent. The flipped tree would lead to the same earlier described agent-damage charts\u2014the two trees are stochastically equi valent. But I don't see the motivation for doing all this extra wo rk in flipping the tree, and I have some concerns about whether the fli pping operation was actually done correctly, or done at all. One concern is that the thing being manipul ated is not an ordinary event tree, and there is no reason to expect that beta distri butions will remain beta distributions in the flipping process. Of course, the flipping could occur after the tree is instantiated in each of the 500 replications, but that would get to be a lot of work. I doubt if that has been the case. The documentation is mute about the tree flipping process. I can only hope that the method actually used for producing agent-da mage charts is equivalent to analyzing the single event tree as described above. Suggestions. My main suggestion for future work is that distributions for branch probabilities be abandoned in favor of direct branch probabilities, as in a standard event tree. In other words, keep it simple. SMEs will not be comfortable expressing definite values for the probabilities, but then they are probably not comfortable with expressing definite values for and , either. Most people are simply not comfortable quantifying uncertainty. There is very little to be gain ed by including epistemic uncertainty about the branch probabilities in an anal ysis like this, and much to be lost in terms of complication. Epistemic uncertainty is not even discussed in most decision theory textbooks. Standard software for handling decision trees would become applicable (event trees are just a special case where there are no decisions) if epistemic uncertainty were not present. There is also standard software for hand ling influence diagrams, which ought to be considered as an alternative to decision tr ees. Influence diagram software is sometimes used diagnostically, which might be of use in bioterrorism. One might observe that the agent is known to be anthrax, for exampl e, and instantly recompute the target probabilities based on that known condition. Another suggestion is to examine the potential for optimization. Given that the basic problem is how to spend money to reduc e risk, it is too bad that a problem that simple in structure cannot be posed formally. It is possible that some actions that we might take would be effective for all contagious diseases. This should make them attractive, but the low rank of most contagious diseases individually in the agent-damage charts tends to suppress their attractiveness. My last suggestion is to report future results in a scientific fashion that can be reviewed by scientists. E nglish is a notoriously impreci se language for describing operations involving chance, so I have repe atedly struggled to understand what was actually done in making my way through the references. As a result, I may well have misinterpreted something above that I hope DHS will correct. If I were reviewing the 2006 work for a journal, my first act would be to send the material back to the authors with a request that it be written up using mathematics embedded in English, instead of just English. I know that DHS has to co mmunicate complicated ideas about risk to I-6 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

That task should be in addition to reporting the results scientifically, not a replacement for it. In summary, my opinion is that the 2006 DHS methodology is not yet the \"rigorous and technically sound me thodology\" demanded by the 2004 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10: Biodefense for the 21st Century . Let me also add that I consider the report as a whole to be a re markable accomplishment, given the magnitude of the task and the time available to do it. References.

Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD10), \"Biodefen se for the 21st Century,\" on April 28, 2004.1 This directive, as well as the National Strategy for Homeland Security,2 published by the White House Office of Homeland Security in 2002, required assessments of the biological weapons threat to the nation and assigned the Department of Homeland Security (DHS ) responsibility for conducting these assessments, in coordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies. The first DHS bioterrorism risk assessment was completed on January 31, 2006, and the report documenting the assessment was published on October 1, 2006.3 THE COMMITTEE'S PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT The National Research Council (NRC) was asked by DHS to carry out a study to recommend improvements to the methodology used for DHS's firs t bioterrorism risk assessment. The NRC study will issue two reports: interim (this report), focused on ne ar-term improvements that can begin in federal Fiscal Year 2007 (FY2007), and final, to recommend longer-term improvements. On August 28-29, 2006, the NRC Committee on Me thodological Improvements to the Department of Homeland Security's Biological Agent Risk Anal ysis met with representatives of DHS, its National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), Battelle Memorial Institute, the White House Homeland Security Council, and the Homeland Security Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE). The briefings at th is meeting described a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of 28 bioagents. For each of the 28 pathogens, it used a 17-step event-tree analysis of paths (sequences of events and actions) that could lead to the deliberate exposure of civilian populations. The recommendations and discussion below are based sole ly on those briefings; DHS's bioterrorism risk assessment was not made available to the committee in time for this interim report. This interim report provides DHS with overall n ear-term guidance and direction for the further development of its risk analysis models. The co mmittee's final report will address longer-term issues in the development of risk analysis capabilities for DHS . Because the topics discussed here will be studied in more depth and with a view toward the longer term, the committee's final repo rt will be more detailed and may modify the conclusions presented here. The committee is confident, however, that the recommendations included in this interim report are appropriate and necessary in the near term. The committee recognizes that the development of th is comprehensive suite of techniques used for the PRA is a logical extension of previous risk analysis methods used for natural and technological hazards and engineering design. 4 The implementation of the selected PRA framework appears, for the most part, to be consistent with well-accepted practice in other fields of risk analysis such as nuclear reactor safety and chemical safety. The committee also notes that DHS and its NBACC have sought ways to refine and improve this new capability. 1 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10, \"Biodefense for the 21st Century,\" April 28, 2004, available at http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/hspd-10.html .

Following are three critical inte rim recommendations. Recommendation 1: DHS should establish a clear statement of the long-term purposes of its bioterrorism risk analysis. A clear statement of the long-term purposes of the biot errorism risk analysis is needed to enunciate how it can serve as a tool to inform risk assessmen t, risk perception, and especially risk-management decision making. Criteria and measures should be specified for assessing how well these purposes are achieved. Key issues to be addressed by such a st atement should include the following: who the key stakeholders are; what their short- and long-term values, goals, and objectives are; how these values, goals, and objectives change over time; how the stakeholders perceive the risks; how they can communicate their concerns about these risks more ef fectively; and what they need from the risk assessment in order to make better (more effectiv e, confident, rational, and defensible) resource- allocation decisions. Other important issues are who should perform the analyses (contractors, government, both) and how DHS should incorporate ne w information into the analyses so that its assessments are updated in a timely fashion. Recommendation 2: DHS should improve its analysis of intelligent adversaries. Event-tree methodology was not developed to model th e possible actions of intelligent adversaries. Traditional event-probability assessment and elic itation techniques for these assessments are not sufficient for modeling the actions of intelligent a dversaries made in response to their opponents' defensive actions and/or in response to initial su ccesses or failures in thei r own plan execution. Alternative techniques\u2014including red teams (i.e., i ndividuals, including both technologists and those with experience in targeting and strategy, whose purpo se is to simulate adversarial decision making) and attack-preference, decision-tree, attack-tree, or attack-graph models5\u2014might be more suitable to complement elicitation. Recommendation 3: DHS should increase its risk analysis methodology's emphasis on risk management. It is unclear how the event-tree probabilistic risk assessment will support DHS's design and evaluation of alternative risk management strategi es. The computational engine being developed by Battelle does not permit, let alone encourage, risk managers to explore \"if resource allocation, then 5 Attack trees and attack graphs are modeling techniques for understanding risk in complex situations. Both are graphical representations showing all ways to attack or damage a system. Decision trees are event trees with decisions represented as possible even ts. Attack-preference models examine decisions from the viewpoint of the attacker rather than the defender.

Moreover, the model should have an interface and visualization component that makes its results and limitations easier to understand and be used by decision makers. The committee encourages DHS to continue to build on, refine, and improve the probabilistic risk assessment foundation already laid down. The committee will continue to pursue these and additional topics in its review over the coming year. 6 The DHS methodology, as reflected in software, actually does allow changes in assumptions; but this must be done through an analyst and would require a significant time delay and limit the range of alternatives that could be examined.

Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD10), \"Biodefense for the 21st Century,\"1 on April 28, 2004. The directive requires assessments of the bi ological weapons threat to the nation: Another critical element of our biodefense policy is the development of periodic assessments of the evolving biological weapons threat. First, the Unite d States requires a continuous, formal process for conducting routine capabilities assessments to guide prioritization of our on-going investments in biodefense-related research, development, planni ng, and preparedness. These assessments will be tailored to meet the requirements in each of these areas. Second, the United States requires a periodic senior-level policy net assessment that evaluates progress in implementing this policy, identifies continuing gaps or vulnerabilities in our biodefense posture, and makes recommendations for re-balancing and refining investments among the pillars of our overall biodefense policy. The Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with other appropriate Federal departments and agencies, will be responsible for conducting these assessments. 2 The first Department of Homeland Security biote rrorism risk assessment was completed on January 31, 2006, and the report documenting the analysis was published on October 1, 2006.3 This assessment and report implemented the requirement of th e National Strategy for Homeland Security,4 issued in July 2002 by the Office of Homeland Security, and of HSPD10 for DHS to assess the biological weapons threat in coordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies. At DHS's request, the National Research Council (NRC) established the Committee on Methodological Improvements to the Department of Homeland Security's Biological Agent Ri sk Analysis to provide a review, via two reports (interim and final), of the methodology used in DHS's report. The committee's first meeting was held at the Na tional Academies' Keck Center in Washington, D.C., on August 28-29, 2006. The appendix contains the agenda for that meeting. The committee heard and discussed presentations regarding risk analysis for biological pathogens by representatives of DHS, its National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), Battelle Memorial Institute, the White House Homeland Security Council, and the Ho meland Security Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE). The r ecommendations and discussion below are based solely on those briefings; DHS's bioterrorism risk assessment was not made available to the committee in time for this interim report; however, the committee believes that these briefings included sufficient detail to adequately present the methodology used in the risk analysis. NBACC has contracted with Battelle to pr oduce a computational engine that assesses the \"normalized risk\" of 28 pathogens as that risk relat es to death, morbidity, and direct economic costs. 5 In federal Fiscal Year 2007 (FY2007), DHS intends to im prove and refine its proba bilistic risk assessment (PRA). The committee has been asked to recommend po ssible directions for improvement, as well as to 1 Available at http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/hspd-10.html .

These comments are intended to provide guidance to DHS for its work during FY2007. Specifically, the committee has been given the followi ng charge for this interim report: Assess the adequacy of the DHS's current methodol ogy as a foundation for the desired risk analysis capabilities; Identify any other risk analyses that rely on the major components of the existing methodology, probabilistic risk analysis and multi-attribute ri sk analysis, and which could guide DHS's future developments; Assess the feasibility of incorporating models of second-order economic effects into the methodology during FY07; Identify better methods, if any, for handling the high degrees of uncertainty associated with the risk analyses of biological agents; Recommend near-term improvements to enhance the transparency of the method and its usefulness to decision makers; Discuss how the methodology could be extended to ri sks associated with classes of agents, including enhanced or engineered agents that have yet to be developed; and Discuss the feasibility of extending the methodology to also serve as a framework for risk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats. For this interim report, the committee was not able to address the last of these tasks\u2014to examine risk analysis for chemical or radioactive threats\u2014be cause the breadth of this task exceeds the information that could be provided during briefings to the committee in one meeting. That task, however, will be addressed in the committee's final report. The committee's charge for its final report is as follows: Recommend how the methodology can incorporate changing probability distributions that reflect how various actors (e.g., terrorists, first responders, public health community) adjust their choices over time or in different contexts; Recommend further improvements to the consequence analysis component of the methodology, including its models of economic effects; Identify any emerging methods for handling large degr ees of uncertainty (e.g., fuzzy logic, possibility analysis) that merit consideration for future incorporation; Recommend further improvements to the transparency and usability of the methodology; Discuss in more detail beyond the first report how the methodology could be extended to risks associated with classes of agents, including enhanc ed or engineered agents that have yet to be developed; and Discuss in more detail beyond the first report the f easibility of extending the methodology to also serve as a framework for risk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats. This charge will require study of the issues addressed here in greater depth and with a view toward the longer term. The committee is confident, however, that the recommendations included in this interim report are appropriate and necessary in the near term. The committee's reco mmendations that follow address the general goal of improving methodology. E ach recommendation relates to multiple elements of the charge, as noted in the accompanying text. THE DHS BIOTERRORISM RISK ASSESSMENT This interim report frequently re fers to \"risk\" and activities surrounding its manipulation. For purposes of clarity, several definitions are given: J-15Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTIONS REPRINTED INTERIM REPORT Risk\u2014the potential for realization of unwanted, adverse consequences to human life, health, property, or the environment, computed as the product of the probability of an event and the consequence of that event. Risk analysis \u2014the overall process that involves risk assessment, risk perception, risk communication, and risk management. The hazards to be analyzed (e.g., physical, chemical, nuclear, radiological, and biological agents) may result from natural events (e.g., earthquakes and hurricanes), technological events (e.g., chem ical accidents), and human activity (e.g., design and operation of engineered systems or attack by terrorists). Risk assessment \u2014the scientific process of identifying hazards and quantifying their potential adverse consequences (magnitude, spatial scale, duration, and intensity) and associated probabilities including the uncertainties surrounding these estimates. Risk assessment may include a description of the cause-and-effect links among hazards and the nature of the interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Risk perception \u2014beliefs held by individuals or organizations about the risks of a hazard. Risk perception is concerned with psychologi cal and emotional factors, which have been shown to have an enormous impact on behavior. Risk perception can be influenced by personal knowledge, experience, and beliefs; it can be affected by changing perceptions of the threat, the vulnerabilities, and/or the conse quences; it may be influenced by information about hazards, risk assessments, risk policies, and risk management decisions. Risk communication \u2014the process used by risk analysts, decision makers, policy makers, and intelligent adversaries to provide data, inform ation, and knowledge to change the risk perceptions of individuals and organizations and enable them to assess the risk differently than they otherwise might. Risk communication needs must be considered when developing strategies for managing risk; thus any risk anal ysis methodology must take into account how affected individuals perceive and understand risk. Risk management\u2014the process of constructing and evaluating strategies for reducing losses from future hazards and dealing with the rec overy process should a disaster occur. Risk management strategies include a combination of options, such as providing information (i.e., risk communication), economic incentives (e.g., s ubsidies, fines), insurance, compensation, regulations, and standards. These strategies enab le individuals and private-sector or public- sector organizations to transfer, mitigate, or accept their perceived risks. Risk management strategies can be evaluated by undertaking co st-benefit analyses to de termine the trade-off between the reduction of risk and the costs of undertaking such measures. In evaluating a risk management strategy, one needs to be concerned with the way resources are allocated (i.e., efficiency considerations) as well as w ith the impact of these measures on different stakeholders (i.e., distribution or equity considerations). The model used for the DHS bioterrorism risk assessment is a computer-based tool used for assessing the relative risk of terrorist use of each of 28 specific pathogens, identified in other sources. The methodology described below is an instance of probabilistic risk assessment, which is particularly well adapted for low-frequency, hi gh-potential-consequence events for which there is no database sufficient to assess risk using statistical analysis of historical data. The PRA used by DHS divides the spectrum of possi ble attacks into a discrete set of scenarios, or sequences of events, and for each scenario it provides an estimate of the scenario's probability of occurrence, consequences, and risk. Owing to the extremely large size of the sample space, Battelle sampled the events in the scenarios involving a particular pathogen, estimated the risk associated with that pathogen, and compared it with the risk of other pathogens in order to obtain risk relative to that of other pathogens. Each scenario involves a chain of as many as 17 events, which can be partitioned into those characterizing the terrorist group's motivations and goals; those involving its methods and ability to J-16Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Each event is further given discrete characteristics. For instance, the event of target selection can be further decomposed into the selection of a large, open building; a small enclosure; a large, divided building; a large outdoor space; a water pathway; a food pathway; or a contact target such as a letter. The event tree6 generated thus has millions of scenarios, or paths through the tree, for which the probabilities and consequences must be explic itly or implicitly calculated. For each scenario, a range of consequences\u2014me asured in terms of illnesses, fatalities, and economic losses\u2014must be computed, with a probability distribution over the range. The \"consequence engine\" used for these computations consists of a ser ies of equations whose variables are derived from the properties of the pathogen, the details of the scenario , and the hypothesized U.S. response to the terrorist event. DHS is developing improved means to estim ate the first- and second-order economic effects (as discussed later in this report). In addition, it is developing systems dynamics models of the ways in which the scenarios might unfold. The committee will review this systems dynamics approach in its final report. Even from this brief description, it can be seen that the DHS model requires a large amount of information, much of which is uncertain. This information includes the known properties of the pathogens, estimates of the propensities of terrorists to take different actions, and estimates of the reactions of the affected population and of the tim eliness and effectiveness of the government response. With the exception of known scientific information, th e parameters are either estimated from historical experience or elicited from experts, often in the form of probability distributions. RECOMMENDATIONS For the most part, the analysis described in th e previous section follows approaches considered technically sound and useful in other areas of risk an alysis such as nuclear reactor safety and chemical safety. In validation of risk, PRA avoids many of the practical problems and difficulties that arise from other alternative methods such as fuzzy logic, the analytic hierarchy process, or worst-case analysis (Banks and Anderson, 2006; Laviolette et al., 1995). Event-tree analysis, which is the basis of PRA, is a well-developed risk tool in nuclear reactor safety and many other, usually engineering, contexts (Lindley and Singpurwalla, 1986). The main concern of the committee is that the current PRA ev ent-tree paradigm does not fully support any of the components of risk analysis. It does not include cons ideration of the actions of an intelligent and reactive adversary, which is required for a complete risk analys is. It makes no provision for risk perception. It does not allow the exploration by decision makers of \"what-if\" questions, which is needed for risk management. 7 DHS needs to provide analyses for a variety of purposes to a variety of customers, and all within the context of competing security demands in the short run, while taking into account the longer- run concerns that may change over time. Therefore, a necessary first step is to clarify the longer-term goals and objectives of bioterrorism risk analysis. Recommendation 1: DHS should establish a clear statement of the long-term purposes of its bioterrorism risk analysis. 6 An \"event tree\" is a visual representation of all events that can occur in a system. As the number of events increases, the picture fans out like the branches of a tree. 7 The DHS methodology, as reflected in software, actually does allow changes in assumptions; but this must be done through an analyst and would require a significant time delay and limit the range of alternatives that could be examined.

All rights reserved.Department of Homeland Security Bioterrorism Risk Assessment: A Call for Change http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12206.htmlPREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL CORRECTIONS REPRINTED INTERIM REPORT In order to justify the current methodology as a foundation for future analyses, a clear statement of the long-term purposes of the bioterrorism risk analys is is needed to enunciate how it will support risk assessment, risk perception, and especially risk management decision making. Criteria and measures should be specified for measuring how well these purposes are achieved. Key issues to be addressed by such a statement should include the following: who the key stakeholders are; what their short- and long- term values, goals, and objectives are; how these va lues, goals, and objectives change over time; how the stakeholders perceive the risks; how they can commu nicate these risks more effec tively; what they need from the risk assessment in order to make better (mor e effective, confident, rational, and defensible) resource-allocation decisions; and who should perform the analyses (contractors, government, both). Another important operational consid eration is the determination of how DHS should incorporate new information in its analyses. The pace of change in biotechnology will require frequent and systematic updates of information used by the model. DHS i ssues \"tailored assessments\" to respond to unscheduled requirements, in addition to its biennial report, and it must be able to incorporate new intelligence information or technological change, for instance, in these analyses. DHS's purposes for its bioterrorism risk assessment must be supported by its customers, by the U.S. Congress, and by the scientific community, among others; thus, DHS should actively solicit the opinions of its stakeholders to ensure that communicati on on issues of risk analysis is two-way. To that end, the language and analyses used must be preci se. The technical presentations given to the committee suggest that the model documentation does not always use standard and consistent terminology. For example, several speakers at the committee's first mee ting used the term \"relative risk\" to refer to what should be called \"normalized risk,\" and \"likelihood\" was sometimes used as a The terms \"risk,\" \"expected risk,\" the computation of \"normalized risk\" was flawed. 8 The terms \"illness\" and \"morbidity\" should be clarified and defined more precisely (i.e., illness woul d need to be defined as either \"infected\" or \"symptomatic\"). Other terms used in the presentations to the comm ittee were not precisely de fined, and functional notation was confusing. DHS should define and use a standard lexicon, clarify concepts, and align with contemporary literature in order to improve the transp arency of its models and results. DHS's operational definition of \"risk\" should be refi ned to include time explicitly\u2014for example, by indicating how many events with various degrees of severity of adverse c onsequences can be expected over what time intervals if different risk management interventions are implem ented. Attention also needs to be given to the uncertainty and ambiguity associated with these risks. Use of outside peer reviews may help in this regard. The issues raised here are not minor concer ns; this lack of precision can lead to internal inconsistencies in the model and to communication problems at all levels. DHS's risk assessment currently encompasses what are mainly traditional bioagents. However, it seems logical that the DHS vision for risk analysis should be broad enough to include risks posed by other significant future biological threats. Traditional bioagents are \"naturally occurring microorganisms or toxin products with the potential to be weaponized and disseminated to cause mass casualties.\" .9 Testing the methodology by using existing biological ag ent threat lists, as has been done to date, is a prudent and logical way to start, given the very larg e number of pathogens that could possibly be used as weapons. Existing threat lists (e.g., from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention10) reflect 8 After normalization (division by the average risk over all agents), information about the actual magnitude of the risk is lost, affecting risk assessment and making the an alysis of most resource-allocation decisions difficult. Moreover, distributions of risk, as normalized in this way, cannot be created by simply normalizing the scale of the non-normalized risk. 9 Federal Register, Vol. 71, No. 174, 2006, available at http:/www.hhs.gov/ophep/ophemc/bioshield/ PHEMCESStrategyFRNotice090806.pdf.

However, many bioterrorism experts would agree that the \"logic behind biowarfare programs of the past will not necessarily guide the life sciences as ne w technology rapidly emerges; biowarfare programs of the past predated current knowledge of molecular biology\" (R elman, 2006, pp. 113-115). Therefore, future iterations of the methodology should also consider en hanced, emerging, and advanced agents in addition to traditional bioagents: Enhanced agents are those that are modified to circumvent current countermeasures\u2014for example, microorganisms that are purposefully manipulated to be resistant to multiple antibiotics, thus complicating a public health response in the aftermath of an attack. Emerging agents are those that occur naturally but are newly recognized or anticipated to pose a public health threat\u2014for example, a highl y lethal and readily transmissible influenza strain that may cause a pandemic. Advanced agents are novel microorganisms that may be created by employing laboratory methods. The results of such an extended risk assessment w ould be useful in determining the appropriate allocation of resources to develop flexible defenses\u2014t hose that may be useful against a wide range of microorganisms that may share common processes in causing disease. Such an assessment would require information that is not currently available\u2014estimates of likely developments in biotechnology that would enable new capabilities that could be used by terrorists. The committee believes that, for the near term, the elicitation of expert opinion, similar to what was undertaken in DHS's assessment of traditional bioagents, would be a useful starting point. This could be the first step in establishing the risk imposed by agents not yet in the environment and in broadening th e analysis to include classes of agents rather than individual agents. The committee will examine this di fficult problem in more depth in its final report. Recommendation 2: DHS should improve its analysis of intelligent adversaries. Event trees were not originally developed to model intelligent adversaries who adapt their attacks in response to (or in anticipation of) their opponents' defensive actions and/or in response to their own initial successes or failures in plan execution. Alternative risk analysis techniques, including attack-preference, decision-tree, attack-tree, or attack-graph models, 11 can complement or replace probability elicitation. There have been recent advances in dealing with interdependent and c oordinated adversary actions, called interdependent security (Heal and Kunreuther, 2005) , which may improve the fidelity of DHS models. To use a PRA event-tree risk assess ment in the analysis of intelligent adversaries, the tree must include all realistic threats that adversaries may pursue. The committee believes that the DHS PRA tree is reasonably complete, although DHS should examine this further in light of the expectation that adversaries will adapt to any defensive decisions made by the United States. A small number of well- chosen red teams (i.e., individuals including both tec hnologists and those with experience in targeting and strategy, whose purpose is to simulate adversaria l decision making) to provide input for \"what-if\" scenarios can help to confirm and expand th e current state of understanding and model validation and can complement expert opinion. 11 Attack trees and attack graphs are modeling techniques for understanding risk in complex situations. Both are graphical representations showing all ways to attack or damage a system. Decision trees are event trees with decisions represented as possible events . Attack-preference models examine decisions from the viewpoint of the attacker rather than the defender.

Most of the event probabilities have been generated using expert opinion. DHS is keenly aware that this approach may be unreliable, and the committee is pleased that DHS intends to use CREATE's expertise to improve elicitation of the views of subject-matte r experts. But the reliability of these probability assessments will always be problematic, requiring caref ul attention to the elicitation methods as well as needing well-designed sensitivity analyses (Kahneman and Tversky, 2000; Meye r and Booker, 2001). Moreover, strictly probabilistic analysis should also be supplemented with other methods, such as attack- preference models and attack-tree models, in order to ascertain any severe contradictions in the resulting risk management (or mitigation) recommendations. The Mission Oriented Risk and Design Analysis (MORDA) model, used in several Department of Defense risk assessment studies, is an example of the use of subject-matter expert teams from various disciplines to collect data and incorporate expert kno wledge about adversaries. The MORDA model uses this collected information in adversary models and attack-tree models (Buckshaw et al., 2005). In order to better understand the sources of uncertainty and to plan for their reduction, any analysis resulting from the PRA model should include a data-qua lity matrix with a qualitative assessment of the sources and quality of the data and perhaps quantita tive indications of the confidence and precision associated with current estimates (e.g., plausible range of values for model inputs) for the 28 bioagents and the 17 steps in the event tree developed by Battelle. The committee believes that static probabilities, as th ey are currently used by DHS, are insufficient to model the behavior of intelligent adversaries . Static probabilities may be appropriate when dealing with nuclear reactors, but not for an intelligent adver sary who adapts an attack on the basis of the actions of the defenders and on information that it acqui res as planning and execution progress. Although classical game theory is a formal wa y to handle such situations, there is now a growing literature that may be more relevant for dealing with the adversarial nature of the bioterrorism problem (Bier et al., 2005; Enders and Sandler, 2006; Heal and Kunreuther, 20 05). Studies have been conducted by the Navy Postgraduate School in which the defender computed a strategy that would minimize the maximum damage that could be caused by an attacker (terrori st) who was aware of that strategy. These \"attacker- defender\" studies, which have been undertaken in various contexts to determine how best to protect U.S. infrastructure, might serve to complement the static probability analyses currently used by DHS (Brown et al., in press). Any analysis of adversarial actions, as well as of mitigation strategies and responses, will require accurate estimates of the real damages that the United States would experience. Currently, the PRA computes measures of mortality, morbidity, and direct economic costs. But indirect economic costs (e.g., of business interruption) must also be included to avoid underestimating true financial consequences. If these indirect costs are large, it may be necessary to evaluate their impact, taking into account risk aversion and/or loss aversion. 12 Evaluation of these costs will require that DHS more carefully consider its consequence measures and modeling, which should be augmen ted to include indirect economic effects. DHS is planning to use input-output models and CREATE-deve loped general equilibrium models to improve its estimates of the direct economic consequences of terrorist events in its FY08 risk assessment. Both of these techniques can be used to estimate the indirect costs. The committee agrees that their use is appropriate for the next stage of model development. DHS is planning, however, to pursue consequence modeling that is of higher fidelity and resolution than that of the modeling being used now. Such a path is not clearly justified by either data availability or currently articulated decision needs. More fine-g rained and detailed conse quence models of targets 12 Risk aversion is the reluctance of a person to accept a ba rgain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but possibly lower, expected payoff . Loss aversion refers to the tendency for people to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. J-20Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The committee is concerned about the use of too fine a granularity in the simulation. It could result in false precision that might be mistaken for accuracy in a model that is, by necessity, not particularly well validated, affecting both risk assessment and risk ma nagement. In addition, too fine a granularity decreases the transparency of the model. The committee is concer ned that merely increasing the number of parameters that need to be elicited may not increase the real or useful precision of the model. Individuals' perceptions of risks can have a ma jor influence on indirect economic consequences, resulting in a need to develop strategies to manage risk perception and to deal with these perceptions. DHS should consider decision-analytic methods for dealing with issues such as attitudes toward probabilities and consequences (the components of risk ), the role of affect and emotion, biases in judgment, and the types of rules used by individua ls and groups in choosi ng between alternatives. Recommendation 3: DHS should increase its risk analysis methodology's emphasis on risk management. Risk managers should be able to explore the impact of different investment strategies on the effects they might have on the attacker. Typical trade-offs facing U.S. risk managers might involve allocating resources among human intelligence versus vaccine deve lopment or deployment of biohazard sensors. A given resource allocation may drive a corresponding set of decisions by potential terrorists, which in turn changes risks. The current DHS event-tree PRA is no t adequate for such risk management purposes. This is so because the event-tree PRA ca nnot determine which portfolio of investments is most effective and how potential attackers are likely to respond, althou gh it does provide value in giving a coarse look at relative risks. This inadequacy hi ghlights the importance of improving the current risk analysis with red teaming, attack-preference models, attack-tree m odels, and perhaps, game-theoretic analyses or alternatives. All of these techniques will serve to m itigate the high degree of uncertainty associated with the risk analysis of biological agents. It is unclear to the committee how the current PRA approach supports DHS's design and evaluation of alternative risk management strategies. Th e computational engine does not permit, let alone encourage, risk managers to explore scenarios of \"if resource allocation, then probable consequence.\" DHS needs to determine how alternative risk ma nagement strategies, involving specific resource investments in attack prevention, consequence mitigation, or other forms of protection, translate to changes in the overall level of risk. An interface and visualization component is needed to display results and limitations of this very complex model and to improve transparency. In evaluating alternative risk management strate gies, DHS should take into account all significant benefits that result from any strategy, beyond just t hose benefits that directly impact the risks of bioterrorism attacks. For instance, investment in intelligence might include all homeland security risks, and the risk management trade-offs should be considered in that larger context. This last conclusion has ramifications for all of DHS's risk analysis and dir ectly addresses the committee's final charge. It will be more fully explored in this study's final report. DHS should develop a targeted research program to develop risk analysis methods that take into account the decision maker's risk perception and risk management strategies. Such a program would include the following, for example: consideration of how constraints on resources available to the decision maker might affect terrorist decisions, a nd an understanding of how attackers who encounter failures or setbacks in executing an initial plan will respond\u2014including the realistic possibility that they will implement contingency plans or adaptively replan to achieve goals that still appear feasible and worthwhile. 13 Methods for modeling multiple coordinated att acks by teams of adversaries should also be considered.14 These changes should all be incorporated into the next generation of DHS's bioterrorism 13 See http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA009141 .

The committee believes that these extensions can be achieved by expanding the models rather than by increasing the fidelity of existing models. SUMMARY As previously noted, each of the committee's recomme ndations relates to multiple elements of its charge. Here, responses to each element of the charge, in order, are summarized. DHS's current methodology is adequate but incomp lete. A statement of purpose is needed, as well as methods to handle intelligent adversaries. Red teaming, atta ck-preference models, attack-tree models, and game-theoretic analyses should all be examined for the purpose of supplementing the existing methodology. The analyses cited, by Buckshaw et al. (2005) and by Brown et al. (in press), are examples of other types of risk analysis that would be appropriate for DHS's future development. DHS's current plans for the incorporation of second-order indirect economic effects into its methodology are appropriate, as long as the model's level of granularity is carefully considered. High degrees of uncertainty can be addressed by the incorporation of red teaming, attack- preference models, attack-tree models, and game-the oretic analyses. The incorporation of data- quality matrices in DHS's analyses will lead to a better understanding of the sources of uncertainty. In order to improve transparency, DHS should define and use a standard lexicon, clarify concepts, and align with the contemporary literature. In order to extend the methodology to risks associ ated with classes of agents, careful elicitation of expert opinion is the best starting point. This issue will be further examined in the committee's final report. No examination was made in this interim repor t of the feasibility of extending the methodology to serve as a framework for risk analysis of chemical or radioactive threats.
