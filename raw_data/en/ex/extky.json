The brand claims that their supplement shrinks hemorrhoids and soothes itching and burning. But does Hem Healer contain ingredients proven to have these effects in medical studies, or are these just marketing claims? Does the supplement contain any unhealthy additive ingredients? Do oral supplements for hemorrhoids even work? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of Hem Healer? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze the ingredients in Hem Healer based on medical studies to give our take on whether the supplement is likely to be effective, or if it's a waste of money. We'll discuss whether oral supplements make sense for hemorrhoids, what some research-backed natural treatments for hemorrhoids are, and feature real user reviews of this brand. Ingredient Analysis Hem Healer has three active ingredients, as shown above: diosmin, hesperidin, and horse chestnut extract. Diosmin is a chemical compound derived from citrus fruits, and it has been studied for the treatment of hemorrhoids. A [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11141716/) published in the Clinical Therapeutics journal found that diosmin reduced hemorrhoidal pain by 79% and hemorrhoidal bleeding by 67%, however the dose used was 900 milligrams (mg) per day, or twice the per-serving dose that exists in Hem Healer. A 2015 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893991/) found that diosmin and hesperidin (another ingredient in Hem Healer) reduced pain associated with hemorrhoids. Hesperidin is another flavonoid compound derived from citrus fruits. While we can't find any clinical trials showing this compound to be effective in isolation, a 1997 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9184951/) reported that hesperidin combined with diosmin was \"safe, acceptable, and effective in the treatment of hemorrhoids of pregnancy.\" Horse chestnut extract was described as potentially effective for the treatment of hemorrhoids in a [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11302778/) published in the Alternative Medicine Review journal. The inactive ingredients in Hem Healer are shown below: These ingredients are likely safe and non-toxic. Overall, we consider Hem Healer potentially effective for the treatment of hemorrhoids. All three of its active ingredients have research backing, although we can't identify any clinical trials proving these ingredients to be effective at the dose in this supplement. But do hemorrhoid supplements even work? We'll discuss that question in the next section. Do Hemorrhoid Supplements Even Work? A YouTube creator named \"Dad Reviews with @Lanevids\" discussed his experience using various at-home hemorrhoids treatments: An interview with a doctor on the Rachel Ray Show is under three minutes long and discusses several potential at-home remedies for relieving hemorrhoids for good: Will Hem Healer Cause Side Effects? Hem Healer doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials, which makes it challenging to determine whether or not the supplement is likely to cause side effects. However, we can make an educated guess based on its ingredients. Diosmin was not shown to cause any serious side effects, even at higher doses than in Hem Healer, in a [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455100/) published in the Vascular Health and Risk Management journal. Hesperidin is described as a \"non-toxic antioxidant\" in a 2019 [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952680/). Horse chestnut seed extract was described as \"generally well tolerated\" and only likely to cause mild side effects in a 2009 [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19247403/). As stated in the ingredient analysis section, we consider the inactive ingredients in this supplement to be non-toxic and safe. Overall, we consider Hem Healer unlikely to cause any serious side effects based on a review of its ingredients. However, we would recommend that patients with pre-existing conditions speak with their doctor prior to taking this supplement. But how do real users rate and describe the effects of Hem Healer? We'll discuss in the next section.
