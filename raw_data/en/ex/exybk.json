Opioid medications, once the mainstay of pain therapy across the spectrum, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) guidelines recommend that non-opioid pain medications are preferred for chronic pain outside of certain indications (cancer, palliative and end of life care). Mindfulness, hypnosis, acupuncture and yoga are four examples of mind-body techniques that are often used in the adult population for pain and symptom management. In addition to providing significant pain relief, several studies have reported reduced use of opioid medications when mind-body therapies are implemented. Mind-body medicine is another approach that can be used in children with both acute and chronic pain to improve pain management and quality of life.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2017-06-20", "cleaned_text": "A Mind-Body Approach to Pediatric Pain Management [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) Over 11 million children have special health care needs and about 60% of them have difficulty participating in any activity [ [2](#B2-children-04-00050)]. In one cross-sectional study of pain prevalence in a pediatric hospital, the authors found that out of 241 patients, 27% had pain at the time of admission and 77% experienced pain at some point during their admission; what is more, pain medication was found to be single-agent and administered irregularly [ [3](#B3-children-04-00050)]. [4](#B4-children-04-00050), For example, the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association's most recent position statement supports and encourages the competent practice of complementary therapies for the purpose of promoting holistic end-of-life-care. 2. The Problem 2.1. What Is Pain [6](#B6-children-04-00050), [7](#B7-children-04-00050)]. In addition to the physical sensation, pain behaviors are also influenced by pain perception. In a recent randomized control trial, pain sensitivity was assessed in over 700 adult patients with major depression. It was found that those suffering from major depression had higher pain sensitivity even after adjusting for factors such as poor sleep and physical inactivity [ [8](#B8-children-04-00050)]. Severity of anxiety also predicted decreased pain threshold. [9](#B9-children-04-00050)]. [10](#B10-children-04-00050)]. In pediatrics, there is also an added complexity when considering developmental stage and parental influence. Not only do parents often have to serve as the surrogate communicator for the patient, parents own magnification, rumination, and anxiety surrounding pain influences the child and vice versa, leading to increased pain sensitivity and fear-avoidance behaviors [ [11](#B11-children-04-00050)]. It is clear that pain is not as simple as a noxious stimulus to an extremity that sends a danger signal to the brain. 2.2. The Opioid Crisis [12](#B12-children-04-00050), [13](#B13-children-04-00050), [14](#B14-children-04-00050)]. The opioid overdose and death rates have to increase [ [15](#B15-children-04-00050), [16](#B16-children-04-00050), [17](#B17-children-04-00050), [18](#B18-children-04-00050), [19](#B19-children-04-00050), [20](#B20-children-04-00050)]. 2016 Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) guidelines state that that non-opioid therapy is preferred for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative and end-of-life care in patients over the age of 18 years. Inappropriate medication use and dosing can lead to death and disability [ [15](#B15-children-04-00050), [16](#B16-children-04-00050), [17](#B17-children-04-00050), [18](#B18-children-04-00050), [19](#B19-children-04-00050), [20](#B20-children-04-00050)]. At times, significant morbidity can result even when recommended dosage ranges are used [ [15](#B15-children-04-00050), [16](#B16-children-04-00050), [17](#B17-children-04-00050), [18](#B18-children-04-00050), [19](#B19-children-04-00050), [20](#B20-children-04-00050)]. For example, deaths have been described with the use of codeine despite dosages prescribed in the recommended range. In the case of codeine, the prodrug must be converted into morphine in the liver via the cytochrome P450 2D6 system and drug over or under conversion may be the result of genetic variation [ [21](#B21-children-04-00050)]. Furthermore, tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence present a problem even in the pediatric population and the neuropsychological effects of opioids may also be a cause for concern [ [22](#B22-children-04-00050), [23](#B23-children-04-00050), [24](#B24-children-04-00050), [25](#B25-children-04-00050)]. Opioid medications can play an important role in the treatment of pain; however, a pain management plan is not complete without including mind-body therapies. 2.3. Pain in Pediatrics [26](#B26-children-04-00050)]. Studies have shown that up to 40% of children experience pain at least weekly, and conservative estimates say chronic pain affects 20% to 35% of children and adolescents around the globe [ [27](#B27-children-04-00050)]. Despite this significant prevalence, pain often goes under-addressed. A large-scale study involving eight pediatric hospitals observed inadequate pain assessment and management for patients undergoing painful procedures, reporting that less than one-third of patients had documentation of one or more pain management interventions [ [28](#B28-children-04-00050)]. When pain becomes chronic, significant physical and psychological tolls are experienced by both the patient and their families. Often the pain itself continues into adulthood, with 17% of adult chronic pain patients reporting a history of chronic pain in childhood/adolescence [ [29](#B29-children-04-00050)]. In addition, patients with chronic pain are at increased risk for several comorbidities, including many psychiatric disorders, hyperactivity disorders, social disability, and educational/occupational disability [ [10](#B10-children-04-00050)]. This patient population also has increased use of medical services, with healthcare costs for children with moderate to severe chronic pain averaging 19.5 billion annually [ [30](#B30-children-04-00050)]. Despite approximately 1.7 million children affected by chronic pain in the US alone with approximately 20% of cases having developed from acute post-operative pain, assessment and management of pain in pediatrics continues to be a challenge [ [26](#B26-children-04-00050), [31](#B31-children-04-00050)]. Mind-body medicine can provide a different approach. The mind-body approach is one in which the strengths of the patient and family are considered. In addition, this approach focuses on designing a treatment plan that is efficacious and minimizes the need for opioid medications. Mind-body remains a relatively novel approach in medicine. Although most of the current literature focuses on adult populations and on the more conventional psychological therapies (e.g.; cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy) that share similar inherent characteristics with mind-body approaches [ [32](#B32-children-04-00050), [33](#B33-children-04-00050), [34](#B34-children-04-00050)], there is a growing body of evidence that supports other mind-body therapies as effective and practical treatment approaches in pediatrics [ [35](#B35-children-04-00050), [36](#B36-children-04-00050), [37](#B37-children-04-00050), [38](#B38-children-04-00050), [39](#B39-children-04-00050)], particularly in [41](#B41-children-04-00050), [42](#B42-children-04-00050), [43](#B43-children-04-00050), [44](#B44-children-04-00050), [45](#B45-children-04-00050)]. 3. to Pain 3.1. The Use of Mind-Body Medicine in Pain Management [46](#B46-children-04-00050)]. Mind-body therapies show promise as adjunct and at times primary treatment for pain in children and adults, and can be used across the spectrum. For example, diaphragmatic breathing stimulates the vagus nerve and promotes the relaxation response. The vagus nerve, an essential component of the autonomic nervous system, affects many of the body's internal organs including: the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. As with many therapies, a development-based approach is essential. Teens can use complex imagery, while younger children can be taught diaphragmatic breathing techniques with simple imagery, such as blowing a balloon or blowing out candles. A toddler can be encouraged to engage in diaphragmatic breathing with the use of bubbles or pin wheels. For infants or children with severe cognitive disabilities, rocking and rhythmic womb or heartbeat sounds are techniques that can encourage diaphragmatic breathing. [36](#B36-children-04-00050), [44](#B44-children-04-00050), [47](#B47-children-04-00050), [48](#B48-children-04-00050)] and can be used in a developmentally appropriate manner to serve as adjunct or primary pain management [ [47](#B47-children-04-00050), [48](#B48-children-04-00050)]. Furthermore, a reduction in opioid use may be seen. One study demonstrated a greater than 60% reduction of opioid-like medication usage following routine surgery when acupuncture was used [ [49](#B49-children-04-00050), [50](#B50-children-04-00050), [51](#B51-children-04-00050)]. Although more research is needed in the pediatric population, given the low risk and low cost of many of these techniques [ [52](#B52-children-04-00050), [53](#B53-children-04-00050), [54](#B54-children-04-00050)] for patients and potentially for insurance companies as well, their use is encouraged to enhance symptom management whenever feasible. In the next section, we give an overview of selected mind-body therapies and their function and applications in the management of pain in the pediatric population. 3.2. Selected Mind-Body Approaches 3.2.1 Meditation and Mindfulness [55](#B55-children-04-00050)]. Mindfulness, described as \"the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment\", is a meditation practice with ancient Buddhist origins that focuses on experiencing the present moment unobstructed by bias or judgmental thinking in an effort to improve cognitive and emotional well-being [ [56](#B56-children-04-00050)]. One such application of mindfulness is Kabat Zinn's Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a group intervention first introduced in 1990 that focuses on mindfulness meditation training as a complimentary therapy to the standard medical treatment of chronic pain and illness [ [57](#B57-children-04-00050), [58](#B58-children-04-00050), [59](#B59-children-04-00050), [60](#B60-children-04-00050), [61](#B61-children-04-00050), [62](#B62-children-04-00050), [63](#B63-children-04-00050), [64](#B64-children-04-00050)]. Research has suggested that mindfulness can improve symptoms associated with medical illnesses and increase quality of life [ [65](#B65-children-04-00050)]. From a neuroscientific perspective, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been conducted in hopes of identifying the neural mechanisms that are responsible for the efficacy of mindfulness meditation in pain relief [ [66](#B66-children-04-00050), [67](#B67-children-04-00050), [68](#B68-children-04-00050), [69](#B69-children-04-00050), [70](#B70-children-04-00050), thirteen skilled Zen mediators, each having had a minimum of 1000 hours of meditation experience, were recruited and experimentally exposed to pain via thermal stimuli while in an MRI [ [70](#B70-children-04-00050)]. During exposure to pain, the meditators exhibited increased brain activation in the insula, thalamus, and midcingulate cortex; areas associated with the sensory aspect of pain. Additionally, decreases in brain activity were observed within the hippocampus, amygdala, and caudate; areas responsible for the recollection, emotion, and appraisal components of pain, respectively. The authors concluded that the participants were completely aware of the sensation of pain but were able to inhibit the appraisal and emotional responses of pain. In other words, changes in the perception of pain were facilitated through the cognitive and affective components of the pain matrix rather than through the sensory properties of pain. Furthermore, the differences in brain activity were found to be inversely proportional to meditation skill level, establishing a correlation that supports the authors' hypothesis in regards to meditation's therapeutic effect on pain. As for neurophysiological findings, structural MRI results overlapped with the fMRI results: meditators were found to have thicker grey-matter in the same pain-related regions of the brain where changes in functional activity were observed [ [66](#B66-children-04-00050), [68](#B68-children-04-00050), [69](#B69-children-04-00050)]. [62](#B62-children-04-00050)]. Nonetheless, mindfulness as it relates to pain in children has not been extensively studied and although mindfulness meditation has shown to be beneficial in classroom and school settings for improving psychological distress [ [74](#B74-children-04-00050), [75](#B75-children-04-00050), [76](#B76-children-04-00050), [77](#B77-children-04-00050)], more research is required in order to determine whether the same effects can be translated in children and pediatric medicine. 3.2.2. Hypnosis [78](#B78-children-04-00050), [79](#B79-children-04-00050), [80](#B80-children-04-00050)]; it is only since the 1980s that it has been meaningfully applied to pediatric care [ [81](#B81-children-04-00050), [82](#B82-children-04-00050)]. [82](#B82-children-04-00050)]. During induction, the provider encourages patient relaxation by asking them to imagine a calm and serene setting on which they can focus all of their attention. Next, the patient is given therapeutic suggestions to achieve the desired effect. Lastly, the patient is asked to leave their imagined setting and to return to normal consciousness. Hypnosis for pain management follows this same protocol with a focus on suggestions that either turn down or decrease pain perception or increase pain thresholds [ [83](#B83-children-04-00050)]. [84](#B84-children-04-00050), [85](#B85-children-04-00050)] and age, thus suggesting that hypnosis may be an especially viable form of therapy for pain management in the pediatric population [ [82](#B82-children-04-00050)]. [85](#B85-children-04-00050), [86](#B86-children-04-00050), [87](#B87-children-04-00050), [88](#B88-children-04-00050)]. In other words, many researchers have set out to investigate how hypnosis affects the brain's neural-networks and physiology that in turn, are responsible for the perception of pain within an individual. This \"pain matrix\", as it has been described, is comprised of specific areas of the brain that collectively produce the experience of pain. In the simplest summary of the current literature, the components of the pain matrix include: the prefrontal cortex, frontal thalamus and insula. The cerebellum, though not technically a component of the pain matrix, also plays a role. Using fMRIs to measure brain activity during hypnosis, researchers have concluded that by influencing activity in the various components of the pain matrix, hypnosis is indeed able to have a collective therapeutic effect on pain. [78](#B78-children-04-00050)]. When compared to groups receiving standard treatment and groups receiving no treatment, 75% of participants receiving hypnotic suggestion experienced a greater analgesic effect. Furthermore, the effect was seen with both clinical and experimental pain with no significant difference between the two settings. 3.2.3. Yoga [89](#B89-children-04-00050)]. Beyond the biophysical benefits, yoga is also inexpensive, can be practiced by people of any age and physical skill level, and can be performed almost anywhere. The side effects are minimal, with the most common being musculoskeletal injury, often resulting from inappropriate supervision and/or technique [ [90](#B90-children-04-00050)]. [91](#B91-children-04-00050)]. In a 2006 meta-analysis, when yoga was incorporated into school curricula, improvements in academic performance, behavior, concentration, emotional balance, and self-esteem were all seen [ [92](#B92-children-04-00050)]. Regular practice of yoga has been associated with improvement in mood and function in patients suffering from depression [ [93](#B93-children-04-00050)]. [94](#B94-children-04-00050)]. A study of 30 children, aged 11-18, with amplified pain syndromes enrolled in an intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program incorporating 5-6 h of yoga weekly demonstrated improved pain and functioning without the use of pharmacology therapy [ [95](#B95-children-04-00050)]. Positive effects have also been shown in pediatric patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ [96](#B96-children-04-00050)]. Current evidence is encouraging, but more large-scale research is still needed to determine the efficacy of yoga in the treatment of pediatric chronic pain [ [39](#B39-children-04-00050)]. 3.2.4. Acupuncture [97](#B97-children-04-00050)]. First acknowledged as a medical therapy by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 1997, the number of licensed acupuncturists in the US has grown exponentially over the decades with over 27,000 licensed acupuncturists in 2013\u2014a one hundred percent increase from 2000\u2014and an estimated one million annual American consumers. In 2001, Battlefield Acupuncture, an auricular acupuncture procedure, was developed by Richard Niemtzow as a simple and effective method for rapid pain relief that can be performed with minimal training by non-licensed acupuncturists [ [98](#B98-children-04-00050), [99](#B99-children-04-00050), [100](#B100-children-04-00050)]. Since then, it has since been utilized in emergency rooms and has been taught to US military and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) personnel for use in both medical and battlefield environments a viable alternative for the treatment and management of acute and chronic pain across various illnesses [ [22](#B22-children-04-00050), [103](#B103-children-04-00050), [113](#B113-children-04-00050), [114](#B114-children-04-00050), [115](#B115-children-04-00050)]. One overview of Cochrane reviews concluded that acupuncture demonstrates effectiveness as a treatment for pain associated with migraines, tension headaches, neck disorders, arthritis, and low back that acupuncture stimulates nerves and muscles located within the acupuncture points and trigger a release of neurochemicals endorphins such as serotonin, oxytocin, and endogenous opioid peptides and therefore result in an analgesic effect [ [117](#B117-children-04-00050), [123](#B123-children-04-00050), [127](#B127-children-04-00050)]. However, while substantial research has shown acupuncture to be an effective therapy for pain among the adult population, there is limited research on acupuncture in regards to the treatment of pain among pediatric patients. Nonetheless, what little research does exist concludes that acupuncture is an effective and feasible therapy option for pain in pediatric populations [ [48](#B48-children-04-00050), [103](#B103-children-04-00050), [130](#B130-children-04-00050), [131](#B131-children-04-00050), [132](#B132-children-04-00050), [133](#B133-children-04-00050), [134](#B134-children-04-00050)]. One study in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) that used acupuncture for acute post-operative pain in children showed that acupuncture was highly accepted and well tolerated without morbidity. In addition, the majority (70%) of patients and families surveyed believed that acupuncture helped their pain. This particular study used the Japanese form of acupuncture with fine needles for older children and Shonishin (a non-needling technique using special tools) for those who were younger than two years of age [ [135](#B135-children-04-00050)]. A number of other articles have also shown some perceived pain relief without significant adverse effects due to acupuncture. [ [136](#B136-children-04-00050), [137](#B137-children-04-00050)] 4.
