It provided funding for the purchase of 23 -valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine for all adults aged 65 years and a single revaccination after 5 years. A second revaccination was also recommended for those first vaccinated before 65 years of age. It was introduced simultaneously with the National Childhood Pneumococcal Immunisation Program, and followed several regional vaccination programs for Indigenous adults, the Victorian elderly pneumococcal program from 1998 and the National Indigenous Pneumococcal and Influenza Immunisation Program for Indigenous adults from 1999. Methods The evaluation consists of three major components: a process evaluation, system description and outcome/impact analysis. It covers the 4-year period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2008. Results Program implementation Key informants reported the program to be successfully impl emented, effectively capitalising on the strengths of immunisation service provision in Australia, in particular the Older Australians Influenza Immunisation Program. Commonwealth promotional resources were valued but also supplemented by materials from th e jurisdictions. A number of issues and barriers to the delivery of the program were identified. These included the short time -frame for implementation, concern at the lack of an immunisation register for this age group with consequent difficulty in ascert aining vaccination status or coverage in a timely way . The simultaneous rollout of the childhood and the older Australians pneumococcal immunisation programs was also mentioned as an issue, as it caused confusion among providers, with some having difficult y in distinguishing the two vaccines ( 7-valent some reported instances of Pneumovax 23TM (23vPPV) supplies being discarded after the annual influenza season, due to providers not being aware shelf life was longer than that of influenza vaccine. The following recommendations are made regarding program implementation: Allow a minimum of 9 months for planning program implementation. Should the p rogram be expected to continue into the medium term, establish an immunisation register or some other effective means to provide timely coverage data and retrieve vaccination status information on individuals . This is a particular priority for the 23vPPV p rogram, given its relatively complicated revaccination recommendations. Promote Pneumovax 23TM vaccination during the whole year. Consider having a set time of year for implementation of new programs and/or stagger different vaccines where possible. Centra lly produce educational and promotional materials available for immunisation providers and clients. 6 Promotional materials for the general public should be engaging and attractive, while those for providers should be concise. Expand web -based and other onl ine information for quick and easy access by providers. Pay s pecial attention to information needs where more than one vaccine is launched. Available data systems Three main sources of data were available for evaluating the outcomes and impacts of the Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program. These were invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD) notifications provided by the Enhanced IPD Surveillance Working Group, national adverse events following immunisation reports provided by the Therapeutic Good s Administration, and vaccination coverage estimates from computer assisted telephone interview surveys conducted by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA ) and some jurisdictions. These sources were vitally important ; however , limitations were identified that either restrict or affect the quality of output. The following recommendations have been developed. National IPD surveillance, including enhanced data, have provided critically important data for monitoring the impact of pneum ococcal vaccination. However, issues remain to be resolved with respect to data completeness, timely collation and reliable transfer to DoHA. The establishment of a single complete historical national dataset that is updated with additional annual datasets in a timely way should be a priority. The monitoring of vaccination coverage in adults has been limited by irregular national surveys, with only one post -program survey available for this evaluation, conducted in 2006. In the absence of a national adult o r pneumococcal immunisation register as mentioned above, annual surveys should be conducted to enable timely program monitoring. Collecting vaccination status data for a vaccine with complicated revaccination recommendations, such as pneumococcal vaccine, requires more attention to data validity than for influenza vaccine, which is recommended annually. Individual studies have provided variable estimates of validity, and an assessment of the exact questions used in the adult vaccination survey, including v erification by providers, should be conducted. Vaccination coverage, vaccine safety and disease impact The Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program appears to have resulted in a modest increase in vaccination coverage. In 2004 , an estimated 51% of eligible survey respondents had been vaccinated in the previous 5 years, increasing to 62% in 2006. As the estimated national influenza vaccination coverage in 2006 was 7 8% there is room for improvement of 23vPPV coverage. Reports of adverse events wer e predominantly mild injection site reactions and consistent with the known safety profile of this vaccine. There was a 31% decrease in total IPD notification rate in those aged 65 years not recorded as Indigenous from Australian jurisdictions excluding Victoria between 2002 -2004 and 2007 -2008. However, the decrease was limited to serotypes in the 7vPCV, which decreased by 72%, while IPD due to serotypes contained only in the 23vPPV increased by 49%. The most likely explanation for this pattern is a decre ase in 7vPCV -type IPD due to herd immunity effects of childhood immunisation, which has been reported in several other countries. Therefore , an impact on notifications of 7 IPD from th e Older Australians program cannot be demonstrated, possibly due to the herd immunity effects of 7vPCV, as well as the modest increase in coverage and the limited effectiveness of the 23vPPV. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness ( VE) for 23vPPV in elderly Australians were 32.5% (95%CI : -20 to 62) using the indirect cohort method, as at 2005, and 56.9% (95%CI : 42-68) using the screening method , as at 2005 -2006. They are consistent with the extensive international literature on effectiveness of the 23vPPV. However, these estimates may not represent VE in more recent years due to the substantial changes in serotype distribution caused by the use of 7vPCV. New , currently licensed , higher valency conjugate vaccines, if introduced into the N ational Immunisation Program for children, could also be expected to result in herd immunity effect s in the elderly , from a broader range of serotypes, further decreasing the potential benefit of 23vPPV . 8 CHAPTER 1. Introduction 9 Pneumococcal disease is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Pneumococci are frequently isol ated from the upper respiratory tract and can spread directly from the nasopharynx to cause infection in other parts of the respiratory tract (otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia) or enter the bloodstream. Prior to widespread conjugate pneumococcal vaccinat ion pneumococcus was the most common bacterial cause of acute otitis media in developed countries, which in turn was the most common bacterial infection treated by paediatricians1, and the cause of approximately 60% of pneumonia, the 6th most common cause of death in Australia.2 Following bloo dstream invasion, clinical manifestations include meningitis, pneumonia and infection at a number of less common sites, as well as septicaemia without focal infection. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined as a sterile site isolate of Streptococcu s pneumoniae , usually from blood. To date, 90 capsular antigenic types have been recognised, each eliciting type -specific immunity . The age groups with the highest rates of IPD are children <2 years of age and adults >85 years of age. Rates are substantial ly higher in those with medical or other risk factors such as chronic respiratory or cardiac disease, immunosuppression of any cause, in Indigenous Australians and smokers . At the commencement of the Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program , there were two pneumococcal vaccines available in Australia : Pneumovax 23 (CSL Biotherapies/Merck & Co Inc .) licensed in 1986 and Prevenar (Wyeth Australia Ltd) licensed in 2000.3,4 Pneumovax polysaccharide serotypes of pneumococcus , is effective in reducing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults and the immunocompete nt elderly , but has a limited response in children <2 years of age . It has substantially reduced effectiveness 5 years after vaccination, little or no impact on nasopharyngeal carriage or non -invasive disease, and does not elicit a booster response . 3,5,6 In contrast, Prevenar , a 7-valent pneumococcal pneumococcal polysacc haride serotypes conjugate d to a diphtheria toxin protein. The so -called 'conjugate' vaccines induce a T -cell, or memory, immune response and an effective response in the immature immune system of infants . The 7vPCV is effective in reducing morbidity and m ortality from IPD in children <2 years of age and does reduce or eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes. The 7vPCV has demonstrated impacts on non - invasive disease and herd immunity effects in unvaccinated age groups in some settings . It is licensed only for use in children from 2 months to 9 years of age.1,3 It includes the seven serotypes that were the most common cause of IPD in US children prior to widespread vaccination, all of which are also in the 23vPPV. Prior to the widespread use of pneumococc al conjugate vaccine , between 2002 - 2004, approximately 68% of IPD in the elderly was due to the seven serotypes in the conjugate vaccine, and 95% was due to the 23 serotypes in the 23vPPV. The National Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program c ommenced in January 2005 , at the same time as the National C hildhood Pneumococcal Immunisation Program . The Australian government funded the 23vPPV for adults 65 years in all states and territories.7,8 The 23vPPV has been available through a range of publicly funded programs prior to the national program for the elderly. In 1991, a pneumococcal immunisation program for Indigenous adults was conducted in some parts of the Kimberley region of Western Australia which became Kimberley -wide from 1996.9,10 In Queensland, a targeted pneumococcal and influenza program commenced in 1996 for Indigenous adults in Cape York which was extended to the Torres Strait and Cairns in 1997.11,12 The following year, a state -wide Indigenous pneumococcal and influenza immunisatio n program funded by Queensland Health commenced.11,12 The Northern 10 Territory Government Department of Health and Famili es has also recommended pneumococcal vaccines for Indigenous adults since the early 1990s but in 1995 actively promoted this vaccine to Indigenous adults , and since May 2000 has funded vaccines to all Indigenous individuals aged 15 years.13 From 1999 onwards, the National Indigenous Pneumococcal and Influenza Immunisation (NIPII) Program funded 23vPPV for Indigenous adults aged 15 years with risk factors and all Indig enous adults aged 50 years.14 Since 1997 , 23vPPV has been recommended for all individuals aged 65 years3 and available at a subsidised cost through the Government 's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In Victoria, a universal pneumococcal immunisation program for the elderly commenced in 1998.15,16 The 23vPPV is also recommended for those aged 10 years with medical or other conditions putting them at increased risk of IPD. For those first vaccinated at 65 years of age a single revaccination is recommended 5 years after the first dose. For those first vaccinated at <65 years of age , a second revaccination is recommended, either 5 years after the second dose, or at 65 years of age , whichever is later.3 Evaluation of the Older Australi ans Pneumococcal Immunisation Program The National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), as part of its responsibilities under the 2005 -2009 funding agreement with the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA), has t he lead role in evaluati ons of National Immunisation Program ( NIP) vaccines. Evaluations are conducted according to a standard protocol agreed with DoHA, consisting of a Systems description, Process evaluation, and an analysis of Outcomes (adverse events f ollowing immunisation, vaccination coverage) and Impacts (morbidity and mortality). Evaluations are conducted in liaison with key stakeholders, in particular the National Immunisation Committee (NIC). T he evaluation of the O lder Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program was conducted during 2009 concurrently with an evaluation of the National Childhood Pneumococcal Immunisation Program . NCIRS has previously submitted unpublished evaluation reports on the National Indigenous Pneumococcal and Influenza I mmunisation (NIPII) Program in 2004 ,17 the National Q Fever Immunisation Program (200 4), the National Meningococcal C Program (2007), and the National Adolescent Pertussis Immunisation Program (2009), as well as a published report on the National Measles Control Progam .18 11 CHAPTER 2. Process Evaluation 12 Aims The purpose of conducting a process evaluation of the pneumococcal immunisation program is to describe the planning, implementation and delivery of the program, the achievements and any obstacles encountered. Chapter s cope and structure The evaluation was limited to a review of publicly available documents, materials provided by state/ territory immunisation program managers and a survey of key informants. The results section of the report is divided into two major sect ions: Part 1 summarises the key aspects of the planning, implementation and delivery of the national program. Part 2 summarises the strengths and challenges in the planning, implementation and delivery of the program as identified by key informants (based on experience with the program implementation) and informants' recommendations for future immunisation programs. Methods Information sources Sources reviewed to obtain information about the planning and implementation of the pneumococcal immunisation pro gram included: available media releases; information documents written for providers and parents and available on health department websites; reports and data provided by the states and territories; and information obtained from a survey of key informants. Survey of key informants The survey was conducted between March and August 2009. The key informants surveyed (listed in the acknowledgements) were staff from the Department of Health and Ageing, state and territory program managers and other relevant staf f, and four Divisions of General Practice/State Based Organisation immunisation coordinators (SBOICs). The SBOICs were nominated by Ms Helen Moore; they were involved at the general practice or Divisional level at the time of program commencement, although none were in their current roles as SBOIC at that time. Twenty -two people were surveyed, of whom only 55% (12) were in their current roles in 2005. Those 12 included representatives from six states and territories and one from DoHA. Key informants were se nt a questionnaire by email prior to a structured telephone interview, which was audio -digitally recorded with consent of the respondent. Questionnaire The structured questionnaire used for the telephone survey of key informants was developed by NCIRS st aff based on previous national immunisation program evaluations.17,19,20 The questionnaire contained both open and closed questions and sought information about: program development and planning including funding, the communication strategy, vaccine supply and distribution implementation of the program surveillance of adverse events following immunisation (AEF I) 13 monitoring of vaccine coverage, wastage and leakage participants' views regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the pneumococcal immunisation program planning, and their recommendations for future immunisation campaigns. This information was sought in a series of open questions in the telephone interview (see Appendix ). The answers from the telephone interviews were transcribed and drafts sent back to the informants for their comments. All changes and additional information from the informants were inc orporated into the final versions of the transcribed questionnaire. Data analysis Survey responses were collated in an Excel spreadsheet. Content analysis was conducted to identify prominent themes nominated by key informants regarding strengths and weakne sses of the pneumococcal immunisation program and informants' recommendations for future programs. Results Part 1: Planning, implementation and delivery of the program This section summarises key features of the planning, implementation and delivery of the program including the roles and responsibilities of DoHA, jurisdictions and immunisation providers. However, it was difficult to obtain detailed information on specific roles and responsibilities as only half of all key informants and none of the SBOIC s were in their current positions in 2005. Responses were often of a general nature. Any specific information provided in a particular area has been clearly stated in the relevant section. Funding The Australian Government allocated funding for the Older Au stralians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program and the announcement was made by the then federal Minister for Health and Ageing in two media releases, on 11 June and 7 December 2004.7,8 It was announced that from 1 January 2005 the Australian government would provide free pneumococcal vaccine to all Australians aged 65 years. From 1 January 2005, funds were made available to the states and territories for purchasing Pneu movax 23 , through the usual arrangement under the Australian Immunisation Agreements (AIA). Funding of $28,554,188 was provided to jurisdictions in 2005 to purchase vaccine to cover the period of the AIA s up to 2009. The funds allowed for 85% vaccine cove rage of the entire population aged 65 years during that period and 15% for wastage and leakage of vaccines. Performance indicators were negotiated between DoHA and the state and territory governments as part of the AIAs. Funds provided by DoHA did not inc lude an allocation for service delivery and state and territory governments provided additional funds for this in some instances. Communication The communication strategy included a national component that focused on the broader aspects of the Older Aust ralians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program, a local component that provided information about delivery of the program in each state and territory , and a State Based Organisation/Division of General Practice component. 14 National communication strategy DoHA de veloped a communication campaign that used a combination of mass media and direct communications to notify the Australian public and health professionals about the program. Mass media communication strategies included media releases and interviews by the t hen Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott.7,8 In addition, information for consumers and immunisation providers about pneumococcal disease was posted on the nati onal Immunise Australia website, and provided through the national immunisation telephone help line. The Department of Veterans' Affairs also had promotional activities for pneumococcal vaccinations (e.g. articles in Vetaffairs , a newspaper for the veteran community; mail -outs to immunisation providers). A comprehensive information package was sent by DoHA to all general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses to inform them of the National Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program. The package in cluded a tear-off pad (information provided as Q&As for the general public) , posters and provider guidelines. The DoHA promotional materials were circulated to NIC for comments prior to distribution. DoHA also utilised the existing strategy for the over 65 year olds influenza vaccinations for promoting the pneumococcal program. The education was targeted at GPs as the 65 year olds and over had proven to be compliant with GP advice. Jurisdictional communication strategies The jurisdictional communication s trategies varied though all states/territories included information on their health department websites, provided information through their immuni sation telephone help lines and did local media releases (Table 1). All jurisdictions, except Victoria, used t he DoHA promotional materials. In addition, jurisdictions held educational sessions and disseminated information about the program to immunisation providers through the relevant health department, population health units and the State Based Organisations/D ivisions of General Practice. The program was promoted primarily along with the seasonal influenza program in all states/territories using posters, pamphlets, T -shirts promoting vaccine days, DoHA resources and the resource materials developed by the vacci ne companies. In Victoria, as this was the 8th year of their immunisation program, promotional activities from previous years were continued, although less intensive than would be expected at the launch of a new program. Other state/territory health depart ments also promoted and educated specific healthcare providers in some instances, e.g. NSW Health promoted the program to Justice Health; and the South Australian Department of Health promoted and educated pharmacies and aged care centre staff on maintaini ng consistency in vaccination recording systems and practices. The inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccine on vaccine order forms developed by the jurisdictions for recording the number of vaccine doses in stock/fridge and the number of doses required by imm unisation providers also alerted immunisation providers about the program. 15 Table1.

I mmunisation providers who were unable to be present for the educational sessions could attend by videoconference. Information was also disseminated via newsletters and emails, though a significant proportion of general practices did not have computer access at that time. Immunisation providers could also order promotional materials if they needed them. Information wa s also provided in the consultation room or in the treatment room , posted behind toilet doors , via phone messages , by TV advertisements in the waiting area , or by computer printouts. There was a joint approach (e.g. regular meetings, consultation) between State Based Organisations/Divisions of General Practice and the jurisdictions in the delivery of immunisation programs as reported by all Division of General Practice key informants. Examples of collaborations were reported, between general practitioners, State Based Organisations/Divisions of General Practice, state/territory health departments and/or Aboriginal Medical Services. These were both to deliver the program and to raise patients' awareness of the importance of pneumococcal vaccinations. In the Australian Capital Territory, combined educational sessions (for the childhood and adult pneumococcal immunisation programs) were held on a range of topics. The State Based Organisations/Divisions of General Practice distributed Commonwealth and jurisdicti onal information resources to inform immunisation providers and prepared them for the rollout of the immunisation program. The pharmaceutical company had their own information sheets and advertisements for the general public and immunisation service provid ers. The amount of industry involvement in the dissemination of resource materials varied across states/territories and was most prominent in the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Vaccine The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing provided funding to the states/territories to purchase Pneumovax 23TM from 2005 onwards which was similar to the arrangements for other vaccines, as mentioned earlier , and each jurisdiction was responsible for va ccine distribution to local immunisation providers. Existing local distribution and storage systems were used, but due to the large number of vaccines and the joint launch with the childhood program, expansion of these systems was necessary in some jurisdi ctions. The number of doses and area of distribution were monitored and an even supply of the vaccine was maintained by the jurisdictions. State/territory health departments collected data on the distribution of Pneumovax 23, specifically on the number of doses distributed by each general practice by area by month. Wastage was estimated based on the resident age cohort, numbers of doses administered and th e numbers of vaccine doses distributed. There was a requirement that leakage and wastage combined was less than 15% for the pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax 23TM). In addition, jurisdictions collected vaccine coverage information by a range of methods and r eported this in the annual AIA acquittal performance report. National computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) surveys collecting pneumococcal coverage data were undertaken in 200421 and 2006 (unpublished), and also in New South Wales,22-26 Western Australia27 and South Australia .28-30 17 Annually, jurisdictional health departments provided general practice specific data to GPs on the number of doses they used in the previous year. Leakage data was not collected directly, but could be estimated by the majority of jurisdiction s (Western Australia, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and New South Wales) from CATI surveys or other methods. Further details were not available. Implementation and delivery Planning for the implementation include d jurisdictions ensuring immunisation providers had all supporting documentation (e.g. inclusion of Pneumovax 23TM in forms) and that jurisdictions had communication strategies in place. GPs provided the majority of vaccinations nationally and in most juri sdictions, but Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs), pharmacies, correctional services, nursing homes and aged care facilities were also involved. All jurisdictions incorporated components of the Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation P rogram into the existing infrastructure and processes used to deliver NIP vaccines to people aged 65 years. The program commenced in January 2005 and was simultaneously implemented across all jurisdictions. An ongoing catch -up strategy was based on age -appropriate recomm endations. There was no special committee or changes to reporting for AEFI in all jurisdictions , except Victoria where , after 2007, all AEFI were reported to the Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC ) system instead of directly to the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC ). To date, Victoria is the only jurisdiction that has conducted an evaluation of the outcomes and impact of the pneumococcal immunisation program among the elderly.15,16 However, the evaluation was done prior to the rollout of the national program and did not include a process evaluation. 18 Part 2: Stakeholder views - strengths, wea knesses and recommendations There were strengths and challenges in implementation of the program as expressed by key informants. Funding Funding was allocated annually for the ongoing program and as a lump sum payment for the catch -up at the beginning of t he universal program, part of which was rolled over to following years. There were difficulties referred to by one jurisdiction regarding reporting an under -spend in the first year, rollover of funds, and running out of money in subsequent years. Funding s pread over several years may have enabled better management of immunisation services. Most jurisdictional representatives also expressed the need for funding service delivery. Communication The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing communic ation materials were considered useful and valued by most jurisdictions. The education and resources provided by the state/territory health departments were also an identified strength of the program (the Northern Territory, South Australia, Victoria). The majority of key informants from the jurisdictions and Division s of General Practice reported that there were difficulties distinguishing the two vaccines (7vPCV and 23vPPV) and occasional instances where they were used interchangeably, i.e. given to the wrong age group. A Division of G eneral Practice key representative also reported that the complicated recommendations for revaccination (i .e. one revaccination for some, two for others) was not clarified sufficiently in the promotional material. Furthermor e, there have been no updated national Indigenous specific resources since 2004. The strategy of promoting the vaccine (Pneumovax 23TM) to be given during the winter season with the influenza vaccine was successful. However, some jurisdictional and Divis ion of G eneral Practice key informants stressed that this may result in vaccine being discarded prematurely, as its shelf life is about 18 months, and may also lead to missed opportunities to vaccinate during the rest of the year. Hence, there was an empha sis on the importance of promoting the vaccine during the rest of the year. Seventeen key informants rated the DoHA communication resource materials (Table 2) and provided their comments. The most common rating for all three resources was 'good'. Fewer re spondents provided a rating for the provider guidelines, as respondents felt immunisation providers should be asked to rate those. The majority of the key informants said that the DoHA communication resources were a good thing and representatives from one jurisdiction mentioned that it was regrettable that they were no longer provided in new immunisation programs. Although most key informants said that the content of the educational resources was good, they commented that the layout and format majority of Divisions of General Practice representatives reported that GPs liked 'minimalist information' since they do not have time to read and pref erred to call someone for information (e.g. the Immunisation Help Line). Most jurisdictional representatives stressed the importance of providing appropriate information to people to avoid confusion , i.e. getting the right information out to the right peo ple at the right time , and that all key stakeholders be involved in the communication strategy to ensure clear communication between them. In addition, key informants advocated clear and concise information in press releases and 19 promotional materials for p roviders and in raising community awareness of the immunisation programs. Furthermore, most key informants suggested that the information in DoHA educational resources should be in dot points; more reader friendly; have a summary of short and sharp key mes sages upfront; be limited to one page; be updated every year; be timely; have a lower level of readability ; and have colours and graphics incorporated. The majority of immunisation coordinators from the Divisions of General Practice recommended 'keeping up with the times' (e.g. website information, updating of clinical software) so that the information resources were simple , and easy and quick to access. I t was reported that, in the last 5 years, some general practices have been poster -free and brochure -free, so alternative sources of information are needed. In the future, more software development would be needed for providing more online immunisation -related information to providers during consultations. Table 2.

However, most jurisdictional and Divisions of General Pract ice representatives stated that there were logistical issues in distributing vaccine and vaccine management issues (e.g. storage , particularly during influenza season, cold chain maintenance). The provider fridges were inadequate at the time of implementat ion and storage capacity was strained by the simultaneous introduction of the Childhood and Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Programs. In addition, in the initial months of implementation of the program in 2005, there was a short shelf life ('use-by date ') on the Pneumovax 23TM vaccines which led to expired stock and wastage (e.g. in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales). Implementation and delivery The seasonal influenza immunisation program was a good trigger for uptake of pneumoc occal vaccinations annually. The seasonal influenza program enhanced the pneumococcal program. However, most jurisdictional and Division of General Practice key informants reported that it was confusing at times for clients because there was a risk that so me adults may have had more Pneumovax 23TM vaccinations than recommended , i.e. received a second dose 1 year later . Though the uptake of pneumococcal vaccinations was facilitated by the influenza immunisation program, there was a reported shortage of the i nfluenza vaccine in 2005 (e.g. the Australian Capital Territory) that could have affected uptake of the adult pneumococcal vaccin e. All jurisdictional representatives and immunisation coordinators from the Divisions of General Practice unanimously reported that there was a short time -frame for the rollout of the program. The 1st of January (just after the Christmas holiday season) was not considered a good time for implementation of immunisation programs that required preparation and considerable resources during December and January. The implementation of the program was 'rushed' and most staff were not able to take leave during the holiday season and had to work harder and longer. Notwithstanding the information provided nationally and in some instances by others, most jurisdictional and Divisions of General Practice representatives reported that the rollout of both the Childhood and the Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Programs at the same time in January 2005 caused significant confusion among providers. GPs and pharmacists reported confusion and difficulty in distinguishing the two pneumococcal vaccines (7vPCV and 23vPPV), as previously reported. Two jurisdictions did not report this difficulty; in the Northern Territory , the Indigenous childho od and adult programs were already extensive and well established, while in Victoria , there was an adult pneumococcal immunisation program already in place since 1998. The majority of key informants from the State Based Organisations/Divisions of General Practice recommended that the introduction of new immunisation programs and updating of the immunisation schedule should occur at a known set time in the year rather than in ad hoc stages during the year. This would assist with ongoing planning and educati on (including development and running of the education programs) before the vaccines arrived in the fridges of general practices. They also suggested separating the introduction of similar adult and childhood programs to avoid provider confusion. Immunisa tion register issue The lack of immunisation records of clients may have affected vaccinations since there was no personal health record card or immunisation register to identify people's vaccination status and the duration of time from the last dose. This information is 21 more important for 23vPPV than for influenza vaccine, due to its more complicated revaccination recommendations. Hence, there were instances of reported over - vaccination because the adult pneumococcal vaccine was promoted with the seasonal influenza vaccinations, given on a yearly basis. In addition, an issue raised by one Division of General Practice key representative was the impact of changing of paper -based records to electronic health records in general practices, where not all retrospe ctive data of patients may have been entered in the new database and there could have been missing information. All key informants recommended a centralised database or 'whole -of-life' immunisation register that would provide better information, especially for adult immunisation programs. Discussion, summary and recommendations Implementation of the national pneumococcal immunisation program was a cooperative effort between DoHA, the state and territory governments, general practitioners, local government a nd community health providers. It commenced in all jurisdictions on 1 January 2005. The program effectively capitalised on the strengths of immunisation service provision in Australia, in particular the Older Australians Influenza Immunisation Program. Med ia publicity and professional communication networks were used to inform immunisation providers and the public about the program. While the implementation strategy was effective in making pneumococcal vaccinations available to a large number of adults, a n umber of issues and barriers to the implementation of the program were identified by key informants that indicated improvements could be made to future programs. Successful implementation of 23vPPV with influenza vaccination is supported by studies that f ound influenza vaccination is significantly associated with pneumococcal vaccination status and physician recommendation for vaccination was an important factor in influencing patient behaviour.31,32 However, there were some reported instances of over -vaccination, and the simultaneous implementation of two adult programs with different revaccination schedules may have contributed to this. All jurisdictional and Division of General Practice key informants reported concern at the lack of an immunisation register and the difficulty of ascertainment of adul t pneumococcal vaccination status. This is a particular issue for 23vPPV, which has complicated revaccination recommendations and the risk of harm if over -vaccination occurs. This is consistent with a study of primary care internists and family physicians in the USA that found that one of the reported barriers for adult pneumococcal vaccination was the absence of patient immuni sation history.33 Also, in the absence of a register , jurisdictions rely on infrequent national or state CATI surveys or less robust methods to determine coverage, wastage and leakage. In addition, most jurisdictional key informants reported that the vacc ine (Pneumovax 23TM) had a shelf life of 12 -18 months and the close association with influenza vaccination resulted in it being discarded unnecessarily early in some instances at the end of the influenza season. Recommendations: Establish an immunisation register to provide vaccination status and coverage information, as a particular priority for 23vPPV , if the program is expected to continue . Promote Pneumovax 23TM vaccination during the whole year . Funding for the program was allocated annually for the ongoing program and as a single lump sum payment for catch -ups in the first year of the program, to cover the period of the AIA till mid -2009. Difficulties with implementing the full catch -up in the 22 first year and managing the resultant rollovers and a sho rtage of funds in later years was experienced in at least one jurisdiction. However, funding for catch -ups by single year may also have been complicated to administer. Reported pre -program coverage was substantial, ranging from 42% in W estern Australia to 62% in Victoria.21 As a single booster was recommended after 5 years for those first vaccinated at 65 years of age , there would have been considerable variation between jurisdictions in the proportion of the elderly population due for vaccination in any particular year. The rollout of the Older Australians Pneumococcal Immunisation Program together with the childhood pneumococcal program, with limited preparation time, in the middle of the traditional Christmas holidays, caused significant logistical and communications challenges. Some immunisation providers and pharmacists faced difficulty in distingui shing the two vaccines (7vPCV and 23vPPV), including reports of the vaccines being used in the wrong age groups. This confusion was also reported in a US study, where the infant 7vPCV program was introduced with a pre -existing 23vPPV program for the elder ly.34 Recommendations: Provide c entrally produced educational and promotional materials for immunisation providers and clients/patients. Promotional materials for the general public sh ould be engaging and attractive, while those for providers should be concise. Expand web -based and other online information for quick and easy access by providers. Avoid rollout of more than one new immunisation program at one time . If dual rollout is con ducted, apply special attention to information needs. Allocate a minimum of 9 months to preparation for program implementation. Consider a set time of year for schedule changes . Limitations of the report This study has a number of limitations. The evalua tion of the national pneumococcal program was not incorporated into the planning and development phases of the program. Rather, this evaluation was designed after the completion of the pneumococcal immunisation program and information was collected retrosp ectively. This process evaluation was conducted in March to August 2009 and over 4 years after the program commenced in January 2005. The consultation process was limited by staff turnover, reducing the number of interviewees who had worked in key positio ns during the planning and implementation phases of the program , and by recall difficulties amongst those that had been present at that time. Recommendations: Commence planning of evaluations during program implementation planning. Commence process evalu ations within 1 year of program launch . Conclusions The National Older Australians P neumococcal Immunisation Program was successfully implemented in 2005 and offered to those aged 65 years. It was incorporated into an already successful NIP. National promotional materials were widely used. The simultaneous implementation of the adult pneumococcal 23 immunisation program alongside the influenza immunisation program may also have contri buted to higher uptake of the vaccine.31,32 Several measures were identified to benefit future programs, including more time to prepare for implementation; the continued availability of national communication materials; the continued promotion of the program during the year and not just during the infl uenza season; a national register for recording 23vPPV vaccination status ; and more timely process evaluations. 24 CHAPTER 3. System Description 25 Aims 1. To describe the surveillance systems that collect the following information used in the evaluation: not ification data, hospitalisation data, mortality data, adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) data and vaccine coverage data. 2. To review the quality and completeness of data used to evaluate outcomes of the program. Notification data The National No tifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) was established in 1990 and coordinates the surveillance of more than 60 communicable diseases reported by laboratories and health workers to state and territory authorities under their current public health le gislation. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been notifiable in a couple of states/territories since the mid 1990s (the Northern Territory since 1995 and Queensland since 1997) and Australia -wide since 2001. State and territory notification criteria are based on the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) surveillance case definitions.35 Notification details collected include a unique record number; state or territory identifier; disease code; serogroup/subtype; dates of onset, notification, diagnosis and birth; sex; Indigenous status; patient death; and immunisation status. Cases are de -identified by the state or territory before they are sent to NNDSS. From 2001 to 2003, the case definition used nationally for IPD was \"the isolation from, or detection in, blood, cerebrospinal fluid or other sterile site, of S. pneumoniae \".4,36,37 From January 2004, the national case definition was changed slightly, and is shown in the highlighted box below.38 IPD surveillance is coordinated by the Enhanced IPD Surveillance Working Group (EIPDSWG) of the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA), which includes relevant surveillance staff from each jurisdiction. 'Core ' data fields, that are collected for all notifiable diseases, are transferred to the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) Surveillance Branch approximately daily. Records may be entered and forwarded as soon as they satisfy the cas e definition, while data for some fields may be updated as they become available, sometimes months later. Core data unit records for all vaccine preventable diseases are provided to NCIRS monthly. Pneumococcal dise ase - invasive Reporting Only confirmed cases should be notified. Confirmed case A confirmed case requires laboratory definitive evidence only. Laboratory definitive evidence 1. Isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site by culture OR 2. Detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site by nucleic acid testing (NAT). 26 In addition to the core surveillance data that is routinel y collected for all notifiable diseases, additional 'enhanced' data are collected for invasive pneumococcal disease notifications. The enhanced data cover clinical presentation, IPD risk factors, more detailed vaccination history and antibiotic susceptibil ity of the pneumococcal isolate.39-41 The collection of enhanced data may also improve the information in core data fields that is often poorly completed, such as vaccination status, Indigenous status and serotype. However, the collection and transfer of enhanced data is more variable. There are differences across jurisdictions in the age groups of enhanced data collection (Table 3). The Australi an Capital Territory has been collecting enhanced surveillance data for children aged <5 years only, whereas New South Wales has collected enhanced surveillance data for children aged <5 years and adults aged >50 years since 2002. South Australia and Victo ria collected enhanced surveillance data for children aged <5 years and adults aged >64 years from 2002 to 2005 and expanded it to all ages from 2006. The Northern Territory, Western Australia, northern Queensland and Tasmania have collected enhanced surve illance data since 2002 for all age groups. In New South Wales, enhanced data were not collected in some area health services from 2001 to 2003. Table 3.

The latest annual report published was for 2006 data. Enhanced data have only been published for single years in annual reports; time trends have not been published due to the unreliability of th e data transfer system. Unit record enhanced data are available only following approval by CDNA members, and are not included in this evaluation. Quality and completeness of notification data Invasive pneumococcal disease has been notifiable in all states and territories since 2001 but not all notifications were captured from some states and territories in the first year because of delays in changes to state and public health legislation.39 The total notification numbers are regarded as relatively complete for all jurisdictions since 2002.39 However, there are variations between jurisdictions in the coverage of enhanced data. The re are also issues with the reliability of data transfer to DoHA, and with the completeness of enhanced data fields and the important core data field of vaccination status. These factors mean that analysis of those fields should be done with considerable c are, and caution is required in their interpretation. The key surveillance data from 2004 to 2006 are shown in Table 4.39-41 In 2006, the surveillance data were better reported than in the previous years: clinical 27 presentation data were complete for 81% of reported IPD cases, Indigenous status complete for 85% of cases and vaccination status complete for 68% of cases.41 Table 4. Surveillance data of invasive pneumococcal disease, 2004 to 200639-41 2004 N=2,375* n (%) 2005 N=1,680* n (%) 2006 Clinical (85%) * Number of notifications Percentage of records w ith complete data Notification for invasive pneumococcal disease may also be affected by sensitivity of laboratory testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae .42 Both culture and nucleic acid testing (NAT) have been consistent with the case de finition since national surveillance began, but NAT was specifically included in 2004. While NAT is regarded as more sensitive than culture, no change in the sensitivity of notifications due to changes in laboratory methods has been documented or reported. AEFI data In Australia, adverse events following immunisation ( AEFI ) are notified to the Adverse Drug Reactions Unit (ADRU), which is part of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), by state and territory health departments, health professionals, vaccine manufacturers and members of the public. All reports are assessed at the ADRU and entered into the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions System (ADRS) database. Reports are then forwarded to the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC) for furth er assessment at 6 -weekly committee meetings. ADRAC is an expert committee composed of independent medical experts who have expertise in areas of importance to the evaluation of medicine safety. Current members include an endocrinologist, clinical pharmaco logist, specialist physician, neurologist, clinical epidemiologist, specialist immunologist/paediatrician, gastroenterologist and a general practitioner with an interest in complementary medicine.43 ADRAC reviews adverse drug reactions for prescription medicines , including vaccines, over -the-counter medicines, and complementary medicines (herbal medicines, naturopathic and/or homoeopathic medicines, and nutritional supplements such as vitamins and minerals). Therefore, review of AEFI constitutes only a small comp onent of ADRAC's mandate. De -identified AEFI surveillance data from 2000 is regularly released to NCIRS for analysis. Annual national AEFI surveillance summaries have been published since 2003. These include all reports received by TGA of adverse events th at occurred after the receipt of a vaccine, which contain enough basic information to be a valid report, and where the vaccine cannot be excluded as the cause due to biological implausibility. Prior to review at an ADRAC meeting, AEFI are assigned a causal ity rating, based on the level of certainty that reported vaccines caused the reaction. Factors that are considered in assigning causality ratings include the timing (minutes, hours , etc) and the spatial correlation (for injection site reactions) of sympto ms and signs in relation to vaccination, and whether one or more vaccines were administered.44 AEFI are defined as 'serious' or 'non -serious' based on information recorded in the ADRAC 28 database and criteria similar to those used by the World Health Organization (WHO)45 and the United States Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).46 'Serious' events are those where the record indicates the person had recovered with sequelae, been admitted to a hospital or hospitalisation was prolonged, experienced a life -threatening event, or died. Reactions are re -coded from the reporter' s description into standardised terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA\u00ae).47 Individual AEFI reports often list more than one vaccine that were given simultaneously and multiple reactions that occurred following receipt of those vaccines. Also, multiple reports may be received for AEFI following the same vaccination(s). Quality and completeness of AEFI data AEFI reports represent only symptoms that manifest after vaccina tion, which may or may not have been caused by vaccination. While causality is assigned to individual reports by expert review by ADRAC, in the vast majority of cases the causative role of a vaccine cannot be definitively confirmed or excluded. Therefore, the information collated in the ADRS database is primarily intended for signal detection and hypothesis generation. Reporting rates of AEFIs can be estimated using appropriate denominators such as the number of vaccine doses administered. However, they cannot be interpreted as incidence rates due to under -reporting and biased reporting of suspected AEFIs, and the variable quality and completeness of information provided in individual AEFI notifications.44,48 Surveillance methods for AEFI have been found to differ between states and territories.44,49 For example, AEFI are notifiable conditions in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia. In Tasmania, AEFI are reported directly to the ADRU. This was also the case in Victoria prior to 2007. Since this time, AEFI have been reported to the Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC) service at the Royal Children's Hospital, who then forward them to the ADRU and provide quarterly reports to the health department. In all other states and territories, AEFI are reported to the health departments who then forward them to the ADRU. Vaccine coverage data Coverage for adults was obtained from national surveys that used the computer - assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey method.21 A random digit dialling technique, using an electro nic directory of residential telephone numbers , generated the sample. The respondents were people aged 18 years from the populations of all states and territories. The coverage was calculated as the proportion of the target population vaccinated within th e previous 5 years 'for pneumonia'. The CATI method of the survey excluded residents of institutions. Therefore, a survey of aged care residential facilities was undertaken as part of the national survey at the same time as the main CATI survey for adjusti ng the main results. The survey of aged care residential facilities included questions about pneumococcal vaccination of the residents. Published national coverage estimates are available only for 1 year (2004), immediately prior to the vaccine being added to the National Immunisation Program. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage was also estimated in the survey conducted in 2006 (unpublished), and results are included in this evaluation. The next survey is to be conducted in late 2009. Pneumococcal vaccinatio n coverage data are also collected by CATI in N ew South Wales,22-26 Western Australia27 and South Australia28-30 producing annual estimates. 29 Quality and completeness of vaccine coverage data Coverage estimates from CATI surveys should be interpreted with caution. Vaccination records are not referred to in th ese surveys, as they are usually not available for adults at the time of interview. While telephone interviews in some settings have included a validation step of contacting providers to validate information provided by participants, this has not been a co mponent of surveys in Australia. Two validation studies of pneumococcal vaccination status measurement have been conducted in Australia, both in Victoria, comparing self -report with medical records. Both found self -reported pneumococcal vaccination status within the previous 5 years to be unreliable for assessing the vaccination status of individual patients, but more reliable for estimating population coverage. In one of the studies, conducted on previous participants in a CATI survey, self -reported pneumo coccal vaccination within the previous 5 years under -estimated actual coverage by 5 -6%.16 The other study, conducted on patients hospitalised with pneumonia, showed under - estimation of actual coverage by 1%.50 Discussion The surveillance systems a vailable in Australia for the evaluation of immunisation programs provide vital information for measuring outcomes and the impact of the program on disease burden. However, many of these systems have limitations that either restrict or affect the quality o f output for program evaluations. The following recommendations have been developed when considering the pneumococcal immunisation program. National IPD surveillance, including enhanced data, have provided critically important data for monitoring the impa ct of pneumococcal vaccination. However, issues remain to be resolved with respect to data completeness, timely collation and reliable transfer to DoHA. The establishment of a single complete historical national dataset that is updated with additional annu al datasets in a timely way should be a priority. The monitoring of vaccination coverage in adults has been limited by irregular national surveys. Annual surveys should be conducted to enable timely program monitoring. Collecting vaccination status dat a for a vaccine with complicated revaccination recommendations, such as pneumococcal vaccine, requires more attention to data validity than for influenza vaccine, which is recommended annually. Individual studies have provided variable estimates of validit y, and an assessment of the exact questions used in the adult vaccination survey, including verification by providers, should be conducted. An adult immunisation register would provide coverage estimates as well as the important benefit of providing infor mation to providers on individual patients, which is particularly important for pneumococcal vaccine's complicated revaccination recommendations. 30 CHAPTER 4. Outcome/ Impact analysis 31 Aims and Methods Literature searches Literature was reviewed on the effe ctiveness of 23vPPV in preventing IPD in adults, and on the impact of pneumococcal vaccination programs for the elderly on rates of IPD. Population -based studies, rather than studies on patients with specific clinical conditions, were selected. Studies wit h invasive pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal bacteraemia as the primary outcome of interest were selected, although studies that also reported on pneumococcal pneumonia were also included. The literature search was performed on the PREMEDLINE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases (including Database of Systematic Review s, Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects). Reference lists of published systematic reviews and key studies were also examined. Adverse events following immunisation Reported adverse events following immunisation were provided by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, as described in the System description, and analysed at NCIRS . Reporting rates were calculated using coverage estima tes from the 2004 and 2006 national coverage surveys as denominators. Trends in IPD notifications and 23vPPV vaccination coverage Notifications of IPD were obtained from the National Notifiable Disease s Surveillance System and were included from all years where complete surveillance data were available (2002 -2008) and limited to ages 65 years. As childhood conjugate vaccine was funded from the same year, notifications were aggregated by serotype grouping to distinguish the impact of these two vaccines - types contained in the 7- valent conjugate vaccine (7v), those contained in the 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine but not in the conjugate (23 -non-7v) and those not contained in any vaccine (non-23v). Notifications from Victoria and any notifications recorded as Indigenous were excluded, as their funded programs commenced at different times to the national program ( 1998 and 1999 , respectively ). The proportion of notifications that were serotyped increased from 7 7% in 2002/2003 to 90% in 200 8, so serotypes were allocated to untyped cases according to the distribution in typed cases by jurisdiction, by year. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson distribution of notification numbers. Rates were calculated using yearly total population estimates fro m the 2006 Census, minus Indigenous population estimates from the 2001 Census. Vaccination coverage estimates for those aged 65 years were provided from the Adult Immunisation Surveys conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) under contract to the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) in 2004 and 2006. Estimates were provided by j urisdiction by year, from AIHW on special request. Estimation of vaccine effectiveness using the indirect cohort method This study was conducted on notifications of IPD from 2001 to 2005 in people aged 15 years, accessed from enhanced surveillance datase ts used in the preparation of previously published annual reports. Vaccination status was categorised as fully vaccinated with 23vPPV according to national recommendations,51 overdue for revaccination, or never vacci nated. Cases with vaccine serotypes were compared to those with non -vaccine serotypes, while those with vaccine -related serogroups but non -vaccine serotypes were excluded. 32 Cases reported as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander were analysed together as 'Indigenous '. Cases with missing data for a variable of interest were excluded from the vaccine effectiveness ( VE) calculations, with the exception of risk factors, since it was not possible to distinguish between those without risk factors and those wit h missing data. Effectiveness was estimated as one minus the ratio of the odds of having vaccine -type disease in vaccinated versus unvaccinated cases, multiplied by 100, according to the method of Broome.52 The odds ratio was derived from logistic regression models using the LOGISTIC procedure i n SAS. The models included vaccination status as one of the independent variables predicting the probability of the case being a vaccine serotype. Effect modification was tested by the inclusion of terms for interaction between vaccination status and all other independent variables. The criteria for inclusion of variables or interaction terms in the model were either: 1) a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement in the model's ability to predict serotype distribution ; or 2) a greater than 5% chang e in the VE estimate. The coding of binary independent variables was centred around zero.53 Estimates were stratifi ed into two age groups - 15-64 years and 65 years. Statistical analysis was carried out in SAS v9.1.3.54 Descriptive analyses were conducted on the entire dataset from 2001 to 2005 and the Chi squared test was used to assess statistical significance. Estimation of vaccine effectiveness using the screening method The screening method uses the formula VE = 1 - [PCV/(1 -PCV)][(1 -PPV)/PPV], where PCV is the proportion of cases vaccinated, and PPV is the proportion of the population vaccinated. PPV was obta ined from vaccination coverage estimates of those aged 65 years provided from the Adult Immunisation Surveys of 2004 and 2006 as outlined above. PCV was obtained from enhanced IPD surveillance data provided by DoHA on behalf of the National Pneumococcal Surveillance Working Party. Notifications in those aged 65 years were included from 2001 - a year of incomplete national surveillance - to 2006. Notifications reported as Indigenous or with missing serotype or vaccination status were excluded. PCV was taken as the proportion of 23 -valent vaccine -type IPD cases recorded as fully vaccinated. A logistic regression model was fitted using Proc Genmod in SAS v9.1, as described by Torvaldsen 2003,55 in which the number of vaccinated cases (dependent variable) is regarded as binomially distributed, with PCV used as the parameter and the number of cases as the index. Vaccination coverage was used as an estimate of PPV and logit PPV was specified as an offset in the model. Th e only parameter in the model was a binomial age variable - 65-74 years, or 75 years . VE was calculated from the model by subtracting the exponentiation of the estimated linear predictor (XBETA in SAS) from one. Confidence intervals were derived in Excel from the covariance matrix, using the standard error of the linear predictor, as previously described by Torvaldsen et al.55 33 Results Literature reviews Vaccine ef fectiveness There have been many studies on the effectiveness of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines since they were first developed in the 1940s; almost 20 controlled trials (intervention studies), more than 20 observational studies and approximately 10 meta -analyses of those studies. Interpretation is complicated by the wide range of populations studied and hence widely differing vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates, from young adults in high -risk developing country settings to the elderly in developed countries, those with chronic disease and the immunocompromised. Randomised controlled trials The majority of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating VE were performed in populations aged 55 years or with moderate to high risk conditions. In the majority of these studies, VE against IPD, all -cause pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia was not significant. Of those studies that showed significant protective effects ,56,57 the results are questionable due to the use of poor randomisation procedures. In five RCTs performed in young adult populations (mean or median age not provided), VE against IPD or pneumococcal pneumonia was high (77 -92%) and significant. These included three trials in South African gold miners ,58,59 a rural population in Papua New Guinea60 and a military recruit study .61 In all these cases , attack rates were h igh due to overcrowding or poor ventilation in housing or mines. A further study in young women with HIV infection in Uganda showed 23vPPV to be ineffective against invasive pneumoc occal disease.62 RCT A Cochrane systematic review on for preventing pneumococcal infection in adults ' by Moberley et al., 2007 ,63 aimed to assess the effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination in preventing disease or death in adults. This review update d the pre vious Cochrane review ,64 addressing whether pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is effective in all adult populations, or whether only some groups will benefit. Fifteen randomised and seven non -randomised studies were included in this review, the la tter contributing outcomes for culture - confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease only. Meta -analysis of the randomised trials found pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination an effectiveness of 74% (95%CI: 5 6-85) against IPD (Table 5). However, as the out comes became less specific , the strength of the evidence for protective benefit reduced, with a point estimate for VE against all -cause pneumonia of 29% (95%CI: 3 -38), and there was no significant reduction in all -cause mortality (Odds Ratio 0.87; 95%CI : 0.69-1.10). For each of the primary outcomes considered in the randomised trials, the size of the effect differed in population groups. In particular, the VE against IPD among the sub -group of adults with chronic disease (-56; 95%CI: <0 -65) appears poor i n comparison to that of otherwise healthy adults in developed (80; 95%CI: 59 -90) or developing countries (86; 95%CI: 39-97) (Table 5). In the case of VE against all -cause pneumonia, adults in developing countries was the only sub -group to show a protective effect (46; 95%CI: 33 -57). Their meta - analysis of non -randomised studies is discussed in the section below on observational studies. While the failure to demonstrate efficacy against IPD in adults with chronic illness may be due to lack of power, it is biologically plausible that the vaccine may be less effective amongst this sub -group. The meta -analysis does not provide compelling 34 evidence to support the routine use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the prevention of the less specific outcomes of all -cause pneumonia or mortality. The degree of protection afforded by vaccination is likely to differ across populations according to health status, risk of exposure, susceptibility to disease and serotype distribution. Five other meta -analyses of tria ls have been published.63,65-69 In many of these, only a small number of trials were included, resulting in insufficient power to demonstrate 50% efficacy of the pneumococcal vaccine. Vaccine efficacy against two primary outcomes (IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia) was determined for overall populations as well as individual patient groups, in particular, elderly or high risk adults and young, immunocompetent adults (Table 5). Cornu et al., 2001 ,65 Hutchison et al., 1999 ,67 and Fine et al., 1994 ,66 found statistically significant VE against IPD, but only when trials in young adults in developing countries were included. In all meta -analyses, the VE point estimates against pneumococcal pneumonia were lower than those observed for IPD but, as with VE against IPD, were statistically significant only when trials in young adults from developing countr ies were included .65-68 Meta -analysis of individual patient groups showed that elderly or high risk adults had low vaccine efficacy against IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia compared to young, immunocompetent adults that showed high and significant VE. The confidence intervals were much wider for elderly or high risk groups indicating that there was a lack of power to demonstrate a significant difference between vaccinated and control groups. In contrast to the other meta -analyses, Moberley et al., 2007 ,63 showed significant VE in adults from developed countries with no chronic illness, comparable with that observed for adults from developing countries (Table 5). 35 Table 5.

In these populations, the pneumococcal vaccine showed a p rotective efficacy against IPD of 50 -80%. Only five studies considered VE against pneumonia. VE estimates were lower than those observed for IPD but significant in three of the five studies.70-72 Meta -analyses of observational studies Moberley et al., 2007 ,63 performed a meta -analysis of seven observational studies as part of their Cochrane systematic review. Pneumococcal vaccination reduced the risk of IPD with a VE estimate of 52% (95%CI: 39 -63) for all serotypes and 55% (95%CI: 38-54) for vaccine type disease. This result w as consistent across all study designs (Table 6). Two sub -group analyses involving immunocompetent older adults and immunocompetent adults alone produced similar VE estimates of 68% (95%CI: 53 - 78) and 59% (95%CI: 48 -68), respectively. These results are con sistent with those found in a previous systematic review of observational studies on the effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in adults (Conaty et al., 2004) .73 In that review, a meta -analysis was performed on 13 observational studies that produced an 36 overall VE against IPD of 53% (95%CI: 46 -59) (Table 6). VE increased slightly to 55% (95%CI: 48 -62) when restricted to the elderly or those with chronic disease. The VE estimates were consistent with the non -significant VE estimate observed for the RCT meta -analysis of nine RCTs (38; 95%CI: -4 to 63), although slightly higher, most lik ely due to selection bias or other unmeasured confounders. Table 6. Meta -analysis of observational studies on pneumococcal vaccine against IPD Meta -analysis, year published Patient sub -group VE (95% CIs) Moberley et al., 2007 Immunocompetent older adult s 68 (53 -78) Immunocompetent 59 (48 -68) All studies 52 (39 -63) Conaty et al., 2004 Elderly or chronic illness 55 (48 -62) All studies 53 (46 -59) Impact of age There were many studies in the elderly in developed countries, some of which include d young adults with indications for vaccination, and four in young adults in developing countries. The only trial in young otherwise healthy adults in a developed country was by MacLeod et al.,61 done in 1945 with a tetravalent vaccine. Therefore between -study comparisons of VE in otherwise healthy adults of different age groups are difficult to conduct. Most meta -analyses found lower VE in elderly/high risk populations in developed countries compared with young otherwise healthy adults, mostly in developing countries. Moberley et al., 2007 ,63 found no difference in VE from RCTs of otherwise healthy, mainly older adults from developed countries, compared with one study on young healthy adults in a developing country. The meta -analysis of observational st udies by Conaty et al. , 2004 ,73 also included a separate analysis on elderly or adults with ch ronic disease. After excluding one study with cases aged >2 years, one of HIV positive adults, one with age unspecified, and one on a Navajo population with a high prevalence of chronic disease, the remaining studies on the elderly with or without risk fac tors had a similar VE estimate. Two observational studies that specifically investigated VE against IPD by age, one of which w as an indirect cohort stud y,74,75 conducted after the Conaty meta -analysis, showed that VE decreased with increasing age.74-76 The differences between the youngest and oldest age groups were statistically significant in one study,74,75 and included a wide range of e thnic backgrounds and risk factor prevalence in the different study populations. Adjustments made for risk factors in some of the studies did not alter this decreasing trend in VE with age. Conclusions regarding effectiveness of 23vPPV in the elderly It is difficult to separate effects of age and risk factor prevalence on VE due to the fact that very few studies stratified patient groups according to age and the grouping of risk factors varied between studies. VE estimates are generally high in young healt hy adults and consistently lower in the elderly, although usually also combined with those that have at -risk and high -risk conditions. The balance of evidence supports effectiveness against IPD in the otherwise healthy elderly of approximately 50%. 37 Impac t of 23vPPV in the elderly in other settings Six studies were found examining the impact of the 23vPPV - three in the US,77-79 and one each in Australia,15 Scotland80 and Sweden.81 One study using a mathematical model to predict benefits from 23vPPV vaccination of the elderly is also reviewed.82 United States In the US, the ability to detect any population -level impact was limited by the gradual increase of 23vPPV coverage, and coincidental increase in influenza coverage in the same population. The 23vPPV was subsidi sed through Medicare from 1983 and recommended by ACIP since 1989.78 National estimates of 23vPPV coverage (ever vaccinated) increased from 14% in 1989 to 28% in 1993, 45% in 1997, 53% in 2000, and 58% in 2003. Estimated influenza coverage (vaccinated in the previous 12 months) increased from 33% in 1989 to 52% in 1993 and 65% in 1997.78,83,84 McBean et al.78 looked at IPD hospitalisations in the US elderly from 1996 to 2003. Between 1997 and 2000, 23vPPV coverage increased 11% and the IPD hospitalisation rate decreased 3.8%. Compared to -2000, declined 22% by 2001/02 and 40% by 2002/03. The large declines in 2001 to 2003 were accompanied by only a 4.7% increase in 23vPPV coverage, and appeared much more likely to be due to the indirect effects of 7vPCV. Using a multiple regression model on Californian data, the decreases were found to be sign ificantly associated with 7vPCV coverage rates in children (P=0.03), but not with coverage rates in the elderly, of either 23vPPV (P=0.31) or influenza (P=0.20).85 Redelings et al.79 report a decrease in deaths coded as due to pneumococcal pneumonia (ICD -9 code or at unspecified site (041.2), from death registrations from 1989 -1998. All -age deaths declined by an average of 2.8% per year for all pneumococcal disease, and 3.0% for invasive disease. Vaccinatio n with 23vPPV may have contributed to this decline, but other factors, including influenza vaccination and the introduction of effective anti -retroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection, are also likely to have contributed. In a study of IPD sur veillance data from eight US states, Lexau et al.77 found that, in those aged 50 years, while rates of 7vPCV -type IPD decreased 55% from 1998 - 1999 to 2002 -2003, rates of IPD in 23 -non-7v types did not change. Australia Andrews et al .15 found a reduction of 36% in IPD notification rates in those aged 65 years in Victoria in a 12-month period after the introduction of funded vaccination for the elderly in Victoria, compared to pre -vaccination levels. Reductions were not seen in younger age groups or a comparison population in N ew South Wales without funded vaccination. Scotland Mooney et al .80 assessed the impact of the first winter of recommended and actively promoted vaccination for the elderly in Scotland (2003/04). In the first year of vaccination , 23vPPV coverage was 68% in those aged 65 years and <10% in younger age groups. Coverage in previous years was not reported. There were incremental increases in influenza coverage from 65% in 2001/02, to 69% in 2002/03 and 73% in 2003/04. IPD rates in 200 3/04 were statistically significantly lower than predictions based on data from the previous four winters in the elderly (34% ; 95%CI : 23-43), but not in younger age groups. VE estimates for the non -very high risk elderly were 62% ( 95%CI ( 95%CI : -278 38 to 94) by the indirect cohort method. Influenza activity was low in all years included in the study. Sweden Spindler et al .81 studied the impact on IPD of a campaign promoting 23vPPV in those aged 65 years, including a reduced vaccine cost, in Stockholm from 1998 to 2000, and compared this with another District in which no such campaign was conducted (Skane). 23vPPV coverage in that age group increased in Stockholm from an unspecified but 'negligible' level in 1997 to 29% in 1998 and 36% in 2000. IPD incidence decreased 20% between 1997 -1998 and 2000 -2001 in those aged 65 years, but not in other age groups. However, this decrea se is dependent on high incidence for a single data point for the elderly in 1997. There was no change in Skane over this period, either in vaccine distribution figures or IPD incidence. Modelling Fry et al.82 used modelling to estimate that 23vPPV vaccination in persons over the age of 65 years prevented 11 -12% of IPD cases in 1998, with an estimated 46% coverage in 65 -75 year olds and 7 -8% coverage in those over the age of 75 years. Other assumptions were 85% serotype coverage and vaccine effectiveness which declined with age of receipt and years since vaccination (VE 75% at 65 years, 60% at 74 years and 34% at 85 years, and post -vaccination decreases in VE of 50% from 6-10 years, 75% from 11 -15 years and 100% after 15 years). VE was assumed to be 0% in the immunocompromised. Adverse events following immunisation Pneumococcal polysaccharide (23vPPV) vaccine There were a total of 512 reports of AEFI following receipt of 23vPPV during the 2005 -2008 period . Sixty -seven per cent (n=341) were from people aged 65 years, while 32% (n=162) were for people <65 years of age. The overall reporting rate for people 65 years of age for the period of 2005 -2008 was 19.8 per 100,000 doses, while dose information was no t available for <65 years age group. The following figure (Figure 1) shows trends over time in the number of reported AEFI following receipt of 23vPPV. The occurrence of peaks and troughs is due to the fact that most people receive 23vPPV along with influ enza vaccine, which happens mostly in the first two quarters of the year. The AEFI reporting rate for people 65 years of age increased slightly between 2004 and 2005 from 3.3 to 4.0 per 100,000 population, which can be attributed to the commencement of the funded national 23vPPV vaccine program in January 2005 , as both years used 2004 coverage estimates as denom inator for calculation of reporting rates . 39 Figure 1.

Reaction types are presented in Tables 7 and 8 below. Table 7 classifies reactions into categories defined in the Immunisation Handbook ,3 while Table 8 includes reactions that do not fall into Handbook categories. The most commonly reported adverse event was injection site reaction (84%), followed by fever (20%) and allergic reaction (8% ) (Table 7). 23vPPV vaccine was the only vaccine reported in 59% (n=303) of records , out of which 142 AEFI records described only one reaction following vaccination. The most frequently reported sing le reaction following vaccination with only 23vPPV vaccine was injection site reaction (130); others included chills (2), and one report each of angioedema, bacteraemia, convulsions, cellulitis, pneumonia, urticaria, paralysis, tremor, bacteraemia.

Percent of total number of reports Sixty per cent of all records had causality rat ings of either certain (55%) or probable (4.5%) , while 40.4% were coded as 'possible'. A total of 8.2% (n=42) of records listed outcomes defined as 'serious' (i.e . recovery with sequelae, hospital admission, life - threatening event or death). There were no reports of death, and one report of recovery with sequelae. There were five reports of life -threatening events and 36 reported hospital admissions. Dose number was recorded for only 45% of AEFI records following 23vPPV among people aged 65 years and , out of these , approximately two -thirds indicated that the reaction followed a second dose of 23vPPV. 42 Vaccination coverage and IPD trends over time in the elderly Self-reported vaccination coverage estimates for those aged 65 years are presented in Figure 2, and in two more detailed age groups in Table 11 (65-74 years and 75 years). In 2004, at the national level, 51% of those aged 65 years reported receiving pneumococcal vaccine in the previous 5 years, ranging from 42% in Western Australia to 62% in Victo ria. This increased to 62% in 2006, ranging from 51% in the Northern Territory to 67% in Victoria. In jurisdictions other than Victoria, coverage increased between 5% and 17% from 2004 to 2006. Coverage was 17% to 19% higher nationally in those aged 75 years compared to those aged 65-74 years. Between 2002 and 2008 there were 3005 IPD notifications among persons aged 65 years not recorded as Indigenous from Australian jurisdictions excluding Victoria. The highest total was in 200 4 (530) and the lowest i n 200 7 (357). Annual rates by serotype grouping (serotypes included in 7 -valent [7v], 7 -valent [23- non-7v], and other [non-23v]) are presented in Figure 2. A significant decrease was seen in 7vPCV -type cases f rom 17.8 per 100,000 populati on in 2002 -2004 to 5.0 per 100,000 population in 200 7-2008. The re was also an increase in the rate of 23 -non- 7v IPD from 5. 8 per 100,000 in 2002 -2004 to 8.6 per 100,000 in 200 7-2008, and an increase in non -23v types from 2.6 to 4.3 per 100,000 with no over lapping confidence intervals.

There was no difference in the serotype distribution (75% versus 74% vaccine type, P=0.21). There were 2 ,764 (50%) notified cases with complete data in all key fields. Compared to those with missing data, those with complete data were more frequently Indigenous (13 % versus 7%, P<0.0001) and older ( 49% versus 39% 65 years, P<0.0001). Logistic regression results Of the 2 ,764 cases with complete data in all relevant fields, 223 cases with vaccine - related serotypes were excluded, leaving 2 ,541 to be used in VE calcul ations. Following univariate and multivariate analysis, the variables that remained statistically significantly independently associated with IPD serotype (vaccine versus non-vaccine type) were vaccination status ((P=0.08), Indigenous status (P<0.0001) and having one or more recorded risk factors (P=0.0006). Sex was not significant. No adjustment was made for age as the analysis was stratified by age group. Interaction terms were added to the base model to test for the impact of other variables on the eff ect of vaccination status. An interaction term for risk factors with vaccination status was not statistically significant (p= 0.25), but resulted in an increase in the adjusted point estimate of VE from 30.6% to 40.9%. The presence of risk factors was there fore an effect modifier of VE. Interaction terms for Indigenous status and sex were non -significant and made negligible difference to VE estimates. The final VE model included vaccination status, Indigenous status, the presence of a risk factor, and an int eraction for risk factors with vaccination status. Vaccine effectiveness estimates Crude and adjusted VE estimates, by age group and risk factor status , are presented in Table 10. Crude and adjusted estimates were statistically significantly above zero for those aged 15 -64 years, and the point estimates were higher for those vaccinated within the previous 5 years. For those aged 65 years, confidence intervals included zero for all VE estimates. However, there was also a strong effect of age within this age group. The unadjusted estimate was statistically significant for those aged 65 -74 years and fully vaccinated (66.9% ; 95%CI: 7-88), but not for those aged 75 years (3.6% ; 95%CI: -97 to 53). A similar trend was present for ever being vaccinated - higher for those aged 65 -74 years (58.2; 95%CI: -17 to 85) than those aged 75 years (0% ; 95%CI: -99 to 49). 46 Table 10.

Vaccine effectiveness using the screening method The raw data used in the screening method are presented in Table 11. At a national level, the proportion of IPD cases recorded as fully vaccinated was consis tently lower than the estimated proportion of the population vaccinated by self -report for each year and age group. 47 Table 11.

Vaccine effectiveness estimates using the screening method are presented in Table 12. The estimate of effectiveness using vaccination within the previous 5 years as the predictor variable was statistically significantly abo ve zero for those aged 65 years and in both age subgroups. The point estimate for those aged 75 years was higher than for those aged 65 -74 years, and confidence intervals just overlapped. A sensitivity analysis for the impact of accuracy of population coverage estimates yielde d an upper estimate of 73.2% (95%CI : 63.8-80.1) if true population coverage was 10% higher than estimated and a lower estimate of 33.6% ( 95%CI : 10.4-50.8) if true coverage was 10% lower than estimated.

This is to a certain extent a reflection of the characteristics of polysaccharide vaccines, being of lower and shorter -lasting effectiveness, more variable responses in different populations and lack of a booster response, compared with more modern vaccines 48 such as conjugates. However, the balance of evidence suggests an effectiveness of 23vPPV of approximately 50% in preventing IPD in the otherwise healthy elderly. A modelling study has predicted that, with a modest level of effectivenes s, the persistence of disease from serotypes not included in the vaccine, and relatively modest levels of vaccination coverage achieved in the elderly, the decrease in IPD expected from a national vaccination program would also be relatively modest, around 10-15%.82 In fact, modest decreases were observed in several settings where other pneumococcal vaccines were not in use,80,81 including Victoria.86 However, the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines for children has been accompa nied by substantial decreases in IPD in unvaccinated age groups in several settings,87 attributed to the prevention of nasopharyngeal car riage and subsequent transmission by children to others. This appears to have also occurred in Australia, where decreases in IPD in the non -Indigenous elderly outside Victoria were seen only in serotypes contained in the conjugate vaccine, and IPD due to s erotypes only in the polysaccharide vaccine actually increased. Increases in non -7vPCV type IPD have been seen in many settings after the introduction of 7vPCV, including Australia, most markedly in children but also in other age groups. While there is a t heoretical possibility that the use of polysaccharide vaccine may eliminate or reduce this effect, such an impact has not been clearly demonstrated. In addition, the increase in coverage associated with the commencement of the national program appears to have been relatively modest (5 -17%), as measured by national telephone surveys. This appears to be due to a combination of the relatively high coverage achieved over years of availability through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the difficulties in g eneral in achieving high coverage in the elderly. However, reported 23vPPV coverage is consistently lower than that for influenza, suggesting additional factors specific to 23vPPV are also relevant. Reported adverse events following immunisation increased moderately with the introduction of the national program, consistent with the history or prior use in Australia and modest increase in coverage seen after the commencement of the national program. They were predominantly mild and consistent with reports f rom other settings.88 The reporting rate is higher than for influenza vaccine,89 and this is predominantly due to reports of injection site reactions. It has been reported that injection site reactions occur more frequently following revaccination compared with first vaccination ,90 but other studies have shown relatively little difference in the rate of medical consultation for injection site reac tion following a first, second or third dose of 23vPPV.91 However, the result of factors mentioned above is that a clear impact of 23vPPV on IPD in the elderly in Australia following the introduction of the national prog ram cannot be demonstrated. Point estimates of VE were greater than zero by the indirect cohort method (32.5% ; 95%CI : -20 to 62) and the screening method (56.9% ; 95%CI : 42-68), as they were in other settings of population programs for the elderly (Table 13). However, the VE estimates in this evaluation were calculated in the early years of the national program - 2005 and 2006. In fact, almost all studies of 23vPPV effectiveness were carried out in the absence of 7vPCV. Given the continuing trends in IPD in recent years of decreases in serotypes contained in the 7vPCV and increases in non -vaccine serotypes, the VE estimates may not reflect more recent performance of the 23vPPV. However, there are substantial difficulties in calculating more recent VE estimate s. The impact of 7vPCV renders the indirect cohort method invalid, due to potential biases from serotype replacement. The screening method requires current population coverage estimates, which were not available during this evaluation, but may be in 2010. 49 Table 13.

Miller and N. Andrews, Health Protection Agency, United Kingdom Ever vaccinated Fully vaccinated, according to Handbook recommendations The currently license d higher -valency conjugate vaccines (10 -valent and 13 -valent), if introduced into the NIP for children, may also produce herd effects in the elderly, in a greater range of serotypes. Conclusions The Older Australians P neumococcal Immunisation Program appe ars to have resulted in only a modest increase in vaccination coverage in jurisdictions that did not have a funded vaccination program already in place, with scope for further improvements in coverage. Reports of adverse events were predominantly mild injection site reactions and consistent with the known safety profile of this vaccine. An impact on IPD from this program cannot be demonstrated, possibly due to a combination of several factors including the modest increase in coverage, the limited effectiven ess of the vaccine and the simultaneous herd immunity impacts from the use of 7vPCV in children. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness , calculated as at 2005 and 2006, were greater than zero, but may not be reflective of vaccine effectiveness in more recent y ears. 50 References 1.
