The adjusted odds ratio for contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was 7.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.91 to 7.39) in patients recently diagnosed with cancer in comparison to patients without cancer [ [2](#b2-crt-2022-1541)]. Cancer is significantly associated with severity and high mortality in patients with COVID-19 [ [3](#b3-crt-2022-1541), [4](#b4-crt-2022-1541)]. Therefore, as the efficacy of the novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been proved in clinical trials [ [5](#b5-crt-2022-1541), [6](#b6-crt-2022-1541)], CPs were being prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. [7](#b7-crt-2022-1541)]. However, the analysis included only two studies in which patients received adenoviral-vectored vaccines. [8](#b8-crt-2022-1541)]. Therefore, mRNA-based vaccines have been recommended as a third dose, which demonstrated the effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants [ [9](#b9-crt-2022-1541), [10](#b10-crt-2022-1541)]. As of October 2022, extended primary three-dose vaccination series plus a booster dose are recommended to the immunocompromised to reduce the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 [ [11](#b11-crt-2022-1541), [12](#b12-crt-2022-1541)]. However, risk factors affecting vaccine response and the extent of the immunosuppression are variable in CPs [ [13](#b13-crt-2022-1541)], and studies for immune response against SARS-CoV-2 among actively treated solid CPs are still lacking. Materials and Methods 1. Study design and participants [14](#b14-crt-2022-1541)]. In our analysis, age-matched healthy controls were recruited from a multicenter HCW cohort and included as a comparison group. 2. Specific binding antibody response [15](#b15-crt-2022-1541)]. Values higher than 0.8 U/mL were considered positive. [16](#b16-crt-2022-1541)]. 3. Neutralizing response using plaque reduction neutralization test 4. Reactogenicity [17](#b17-crt-2022-1541)]. The questionnaire consisted of local and systemic symptoms, including injection site swelling, pain, erythema, fever, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia. Participants were asked about the duration and severity of each symptom with grades within 7 days following each vaccine dose. To calculate the cumulative symptom scores, the scores were summed and adapted to severity: asymptomatic (grade 0), mild (below 4 scores, grade 1), moderate (below 8 scores, grade 2), and severe (> 8 scores, grade 3). The participants were also asked to report any other symptoms, and researchers regularly checked the condition of the participants in the clinics or via phone calls. 5. Study endpoint and statistical analyses Results 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population [S1 Fig.](#SD1-crt-2022-1541)). All studies were approved by the institutional review board of Severance Hospital (4-2020-0076) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. [Table 1](#t1-crt-2022-1541). 2. Seroconversion [S3 Table](#SD3-crt-2022-1541)) After the first vaccine dose, HCWs exhibited higher antibody concentrations than CPs, regardless of the type of vaccine received (23.1 vs. 1.9, p=0.004 in HCW-mRNA and CA-mRNA, 5.6 vs. 1.2, p=0.003 in HCW-AdV and Ca-AdV). Among the CPs, similar to HCWs, the vaccine type did not affect the concentration of spike-specific antibodies elicited by the first dose ( [Fig. 1B](#f1-crt-2022-1541)). After the second vaccine dose, participants receiving the mRNA vaccine showed higher antibody titers than those receiving the adenovirus vectored vaccine (566 vs. 177, p=0.001 in Ca-mRNA and HCW-AdV). Ca-AdV showed significantly lower antibody concentrations than those observed in HCW-AdV (177 vs. 468, p=0.043), while GMTs in Ca-mRNA p=0.356) ( [Fig. 1C](#f1-crt-2022-1541)). After the booster dose, there were no statistical differences in the GMTs of bAbs between CPs and HCWs, regardless of the primary vaccine (8,810 and HCW-AdV). After the booster dose of the mRNA vaccine, the primary series of vaccination with adenoviral vaccines exhibited comparable concentrations to those with mRNA vaccines in both CPs and HCWs ( [Fig. 1D](#f1-crt-2022-1541)). The details of antibody concentrations, intervals between two doses, and sampling for each vaccination are described in [S3 Table](#SD3-crt-2022-1541). 4. Neutralizing antibodies in CPs [Fig. 2](#f2-crt-2022-1541), [S4 Table](#SD4-crt-2022-1541)). 5. Factors associated with a robust immune response (ad hoc analysis) [Table 2](#t2-crt-2022-1541)). 6. Reactogenicity [Fig. 3](#f3-crt-2022-1541)). Local reactions, including pain, swelling, and redness after the first vaccine dose were reported in 85% and 83% of Ca-mRNA and HCW-mRNA, respectively and 63% and 71% of Ca-AdV and HCW-AdV, respectively. The second and third doses caused lesser local reactions in CPs than those in the controls, regardless of vaccine type. The third mRNA vaccine dose caused more local reactions than those after the second adenoviral-vectored vaccine (78% and 50% in CP group and 86% and 64% in HCW group, respectively). The incidence and severity of the overall solicited ARs were similar or lower in CPs than in HCWs. Specifically, in the first vaccinated AdV group, the incidence of either fatigue or fever/chill was significantly higher in HCWs than in CPs; in the second vaccinated mRNA group, injection site redness, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia were significantly more common in HCWs than in CPs. However, pain at the injection site was more frequent and severe in CPs than in HCWs, regardless of the vaccine or dose ( [S5 Table](#SD5-crt-2022-1541)). No life-threatening vaccine-related events or unsolicited reactions were observed in our study. Discussion [18](#b18-crt-2022-1541)]. Other cohort participants with solid organ or hematologic cancers receiving two doses of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or one dose of Ad26.COV2, bAb, and nAb titers are quantitatively lower in patients with solid cancers than in the healthy controls, regardless of the vaccine type and presence of previous infection [ [19](#b19-crt-2022-1541)]. In our study, CPs receiving two doses of mRNA vaccines elicited bAb concentrations comparable to those in age-matched healthy individuals. CPs who were administered two doses of AZD1222 exhibited relatively low bAb concentrations than those in age-matched healthy control. But after the third dose vaccination, the differential of bAb concentrations became insignificant. [20](#b20-crt-2022-1541)], higher concentrations of IgG titers and the stimulation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell activity have been observed after receiving BNT162b2 as a booster dose [ [20](#b20-crt-2022-1541), [21](#b21-crt-2022-1541)]. In addition, booster dose confers enhanced variant neutralization breadth, which is associated with an improved magnitude of wild-type neutralization [ [22](#b22-crt-2022-1541)]. In our study, booster vaccination increased neutralization titers against wild-type virus and delta variant in CPs regardless of vaccine type. Since the neutralizing antibodies are considered the most reliable predictor of protecting against symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, the third booster vaccine induces enhanced immunogenicity in actively treated solid CPs. [23](#b23-crt-2022-1541)]. The effect of mRNA booster vaccination in CPs with homologous AZD1222 vaccination was not evaluated. In the present study, after the second vaccination, the neutralization against the Omicron variant was relatively low in CPs. The booster dose did not elicit an expected increase in nAbs against the Omicron in AdV-cancer cohort who were older than mRNA cohort. Intriguingly, neutralizing titers against the Omicron variant following three doses of vaccination were not sufficient in these poor responders. [24](#b24-crt-2022-1541)- [26](#b26-crt-2022-1541)]. The receipt of chemotherapy in the previous year or current steroid treatment has been also associated with low bAb levels [ [19](#b19-crt-2022-1541)]. In contrast, some studies have not shown significant associations with reduced nAb in patients with systemic anticancer therapy [ [18](#b18-crt-2022-1541)] or a negative interaction between cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibody response [ [27](#b27-crt-2022-1541)]. In our study, leukopenia was associated with low immunogenicity among CPs treated with cytotoxic agents. Immunotherapy such as CPIs could stimulate the immunologic system, particularly T-cell response, and boost the immunogenicity after influenza vaccination [ [28](#b28-crt-2022-1541)]. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immunotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated yet [ [29](#b29-crt-2022-1541)]. There were no immunologically related adverse events or superior humoral immune responses after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with immunotherapy in our study. "}
