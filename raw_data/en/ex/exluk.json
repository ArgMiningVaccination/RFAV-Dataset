There is no good time to catch Covid-19, or in my case, for it to catch me. Even though I am fully vaccinated, the symptoms were still debilitating, between moderate and severe. For about almost ten days there, I was concerned about the detrimental effects during and after having the virus. It was clear that I had caught one of the variants, possibly the Delta variant that has been rampaging throughout the country. When I got the positive result, I was supposed to undergo my fourth and fifth surgeries to repair abdominal hernias. I was dreading the surgeries but then I found myself dreading the next two weeks enduring the viral infection. The surgeries were cancelled and have yet to reschedule them. So, I get to dread them longer. The virus, though, sure had its way with me and I could feel it attacking my system. It was very draining and exhausting and forced me to take much longer naps in the afternoon. It was a kind of fatigue that I haven't felt before, however, I'm no stranger to it. On top of having Fibromyalgia, at some point in 2019 or 2020, I dealt with heart episodes that led to arrhythmia issues. I was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) and consequently had to get on a betablocker to keep my heartrate from spiking to high and dipping too low. I've had heart disease my whole life to boot and I'm sure I'm sounding like a very unlucky woman. You can probably imagine my concern about how Covid-19 would impact my heart in the long-term. Throughout the course of the infection, I turned to homeopathy, as I always did in times of a health crisis. Believe me, I've had a few health crises in my lifetime, but this virus was different from any other health condition I have. I tried not to focus on the obnoxious coughing fits, the constant, never-ending headache, chest tightness and radiating pain every time I coughed, and how difficult it got to deal with the aching pain. The symptom was like a Fibromyalgia flareup times twenty, and still, though I'm recovered, the full-body pain hasn't totally gone away. Of course, it may never since I have chronic pain by default. To treat these symptoms, I used the homeopathic remedy called, Bioplasma cell salts. The remedy provides a combination of twelve mineral cell salts that benefit cellular health and function. If you're into holistic living, then you know the powerful impact these alternative treatments have on the body's natural healing processes. Various websites say it's not that effective but actually, they are! And I am living proof that homeopathy, especially Bioplasma, works. When a virus is attacking the system, its grip and hold can be incredibly strong. My nose was so stuffed up, and Bioplasma's job is to naturally thin those secretions. Once I started taking the remedy, I could blow my nose with ease and start getting those micro-buggers out of me. I also drank more than two liters of water a day, slept a lot, took Bioplasma, and ate clean as much as I could. For anybody in doubt about the effectiveness of homeopathy, Bioplasma works miracles. It has five stars across the board on several reviewing sites. Individuals who have suffered daily headaches from clogged sinuses have experienced relief minutes after dissolving Bioplasma under the tongue. Because of this remedy, I could loosen Covid-19's grip and get it out of me. I do believe that the vaccines also successfully carried me through, but without Bioplasma, the overwhelming congestion wouldn't have shaken off for an even longer period of time. Bioplasma made me feel less unlucky, but well, I still have surgeries to look forward to. "}
