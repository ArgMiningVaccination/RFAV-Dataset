Zeeland Grand Rapids CHIROPRACTIC MAY BE THE ANSWER Your spinal cord is the system your body uses to pass information from your brain to every other part of your body. If a vertebra in your spine is misaligned, it may be putting pressure on a nerve. Even a small amount of pressure can disrupt the information traveling over that nerve. If your nervous system is being compromised, your immune system may be compromised and malfunctioning. Chiropractors are specially trained to treat and protect the nervous system by relieving pressure on nerves. By doing this chiropractors are allowing your body to function at its max potential. THE BENEFITS OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE There are marshmallow like pads between your vertebrae called intervertebral discs. The discs are very tough, but can be damaged. The discs provide for movement in the spine. When discs start to degenerate the spine can become less mobile, and may even start to fuse together. The discs also provide space between the vertebrae. This is important because nerves pass through the spaces that are created by the discs. Discs also act as a shock absorbers. When movement occurs, the jelly solution inside the disc has the ability to expand and compress. If the spine become misaligned, a disc can become buldged or herniated. In some cases it may even rupture. A misalignment is not the only cause for this problem. Age can cause the disc to become weak and dehydrated. If you are struggling with back or neck pain, chiropractic care may be the best treatment option for you. Chiropractic is one of the least invasive and safest options for conditions of the spine and discs. THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE Patients who seek out chiropractic care do so for a variety of reasons, they are seeking help with alleviating back or leg pain caused by an injury or trauma, avoiding and reducing headaches and migraines, reducing the symptoms of carpal tunnel, and a variety of other issues. By aligning the spine and correcting issues with posture, balance, and correcting their proprioception, which affects issues within the inner ear and affects our spatial awareness, chiropractors can help reduce joint pain and soreness in the surrounding muscle and tissue. Because chiropractic care is non-invasive, it is often seen as a preferred alternative to medication or invasive surgery because it can help many patients find solace from their joint and muscle pain. WHAT IS CHIROPRACTIC CARE? Health care professionals who practice chiropractic care focus on the neuromusculoskeletal system of the body, and work to help patients eliminate pain, treat and prevent injuries and disorders of the muscles, bones, and nerves. The primary objective of alleviating these issues is that by correcting nerve interference, by means of adjusting the spine, the body is able to heal itself without invasive procedures and drugs. Each patient's case is different, as our spines are all shaped differently, and our bodies react to various outside stimuli in a variety of ways so it's important to understand that every chiropractic treatment is designed specifically for each patient.
