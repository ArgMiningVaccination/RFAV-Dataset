W-33-6 PROJECT NO. 1.60 WORK LOCATION : Moose Research Center, Soldotna STATE : Alaska PERIOD : July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2008 (revised April 2007) I. PROBLEM OR NEED THAT PROMPTED THIS RESEARCH This study investigated nutritional effects on reproduction in female Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas) . We combined monitoring of brow sing behavior and physiological techniques to quantify the energy and protein requirements needed to support successful gestation in female Alaskan moose foraging in pens at the Ke nai Moose Research Center (MRC). In addition, we began to design and va lidate a technique that could allow field biologists to precisely track body composition in wild moose. Ideally, this technique would permit researchers to relate body composition to reproductive performance. II. REVIEW OF PRIOR RESEARCH AND STUDIES IN PROGRESS ON THE PROBLEM OR NEED Energetic and protein requirements for gestation have been measured for several ungulatespecies (e.g. White-tailed deer, Pekins et al. 1998; Roe deer, Mauget et al. 1997) but only estimated in moose. Allometric rela tionships predict these requirements, but do not provide detailed information that w ill allow biologists to better understand the complex relationships between forage availa bility, browse energy and protein content, body reserves, survival, and reproduction. The cost of pregnancy has typically been assessed in wild ruminants in terms of the total caloric requirements of gestation compared to those of maintenance, or expres sed as the difference in metabolic rates as a result of gestation compared to maintenance. Several studies have demonstrated that maternal condition and nutrition affect reproductive success (Alla ye-Chan 1991; Testa and Adams 1998; Keech et al. 2000), but the next step remains to be completed. The interactions between diet ary nutrition and body stores of fat and protein and the Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 2 relative importance of diet compared to body reserves in determining overwinter survival and reproductive success remain largely une xplored. Detailed investigation of the nutritional requirements of female moose for overwinter maintenance and pregnancy in terms of energy and protein catabolized from body reserves compar ed to dietary energy and protein intake is necessary. Further, we will examine the contributions from body fat and protein stores independe ntly, rather than consider ing all body reserves as a homogenous unit. Wildlife managers use assessments of body condition and composition to estimate nutritional condition and body rese rves of fat and protein. Th ese metrics are typically used to describe the status of a population with respect to the carrying capacity of its habitat (K) (indicator animal concept, Franzmann 1985). Fat and protein reserves also ultimately drive reproductive rates and su rvival and influence recruitment. Body composition, the quantitative measurement of fat and protein levels, and body condition or body condition score (BCS), which is a qualit ative assessment of an animal's general nutritional status, are currently assessed in Alaskan moose in the field by two methods, both of which have limitations. The current scheme that assigns moose a BCS between 1 and 10 (Franzmann 1977) is subjective and need s refinement. Inter-observer differences of +/- 1 are common while assessing th e same animal (MRC handling records, unpublished data). In addition, inexperience may compromise comparisons among different areas of the state. For example, a moose that would be assigned a relatively low score in one area could possi bly be assigned a moderate score by an investigator accustomed to animals in poorer condition. While the use of generalized assessments of body condition in moose and other species to pr edict reproductive pote ntial, describe the position of a population of animals relative to K, and assess population demographics (Franzmann 1985; Gerhart et al. 1996) is a valu able concept, this tool needs to be updated. Quantitative measurement of body reserv es of fat and protein is necessary to allow biologists to more completely understa nd the effects of nutriti onal change resulting from variations in habitat quality or other environmental conditions on population health. Moose total body fat content can be accurately predicted from measurements of rump fat thickness with B mode ultrasound (Stephenson et al. 1998). These measurements have provided insight about energy balance and nutri tion, and have been used to describe the position of a population relative to the carryi ng capacity of its habitat (e.g. Testa and Adams 1998; Stephenson et al. 1998; Keech et al. 2000; Stephenson et al. in preparation). Unfortunately, this measure is of limited utility in animals in poor condition, or in animals in late winter or sp ring, as subcutaneous rump fa t depots disappear as ungulates drop below 5-6% total body fa t (Stephenson et al. 1998, Cook et al. 2001a, Stephenson et al. 2002). In addition, ultrasound measurement requires expensive equipment and highly skilled personnel to ensure pr ecision. Bioelectrical impeda nce analysis (BIA) has been used to determine total body water and subs equently estimate both lean mass and total body fat in monogastric animals such as bear s (Farley and Robbins 1994), but is a poor predictor of total body com position in wild moose (Hundertmark and Schwartz 2002). There is a need for a quantitative rather than qualitative index that accurately predicts total body composition in terms of both fat and protein. This index must be easily used in a field setting, discriminate between biologi cally relevant amounts of energy reserves, and minimize observer error (Robbins 1993, St ephenson et al. 1998; Cook et al. 2001b). Most importantly, it must provide nonsubj ective data over the wide range of body Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 3 conditions observed in Alaskan moose that result from variations in habitat quality, nutritional state, or reproductive status. III. APPROACHES USED AND FINDINGS RE LATED TO THE OBJECTIVES AND TO PROBLEM OR NEED OBJECTIVE 1: Measure total overwinter energy expe nditure by pregnant and non-pregnant moose. We used the doubly-labelled water me thod to assess total energy expenditure in pregnant and nonpregnant moos e over a 21 day period three times during gestation. Total energy expenditure was measured at the end of the first trimester, and the end of the second trimester, and and the end of the third trimester c oncluding with parturition. We measured total energy expenditure three times during the winter in two pregnant and two nonpregnant adult cow moose during the winter of 2005-2006, four pr egnant and four nonpregnant adult cow moose in 2006-2007, and two pregnant adult cow moose in 2007- 2008. This data is currently being analyzed. OBJECTIVE 2: Assess total overw inter protein requirements in pregnant and non-pregnant moose foraging in pens at the MRC. Blood samples were obtained from eight female moose (four pregnant and four non pregnant) moose four times in 2005-2006 and again in 2006-2007. Two pregnant moose were sampled four times during the winter of 2007- 2008. Blood samples were obtained late in each tr imester of pregnancy, and once immediately following parturition. These samples are curren tly being analyzed to obtain plasma amino acid profiles and blood chemistry measuremen t that will indirectly assess protein metabolism. These samples are being analyzed by the University of Missouri Experimental Station Chemistry Laboratory (amino acid profiles) and Peninsula General Hospital (blood chemistry). In addition, protei n requirements of these eight female moose over two winters (2005-2006 and 2006-2007), and of two pregnant moose over winter 2007-2008 will be calculated from the to tal overwinter loss of whole-body protein content measured by isotopic water diluti on as described under 'mobilization of body reserves' below. OBJECTIVE 3: Calculate energy mobilized from body reserves of fat, and protein mobilized from labile reserves in pregnant compared to non-pregnant moose. Validate the isotope dilution method of body composition measurement to allow repeated, precise measurement of overall body composition in term s of fat and protein content in the same moose. We validated the isotope dilution method of body composition by intravenously injecting deuterium oxide label into four moose that were later euthanized and processed for body composition analysis. Deuterium oxide diluti on allows calculation of total body water content which is then used to predict body protein and fat content. We also obtained blood samples once per hour for a 12 hour peri od, and again at 24 and 48 hours after label administration to determine equilibration time. This allowed determination of total body water, and in turn, body fat and protei n content from one post-injection blood sample rather than several. We tested equilibration time in four moose three times during pregnancy over the winter of 2005-2006, and eight moose three times during the winter of 2006-2007. Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 4 We also used the isotope dilution method to predict body fat and protein content in eight adult cow moose three times during th e winter of 2005-2006, and a fourth time immediately after parturition in June 2006. Body fat and prot ein were again assessed in eight moose three times during the winter of 2006-2007, and a fourth time immediately after parturition in June 2007. Four of these moose were pregnant each winter, while the remaining four served as nonpregnant controls . We also used the isotope dilution method to measure body fat and protein levels in two pregnant moose three times in winter 2007- 2008, and again after parturition in June 2008. We are currently using this data to calc ulate the amount of to tal energy and protein obtained from browse compared to that obtained from body reserves over each time period. Loss of body stores of fat and pr otein represents energy mobilized for metabolism. When the amount of energy libera ted from body stores is subtracted from total energy expenditure (measured in object ive 1), the remainder will represent the dietary contribution. The diet ary contribution assessed in this manner should equal calculations of dietary inta ke made under objective 2. Similarly, when the amount of protein liberated from body stores is subtracted from tota l protein requirements, the difference will represent the dietary contribution. O BJECTIVE 4: Quantify dietary energy and protein intake of pregnant and non-pregnant moose foraging in pens assessed by observati onal monitoring of browsing. Generate and validate an observational technique to qua ntify energy and nitrogen obtained from browse by moose foraging in summer. Techniques to visually estimate diet co mposition and nutrient acquisition rates of seasonal forage previously developed and valid ated at the Moose Research Center were used to quantify annual activity, diet composition, and nutrient intake (bite size, bite rate) of foraging moose at the Moose Research Center monthly July 2007-June 2008 (n=4, 353 hours). Representative samples of plants ea ten by moose were collected for species- specific biomass regressions and analyzed for nutrient content (digestibility, protein, energy, and tannin content; n=60). O BJECTIVE 5: Quantify dietary energy and nitr requirements of pregnant and non- pregnant moose in metabolic stalls assessed by comparison of forage intake and urinary and fecal losses. Two pregnant and two nonpregnant moose were held in metabolic stalls at the MRC for a six-day feeding tria l twice during winter 2004-2005, th ree times during winter 2005-2006 and again three times during wi nter 2006-2007. Trials were in itiated one month from the end of the first, second and third trimesters during each winter, except during winter 2004-2005 when trials were conducted during the second and third trimesters only. During trials, moose were fed 90% of an ad lib pelleted feed diet determined during a 12- 18 day pretrial feeding period (Schwartz et al 1987). Metabolic stalls allowed delivery of a known quantity of feed, and collection of all fecal and urinary waste eliminated during each trial. A measured quantity of feed wa s presented, and urine and fecal samples were collected, over 24-hour blocks of time for th e six days of the feeding trial. We are currently measuring the energy content of feed, feces, and urine samples via bomb calorimetry, and measuring the nitrogen content of the feed, fecal material, and urine via LECO analysis. Later, subtraction of the am ount of energy and nitrogen in fecal and Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 5 urinary waste from the amount provided in feed will confirm energy and nitrogen requirements by these animals. OBJECTIVE 6: Generate and validate a predictiv e equation for body composition and total body fat and protein content based on palpation measurement of tissue depth. Generate and validate a predictive equation for to tal body protein content using ultrasound- measured depth of skeletal muscles. Identify potential biopsy indicators of body condition, and identify muscle groups and organs mobilized as labile protein reserves to meet metabolic demands. Measure tissue depth relative to underlying bone structure at withers, over ribs, and rump by palpation, and correlate with total body fat, protein, ash, and water content measures obtained via carcass body composition analysis. Measure tissue depth relative to underlying bone structure at withers, over ribs, and rump by palpation, and correlate with total body fat, protein, ash, and water content measures obtained via carcass body composition analysis. We measured tissue depth relative to underlying bone structure at w ithers, over ribs, and rump by palpation in four moose that were later euthanized for carcass body composition analysis, and eight moose three times each during the winters of 2005-2006 and 2006- 2007, and again immediately after parturiti on in June 2006 and 2007. We also measured tissue depth relative to underlying bony struct ures in two moose three times each during winter 2007-2008, and once again after partur ition in June of 2008. Measures of tissue depth relative to underlying bony structures made by palpation is currently being analyzed and correlated with total body fat, protein, ash, and water content measures obtained via carcass body composition analysis in the four euthanized animals, and also correlated with measures of body composition of fat and protein obtained by deuterium oxide dilution in the animals not euthanized. We measured tissue depth relative to underlying bone structure at w ithers, over ribs, and rump via b-mode ultrasound in four moose th at were later euthanized for carcass body composition analysis, and eight moose thre e times each during the winters of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, and again immediately after pa rturition in June 2006 and 2007. We also measured tissue depth relative to underlying bony structures in two moose three times each during winter 2007-2008, and once again af ter parturition in June of 2008. Measures of tissue depth relative to underlying bony st ructures made by ultrasound is currently being analyzed and correlated with tota l body fat, protein, ash, and water content measures obtained via carcass body composition an alysis in the four euthanized animals, and also correlated with measures of body composition of fat and protein obtained by deuterium oxide dilution in the animals not euthanized. We obtained muscle, fat, organ and marro w biopsies, and blood samples from four animals that were euthanized and proce ssed for body composition analysis. We are currently analyzing these biops ies for tissue protein and nitr ogen content, nitrogen and carbon stable isotope signature, and fatty ac id profiles. After these measurements are made, we will attempt to correlate these measures from biopsy samples with overall body fat and protein content measurements obt ained via carcass body composition analysis. Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 6 Objective 7. Writing re ports and manuscripts Annual research performance pr ogress reports were prepared and submitted for project 1.60 in both FY 05 and FY 06. During FY06, \"Nut rient intake of a southeast Alaska moose population in relation to forage avai lability and its influence on nutritional condition\", K.S. White, J.A. Crouse and N.L Barten, was presented as a poster at the annual meeting of The Wildlif e Society in Anchorage AK September 22-27, 2006. IV. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS Knowledge of the interactions between diet and body reserves, and the ability to predict total body composition in terms of both fat and pr otein reserves, rather than just in terms of overall condition, will provide biologists the tools to bette r evaluate the effects and limitations that changes in habitat quality, winter severity, and subsequently nutrition have on productivity and surv ival in populations of wild moose. These tools are extremely important, given declining moose populations in many areas across the state. Evaluating fat and protein reserves separately may provide insight not available through standard qualitative condition assessment. Ultimately, this study will aid in understandi ng how an individual animal's health and body reserves affect its futu re fitness (Stephenson et al. 2002) and overall population health by delineating threshold levels of body reserves of fat and protein that predict whether a cow moose produces a single calf, twins, or experiences a reproductive pause. Detailed investigation of diet, skeletal muscle and organ tissue, and body fat reserves are also required to identify how each of these resources are utilized to meet metabolic needs, and to determine the functional consequen ces of nutritional or protein limitation. For example, while not statistically valid, it is of interest to note that female moose in the Nelchina Basin and Tanana Flats areas seem to have greatly decreased reproductive output, evidenced by low partur ition and extremely low twinning rates, compared with cow moose in the McGrath and Togiak areas, despite approximately equal levels of ingesta-free body fat measured in moose in a ll four locations. Table 1 summarizes this data. While other factors including winter seve rity, animal density, and habitat quality, or sampling methodology are not considered in this comparison, body fat may not be the only factor influencing reproductive rates in these animal s. Separate treatment of diet, body fat, and body protein stores will be informative. Following changes in total body fat and protein reserves in the same animal across different seasons also will allow researchers to determine baseline fat a nd protein requirements for maintenance and survival, and then quantify the surplus that can be devoted to growth and reproduction. V. SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED ON JOBS IDENTIFIED IN ANNUAL PLAN FOR LAST SEGMENT PERIOD ONLY J OB/ACTIVITY 1: Measure total overwinter energy expenditure by pregnant and non- pregnant moose. The doubly labeled water method was used to measure energy expenditure in two pregnant cow moose over th ree, three-week periods during winter 2007-2008. Energy expenditure was measured between December 1-21, 2007, March 5-26, 2008, and May 7-28, 2008. Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 7 JOB/ACTIVITY 2: Assess total overwinter protein requirements in pregnant and nonpregnant moose foraging in pens at the MRC. Blood samples were obtained from two pregnant moose four times during the winter of 2007-2008. Blood samples were obtained late in each trimester (Dec. 1, 2007; March 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008) of pregnancy, and once immediately following parturition (June 12, 200). These samples are currently being analyzed to obtain plasma amino acid profiles and blood chemistry measurement that will indirectly assess protein metabolism. These samples are being analyzed by the Univ ersity of Missouri Experimental Station Chemistry Laboratory (amino acid profiles) and Peninsula General Hospital (blood chemistry). JOB/ACTIVITY 3: Calculate energy mobilized from body reserves of fat, and protein mobilized from labile reserves in pre gnant compared to non-pregnant moose. We also used the isotope dilution method to measure body fat and protein levels in two pregnant moose three times (Dec. 1, 2007; March 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008) in winter 2007-2008, and again after parturition on June 14, 2008. We are currently using this data to calc ulate the amount of to tal energy and protein obtained from browse compared to that obtained from body reserves over each time period. Loss of body stores of fat and pr otein represents energy mobilized for metabolism. When the amount of energy libera ted from body stores is subtracted from total energy expenditure (measured in object ive 1), the remainder will represent the dietary contribution. The diet ary contribution assessed in this manner should equal calculations of dietary inta ke made under objective 2. Similarly, when the amount of protein liberated from body stores is subtracted from tota l protein requirements, the difference will represent the dietary contribution. J OB/ACTIVITY 4: Quantify dietary energy a nd protein intake of pregnant and non pregnant moose foraging in pens assessed by ob servational monitoring of browsing. Generate and validate an observational technique to quantify energy and nitrogen obtained from browse by moose foraging in summer. Radio-collared moose on the Gustavus Forelands, AK were observed for activity, diet composition, and nutrient intake (bite size, bite rate) 30October - 15November 2007 (n=12, 96 hours), and 21February - 9March 2007 (n=12, 107 hours). Concurrent br owse surveys (n=35) quantified willow biomass availability and utiliz ation. Representative forage species were collected during each period for species-specific biomass regr essions and analyses of nutrient content (digestibility, protein, energy, and tannin cont ent). Moose were chemically immobilized via ground or helicopter captures 30October - 08November 2007 and 02March - 11March 2008 (n=35 and 35, respectively) for radio-collaring, co llecting biological samples, and assessing nutritional condition. Techniques to visually estimate diet co mposition and nutrient acquisition rates of seasonal forage previously developed and valid ated at the Moose Research Center were used to quantify annual activity, diet composition, and nutrient intake (bite size, bite rate) of foraging moose at the Moose Research Center monthly July 2007-June 2008 (n=4, 353 hours). Representative samples of plants ea ten by moose were collected for species- specific biomass regressions and analyzed for nutrient content (digestibility, protein, energy, and tannin content; n=60). Project No. 1.60 - Moose Nutrition FY08 Final Performance Report 8 JOB/ACTIVITY 5: Quantify dietary energy and nitroge n requirements of pregnant and non- pregnant moose in metabolic stalls assessed by comparison of forage intake and urinary and fecal losses. This objective was inactive duri ng the most recent reporting period. JOB/ACTIVITY 6: Generate and validate a predic tive equation for body composition and total body fat and protein content based on palpation measurement of tissue depth. Generate and validate a pr edictive equation for total body protein content using ultrasound-measured depth of skeletal muscle s. Identify potential biopsy indicators of body condition, and identify muscle groups and organs mobilized as labile protein reserves to meet metabolic demands. We measured tissue depth relative to underl ying bony structures with both ultrasound and by the palpation method in two moose three times each (Dec. 1, 2007; March 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008) in winter 2007-2008, and ag ain after parturition on June 14, 2008. No moose were euthanized and processed fo r body composition measurements during the reporting period. JOB/ACTIVITY 7: Write reports and manuscripts. Tentative publications are listed below. VI.
