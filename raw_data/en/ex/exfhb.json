I have received and reviewed the mening itis/meningitis vaccine information provided on the back of this form. I understand the risks of meningococcal meningitis and the benefit of immunization and have decided that I will NOT obtain immunization against meningococcal meningitis. is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is a severe bacterial infection of the bloodstream or meninges (a thin linin g covering the brain and spinal cord) caused by the meningococcus germ. Who gets meningococcal disease? Anyone can get meningococcal disease, but it is more common in infants and children. For some adolescents, such as first year college students living i n dormitories, there is an increased risk of meningococcal disease. Every year in the United States approximately 2,500 people are infected and 300 die from the disease. Other persons at increased risk include household contacts of a person known to have h ad this disease, immunocompromised people, and people traveling to parts of the world where meningococcal meningitis is prevalent. How is the meningococcus germ spread? The meningococcus germ is spread by direct close contact with nose or throat discharge s of an infected person. What are the symptoms? High fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and a rash are symptoms of meningococcal disease. The symptoms may appear 2 to 10 days after exposure, but usually within 5 days. Among people who develop meningoco ccal disease , 10- 15% die, in spite of treatment with antibiotics. Of those who live, permanent brain damage, hearing loss, kidney failure, loss of arms or legs, or chronic nervous system problems can occur. What is the treatment for meningococcal disease? Antibiotics, such as penicillin G or ceftriaxone, can be used to treat people with meningococcal disease. Should people who have been in contact with a diagnosed case of meningococcal meningitis be treated? Only people who have been in close contact (hou sehold members, intimate contacts, health care personnel performing mouth -to-mouth resuscitation, day care center playmates, etc.) need to be considered for preventive treatment. Such people are usually advised to obtain a prescription for a special antibi otic (either rifampin, ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone) from their physician. Casual contact, as might occur in a regular classroom, office or factory setting, is not usually significant enough to cause concern. Is there a vaccine to prevent meningococcal me ningitis? In February 2005 the CDC recommended a new vaccine, known as Menactra for use to prevent meningococcal disease in people 11 -55 years of age. The previously licensed version of this vaccine, Menomune is available for children 2 -10 years old and adults older than 55 years. Both vaccines are 85% to 100% effective in preventing the 4 kinds of the meningococcus germ (types A, C, Y, W -135). These 4 types cause about 70% of the disease in the United States. Because the vaccines do not include type B, w hich accounts for about one -third of cases in adolescents, they do not prevent all cases of meningococcal disease. Is the vaccine Safe? Are there adverse side effects to the vaccine? Both vaccines are currently available and both are safe and effective v accines. However, both vaccines may cause mild and infrequent side effects, such as redness and pain at the injection site lasting up to two days. Who should get the meningococcal vaccine? The vaccine is recommended for all adolescents entering middle sch ool (11 -12 years old) and high school (15 years old), and all first year college students living in dormitories. However, the vaccine will benefit all teenagers and young adults i n the United States. Also at increased risk are people with terminal compleme nt deficiencies or asplenia, some laboratory workers and travelers to endemic areas of the world. What is the duration of protection from the vaccine? Menomune, the older vaccine, requires booster doses every 3 to 5 years. Although research is still pend ing, the new vaccine, Menactra, will probably not require booster doses. How do I get more information about meningococcal disease and vaccination? Contact your physician or your student health service.
