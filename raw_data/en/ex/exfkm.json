Dr. Ramin Eshghi earned his master's degree in biotechnology from John Hopkins University before earning his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Southern California University of Health and Sciences. Dr. Eshghi's goal is to maintain and improve the spinal health of all patients while educating the community and each patient about the benefits of chiropractic. As a professional college volleyball player, Dr. Eshghi saw a chiropractor on a weekly basis and he understands the importance of a strong posture and alignment for higher performance. While first seeing a chiropractor for a high school football injury with great results, and always being drawn to a career in healthcare, Dr. Clark knew that chiropractic was the best fit as it offered a natural and holistic approach to healing and living a healthy and wellness based lifestyle. Dr. Clark received his bachelors degree from Iowa State University, and then went on to graduate at the top of his class at Southern California University of Health Sciences in 2015.
