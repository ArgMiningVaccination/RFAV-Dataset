Who is this kit suitable for? This product helped my 3 dogs to recover. You could see the results after just a few days. We are not yet finished with the complete detox, but we have already seen the benefits, namely no more skin lesions and less scratching... and less ticks and fleas. My only disappointment is that the labels on the vials are exactly identical and erase very quickly once touched. I can no longer distinguish between two of the spray products, it is very frustrating! The products were quickly delivered (despite the current economic situation) and I receive quick answers when I ask them. A huge thank you. Always good advice and quality products to keep a dog in better health. The treatments are very effective and work quickly. Thank you very much to the whole team! Products sent and received quickly in France! Packaging is very cute in addition. :) Bravo for your efficiency! I am satisfied with the welcome and advice, "}
