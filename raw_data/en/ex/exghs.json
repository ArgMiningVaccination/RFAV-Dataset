This application for a variation of the conditional marketing authorization (cMA) follows guidance from the EMA and International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) to work towards introducing Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccines. The bivalent vaccine contains 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the wild-type spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is present in COMIRNATY\u00ae (the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine) and 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variants. With the exception of the addition to the mRNA of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike protein sequence, all other components of the vaccine remain unchanged. Pre-clinical data showed a booster dose of Pfizer and BioNTech's Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine generated a Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 variants, as well as the original wild-type strain. In addition to the pre-clinical, quality and manufacturing data for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 adapted bivalent vaccine, the submission is supported by safety, tolerability and immunogenicity [data](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-announce-omicron-adapted-covid-19&esheet=52830565&newsitemid=20220825005747&lan=en-US&anchor=data&index=3&md5=db4df9922fadba310ddc80205ccb07ef) from a Phase 2/3 trial of a 30-\u00b5g booster dose of their Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine, which combines 15-\u00b5g of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 15-\u00b5g mRNA encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant. The companies have also provided safety data from clinical trials evaluating multiple variant-adapted vaccine candidates based on previous variants of concern (e.g., Alpha, Beta and Delta variants). Pfizer and BioNTech also [filed an application](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fannouncements%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-complete-submission-european-medicines-agency-omicron-ba1&esheet=52830565&newsitemid=20220825005747&lan=en-US&anchor=filed+an+application&index=4&md5=35c47079e5b93c63d885daba5b3dc12e) with the EMA for the Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in July which is currently under review by the Agency. Both the Omicron BA.1-adapted and Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent boosters will be available to ship shortly after respective regulatory authorizations and be available for use as early as September, pending regulatory approval. Local supply may vary based on individual country government requests. On August 22, the companies also [completed a submission](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-submit-application-us-fda-emergency-use&esheet=52830565&newsitemid=20220825005747&lan=en-US&anchor=completed+a+submission&index=5&md5=b1f3f51d73d918e15d13677958793fb9) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of a booster dose of an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 12 years of age and older. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY\u00ae) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned. U.S. Indication & Authorized Use Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months of age and older. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized to provide: Primary Series - A 3-dose primary series to individuals 6 months through 4 years of age - a 2-dose primary series to individuals 5 years through 11 years of age - a 2-dose primary series to individuals 12 years of age and older - a third primary series dose to individuals 5 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise Booster Series - a single booster dose to individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine - a first booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) - a first booster dose to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The booster schedule is based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series - a second booster dose to individuals 50 years of age and older who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine - a second booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine COMIRNATY\u00ae INDICATION COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older. HOW IS COMIRNATY \u00ae GIVEN? COMIRNATY\u00ae is administered as an injection into the muscle as a 2-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart. COMIRNATY\u00ae AUTHORIZED USES COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to provide: Primary Series - a third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise Booster Dose - a first booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae - a first booster dose to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The booster schedule is based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series - a second booster dose to individuals 50 years of age and older who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine - a second booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine Emergency Use Authorization Emergency uses of the vaccine have not been approved or licensed by FDA, but have been authorized by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) in individuals 6 months of age and older. The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. INTERCHANGEABILITY FDA-approved COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine FDA authorized for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for individuals 12 years of age and older can be used interchangeably by a vaccination provider when prepared according to their respective instructions for use. The formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorized for use in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age, 5 through 11 years of age, and 12 years of age and older are different and should therefore not be used interchangeably. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Tell your vaccination provider about all of the vaccine recipient's medical conditions, including if the vaccine recipient: - has any allergies - has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - has a fever - has a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner - is immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune system - is pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding - has received another COVID-19 vaccine - has ever fainted in association with an injection - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) may not protect all vaccine recipients - The vaccine recipient should not receive Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) if the vaccine recipient has had a severe allergic reaction to any of its ingredients or had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae - There is a remote chance that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where the vaccine was administered for monitoring after vaccination. If the vaccine recipient experiences a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital - Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine, particularly during the 2 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart - Fainting - Unusual and persistent irritability - Unusual and persistent poor feeding - Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy - Persistent vomiting - Persistent pain in the abdomen - Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin - Fainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). Sometimes people who faint can fall and hurt themselves. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask the vaccine recipient to sit or lie down for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine Some people with weakened immune systems may have reduced immune responses to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) - Additional side effects include rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, arm pain, and fainting in association with injection of the vaccine and irritability These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away. - You should always ask your healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events.
