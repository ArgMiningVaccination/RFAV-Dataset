Certified Organic Artichoke Artichoke has a history of use as both a food and as medicine going back to ancient Egypt and Greece. Used for indigestion, anemia, edema, arthritis, cystitis, liver dysfunction, and preventing gallstones, it is also used as a diuretic and to stimulate bile production in the liver. Medicinally, artichoke is used for indigestion, nausea, irritable bowel syndrome , renal insufficiency, anemia, edema, arthritis, cystitis, liver dysfunction, preventing gallstones and for treating snake bites. It is also used as a diuretic and to stimulate bile production in the liver. Artichoke has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. Nutritionally, artichoke provides around 5.5 grams of amino acids per 100 calories. Twenty-two percent of the total calories in artichokes come from protein. The antioxidant levels of artichoke flower heads is one of the highest reported for vegetables which is twice the level as found in blueberries. Artichoke leaf extract reduces symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain in patients with impaired digestion associated with dysfunction of the gallbladder or bile ducts. Improvement generally occurs after 2 to 8 weeks of use. Preliminary research suggests that artichoke leaf extract might work as a preventative by protecting liver cells from damage. Jerusalem artichoke may constitute a novel prebiotic additive for dogs because of its positive influence on fibre utilization which was translated into better apparent absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Positive impacts on gut health and immune status were also apparent.

It is used as a laxative, diuretic, circulatory tonic, skin toner, blood tonic, and digestive tonic, and treats infections such as viral and urinary tract infections, as well as treats cancer. The first reference of Dandelion as a medicine is found in the works of Arabian physicians of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Dandelion is used for heart failure, loss of appetite, indigestion, flatulence, gallstones, bile stimulation, joint pain, muscle aches, eczema and bruises. Dandelion is also used as a laxative, diuretic, circulatory tonic, skin toner, blood tonic, and digestive tonic. It is used to treat infection, especially viral infections and urinary tract infections as well as cancer. Dandelion root contains high concentrations of inulin. Oligofructans, such as inulin, are used as food sources by beneficial intestinal bacteria. Dandelion root enhances the growth of bifidobacteria and may be useful as a \"prebiotic\". Dandelion root Increases bile production and bile flow to the gallbladder. Certified Organic Milk Thistle Milk thistle is used for liver disorders including toxic liver damage caused by chemicals, chronic inflammatory liver disease, loss of appetite, gallbladder complaints, colitis, auto-immune disease, and uterine problems just to name a few. Thistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterized by leaves with sharp prickles which protect the plant from being eaten by herbivores. Milk thistle has been used in traditional herbal medicine for a long time, with references dating all the way back to the first century. Medicinally, milk thistle is used for liver disorders including toxic liver damage caused by chemicals and chemotherapy; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, jaundice, chronic inflammatory liver disease, hepatic cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. It is also used orally for loss of appetite, gallbladder complaints, colitis, diabetes, prostate cancer, auto-immune disease, uterine complaints, low breast milk supply, allergic rhinitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and infertility. A study from 2007 concluded that silymarin (found in milk thistle) and vitamin E decreased gentamicininduced toxicity in dogs. (1) Sources: Organic Barley Grass Barley grass is used for diarrhea, gastritis, inflammatory bowel conditions and for cancer prevention. It is also used for lowering blood sugar, increasing strength and stamina, and supports toxin removal from the body. It is considered to be easier on the digestive tract than wheatgrass. Barley grass is the leaf of the barley plant, as opposed to the grain. It's medicinal and food uses date back to 7000 BC. Nutritionally, barley grass juice contains beta carotene, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, pantothenic acid, and folic acid. Minerals present include potassium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and magnesium. Barley grass supports toxin removal from the body. Advocates report that barley grass is generally easier on the digestive tract (than wheatgrass), and has the added benefit of being high in organic sodium and therefore beneficial to those with arthritis. Organic Turmeric Root Turmeric is known for its intense orange color and has been used in Asia for thousands of years. It is a cornerstone of both Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is used for abdominal pain, Crohn's disease, colitis, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal bloating, loss of appetite, hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, liver and gallbladder conditions, and is known for its antioxidant properties, just to name a few. Turmeric is a flowering plant of the ginger family. Turmeric has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma. It's known for its intense orange color. Turmeric has been used in Asia for thousands of years and is a major part of both Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It was first used as a dye, and then later for its medicinal properties. Medicinally, turmeric is used for arthritis, abdominal pain, Crohn's disease, colitis, hemorrhage, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal bloating, loss of appetite, jaundice, hepatitis, Helicobacter pylori (H pylori), ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome along with liver and gallbladder conditions. It is also used for headaches, respiratory infections, fatigue, fever, surgical recovery and cancer, including colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. Other uses include anterior uveitis, diabetes, edema, worms, kidney inflammation, systemic lupus, tuberculosis, cystitis and joint pain. Specific to the liver, turmeric is used for jaundice, hepatitis and other liver conditions, gallbladder conditions and GI conditions. Clinical research with turmeric extracts have shown that it reduces pain and increases functionality in varying amounts in people with osteoarthritis. Compared to conventional treatment, taking a turmeric extract of 500 mg 3-4 times daily for 4-6 weeks seems to be comparable to taking ibuprofen 400 mg 2-3 times daily for reducing knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin daily (the main active ingredient in turmeric) reduces the severity of liver disease. Curcumin decreases liver enzyme levels and reduces non alcoholic fatty liver disease severity in 75% to 78.9% of patients compared to 4.7% to 27.5% of patients receiving placebo. Curcumin also decreases additional fat deposition in the liver to 0% to 4.5% compared to 17.5% to 25.6% in those taking placebo. Turmeric is also known for its antioxidant abilities. The antioxidant effect of turmeric appears to be so powerful that it may stop the liver from being damaged by toxins. This could be good news for cases where strong drugs for diabetes or other health conditions that might hurt the liver are taken over the long-term. Use caution if taking turmeric with anti-coagulents or anti-diabetic drugs. Organic Broccoli Sprouts Orally, sprouts used for allergies, cancer, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections. The nutritional content in sprouted seeds varies depending on species, but as a general rule, sprouts contain notable amounts of vitamin C; traces of B vitamins; a surprising amount of protein and fiber; and small amounts of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Sprouts improve the digestive process, boost the metabolism, increase enzymatic activity, prevent anemia, aid in weight loss, prevent neural tube defects, boost skin health, improve vision, support the immune system, and increase usable energy reserves. Organic Cilantro Cilantro is used for cancer and to remove heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and aluminum from the body. It is also used for its antioxidant, antibacterial, antimutagenic and antiparasitic properties. Cilantro is thought by many to be from the Mediterranean region of Europe. It appears that cilantro has been used for at least 5000 years. The seeds (also known as coriander) have even been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. Medicinally, cilantro is used for cancer and to remove heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and aluminum from the body. It is also used for its antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-mutagenic and anti-parasitic properties. Cilantro helps maintain liver function by protecting liver cells from toxins. An animal study, published in \"Toxicology and Industrial Health\" in 2012, found that rats fed cilantro were less likely to suffer liver damage from exposure to toxins than those that did not eat cilantro. The study also found that cilantro leaves have a high concentration of polyphenols, the family of compounds thought to be responsible for cilantro's beneficial effect (1). Sources: Organic Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is used as an adaptogen to increase resistance to environmental stress and can also be used as a general tonic. It also decreases inflammation and can be used for anxiety, tumors, hypothyroidism and chronic liver disease. Ashwagandha has been used in Ayurvedic medicine in India for thousands of years.

Additionally, it is used to reduce fatigue associated with chemotherapy. Why cleanse, detox and support the liver? Dogs originally evolved in a pristine natural environment that was free from chemicals, drugs and other harmful toxins that now exist in the modern world. Today's dogs regularly come in contact with countless toxic chemicals on a daily basis. Many of them show high levels of heavy metals and toxins which leads to disease and a shortened life span. There are tens of trillions of cells in the canine body with 37 thousand billion billon chemical reactions happening in the body every second, and the liver plays a key role in this incredibly complex system. If you find the number above hard to comprehend, it looks something like this: 37 000 000 000 000 000 000 000/sec While the biochemical reactions happen automatically, they are greatly influenced by foreign and toxic substances. Toxicity, along with nutrient deficiencies and poor diet are the primary cause of disease including liver problems. It is our experience that a semi-annual liver cleanse and detox is one of the keys to your dog's healthy and long life.

Is it intended for all life stages? While LiverTune is safe for all ages, there is no reason to start a liver cleanse until your puppy is at least 6 months of age. How long should I be giving my dog LiverTune, and how often? For a first time cleanse, administer orally (mixed in your dog's food) for six weeks. Repeat every six months and use LiverTune for four weeks as a part of a preventative cleanse. Are there any symptoms to expect when starting a cleanse? Since LiverTune helps expel toxins from the liver and the body, it is not uncommon to see changes in stool such as mucous passing, possibly some diarrhea and occasionally ear or skin irritation as the body is adjusting and ridding itself of toxins. These symptoms are positive cleansing effects and usually only last a few days to a week, but if they become severe we recommend giving less (1/4 to 1/2 dose) until the body adjusts and symptoms subside. Can I continue to give my dog the other essentials during the liver cleanse? Yes! We recommend keeping your dog on the essentials during the course of the liver cleanse. Please see our [Guidelines for introducing our essential supplements ](https://peterdobias.com/pages/guidelines-for-introducing-our-essential-supplements)(scroll halfway down the page for our cleanse instructions). Note on other supplements: Dr. Dobias often recommends not doubling up on similar supplements or ingredients. For example, if you are already giving your dog a product for the liver and it contains milk thistle we wouldn't recommend using LiverTune at the same time with that supplement. Are there any special diet requirements that you recommend during a cleanse? [A raw or cooked natural diet](https://peterdobias.com/pages/course-rawdiet) is always best, however the liver cleanse will be beneficial regardless of diet. In general Dr. Dobias recommends lower fat foods and increased vegetable intake during a cleanse. Can LiverTune be given at the same time as Zyflamend? We do not recommend giving these two products together. Stop giving Zyflamend for the duration of your dog's liver cleanse. How about taking LiverTune with Denamarin? We do not recommend giving these two products together as they both contain milk thistle as a main ingredient. My dog has a liver disorder, is it safe to do a cleanse? Dr. Dobias has found a cleanse to be very beneficial for dogs with liver disease. Read more on treating and preventing liver disease naturally [here](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/11014997-treating-and-preventing-liver-disease-naturally). My dog has kidney issues, is it safe to do a cleanse? LiverTune can be given to dogs with kidney disease, however it is not specific for kidney support. [Please see this article on kidney disease ](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/11015021-holistic-approach-to-kidney-disease-treatment)or speak with your veterinarian. Are there any concerns/contraindications where you should NOT do a cleanse? (conditions, medications, supplements?) This product is not recommended if your dog has been diagnosed with gallstones or bile duct obstruction. Please consult your veterinarian before using this product in pregnant or nursing dogs, and before using at the same time as the antibiotics cipro & baytril and other fluoroquinolones. CONTRAINDICATIONS May increase the potential of decreased blood clotting when used in combination with NSAIDS. Is LiverTune gluten-free? Yes, the barley grass in LiverTune is only the green grass, not the grain and therefore gluten-free. Are there any concerns in taking LiverTune on a long-term basis? LiverTune is intended to be given for a 6 week period for the first cleanse. For subsequent cleanses LiverTune should be given for a 4 week period every 6 months. If you wish to use it longer than the recommended period, it is important to work closely with your treating veterinarian to continuously monitor your dog's liver function by having regular blood work done. Will LiverTune also cleanse the digestive tract? LiverTune is not necessarily formulated as a digestive tonic, but it does contain ingredients that support the digestive tract. The main supplement that we have for digestive support is [GutSense.](https://peterdobias.com/products/gutsense) Will LiverTune help resolve skin issues? Every time you get rid of toxins, you may see improvements in skin balance. However many skin conditions originate from other problems, and the root cause must be addressed. True allergies are not as common as [mobility and spinal issues](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/11014037-why-are-skin-allergies-in-dogs-often-misdiagnosed) that present as allergies. "}
