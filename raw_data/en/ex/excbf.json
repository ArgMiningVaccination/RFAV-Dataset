The homeopath strives to perceive each patient's individual physical, mental and emotional nature, trying always to prescribe for the person, rather than the diagnosis. Homeopathy's central philosophical point is called the law of similars, \"Like Cures Like.\" People have observed that a substance which causes an illness or a symptom can, in very small doses, cure the same problem by stimulating the organism to realign itself. Homeopathic medicines are quite safe: they are known to be non-allergenic, non-toxic, and free of side effects. They are prepared from herbal, mineral, and animal substances by homeopathic pharmacies, under strict guidelines established by the FDA . Those practicing homeopathy include naturopathic physicians, medical doctors, chiropractors, osteopathic physicians, as well as trained professional homeopaths. The in-depth interview process delves deeply into the patient's physical, mental, and emotional nature. People often report that they enjoy the process and the individualized care provided by their homeopathic practitioner. The remedy is chosen by the practitioner after an interview and analysis. Classical homeopathy, such as that practiced in this office was originally conceived by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), encourages the prescriber to offer only one remedy at a time.
