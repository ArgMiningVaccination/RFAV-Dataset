Physicians should be aware that a refusal by the patient to touch, maintain eye contact, or speak directly to a member of the opposite gender should not be considered insulting.

The economic standards of these countries are among the highest in the world. As a result, people from these countries often travel to the United States and Europe; the reasons for travel may include business, tourism, education, or training, as well as a desire for medical treatment.

The middle-aged and older generations of this cultural group are particularly bound to their local culture, beliefs, and habits. Healthcare providers may face challenges when dealing with patients from these countries because they may have unique cultural and religious beliefs. To provide improved clinical "}
