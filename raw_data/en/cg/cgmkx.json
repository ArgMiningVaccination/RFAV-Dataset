TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) is a system of healing which originated in ancient China, and has evolved over thousands of years. Chinese medicine involves many healing modalities such as acupuncture, moxibustion, herbs, tuina, and qigong. Rooted in the philosophies of Daoism, Chinese medicine dates back more than 2500 years. In the U.S. more than 3 million people use acupuncture and Chinese medicine annually. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ACUPUNCTURE uses extremely thin needles to penetrate the skin in order to stimulate points designated on the body to help alleviate pain or to alleviate various symptoms of illness. Acupuncture is thought to promote the bodies natural functions, and its ability to heal. Qi, an all encompassing Chinese word used to describe the processes and substances of the body as well as in nature, is manipulated through the use of acupuncture needles, and the strategic use of the designated acupuncture points. In the U.S., the FDA regulates acupuncture needles as medical devices, and requires that they be sterile, non-toxic, and single-use. As such, acupuncturists are required by law to these needles. The vast majority of practitioners around the world have adopted the use of these sterile, single-use needles as well. Acupuncture is considered safe when performed by a properly trained Chinese medicine practitioner. In California, acupuncture can only be performed by licensed acupuncturists who have undergone a master's degree program involving 2900 hours of schooling and clinic experience, and who have passed the rigorous state board licensing exam, or by licensed medical doctors who have received the necessary training. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOXIBUSTION is a traditional Chinese medicine technique which involves the burning of an herb, usually mugwort (ai ye) over selected areas of the body to promote healing. Moxa is used to warm regions of the body, and acupuncture points in order to stimulate blood flow, and qi. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ HERBAL MEDICINE has been used by the Chinese for well over 5000 years to restore balance to the body, promote healing, and to help alleviate various symptoms during illness. Chinese herbs can either be prescribed individually or combined into a formula to assist in overall health maintenance. While there has been considerable negative press in recent years regarding Chinese products, including herbs, we take great care to insure our products are extremely safe, and that the companies we source from provide details on origin, testing, and manufacture. We regularly take the herbs we prescribe to our patients. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TUINA is a system of manipulative therapy which is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, and herbs in Chinese medicine. Similar to massage, the muscles and tendons are manipulated along with acupressure points that facilitate the healing process. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ QIGONG is a Chinese practice which includes gentle physical exercises or movements along with breath work, and meditation (or focused intention). There are 1000's of qigong forms which can be practiced to increase health and vitality. "}
