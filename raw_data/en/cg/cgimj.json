What will happen at the visit, and will it help? For people experiencing pain or discomfort, relief is a huge goal, and they may be hoping that they will leave an adjustment feeling immediately refreshed. This can be the case, but it is important to know that you may leave your appointment with [College Park chiropractors](https://www.chiropractorcollegepark.com/) feeling a little bit sore or generally \"off\" compared to when you went in. This is because of a phenomenon known as toxic release and is actually a great sign that your body is healing! What Is Toxic Release? During a chiropractic adjustment, your provider will use their hands and specialized instruments to move your spine, helping it return to alignment. The focus here is on removing misalignments, or subluxations, that are preventing your nervous system from properly communicating with the brain, causing pain and inflammation. Adjustments remove these blockages, allowing for proper blood flow to return as the body begins to heal. In addition to blood flow returning to normal, toxins that may have been blocked in the subluxation are also released. This may sound concerning, but these toxins are usually in your body, moving through a cycle of being flushed out regularly. A toxic release allows them to continue along this path and be properly flushed out. However, a blockage being released may initially overwhelm your body and cause symptoms of a toxic release. The symptoms of a toxic release do not usually last more than a few days at most- anything lasting a week or longer should be addressed directly by your chiropractor. You may also notice a release happening with each adjustment, though the first is typically the most intense, with the severity declining over time. Signs of Toxic Release The largest sign of toxic release is a general soreness that can be compared to the feeling you have after working out a muscle or a deep tissue massage. If you were seeking relief from musculoskeletal issues, this may feel counterintuitive, but it is not a worsening of your original condition. Soreness and weakness will usually resolve quickly and allow you to feel any improvements resulting from your adjustment. For some people, other symptoms may include: - Mild fever - Sweating - Fatigue - Headaches - Nausea - Dizziness Once these [symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9345679/) begin to subside, you should notice you feel more energetic and alert than you did before. You may even feel more relaxed. This is because the toxins have then worked their way through your system, and your body is now operating without these toxins impacting your functionalities. It is also okay if you do not feel any of these symptoms, and it does not mean your adjustment wasn't effective. You may not have had a subluxation for long enough to build up toxins, or your body may simply process them differently than others. This doesn't mean you will never experience a toxic release in the future. Tips to Deal with Toxic Release Symptoms While a toxic release is normal and not harmful, you may want to take steps to relieve symptoms as quickly as possible. Stay Hydrated Water can help flush toxins out of your body more quickly by pushing them through your bloodstream and to your bladder. This can reduce the amount of time you hold the toxins and, therefore, symptoms. Drinking as much water as you can, ideally around 8 cups per day, is recommended whether you are visiting a College Park chiropractor or not. But it is especially important to drink extra water before and after your appointment to encourage toxins to be released. Staying hydrated can also improve general spine health and encourage healing. It can also be helpful to add lemon juice to the water to ensure you get enough minerals during recovery. Lemons contain electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, and potassium that can encourage muscle function and health. [Electrolytes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002934359903468) may also reduce pain and prevent some symptoms of toxic release. Take a Nap Resting your body after a chiropractic adjustment is critical. Don't try to fight symptoms or push through them, but instead allow your body the time to recover. Pushing too much during the toxic release period can cause symptoms to worsen. Even if you cannot take a day off to recover, ensuring your day is not stressful after an adjustment can make a big difference. Avoid physical activity and anything strenuous for at least one day. Eat Vegetables and Fruit When your body is busy flushing out toxins, it is important to take in things that are nutritious and clean. Fruit and vegetables offer vitamins and minerals that can reduce pain and boost your energy during this period of toxic release. They also have the benefit of keeping muscles and bones strong to help with healing your original ailment. Any fruit or vegetable is good for you, but some of the most antioxidant-packed options include cranberries, cherries, raspberries, tomatoes, kale, and spinach. Try to get in at least one serving of these foods per meal. In addition to eating fruits and vegetables, do your best to avoid processed food or foods with a lot of added [sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127911/) as they may worsen symptoms. Try Yoga Even if you feel sore or weak, yoga is a great way to get in some activity without stressing the body more. Moving and stretching can actually make you feel much better. Chiropractors may recommend these poses: - Cat-Cow Pose. This can release leftover tension and increase blood flow around your spine. To begin, get onto all fours on the floor, keeping your palms and the tops of your feet firm on the ground. Slowly arch your back as high as you can and hold the pose for a few seconds before returning to your original position. Then curve your stomach toward the ground, holding for a few seconds and releasing. Repeat a few times. - Cobra Pose. This pose can reduce fatigue and keep your bones strong, as well as help you breathe better by opening up your lungs. To begin, lie facedown on the floor and lift your arms so they make a 90-degree angle at your sides. Keeping your head looking toward the ground, use your arms to slowly lift your chest off the ground, taking a deep breath. Once your chest is lifted as far as you can, slowly exhale. Hold for a few seconds, and then slowly lower your body back toward the ground. Repeat five times. - Bound Angle Pose. If you are feeling particularly fatigued, this can help by increasing blood circulation and flushing toxins faster. It is also helpful for staying relaxed. You start by sitting on the ground and bringing the bottoms of your feet together so that your legs make a diamond shape. Slightly press your heels together and gently push them down with your hands. Try to move your knees toward the ground and your stomach up. Hold for a few seconds before releasing, then repeat three more times. Preparing for Your Chiropractic Adjustment In many cases, there is no way to avoid the release of toxics associated with a chiropractic adjustment. If there is a blockage in your nervous system that has allowed toxins to build up, they will need to be released. One way to ensure this is as minimal as possible is to seek care immediately upon noticing symptoms of an issue or even by engaging in routine chiropractic care to prevent issues from arising. On the day of your appointment, prepare by drinking a lot of water and eating a light meal or snack that is high in protein. Do anything you may need to in order to stay relaxed, like meditation or engaging in an activity you enjoy. Try to be as rested as possible while still moving a little bit, like going for a short walk. You should also be prepared to discuss your symptoms and provide any relevant information on your medical history. This will allow a chiropractor to target your exact symptoms and release blockages early in your treatment process. It is important to be upfront and honest about your concerns so that your treatment can be personalized to be as effective as possible. The more a patient is able to \"accept\" an adjustment and allow the chiropractor to adjust their spine properly, the more effective the treatment will be overall. While a toxic release can still occur, the ultimate effects will be heightened and lessen the risk of more issues in the future.
