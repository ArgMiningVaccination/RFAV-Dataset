We know that making time to de-stress is important. So we have teamed up with Duke alumnae Gigi Falk, Kayla Falk and Sheridan Wilbur to bring you some meditations to help you regain your focus and serenity\u2014particularly when you're unable to get outside, let alone take a deep breath of fresh air. Here is a 7-minute meditation with Duke student and Duke Gardens work-study assistant Gi Chun, accompanied by Duke Gardens scenery. Here is a 16-minute meditation led by Gigi Falk in summer 2020, featuring peaceful footage of koi fish in the Terrace Gardens pond. This is a 5-minute guided meditation by Sheridan Wilbur from spring 2020, accompanied by photos of Duke Gardens taken by Duke students over the years. Here are five audio meditations that Gigi and Kayla Falk recorded for us in summer 2020.
