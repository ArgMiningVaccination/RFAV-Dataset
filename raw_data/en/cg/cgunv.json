Contemporary Approaches and Challenges of Tourism Sustainability AE Vol. XVI Special No. 8 November 2014 1151 MEDICAL TOURISM IN ROMANIA. THE CASE STUDY OF CARDIOVASCULAR REHABILITATION IN COVASNA Roxana Oana Darabont1*, Paul Suceveanu2, Mihaela Suceveanu3 and Clara 1) University of Medicine and Pharmacy C arol Davila\", Bucharest, Romania, 2) 3) Cardiology Hospital dr. Benedek Geza\", Covasna, Romania, 4) Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania/London School of Economics Abstract Romania has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe for ischemic heart disease and, especially, for cerebrovascular disease. Taki ng into account the actual prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, an augmentation of th e demand for specialized medical services is expected. As this paper argues, this situation can have an important impact on medical tourism. We analyze original data on the case study of a hospital, specialized in cardiovascular treatment, in the Romanian coun ty of Covasna, which is offering specific balneal procedures, such as CO 2 .hydrotherapy, alongside regular rehabilitation programs. The aim of our study is to evaluate the dem ographic characteristics, and the pathology of the hospitalized patients, as well as the specific rehabilitation procedures. Our findings suggest that the interest of patients, with ca rdiovascular diseases, for medical tourism can be influenced by accessibility, by some partic ularities of the location, but also by the holistic nature of the rehabilitation procedures. Keywords: medical tourism, cardiovascular diseases, CO 2 hydrotherapy JEL Classification: C46, I11, L83 Introduction Medical tourism is an increasingly large phenomenon across the world (Connell, 2006, Bookman and Bookman, 2007, De Arellano, 2007). It represents the practice of travelling abroad in order to receive medical treatme nt, and usually involves lower costs for the patients, compared to their residence cities, or countries. Additionally, the medical tourism phenomenon can be triggered by the supply of specialized treatments that are available only in particular places, such as the case of baln eal treatments, which are generally reliant on the supply of spring waters. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the ma in cause of death in Europe (Perk et al., 2012), and Romania has one of the highest mo rtality rates due to ischemic heart disease * Corresponding author, Roxana Oana Darabont - rdarabont@yahoo.com AE Medical Tourism in Romania. The Case Study of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation in Covasna Amfiteatru Economic 1152 and, especially, to cerebrovascular disease (M\u00fcller-Nordhorn et al., 2008). Taking into account the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, a rise in the demand of medical services in this field is expected, with an important impact on medical tourism as well. In many European countries health care systems are providing rehabilitation services after an acute cardiovascular event like myocardial infarction or stroke. Some countries are promoting cardiovascular rehabilitation in residential centers, where the patients live in an optimal environment for 2-3 weeks, in order to become familiar with the necessary medication, and be prepared for a healthier lifestyle. Othe r countries favor for ambulatory rehabilitation units (Piepoli et al., 2010). Our research on the medical tourism in Romania is based on the case study of the Hospital for Cardiovascular Rehabilitation \"Benedek Geza\", which is a specialized center for cardiovascular diseases, located in Covasna Coun ty. This region is presently recognized as a holyday destination, but mostly as a landmark destination for cardiovascular rehabilitation . It is located in the easte rn curve of the Carpathian s, in the south-eastern corner of Covasna County. Its touristic des tination status is improved by its accessibility: 35 km from Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe - the county capital, 60 km from Bra ov - one of the largest cities in Romania, and 250 km from Buchares t-Romania's capital. Most importantly, the resort benefits from springs that are rich in mineral components. Covasna has flourished as a health resort si nce 1881, starting with the opening of ''Devil Swamp Bath Institute'' for public. The following year, the mineral water from Covasna won gold medal at the Trieste mineral water world-exhibition. However, the most important and specific natural conditions of Covasna are the carbon dioxide (CO 2) springs ( mofete) . This is a post-volcanic activity that can be found only in a few other regions of the world, like in France, Italy, Java Island, or in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Our study explores the complementarity between the usual rehabilitation programs provided by the studied medical center in C ovasna, and the specific balneal procedures offered during the medical treatment period. Despite an activity that extends over more than 50 years, and the centripetal role in the regi onal touristic activities, there is no previous assessment of this phenomenon. Therefore, based on the empirical data of the \"Bendek Geza\" Hospital, covering patient demographics and pathology for 2 012, we provide an original assessment of the characteristics and incentives that drive medical tourism in the Romanian county of Covasna. 1. Medical Specificities of the CO 2 Hydrotherapy The specific feature of Covasna is CO 2 hydrotherapy - a remedy with a wide spectrum of effects, which have been known and applied since the Middle Ages. Previous research suggests that carbon dioxide balneotherapy pr ovides substantial benefits with regards peripheral arterial disease (Pagourelias et al., 2011). Coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension or chronic venous disease could also take advantage from this therapy, but further research is necessary to support these inferences. There are very few studies that have analyzed the effect of CO 2 balneotherapy. In a systematic review of the literature, Pagourelia s et al. (2011) have identified only nine studies with consistent research methodology on this issue, in the timeframe of 1980-2011. Fabry et al. (2009) have highlighted the improvement of total walking distance, the increase of ankle-brachial index, as well as the peripheral cutaneous oxygenation, in patients with Contemporary Approaches and Challenges of Tourism Sustainability AE Vol. XVI Special No. 8 November 2014 1153 stage II Fontaine peripher al arterial disease, after 18 consecutive days of CO 2 treatment versus placebo (Fabry et al., 2009). Other positive effects in patients with intermittent claudication have been revealed by Hartmann et al. (1997), as patients with mild, bilateral, peripheral occlusive disease had a 300% augmen tation of the Doppler laser flowmetry after immersion in CO 2 - enriched water compared with the immersion in fresh water. Toriyama et al. (2002) have reported good results even in case of critical limb ischemia. Several experimental data have identified possible mechanisms implicated in the benefits of CO 2 therapy. One of these mechanisms consis ts in the production of an important vasodilatation with a shift of oxygen-bindi ng curve that facilitates oxygen delivery in tissues (Resch and Just, 1994). Complementary, there is an increase in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) conducting to nitric oxide (NO)-dependent and the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells in ischemic limbs treated with CO 2\u2014enriched bath (Irie et al., 2005). Other studies have addressed the balance of oxidative stress systems, which seemed to improve under CO 2 balneotherapy (Dogliotti et al., 2011). 2. Research Design and Empirical Evidence The main objective of this research was to a ssert the amplitude of the medical tourism in Covasna, the most important pathologic conditions for which the patients have been addressed to the \"Bendek Geza\" Hospital for Ca rdiovascular Rehabilitation, and the extent of balneal procedures in the rehabilitation program of the patients. For our purpose of evaluating the traits and incentives for medical tourism in this region, we used descriptive statistics of the demographics of admitted patients, their diagnostics at discharge, as well as the procedures applied during their hospitalization. The statistical analysis was conducted with the Eviews software. Our sample consists of 13,878 patients, hospitalized in 2012, which have been included in the institution's database, if they had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease . The demographic data comprises patients' age and area of residence, which are relevant for the medical tourism phenomenon. The classification of cardiovascular diseases for wh ich rehabilitation programs are applied, was based on the main diagnostic at discharge. Of all the procedures realized during hospita lization we have evaluated only those specific for balneotherapy: hydrotherapy, kinetotherap y, therapeutic massage, stimulative therapy, thermotherapy and therapeutic u ltrasound. However, the soft of the statistical evidence in the hospital did not allowed us to correlate the procedures with each type of diagnostic. Patients with such cardiovascular pathology as ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, arterial hypertension, chronic venous insufficiency are admitted in the Hospital for Cardiovascular Rehabilitation \"Benedek Geza\", in Covasna if they have state insurance and are referenced by a cardiologist. During the hospita lization period, the patients are evaluated through clinical exam, ECG, exercise ECG, echocardiography and va scular ultrasound, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ECG Holter monitori ng, oscillometry, pulmonary f unction tests, radiologic exam, laboratory tests and are appl ied rehabilitation programs consisting in education of patients regarding adequate life-style changes, ap propriate diet, reevaluation of pharmacological therapy, metered physical training - all of which are associated to pharmacological therapy. AE Medical Tourism in Romania. The Case Study of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation in Covasna Amfiteatru Economic 1154 3. Results and discussion Our sample of cases consists of 13,878 patients admitted at Bendek Geza\" Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Hospital, in Covasna, in 2012. The mean age of patients was 64.36 years. For the patients that resided in urban areas, the mean age was 64.29 years, while for those that resided in rural area, the average recorded age was 64.51 years (Figure 1). Figure no. 1: Mean Age of Admitted Patients, 2012 Source: compiled by the authors based on Bendek Geza\" Patient Registry, 2012. As showed in Figure 2, the distribution of patients, by area of residence shows a clear prevalence of patients from the urban area, in the vast majority of counties. The records show a prevalence of patients from the rural ar ea in the case of the counties Ilfov, Calarasi, Harghita, and Arad. Finally, from Buzau county, the proportion of admitions was quite similar between those from urban with those from the rural area of residence. The evidence suggests patients from rural areas of reside nce are at disadvantage, by comparison to subjects from the urban area. Further research would be needed to assert whether this situation is due physicians' lack of involvement in such therapeutic options, or to the higher prevalence of patients without state insurance, in rural areas , which effectively prevents them from treatments at the state- owned Bendek Geza\" medical center. In comparison to all the other Romanian counties, the biggest number of patients admitted in 2012, to the Bendek Geza\" Hospital were, predictably enough, residents of Covasna\u2014 1,330 persons. Still, the majority of hospita lisations (83.43%) were constituted by patients from outside this region, and thus, represente d the core of the medical tourism in this hospital (Figure 3). As the hospitalisation in this facility is reliant on the public health insurance, we are unable to compare and c ontrast the national demand for such services with the international demand. In this sense, we believe that private facilities in the area should also collect and make available data on their patients background, which was not available for the present research.

Figure no. 3: Distribution of patients from urban residence Source: compiled by the authors based on Bendek Geza\" Patient Registry, 2012. The main diagnostics at discharge were ar terial hypertension (56.37%) and chronic ischemic cardiopathy (30.53%) (Figure 4). In th e last category should be integrated those with nonspecifed angina (0.09%), other forms of angina (1%) pacientilor din mediului Tourism The Case Study of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation in Covasna Amfiteatru Economic 1156 atherosclerotic cardiopaty (2.37%). All of these are representing the same pathology, therefore we can conclude th at ischemic cardiac disease was represented in the main diagnostic of discharge in 33.99% of cases. The very few patients with acute coronary syndromes, those with acute myocardial the anterior wall (0.08%), where hospitalised in emergency. They were all residents in Covasn a and they were not included immediately in rehabilitation programs. Figure no. 4: Main diagnostic at hospital discharge Source: compiled by the authors based on Bendek Geza\" Patient Registry, 2012. We were initially surprised by the fact that peripheral arterial disease that could have the main benefit from the specific CO 2 balneotherapy in Covasna was found in a very small number of cases compared with arterial hyper tension and cardiac ischemic disease. This results needs a short comment. First of all, arterial hypertension and cardiac ischemic disease have the highest prevalence among cardi ovascular diseases. On the other hand we have to notice that a lot of patients with ar terial hypertension and/or cardiac ischemic disease have also peripheral arterial disease, but this cases have not been introduced in the statistical anlysis because peripheral arterial disease was not the main diagnostic, was a secondary one. As a consequence, higher rates of peripheral arterial disease could be encountered in this patient, but we were not able to reveal it. Based on the available empirical evidence, we evaluated the application rate of each of the specialized procedures of the \"Bendek Geza\" medical center (see Figure 5). Of all the procedures consisting in hydrotherapy, kinetotherapy, therapeutic massage, simulative therapy, thermotherapy and therapeutic ultrasound, hydrotherapy and kinetotherapy were most frequently applied, in 29.44% and resp ectively in 30.42% of cases. We can observe the important role played by CO 2 hydrotherapy as a treatment procedure, thus supporting our assumption that peripheral arterial disease might have higher rates than previously Ponderea fiecarui diagnostic in numarul total de pacienti (%)0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.05 0.07 0.08 0.08 0.09 0.09 0.10 of Tourism Sustainability AE Vol. XVI Special No. 8 November 2014 1157 reported for patients referred to cardiovascular rehabilitation. Also, we have to notice that, in a significant number of cases, have been applied rehabilitation procedures for rheumatic diseases like kinetotherapy, therapeutic massage or therap eutic ultrasound. We did not include in this analysis the usual procedures for cardiovascular rehabilitation, like education of patients regarding adequate life-style changes, appropriate diet, re-evaluation of pharmacological therapy, metered physical training. Figure no. 5: Specific procedures for rehabilitation Source: compiled by the authors based on Bendek Geza\" Patient Registry, 2012 Conclusions Rehabilitation is an important task in the management of cardiovascular diseases and might be a significant objective of medical tourism in Romania. This paper aimed at revealing, through descriptive statistical analysis, th e extent, and the characteristics of medical tourism for cardiovascular diseases in Covasn a, in 2012. We found that the majority of patients (83%) referred to the Hospital for Ca rdiovascular Rehabilitation \"Benedek Geza\" in Covasna come from another area of residence. This suggests that, at least on the national level, there is a medical touristic dynamics towards this region, for cardiovascular disease treatment. Based on the empirical evidence collected, we assert that the interest of patients with cardiovascular diseases for me dical tourism can be influenc ed by accessibility, by some particularities of the location, but also by the integrated feature of the rehabilitation procedures. Given the institutional admission procedures at the \"Bendek Geza\" Hospital, the most important driver for patients is the accessibility offered by the medical insurance. In this regard we have identified that patients from rural area of residence are at disadvantage, by comparison to subjects from the urban area. Another motivation to prefer this location is represented by the reputation of this hospital. However, we are emphasizing that CO 2 hydrotherapy was applied in a similar rate with certain procedures specific for rheumatic diseases. Considering the mean age of patients is quite advanced (64.36 years) AE Medical Tourism in Romania. The Case Study of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation in Covasna Amfiteatru Economic 1158 we can understand why this procedures has b een also been associated to cardiovascular rehabilitation program. Further research would be needed to detail the drivers and restrictions of Romanian patients that might benefit from such therapies. While we have advanced the hypothesis that rural patients might be restricted by a lower public health insurance coverage rate, there is little evidence on this situation. Additionally, there is no estimate of the existence or dimension of an international demand for the Covasna CO 2 cardiovascular rehabilitation treatments. With a triangulation of data between public institutions, such as Bendek Geza\", and other private facilities in the region, we might acquire a better sense of the real dimension of the medical tourism market in this region.
