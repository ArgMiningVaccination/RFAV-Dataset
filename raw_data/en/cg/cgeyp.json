In an Internet sample of 3196 U.S. adults (with many preregistered hypotheses), divine vaccine attributions were more common than demonic attributions. Demonic vaccine attributions were linked with more anti-vaccination attitudes and lower odds of vaccination, whereas divine attributions showed the opposite pattern. Demonic (but not divine) attributions showed consistent positive connections with conspiracy beliefs (including QAnon), anger toward people and organizations seen as pro-vaccine, and seeing one's political opponents as enemies and as evil. Demonic attributions were also linked with more anxiety, depression, and spiritual struggle, and lower agreeableness and social desirability. Both demonic and divine attributions related positively to political conservatism, religious fundamentalism, Christian nationalism, authoritarian aggression, and traditional masculinity beliefs. Demonic (but not divine) attributions were also associated with being younger and having less education. Both demonic and divine vaccine attributions correlated positively with religiousness, belief in God and the devil, and seeing these entities as powerful, able to work through natural events, and intervening often in the world. Demonic and divine attributions also related positively to belief in heaven and hell, seeing many people as destined for hell, seeing life as a cosmic battle between good and evil, and apocalyptic or \"end times\" beliefs.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-06-06", "cleaned_text": "Demonic and Divine Attributions around COVID-19 Vaccines: Links with Vaccine Attitudes and Behaviors, QAnon and Conspiracy Beliefs, Anger, Spiritual Struggles, Religious and Political Variables, and Supernatural and Apocalyptic Beliefs [https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13060519](https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13060519) [COVID-19, Mental Health, and Religious Treatment Research]( /journal/religions/special_issues/religions_health )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2022](#B8-religions-13-00519)). The COVID-19 situation also fueled widespread misinformation, confusion, and mistrust, often taking the form of conspiracy thinking ( [Islam et al. 2020](#B27-religions-13-00519); [Su et al. 2021](#B54-religions-13-00519)). Many people have seen the virus or pandemic as a hoax ( [Bok et al. 2021](#B4-religions-13-00519); [Imhoff and Lamberty 2020](#B26-religions-13-00519)) or believe that COVID-19 was intentionally created in a lab ( [PRRI Staff 2020](#B45-religions-13-00519)). Ongoing tensions around the vaccines, as well as lockdowns and mask mandates, contributed to an atmosphere of mistrust, anger, and politically focused division ( [PRRI Staff 2020](#B45-religions-13-00519), [2021d](#B49-religions-13-00519); [Suthaharan et al. 2021](#B55-religions-13-00519)). When COVID-19 vaccines were developed and made available, many people had concerns about their safety and efficacy, leading to widespread vaccine hesitancy and refusal ( [Kricorian et al. 2022](#B28-religions-13-00519); [PRRI Staff as QAnon ( [PRRI Staff 2021d](#B49-religions-13-00519)) and concerns that the vaccines contained microchips for surveillance ( [Thomas and Zhang 2020](#B57-religions-13-00519)) fanned the flames of confusion, fear and anger. Religious controversies arose as well: some saw the vaccine as a way to show God's love for one's neighbors ( [PRRI Staff 2021c](#B48-religions-13-00519)), while others sought religious exemptions to avoid vaccination ( [PRRI Staff 2021b](#B47-religions-13-00519)). [Gallup 2022](#B23-religions-13-00519)), we were interested in the following questions: Do some people believe that the devil or God influenced people to create or receive the vaccines? How do these demonic and divine attributions relate to vaccine attitudes and behaviors, conspiracy thinking, anger toward others, emotional distress and spiritual struggle? And how do these demonic and divine vaccine attributions connect with other political and religious factors, along with other beliefs related to the supernatural (e.g., ideas about how God and the devil operate; seeing many people as destined for heaven vs. hell; seeing life as a cosmic battle) and beliefs about sources of authority (e.g., fundamentalism, Christian nationalism, authoritarian aggression, masculinity)? 1.1. Demonic and Divine Attributions: Background [Exline et al. 2021a](#B17-religions-13-00519)). Demonic and divine attributions can have both clinical and social importance, as shown in many prior studies (for reviews, see [Exline and Wilt 2022](#B14-religions-13-00519); [Pargament and Exline 2022](#B40-religions-13-00519)). Demonic attributions (and the closely related concept of demonic struggles) have been linked with emotional distress ( [Exline et al. 2014](#B18-religions-13-00519)), declines in mental health ( [Nie and Olson 2017](#B37-religions-13-00519)), higher mortality rates for medically ill older adults ( [Pargament et al. 2001](#B42-religions-13-00519)), and poorer outcomes from divorce ( [Krumrei et al. 2011](#B30-religions-13-00519)). Demonic attributions may be especially dangerous when focused on other people, as they are linked with anger and antagonistic behavior\u2014patterns shown, for example, in response to the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections ( [Exline et al. 2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519); [Wong et al. 2019](#B64-religions-13-00519)). Divine attributions show more mixed correlates, depending largely on whether God's intentions are seen as positive or negative. For example, people who see a divine hand behind positive events may feel happy and grateful ( [Wilt and Exline 2022](#B62-religions-13-00519)). When people see God causing negative events, they might see God's intentions as benevolent and use such beliefs to cope ( [Pargament et al. 2000](#B41-religions-13-00519)), or they might see God's motivations as cruel and feel anger in response ( [Exline et al. 2011](#B15-religions-13-00519)). [Exline et al. 2022](#B16-religions-13-00519); [https://osf.io/nv9q3/](https://osf.io/nv9q3/)(uploaded on 15 February 2022)). Because we included so many variables in this study, our hypothesis descriptions are necessarily brief. 1.2. Demonic and Divine Vaccine Attributions: Competing Hypotheses - Supernatural Worldview Hypothesis. People need to hold some belief in God and the devil\u2014and see them as somehow active in the world\u2014in order to make demonic and divine attributions. Using this reasoning, divine and demonic attributions should correlate positively, and they should show similar correlations with other variables, because they both reflect a supernatural, often religious worldview in which people believe strongly in God and the devil and see them as active in the world. - God vs. Devil Hypothesis. On the other hand, one could also expect demonic and divine attributions to correlate negatively. If God is seen as good and the devil as bad, then those who see the vaccines as good might see God behind them, whereas those who see the vaccines as bad would see the devil behind them. Following this logic, divine and demonic vaccine attributions should correlate negatively, and they should show opposite correlates with other variables, because they reflect the idea of God and the devil as being in opposition. In other words, the God vs. Devil hypothesis would suggest that if people see God as the cause of something, they should not see the devil as the cause, and vice versa. 1.3. Demonic and Divine Vaccine Attributions: Expected Links with Other Study Variables 1.3.1. Vaccine Attitudes and Behaviors [Lupfer et al. 1994](#B34-religions-13-00519), [1996](#B33-religions-13-00519); [Ray et al. 2015](#B51-religions-13-00519)) and with anxiety or fear ( [Exline et al. 2014](#B18-religions-13-00519)). In this case, we expected people who saw the vaccines in a negative light to make more demonic attributions and to show more vaccine hesitancy, anti-vaccine attitudes, and lower vaccination rates. (Note that causation could conceivably go in either direction: demonic attributions could feed negative vaccine attitudes, but negative vaccine attitudes could also increase the odds of demonic attributions.) In terms of divine attributions, we expected the God vs. Devil Hypothesis to find support here, with divine attributions linked with more pro-vaccine attitudes and higher vaccination rates. 1.3.2. Conspiracy Beliefs [Abrams Vugt thinking has not only been framed as quasi-religious in and of itself ( [Franks et al. 2013](#B20-religions-13-00519)), but it has also been linked with religiousness (e.g., [Frenken et al. 2022](#B21-religions-13-00519))\u2014and, in particular, with conservative or fundamentalist religious views, in prior work (e.g., [Lowicki et al. 2022](#B32-religions-13-00519); see also [Oliver and Wood 2018](#B38-religions-13-00519)). Religiosity has also been linked with more disbelief that COVID-19 is real ( [Bok et al. 2021](#B4-religions-13-00519)) and with more conspiracy thinking around the pandemic ( [Lowicki et al. 2022](#B32-religions-13-00519)). Here, we were interested in the more specific question of demonic vaccine attributions (which we expected to be greater among more religious people). We proposed that demonic attributions would show strong positive connections with QAnon beliefs et al. 2021](#B55-religions-13-00519)), which include a direct focus on the devil. A core QAnon belief is that a secretive cabal of leftists\u2014who are also pedophilic, cannibalistic worshippers of Satan\u2014conspired against Donald Trump when he was in office. We also expected demonic attributions to relate to several other beliefs suggesting conspiracy thinking: seeing COVID as a hoax and seeing the vaccine as containing a surveillance microchip or even the apocalyptic \"mark of the beast\" described in the Bible ( [PRRI Staff 2021d](#B49-religions-13-00519)). We also expected demonic attributions to relate to beliefs about causes of the pandemic, with more blaming of hypothesized entities often linked with conspiracy thinking, such as the New World Order and Illuminati ( [CBS News ( [Langer 2017](#B31-religions-13-00519)), but also other governments (the United States and China) and the media. Finally, since some conspiracy beliefs also involve aliens ( [Swami and Coles 2010](#B56-religions-13-00519)), we speculated that demonic attributions would also be linked with seeing aliens as a cause. We did not register specific predictions about how divine vaccine attributions would relate to conspiracy beliefs, reasoning that both the Supernatural Worldview and God vs. Devil Hypotheses might both play a role. 1.3.3. Anger at Other People or Groups [Exline et al. 2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519); [Wong et al. 2019](#B64-religions-13-00519)), we expected demonic vaccine attributions to be linked with more anger toward organizations or people seen as pro-vaccine and less anger toward those seen as anti-vaccine. Once again, we expected divine attributions to show the opposite pattern (God vs. Devil Hypothesis). 1.3.4. Spiritual Struggles and Emotional Distress [Exline et al. 2014](#B18-religions-13-00519); [Pargament and Exline 2022](#B40-religions-13-00519)) and emotional distress ( [Nie and Olson 2017](#B37-religions-13-00519)), and we expected the same patterns here. We did not offer specific predictions for divine attributions. 1.3.5. Religious/Supernatural Belief and Engagement [Wilt et al. 2022](#B63-religions-13-00519)), if they have a prior history of attributing events to them, and if their beliefs about how the entities operate fits well with the event in question ( [Exline et al. 2021a](#B17-religions-13-00519)). For example, people should be more likely to see demonic influence around the vaccine if they see the devil as very powerful\u2014having sufficient power to work through natural events and through people, for instance\u2014and if they believe that the devil tries to communicate with people frequently. Most proximally, we expected that seeing the devil as a cause of the pandemic would relate strongly to demonic attributions about the vaccines. Because demonic beliefs are part of many religious teachings, including Christianity, we expected people with more religious engagement to make more demonic attributions. We also expected demonic attributions to be associated with seeing life in terms of a cosmic battle between good and evil, with greater belief in hell and seeing more people as destined for hell, and with greater belief that we are living in the end times described in the Bible. [Exline et al. 2021a](#B17-religions-13-00519)). 1.3.6. Political Identities, Attitudes and Behaviors [Callaghan et al. 2021](#B6-religions-13-00519); [PRRI Staff 2020](#B45-religions-13-00519); [Whitehead and Perry 2020a](#B59-religions-13-00519)), we expected demonic vaccine attributions to show connections with self-identified political conservatism and associated behavioral indicators, including voting for Trump in 2020, intending to do so in 2024, and endorsing the conservative FOX news network as one's most trusted media source. Beyond these simple political affiliations, we also expected demonic vaccine attributions to be linked with attitudes toward political opponents. Specifically, we expected that demonic attributions would be linked with signs of mistrust and anger, such as believing that the 2020 election had been stolen from Donald Trump and with seeing political opponents as enemies and as evil. Beyond the competing hypotheses, we did not make predictions about divine attributions and political variables. 1.3.7. Authority-Related Variables [Williamson et al. 2010](#B61-religions-13-00519)) and Christian nationalism ( [Whitehead and Perry 2020b](#B60-religions-13-00519)) to be linked with more demonic attributions around the vaccine, reflecting Biblical beliefs in the demonic as well as political and religious conservatism. Several studies have linked Christian nationalism to anti-vaccine attitudes ( [Corcoran et al. 2021](#B10-religions-13-00519); [Whitehead and Perry 2020a](#B59-religions-13-00519)). We also expected authoritarian aggression, subset of right-wing authoritarianism ( [Altemeyer and Hunsberger 1992](#B2-religions-13-00519)), to be linked with demonic attributions\u2014a pattern found in response to the 2020 U.S. presidential election results ( [Exline et al. 2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519)). Finally, traditional masculinity beliefs have often been a part of conservative religious culture, specifically including Christianity and evangelicalism ( [Du Mez 2020](#B13-religions-13-00519)), fitting with themes of aggression, patriarchy, and militarism (including spiritual warfare) often embedded in this subculture. As such, we also expected traditional masculinity beliefs to also be linked to more demonic vaccine attributions. Other than the competing hypotheses, we did not make predictions here about divine attributions. 1.3.8. Agreeableness and Social Desirability 2. Method 2.1. Participants and Procedure [Exline et al. 2022](#B16-religions-13-00519); [https://osf.io/nv9q3/](https://osf.io/nv9q3/)(uploaded on 15 February 2022)). A 20-minute Qualtrics survey was administered online between February 28 and March 2, 2022, when Omicron was the dominant U.S. variant. U.S. adults were recruited through CloudResearch ( [Chandler et al. 2019](#B9-religions-13-00519)), a company that contracts with other companies to recruit participants. Of the 4144 people who clicked on the survey, 369 did not consent, 477 failed two early attention checks and were exited, 50 showed rushed responding (less than 5 min), 41 typed random material in text boxes, and 11 indicated that they were under 18 years old, leaving 3196 participants for analyses. 2.2. Sample Demographics 2.3. Measures [PRRI Staff 2021a](#B46-religions-13-00519), [2021d](#B49-religions-13-00519)). To keep the survey at 20 min, participants were randomly assigned to two of the other six blocks: (1) COVID Causes/Struggle; (2) Authority; (3) Conspiracy; (4) God, the Devil, and the Afterlife; (5) Distress and Personality. (Block 6 items were not relevant here.). [https://osf.io/nv9q3/](https://osf.io/nv9q3/), (uploaded on 15 February 2022)). 2.3.1. Demonic and Divine Attributions for COVID-19 and Vaccines [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)has descriptive statistics. 2.3.2. COVID Stress and Experiences [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)shows, participants rated their overall stress around the COVID-19 pandemic from 1 (no stress) to 5 (extreme stress). Drawing established items from the PRRI Survey on Religion and COVID-19 Vaccine Trust ( [PRRI Staff 2021a](#B46-religions-13-00519)), we asked, \"Which of the following have you or someone in your household experienced as part of the COVID-19 pandemic?\" (modified from \"the past year\" in PRRI version), followed by checkbox items: lost a job due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had hours or pay cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tested positive for COVID-19, gotten sick with COVID-19 symptoms, been hospitalized for COVID-19, known someone who was hospitalized for COVID-19, and known someone who died from COVID-19. Responses were summed. A few were analyzed as single items. Those who reported having COVID-19 rated the severity of their symptoms from 1 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe). 2.3.3. Vaccine Behaviors, Attitudes, and Anger 2.3.4. COVID-19 and Vaccine Worry [PRRI Staff 2021d](#B49-religions-13-00519)) survey. They read, \"How worried are you that...\" followed by 10 items rated from 1 (not at all worried) to 4 (very worried). Three items focused on COVID-19 (you will get COVID-19; your family, romantic partner, or close friends will get COVID-19; you might spread COVID-19 to someone else). Seven focused on vaccine worry: four from the PRRI survey (you might experience serious side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine; the COVID-19 vaccines are not as effective as they are said to be; the COVID-19 vaccines are not as safe as they are said to be; the long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccines are unknown) and three created for this study (the COVID-19 vaccines contain tissue from aborted fetuses; the COVID-19 vaccines include a microchip or something else being used for surveillance; the COVID-19 vaccines contain dangerous chemicals or materials). See [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001). 2.3.5. PRRI Items, Including Three QAnon Beliefs [PRRI Staff 2021a](#B46-religions-13-00519)), rated from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Because these 10 items were all administered as part of the initial PRRI survey, we used the entire set here. The first three items focused on QAnon beliefs: (1) The government, media and financial worlds in the U.S are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation. (2) There is a storm coming soon that will sweep away the elites in power and restore the rightful leaders. (3) Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country. The remaining items were: (4) The 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump; (5) The chaos in America today is evidence that we are living in what the Bible calls \"the end times\"; (6) God always rewards those who have faith with good health and will protect them from COVID-19; (7) Because getting vaccinated against COVID-19 helps protect everyone, it is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors; (8) The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was developed intentionally by scientists in a lab; (9) Shutdowns, mask mandates, and other steps taken by state and local governments since the coronavirus pandemic began are unreasonable attempts to control people; (10) The COVID-19 vaccine contains a surveillance microchip that is the sign of the beast in biblical prophecy. (Please note that these items are presented in several different tables in the text, as they are grouped together as part of different sets of analyses.). 2.3.6. Conspiracy Beliefs and Pew QAnon Items [Table 2](#religions-13-00519-t002). Those in the Conspiracy block completed these measures: (1) Three established items from a [Pew Research Center](#B44-religions-13-00519)( [2020](#B44-religions-13-00519)) survey on QAnon beliefs: \"How much, if anything, have you heard or read about QAnon?\" (adapted as 1 = nothing at all, 2 = a little, 3 = a lot). Those who said \"a little\" or \"a lot\" were asked to rate whether they thought QAnon was a good vs. bad thing for the country, from 1 (very bad) to 4 (very good), and \"How much do you believe that QAnon ideas are true?\" from 1 (not at all) to 5 (totally); (2) The widely-used 15-item Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale ( [Brotherton et al. 2013](#B5-religions-13-00519)), with items (e.g., \"The government is involved in the murder of innocent citizens and/or well known public figures, and keeps this a secret\") rated from 1 (definitely not true) to 5 (definitely true). See [Table 2](#religions-13-00519-t002). 2.3.7. Causes of Pandemic [Table 2](#religions-13-00519-t002)for the full list of items. 2.3.8. Anger at Other People in Response to the Pandemic [Exline et al. 2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519)). All participants read, \"When you think about the COVID-19 pandemic, how angry do you feel toward:\" followed by 13 items (e.g., liberals, people who did not get the vaccine) in random order, rated from 1 (not at all angry) to 6 (totally furious). [Table 3](#religions-13-00519-t003)presents all 13 items. 2.3.9. Emotional Distress [Kroenke et al. 2009](#B29-religions-13-00519)), with two items each on anxiety (e.g., \"feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge\") and depression (e.g., \"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\") focused on the last two weeks, rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Sums were used for scoring. See [Table 4](#religions-13-00519-t004). 2.3.10. Spiritual Struggles [Exline et al. 2014](#B18-religions-13-00519)), with one compound item each for six types of r/s struggle (divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, ultimate meaning, doubt). A sample item is \"Struggles related to God (e.g., anger or disappointment with God; feeling punished or abandoned by God).\" Religious/Spiritual Variables [Blaine and Crocker](#B3-religions-13-00519)( [1995](#B3-religions-13-00519)), with items rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items include: I allow my religious/spiritual beliefs to influence other areas of my life; My religious/spiritual beliefs provide meaning and purpose to life; My religious/spiritual beliefs lie behind my whole approach to life; Being a religious/spiritual person is important to me. For religious participation, they read, \"On a typical week, how often do you\" followed by four items rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (more than once a day): pray or meditate; attend religious/spiritual services or meetings (or watch online); read religious/spiritual materials (the Bible, books, magazines); think about religious/spiritual issues. The religious belief salience and participation measures were standardized and averaged to assess religiousness (cf. [Exline et al. 2014](#B18-religions-13-00519)). Participants who reported being part of a religious group/community read, \"Which of the statements is most true for your religious group/community?\" followed by: (1) Leaders of my religious group have mostly OPPOSED the COVID-19 vaccine, masks, and social distancing; (2) Leaders of my religious group have been MIXED in their reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, masks, and social distancing; (3) Leaders of my religious group have mostly SUPPORTED the COVID-19 vaccine, masks, and social distancing. (There were also \"don't know\" and does not apply\" options for this question about religious communities, which we developed for this study.) See [Table 5](#religions-13-00519-t005). 2.3.12. Specific Beliefs about God, the Devil, and the Afterlife [Exline et al.](#B19-religions-13-00519)( [2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519)): \"Have you ever had an experience in which you thought God was (or might have been) involved?\" rated from 0 (no, never) to 4 (yes, many times); \"In your opinion, how much power does God have in terms of being able to affect people's lives?\" rated from 1 (no power at all) to 5 (total power); \"In your opinion, how often does God try to communicate with people?\" rated from 1 (never) to 6 (all of the time); \"If a certain event can be explained using natural laws, could God still play some role in causing or influencing the event?\" and \"Do you think that God sometimes works through people?\", rated from 1 (no, definitely not) to 5 (yes, definitely). Those with some belief in the devil then completed the same items with \"the devil\" in place of \"God\". Participants also rated, \"Do you see life in terms of a cosmic battle between good and evil (or God and the devil?)\" from 1 (no, not at all) to 5 (yes, definitely). Participants rated their level of belief in an afterlife, heaven, and hell (all three rated from 1 = not at all to 5 = totally). Those with some belief in heaven read, \"How many people do you think will go to heaven?\" rated from 1 (none) to 7 (everyone), with a parallel item for hell. See [Table 5](#religions-13-00519-t005). 2.3.13. Political Perry 2020b](#B60-religions-13-00519)), with items (e.g., \"The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation\") rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree); (2) the five-item Intratextual Fundamentalism Scale ( [Williamson et al. 2010](#B61-religions-13-00519)), with items adapted with permission to focus on the Bible (e.g., \"Everything in the Bible is absolutely true without question\") and rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree); (3) five authoritarian aggression items from [Altemeyer and Hunsberger](#B2-religions-13-00519)( [1992](#B2-religions-13-00519)) measure of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (as adapted in [Exline et al. 2021b](#B19-religions-13-00519)); (4) the five-item Male Role Norms inventory ( [McDermott et al. 2019](#B35-religions-13-00519)) to assess traditional masculinity beliefs, with items (e.g., \"A man should always be the boss\") rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). See [Table 7](#religions-13-00519-t007). 2.3.15. Agreeableness and Social Desirability [Soto and John with items (e.g., \"Is compassionate, has a soft heart\") rated from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly) and a five-item measure of social desirability (e.g., \"I am always courteous, even to people who are disagreeable\") ( [Hays et al. 1989](#B25-religions-13-00519)), with items scored as 0 (false) or 1 (true). Items were summed for the social desirability measure. 3. Results 3.1. Overall Layout of Results [Gignac and Szodorai](#B24-religions-13-00519)( [2016](#B24-religions-13-00519)) and [Funder and Ozer](#B22-religions-13-00519)( [2019](#B22-religions-13-00519)), in which 0.10 is interpreted as small, 0.20 as moderate, 0.30 as large, and 0.40 as very large. 3.2. COVID and Vaccine-Related Variables, Including Divine and Demonic Attributions [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)focuses on COVID-19 and vaccine-related attitudes, experiences and behaviors. Most participants had been vaccinated (50% with booster, 22% with no booster) and reported pro-vaccination attitudes. They reported moderate stress around COVID-19 and saw COVID-19 as more dangerous than the vaccines. Over a third (36%) reported that they or a household member had tested positive or been sick with COVID-19. Among those who got COVID-19 themselves, moderate symptoms were reported on average. [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)shows, all means for divine and demonic vaccine attributions were below the scale midpoint of 3, suggesting that most people did not see God or the devil as influencing COVID or vaccine behaviors. People were much more likely to see the devil (vs. God) as causing the pandemic, and they were more likely to see God (vs. the devil) as influencing people to create or get the vaccines. In terms of specific vaccine items, respondents were more likely to see the devil as having led people to create the vaccine than leading people to receive the vaccine, which in turn was endorsed more than belief that the devil had led oneself, personally, to receive (or not receive) the vaccine. In terms of divine attributions, people were most likely to believe that God led people to get the vaccine, followed by leading oneself, personally, to get the vaccine, with lower endorsement for the idea that God led people to create the vaccines. [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)shows that demonic and divine attributions were positively correlated, supporting the Supernatural Worldview Hypothesis. However, a supplemental analysis provided some support for the God vs. Devil Hypothesis as well. When we controlled for beliefs that God and the devil had caused the pandemic itself, the correlation between divine and demonic vaccine attributions flipped to become negative: pr (2605) = 0.11, p < 0.01. [Table 1](#religions-13-00519-t001)), demonic vaccine attributions were consistently linked with lower vaccination rates for oneself and one's children, more vaccine hesitancy (less desire for vaccinations for self or children; more vaccine worry) and more anti-vaccination attitudes (getting vaccine is morally wrong and a sign of weakness, vaccine is more dangerous than COVID-19, vaccines are an attack on personal freedom and unreasonable attempts to control people). In terms of specific vaccine worries, health and safety concerns (long-term effects unknown, side effects, not safe or effective) predominated over fears that the vaccines contained dangerous materials or chemicals, tissue from aborted fetuses, or microchips or other surveillance tools. All vaccine worry items had moderate to strong positive correlations with demonic vaccine attributions, but the strongest correlations were with the items on dangerous materials or chemicals, aborted fetal tissue, and microchips/surveillance tools. 3.3. Conspiracy Beliefs [Table 2](#religions-13-00519-t002)). Demonic vaccine attributions showed robust positive links with general conspiracy thinking and with QAnon beliefs, including all three PRRI items (cabal, storm is coming, patriots may have to resort to violence) as well as the Pew items on believing in QAnon and seeing it as a good thing for the country. Demonic vaccine attributions were also linked with vaccine-specific conspiracy beliefs: seeing COVID-19 as a hoax, believing that it was intentionally started by scientists in a lab (which was especially clear on the Likert PRRI item), and seeing forces such as the New World Order, the Illuminati, the Deep State, liberals, and the U.S. and Chinese governments as causes of COVID-19. Divine vaccine attributions, in contrast, showed very weak, inconsistent links with conspiracy beliefs. 3.4. Anger toward Other People and Groups [Table 3](#religions-13-00519-t003)focuses on pandemic-focused anger at other people. Bonferroni-corrected comparisons show that participants felt most angry at the Chinese government, followed by Donald Trump and organizations and religious leaders that opposed vaccines, masks, and social distancing. Next were the media and the U.S. government, along with Joseph Biden. In general, participants reported more anger at entities and leaders than at other individuals (e.g., liberals, conservatives, or people who did or did not get the vaccine). Reflecting the fact that about \u00be of participants had been vaccinated, participants reported more anger at unvaccinated people than at those who were vaccinated, and more anger at organizations that opposed vaccines, masks, and distancing than those who supported them. 3.5. Emotional Distress and Spiritual Struggles [Table 4](#religions-13-00519-t004)shows that participants, on average, reported low levels of emotional distress in the past two weeks. Demonic vaccine attributions were linked with greater distress, as predicted. 3.6. Religious Engagement and Specific Beliefs about God, the Devil, and the Afterlife [Table 5](#religions-13-00519-t005)shows that, as predicted, demonic and divine vaccine attributions correlated positively with religiousness (belief salience and participation). As expected, demonic attributions were linked negatively with perceptions that one's religious group had supported vaccines, masks, and distancing, whereas the opposite was true for divine attributions. Demonic attributions were linked with more belief in God and the devil, more prior experiences attributed to the devil and to God, and seeing both as having strong \"operating rules\" (cf. [Exline et al. 2021a](#B17-religions-13-00519)) (powerful, communicating often, able to operate indirectly through people and natural events), along with belief that God would protect the faithful from COVID-19. Divine vaccine attributions also showed positive correlations with beliefs, experiences, and strong operating rules for both God and the devil, in line with the Supernatural Worldview Hypothesis. [Table 2](#religions-13-00519-t002)). 3.7. Political Variables [Table 6](#religions-13-00519-t006)shows that, as expected, demonic vaccine attributions were linked with self-identified political conservatism and related variables: Republican party affiliation, turning to FOX News as a trusted information source, voting for Donald Trump in 2020, and intending to vote for him in 2024. These associations were modest in size. However, demonic attributions showed stronger associations with believing that Trump won the 2020 election and that the election was stolen from him\u2014two beliefs that go beyond basic conservative identification or behavior to suggest more potential conspiracy thinking. Also, as predicted, those who made more demonic attributions were more likely to see people with different political views as enemies and as evil. Divine vaccine attributions showed weak connections with these general political variables. 3.8. Authority-Related Variables and Individual Differences 3.9. Demographic Differences 4. Discussion 4.1.
