The B section features measures of half notes that sound like the burner in a hot air balloon letting out more flame to make the balloon rise further in the air. The return to the A section gives students an opportunity to play with dynamics that reflect being even further in the sky. What level is Mid-Air Meditation? Mid-Air Meditation is a late elementary solo. The piece is in C Major, with both hands playing in bass clef for a majority of the song. The easy key signature makes this a wonderful opportunity for students who may still struggle playing in the bass clef to work on note name and interval recognition. There is pedaling throughout the piece, and the B section includes pedaling more than once within a measure, another technique students at this level may not have had an opportunity to explore. Both hands play with 5-finger patterns throughout the piece, making it easier to play in multiple registers when the piece calls for it. The smallest note value in this piece is an eighth note. There are many ties into the first beat throughout the piece. Bonus recording included! Mid-Air Meditation comes with a bonus mp3 recording performed by Wendy Stevens. You are permitted to send this example performance track to your students to help them learn the piece.
