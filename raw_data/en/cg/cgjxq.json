I graduated from Sardar Patel University in India with a B.H.M.S (Bachelor of Homeopathy, Medicine, and Surgery) degree. I am a certified member in Classical Homeopathy by the North American Society of Homeopaths, and have presented many case seminars and workshops. I have had much success with the below weight management program. I believe homeopathic practice together with functional medicine can help many patients achieve their health goals. Was it your New Year's resolution to lose weight? Exercise more? Are you worried about post COVID weight concerns? You're not alone. A hA2cg Evolution Weight Management program is convenient and completely planned out when you start. You'll have the option for virtual appointments.

You will be guided and supported with resources always available. Below are some common questions about h2cg: How is hA2CG Evolution used? hA2cg Evolution is used just as any other homeopathic product is used. The standard recommendation is 10 drops, 3 to 6 times per day. How does hA2CG Evolution work?
