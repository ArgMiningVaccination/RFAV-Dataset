For parents, it can be hard to tell whether your child's illness requires antibiotics or if there are other ways to effectively treat his or her symptoms. To prevent overuse of these drugs, it's important to know when home remedies can be used instead of antibiotics. If your child has an [ear infection](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616), consider using over-the-counter pain relievers in place of antibiotics. Children's ear infections usually improve within two to three days, especially for kids who are 2 years or older. If symptoms do not improve within a few days, it would be wise to take your child in to his or her provider. Use antibiotics for an ear infection if your child is age: - 6 months or younger - 6 months to 2 and has moderate to severe pain - 2 or older and experiencing severe symptoms Don't use antibiotics to treat your child's cold, flu and most other respiratory infections. Viruses cause most respiratory infections, and antibiotics don't treat viruses. Antibiotics fight bacteria.

Instead, offer your child warm liquids, such as tea or soup. Both can have a soothing effect and loosen mucus. Over-the-counter saline nasal drops or saline spray mucus. Try running a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room or using steam from a hot shower for additional relief. [Strep throat](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/strep-throat/symptoms-causes/syc-20350338) is caused by bacteria. However, most children with the symptoms of strep throat have a virus. You should ask for a strep throat test before turning to antibiotics to cure your child's symptoms. Ice cream, frozen fruit pops or cold beverages may soothe a sore throat. Older children can try gargling salt water or sucking on throat lozenges. Always encourage your child to get enough rest, so his or her body has a chance to recover. Consider getting antibiotics for your child when a cough persists for 14 days or more. Antibiotics also are necessary if a health care provider diagnoses your child with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat.
