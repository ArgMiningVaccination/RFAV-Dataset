Bloom, PhD", "date": "2018-01-15", "cleaned_text": "Dr. Ona Bloom is director of the Laboratory of Spinal Cord Injury Research and a professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. She is jointly appointed as professor of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation and of Molecular Medicine at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Dr. Bloom also serves as the Director of Research for the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Prior to joining Northwell Health, Dr. Bloom performed her postdoctoral studies and served as an associate research scientist in the Departments of Cell Biology and Immunology at the Yale University School of Medicine. Her studies at Yale focused on understanding how immune cells communicate with each other. Dr. Bloom received her PhD from The Rockefeller University, where she studied molecular and cellular neuroscience in the laboratory of the late Professor Paul Greengard. Her PhD studies were focused on understanding the molecular anatomy of synapses, the points of communication between nerve cells. Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) affects more than 350,000 people in the United States, with 17,000 new injuries each year. It is increasingly appreciated that immunological consequences of SCI are clinically significant: historically (pre-COVID-19 pandemic), infections have been the leading cause of death and rehospitalization for people with SCI, who are greater than 80 times more likely to die of sepsis than uninjured people. The goal of Dr. Bloom's lab is to identify biological mechanisms of infection susceptibility and persistent systemic inflammation in people with SCI and to determine how the immune system can be modified to improve functional abilities, life expectancy, and quality of life. The main focus of the lab is on performing clinical translational studies, with the hopes of identifying new targets and strategies for potential therapeutic intervention. Dr. Bloom's clinical studies on acute and chronic SCI are performed in collaboration with [Dr. Adam Benjamin Stein](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/physical-rehab-medicine/dr-adam-benjamin-stein-md-11346054), chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell and [Dr. Matthew Alan Bank](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/surgery/dr-matthew-alan-bank-md-11309625), medical director of the ACS-verified Level One Trauma Center at North Shore University Hospital. Dr. Bloom's SCI research program has received external funding from the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation, the Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program, the Spinal Cord Injury Research Board of New York State, the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Defense. Dr. Bloom is also an affiliated researcher at the RR&D National Center of Excellence for the Medical Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY.
