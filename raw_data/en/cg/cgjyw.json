How we chose the best spa resorts in the USA The first step in narrowing down the best spa resorts in the USA was to define what exactly a \"spa resort\" is. In this case, we categorized any resort with a spacious, amenity-packed spa and varied treatment offerings as a \"spa resort.\" In most cases, the spa was the top\u2014if not the main\u2014draw for staying at the property. With this definition in mind, we considered everything from expansive properties to small- and medium-sized boutique hotels, some of which were all-inclusive.

We also cross-referenced our picks with user reviews and ratings across booking sites like Tripadvisor to ensure a relaxing experience.
