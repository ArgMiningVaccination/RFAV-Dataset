I have to admit that I was totally overwhelmed by essential oils (and had no idea how to use them in everyday family life, such as in [natural remedies for kids](https://vibrantchristianliving.com/natural-remedies-essential-oils-kids/)) when I first heard about them. I wondered: - \"Which essential oils do moms use the most?\" - \"How can I use these oils in everyday life to battle stress?\" - \"What are the best [essential oils for a cold](https://vibrantchristianliving.com/natural-ways-fight-cold/)?\" - \"Do essential oils actually work?!\" I was surprised that so many moms had heard of essential oils but still needed more information on how to use essential oils in every day family life. Let's talk about each of these questions so that you can get all the essential oil information you need so that you can confidently use essential oils in your home too. I believe that every mom looking to have a more natural home needs a simple list of essential oils and their uses. Here are the essential oil health remedies and essential oil cleaning recipes I use so that you can see for yourself how natural remedies made with essential oils can be a blessing for your family too! The #1 Essential Oil Uses Question My big fear was that I would buy essential oils and never use essential oils (or that I'd have no idea how to even use essential oils)! Are you wondering this too? If so, you're in good company. It's the number one essential oil question that most of us have. However, I've been using essential oils for a good 8 years now and I seriously don't know what I would do without them. Truly! All it took was learning a few simple essential oil remedies (like [how to kick a cold using essential oils](https://vibrantchristianliving.com/natural-ways-fight-cold/) or [how to use essential oils for other common family ailments](https://vibrantchristianliving.com/natural-remedies-essential-oils-kids/)) and I found that I use essential oils regularly as a mom. Best of all, I've found that I don't really need to invest in a ton of different essential oils. Since essential oils are quite versatile, I've found that I really only need a few key essential oils to create the home remedies my family needs. But, looking back, I wish someone had given me a \"ultimate list of what I really needed (and how to use them) as an essential oils newbie. So that's exactly what I'm sharing with you today! I want to give you the inside scoop on the 10 basic essential oils/blends that solve a variety of the everyday issues we face as busy moms. Consider these 10 essential oils and essential oil blends as your everyday natural defenders when the following strike: - bad attitudes and stress - owies, bug bites, headaches - tummy aches and car sickness - sore muscles and back pain - and so many of those other things we deal with as moms! I use 10 essential oils (and these 31 natural remedies) all day long to help my family feel better and to help keep our home clean without harsh chemicals. And your family can have this too! Seriously, once you start using them you'll wonder what you did without them! Let me introduce you to the basic 10 essential oils I use everyday (and answer your essential oil questions along the way...) Where Can You Buy Essential Oils? If you're going to use essential oils, it's important to use the best essential oils. I'm not going to get into a debate about which essential oils brands are the \"best essential oils\" but I will say that you should use essential oils that are pure, high quality and tested by a third party source. I mean, we're trying to make our families healthier, right? It makes sense to only buy essential oils that are the best quality. I use (and highly recommend) [Rocky Mountain Oils](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fabout-us%2F) because not only are they some of the best essential oils on the market (in terms of high quality), they offer: - competitively priced essential oils (plus regular sales) - free shipping - a 90-day money back guarantee on all their oils; and (most importantly to me), - RMO's oils can be purchased directly from the company (no need to join a multi-level marketing team). Just order your oils as you need them and return them if they don't work for you. The Rocky Mountain Oil's customer service team members are also incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. Anyway, if you need to know where to buy essential oils, [I highly recommend Rocky Mountain Oils](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com)! 10 Essential Oils I Use Everyday as a Mom Note: There are literally hundreds of essential oils available, and most have multiple uses. But in order to keep things simple (and not overwhelming), I'm just going to talk about 10 oils and blends that I regularly use and trust as a mom. 1) [Lavender](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Flavender-hungary.html) [Lavender](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Flavender-hungary.html) is often the oil I reach for first. It has a lovely calming scent that's great for helping kids sleep, calming nerves when kids are stressed, or for helping everyone relax after a long day. If I really want to relax, I will apply Lavender with Peppermint and it's pure bliss! Lavender is also great for blending with other antiseptic-type essential oils, such as Tea Tree, to add comfort and soothing such as when treating kids' owies. 2) [Lemon](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Flemon-usa-pressed-peel.html) I love to use the power of [Lemon Essential Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Flemon-usa-pressed-peel.html) in our cleaning. We've found Lemon oil and Tea Tree oil are excellent to powerfully clean carpets, bathrooms, mirrors and glass. A drop of lemon is also a lovely and refreshing way to brighten up a cup of water. I especially like [Rocky Mountain Oils' Lemon Essential Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Flemon-usa-pressed-peel.html) because it's not too sharp-smelling, if that makes sense. Lemon Essential Oil can also be used in cooking! 3) [Peppermint](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fpeppermint-usa.html) [Peppermint](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fpeppermint-usa.html) is my favorite pain-relieving oil! I can't tell you how many times it's spared me from a headache. I rarely, rarely take any sort of ibuprofen or aspirin anymore for headache because a few dabs of [Peppermint](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fpeppermint-usa.html) on my temples and neck usually does the trick. I've also found it to be an amazingly powerful expectorant (by itself or used with Eucalyptus) when one of us deals with chest or nose congestion! It's my go-to oil that I either use by itself (or blend with other pain-relieving oils) when I deal with sore muscles or neck issues. It's a hot oil (which means that it should be applied with a carrier oil like [Fractionated Coconut Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/f-c-o-fractionated-coconut-oil.html) in order to avoid skin irritation) and a little goes a long way. However, there's nothing like [Peppermint's](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fpeppermint-usa.html) cooling, freshening scent! 4) [Tea Tree](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/tea-tree.html) This powerful oil has an equally powerful medicinal scent! Wow! But I like to think of that bold smell as a reminder of [Tea Tree's](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/tea-tree.html) power as a cleaning and antiseptic agent. Because of Tea Tree's great antibacterial properties, I often reach for it when dealing with bug bites or other sores. We recently spent time in the mountains and have been (very effectively) treating our mosquito bites with a few drops of Tea Tree and Lavender with [Fractionated Coconut Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/f-c-o-fractionated-coconut-oil.html) in a roller ball whenever the bite starts to itch. And of course, it's an essential part of any home cleaner we use. It's just fantastic for purifying and ousting germs. 5) [Immune Strength](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/immune-strength.html) Immune Strength is one of those oils that you don't think about much... until you really, really need it. And then, oh, you're so glad it's there! When someone in the family starts showing the first sign of a cold, we reach for this oil and begin immediately treating the whole family. We have used it in a spray bottle (mixed with water) as part of an antibacterial hand spray and to clean doorknobs and light switches. I also use it as part of my [DIY Cell Phone Screen Cleaner](https://vibrantchristianliving.com/diy-cell-phone-screen-cleaner/). Note: Because this oil blend contains several hot oils such as Cinnamon, Oregano and Clove Bud, it's really important to blend this oil with [Fractionated Coconut Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/f-c-o-fractionated-coconut-oil.html) if you plan to apply it topically, such as to the soles of the feet. 6) [Eucalyptus](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Feucalyptus-citriodora.html) Eucalyptus has a strong, distinct scent, which makes it ideal for helping with respiratory issues (especially with loosening phlegm), in natural cleaning remedies and as an insect repellent. It is also used in some of Rocky Mountain Oils' pain relief blends as a way to calm muscles. When blended with Fractionated Coconut Oil, [Eucalyptus](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Feucalyptus-citriodora.html) can also be used topically to help relieve pain from dry, irritated skin. It's recommended that Eucalyptus not be used with children, however. 7) [Myrtle](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fmyrtle.html) Instead of using Eucalyptus with kids, try using Myrtle. I've been experimenting with [Myrtle](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fmyrtle.html) more and more lately, and this oil has quickly become one of my new favorites! Myrtle is fantastic for helping with respiratory infections and breathing issues. We also diffuse Myrtle (and/or Eucalyptus and Peppermint) in our children's bedrooms at night when they have a cold to make breathing easier and promote fast healing. It also is great for any skin blemishes and can be used in natural beauty skin regimens to combat oily skin areas. When used aromatically (in other words, in [a diffuser like this one](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fspring-diffuser.html)), Myrtle has been shown to help improve moods and to promote restful sleep as well. 8) [Grapefruit](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fgrapefruit-pink.html) Grapefruit has a lovely refreshing scent that adds a nice brightness and lifts the spirit. It is good for dealing with stress and mental fatigue. That's why, when one of my kids is dealing with the grouchies, I apply a few drops of [Grapefruit](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fgrapefruit-pink.html) with Lavender to their wrists and have them take deep breaths inhaling the scent. In fact, one of my children carries a rollerball with a Grapefruit/Lavender combo diluted in [Fractionated Coconut Oil](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/f-c-o-fractionated-coconut-oil.html) in order to encourage a good attitude. Grapefruit is also a bright and refreshing oil to add to a natural household cleaner. Note: Grapefruit oil is phototoxic, which means that you shouldn't apply the oils to the skin within 2 hours of being in direct sunlight. 9) [Purify](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/purify.html) Purify is my saving grace (truly) when odors lurk in our home. It's a great blend for cleaning, especially as a way to freshen the air. There have been many many times where we've been traveling and [Purify](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&source=http://www.rockymountainoils.com/purify.html) has saved the day by removing those gross mildewy, musty or just downright stinky smells. Let's just say that Purify is also helpful for dealing with that lovely \"teen boy\" bedroom scent (if you have one, no further explanation is needed!), or if you have cats and your kids wait a little too long to clean the litter box. Ahem. Consisting of Lemongrass, Tea Tree, Lavender, Myrtle and Citronella, Purify was created especially to kill fungus, airborne germs and mold (and who wants that in their home! Yuck!). 10) [Helichrysum](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fhelichrysum-gymnocephalum.html) I adore this healing oil as a way to rapidly repair tissue! I recently used it in combination with Peppermint (in a base of Fractionated Coconut Oil) with great results in order to help heal some strained muscles in my knee. [Helichrysum](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fhelichrysum-gymnocephalum.html) is another strongly scented oil, so a little goes a long way and it's best blended in a carrier oil if applied topically. Helichrysum is also an amazing blend to use after any skin injury (I blend Lavender, Helichrysum and Tea Tree in a rollerball with Fractionated Coconut Oil and use it for owies). I recently used Helichrysum to effectively treat a bloody nose. My mom had told me that one drop applied over the nose instantly stopped her bloody nose, and surprisingly, I had a bloody nose the next day and found that worked for me as well! My daughter also tends to get bloody noses when there's a weather change, and we regularly use Helichrysum to help her. Mom's Essential Kit: A Great Way to Practice Essential Oils Uses Want to see how these 10 essential oils can change your family's everyday life too? I'd highly recommend getting Rocky Mountain Oil's [Mom's Essential Kit](http://go.rockymountainoils.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainoils.com%2Fshoprmo%2Fessential-oils%2Fkits.html) which contains all 10 essential oils and essential oilblends. Using essential oils doesn't have to be scary or intimidating! Start with some of the uses I have here, and then experiment to see what works for your family. Note: Please follow the links for each individual oil listed here for any cautions or side effects, especially if you are applying to children or if you're pregnant or nursing.
