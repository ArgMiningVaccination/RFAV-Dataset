In 2021 I started talking about how the vaccines were going to cause COVID-19. The vaccines were going to damage the... America Out Loud PULSE with Dr. Peter McCullough and Malcolm Out Loud -When the nose is not properly cared for, it can become a breeding ground for bacteria, which can lead to infections, viruses, and other complications. In the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, nasal hygiene was responsible for saving many lives, and it's no telling how many more we could have saved, had this life-saving information been embraced... Blood damage that has been detailed through sophisticated research methods is the \"missing link\" to explain many negative health conditions ranging from heart problems, cancers, reduced immunity, and death. Blood damage is the key biologic explanation for harmful vaccine impacts. They can be seen as part of the Bio-War forced upon humanity - a true crime against humanity... The first three days of illness are the \"golden window\" for effective care. For high-risk patients, it takes about 4-6 drugs for 5, 10, or even 30 courses, depending on age, medical problems, and severity of illness. The community standard of care is established by local doctors who have taken on the challenge to treat COVID-19 in order to avoid hospitalization and death... The Voice of a Nation with Malcolm Out Loud - The nose is where bacteria and viruses enter the body. Nearly 75% of the visits to primary care physicians in the U.S. are related to upper respiratory issues. In today's episode of The Voice of a Nation, Founder, and CEO, Nathan Jones, and Dr. Peter McCullough provide the roadmap to good nasal hygiene and why it matters... If I told you that the experimental shots have injured at least 1.3 million people, killed at least another 29,000, killed almost 8,000 people within 2 days of getting the shot, and are in such low demand that 82.2 Million vials have been discarded as of mid-May according to research performed by the Children's Health Defense...would you consider them safe? The virus must be killed in the nasal cavity at least twice a day after coming back home for prevention and up to every four hours during active treatment. This is very important with the Omicron variant, which multiplies 70 times faster than the prior strains of the virus. Early treatment using this approach is associated with a 71% improvement... There are no studies demonstrating the clinical benefit of COVID-19 vaccination in COVID-19 survivors, and there are three studies demonstrating harm in such individuals. It is my opinion that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection in humans that results in robust, complete, and durable immunity, and is superior to vaccine immunity which by comparison has demonstrated massive failure...

I have... Our understanding of the universe has evolved greatly over time, from the ancient Greeks' geocentric model with the Earth at the center of the solar system to Copernicus's heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center. Galileo, Newton, Kepler, Hubble, Einstein,... Special offers for our America Out Loud family of listeners & readers The spike protein is responsible for the pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and drives the development of adverse events, injuries, disabilities, and death after vaccination through immunologic and thrombotic mechanisms. The long-lasting spike protein has been found in the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, ovaries, testicles, and other vital organs at autopsy in cases of death after vaccination. In the case of vaccine-induced thrombotic injury, the spike protein has been found within the blood clot itself. Thus, there is a strong rationale for considering residual SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a treatment target in post-COVID-19 and vaccine injury syndromes. The spike protein participates directly in pathophysiology, incites inflammation, While specific syndromes (cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, thrombotic, immunological) will require additional therapies, we propose the clinical rationale for a base detoxification regimen of oral nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin for patients with post-acute sequelae from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. The empiric regimen can be continued for 3-12 months or more and be guided by clinical parameters: - Nattokinase 2000 FU (100) mg orally twice a day without food - Bromelain 500 mg orally once a day without food - Curcumin 500 mg orally twice a day (nano, liposomal, or with piperine additive suggested) Click for larger size. No therapeutic claims can be made for this regimen because it has not been tested in large, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials. No such studies are planned or funded currently by federal or institutional sponsors. The main caveats are bleeding and allergic reactions. The regimen can be used in addition to antiplatelet and antithrombic agents; however, caution is advised with respect to monitoring bleeding risks. McCullough PA, Wynn C, Procter BC. Clinical Rationale for SARS-CoV-2 Base Spike Protein Detoxification in Post COVID-19 and Vaccine Injury Syndromes. Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons Volume 28 Number 3 Fall 2023, 90-93. Dr. McCullough is an internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist managing the cardiovascular complications of both the viral infection and the injuries developing after the COVID-19 vaccine in Dallas, TX, USA. Since the outset of the pandemic, Dr. McCullough has been a leader in the medical response to the COVID-19 disaster and has published \"Pathophysiological Basis and Rationale for Early Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection,\" the first synthesis of sequenced multidrug treatment of ambulatory patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the American Journal of Medicine and subsequently updated in Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine. He has dozens of peer-reviewed publications on the infection and has extensively commented on the medical response to the COVID-19 crisis in TheHill, America Out Loud, NewsMax, One America News, Victory Channel, NTD, and FOX NEWS Channel. Dr. McCullough has testified on pandemic response multiple times in the US Senate, Texas Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, Arizona Senate, Colorado General Assembly, New Hampshire Senate, Pennsylvania Senate, and South Carolina Senate. On December 7, 2022, Dr. McCullough co-moderated a Senate Panel and concluded that all COVID-19 vaccines should be removed from the market for excess mortality. Dr. McCullough has reviewed thousands of reports, participated in scientific congresses, group discussions, and press releases, and has been considered among the world's top experts on COVID-19.

Our Lives & Politics with Booker Scott - Is the Republican majority in the 118th Congress advancing conservatism or merely slowing down liberalism? Drawing on the Federalist Papers and Willmoore Kendall's 'Conservative Affirmation,' conservatives must do more than block progressivism; they must actively replace it with sound political and moral principles. Fiscal irresponsibility and ongoing investigations raise questions... The McCullough Report with Dr. Peter McCullough - Is there really a consensus? I asked Dr. Goldfarb to lay out the issues and relate them to informed consent, the real outcomes of transgender medicine, detransitioning in regret, and talk about his new organization, Do No Harm. I can tell you firsthand Dr. Goldfarb is of the highest integrity and taking on this issue directly with the physician societies. The debate should be among... America Emboldened with Greg Boulden - On Friday, New Mexico's governor put a temporary ban on carrying guns in public in Albuquerque and the surrounding county. She invoked emergency powers as a public health emergency, which is a civil order. Violations of this measure would receive fines. Her action is being met with calls for her impeachment and pressure for her to resign. Governor Lujan Grisham stated that she... Dr. Paul Alexander Liberty Hour - The 'Pirola' Sub-Variant (clade) BA.2.86 of COVID virus (SARS-CoV-2), IMO pure fear-porn hysteria, much ado about nothing! Based on all we know! Thirty mutations on spike protein, so yes, more infectious. The COVID-19 vaccine hits ONLY the spike protein (non-lethal selection pressure), unlike natural exposure immunity that confers sterilizing immunity (stops infection, replication, transmission). Stop... Quarantine and Isolation Camps are exactly where persons resisting authoritarian and pandemic orders would be sent. New Yorkers and interested citizens from other states should make the time to attend this groundbreaking appeal hearing on September 13th. What happens in New York today may happen in any other state tomorrow... Remember all that virtue signaling claiming illegal immigration was a huge benefit for America? Well, the border states, especially Florida and Texas, decided it was unfair for them to horde all those benefits for themselves, so they decided to share them with the Sanctuary cities and states and shipped them off to places like NYC. They also sent a bunch to Martha's Vineyard... They have left us struggling to maintain the moral standards of our Christian religion and nearly totally dependent on them for our survival, even when they demonstrably can't control a fire destroying an island town. The destruction of Lahaina, admittedly, is a small example of the failure of Progressivism, but it's an excellent one. I have a feeling we are in the calm before the storm... Viewpoint This Sunday with Malcolm Out Loud - Weiss says to expect an indictment on Hunter Biden by month's end. Rep Jim Jordan is here on the top stories, including his letter to DA Fani Willis in the RICO charges against Trump. American exceptionalism or American arrogance? Gen Paul Vallely on the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Ilana Freedman on the New Axis of Evil. Tony Branco says, Biden is gaslighting the public... The Tom Renz Show - In Dearborn, Michigan, Islamic and Christian communities united against school district policies, overlooked by mainstream media. This unity challenges the divisive narratives pushed by some media and political entities. Addressing biases and promoting understanding, the author highlights the importance of seeing beyond labels, urging Americans of all backgrounds to come together for freedom. Mayor Eric Adams, once an advocate for plant-based nutrition and lifestyle medicine, now enforces big pharma policies, disregarding mounting evidence of vaccine damage. NYC's strict COVID-19 measures contrast sharply with more successful, relaxed approaches elsewhere. The city faces an exodus of its tax base and rising health problems, as Adams appears increasingly disconnected from real solutions. Will he end up the worst... The Voice of a Nation [malcolm at eight] - Why would any US president take unprecedented steps to dismantle the American economy so that we can not compete with other nation's economies? Those same nations, like China and India, are laughing at America as they reap the rewards in big ways. These countries are the biggest polluters in the world... Nurses Out Loud with Jodi O'Malley MSN, RN - After enduring division for far too long, a breakthrough has occurred among nurses. One courageous nurse has accepted my invitation to engage in a live discussion, focusing primarily on our differences regarding the use of masks, the hospital protocols, and our experience as COVID nurses. Today, we embark on this enlightening conversation together. This is just the beginning, as it... Medical therapy and surgery must always be deemed clinically indicated and medically necessary. Within the last few years, a sweeping change has come into pediatrics\u2014transgender medicine. I asked that question to an expert who takes an evidence-based view that many Americans want to hear. I sat down with former Professor of Medicine and Dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, to... The Tom Renz Show - There's a real concern about the age of those in the U.S. Senate. Feinstein has no idea where she's at. I think between her and McConnell, they provide more funding for 'Depend\u00ae Diapers' than anyone else on the planet. McConnell froze up recently, and we can see that he's not equipped to be in the Senate. Let me be really clear: Mitch McConnell is the worst senator in America. I despise his performance as... The Dean's List with Host Dean Bowen - Since the 1947 Everson v. School Board decision, we have watched the Supreme Court gradually change the Constitution while subverting the Constitutional Amendment process. They have highlighted the \"wall of separation between church and state\" phrase to constitutional verbiage status. They have redefined words within that phrase to mean something completely different. For...
