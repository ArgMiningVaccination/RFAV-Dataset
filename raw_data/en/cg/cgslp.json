Sonia F. Tan, DAOM, RAc, RTCMP Abstract This retrospective case series analysis investigated a novel acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnostic and treatment approach, and its efficacy results in treating Allergic Rhinitis. The primary question associated with this research capstone was: \"Does the novel integrative Blood plus Balance Method approach of Tan's Strong Blood Strong Immunity, provide better efficacy and long term outcomes?\" The historical cases were reviewed in a quantitative manner using weeks to symptom abatement, and weeks to (any) new onset in comparison to current studies as outcome measures. After a thorough review and analysis of the studies, the hypothesis was confirmed\u2014not only does the Tan Strong Blood Strong Immunity produce quicker efficacy, it also provides longevity with no recurrence at a faster rate than the current studies. The results were discussed with implications for practice and recommendations for future research.
