There are still some circumstances in which testing will required: - If you have a vaccination exemption or are eligible for a booster but have not received one, you must continue to test twice a week at the Yale sites. - If you have [COVID-19 symptoms](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/covid-19-symptoms), regardless of your vaccination status, you should take a PCR or antigen test. - If you have been exposed to COVID-19 and are designated a close contact, follow the testing instructions and other guidance in the [university policy](/health-guidelines/yale-covid-19-outreach-program-and-close-contact-guidance). In this post-term period, testing will continue to be available to you at campus PCR testing sites, where you can also pick up antigen tests while supplies last. If you test positive on a self-administered antigen test, please complete [this form](/health-guidelines/reporting-covid-19-infection-test-outside-yale-testing-program); the Yale Health resulting team will call to offer clinical support and isolation instructions. If you are participating in the 2020 Alumni Ceremony or the 2022 Commencement, as a graduate or in a supporting role, you are strongly encouraged to test two days before the first event - likely on Thursday, May 12 (ahead of the 2020 Alumni Ceremony) and on Friday, May 20 (ahead of the 2022 Commencement). My congratulations to the graduates, and warm wishes to everyone else. Sincerely, Melanie Boyd Dean of Student Affairs Senior Associate Dean, Yale College she | her | hers "}
