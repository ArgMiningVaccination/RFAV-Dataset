It is based on the principle that energy - known as 'qi' (pronounced 'chee') - runs through the body along meridians or 'channels', all of which correspond to a particular organ or part of the body. If this energy is free-flowing and balanced within the body, the individual is believed to remain in good health. However if qi becomes blocked, impaired or imbalanced, then it is said that mental, emotional or physical illness may follow. Acupuncture aims to rest the balance of qi in the body, by inserting fine needles to stimulate specific 'acupoints' that run along each of the meridians.

He also studied the natural healthcare system - Ayurveda - and heard about the revival of a gentle, yet extremely powerful Marma Therapy whilst in India in 2013. Curiously, the next Sukshma Marma training course was not in India, but in the UK, starting the evening that his plane from India was due to land at Heathrow - so he went on the course straight from the airport! Marek is now a qualified Sukshma Marma therapist, has treated clients in the UK, USA and Italy, and has recently translated the principal textbook on this technique into English. mareklorys@ gmail.com Monday 5th September - The Balance Procedure with Yvonne Zackim So why is being in balance so important? When our bodies are balanced both physically and emotionally dis-ease can be healed, and we are able to create the life we want rather than the life we don't want. The Balance Procedure activates the Language of the Universe with nine symbol cards, each representing a geometric symbol, affirmation, colour, number, zodiac, gemstone, element, planet, chakra, and physical aspect and how, when all is balanced, it is the unconscious mind. TBP is an energy technique that does not require an understanding of theory or precise disciplines, but is learnt through practice. Knowing how it works is not as important as doing it. Rather than using the rational, intellectual level of consciousness, it requires the development of flexibility and expansion of consciousness. It is not the procedure itself that brings about the results, they are merely catalysts. It is the life force working inside each person that brings about the transformation. [The Balance Procedure](http://www.balanceprocedure.com) Monday 3rd October - An insight into Apothecary with Amanda Saurin Amanda Saurin is the founder, plant grower, gatherer, distiller and maker at AS.AP She is a traditional Apothecary, and has worked with herbs and homeopathy for many years developing effective, gentle, bespoke preparations. Whilst living in the Levant, she learnt and gradually perfected the art of distillations to create exquisite aromatics and essential oils from plants she collected in the gardens of Sufis, the mountains of Kyrenia and the citrus groves bordering the Mediterranean. An appreciation of the transformative nature of scent, the rhythm of the plants, of their terroir, of landscape and the inter-connectedness of us all, are pivotal to the philosophy that underpins and informs Amanda's work. Through AS.AP she brings together her love of plants, growing, making, healing and collaboration to produce beautiful products that capture the essence and vitality of plants with the benefit of illuminating and rejuvenating your own natural beauty.

The Bowen Technique, developed by Australian Tom Bowen in the 1950's, is a gentle, hands-on therapy that addresses all types of musculoskeletal pains, and is designed to stimulate the body's innate healing ability. It has been hailed as one of the fastest growing and most successful treatment methods in the country. The technique uses a specific set of gentle rolling movements with the forefingers and thumbs on precise points on the body. These delicate rounded motions trigger impulses in the brain to stimulate healing, release blocked energy and improve blood flow and lymphatic drainage.
