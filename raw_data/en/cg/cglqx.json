Received for publication: March 18, 2004 Accepted: April 30, 2004Abstract Dental caries is a transmissible infectious disease, in which mutansstreptococci (MS) play the role of main pathogens. This oral disease represents a public health problem worldwide, and despite the advances in dental health with the use of fluoride abroad, treatment of cariesmanifestations and their outcomes are still highly costly to public andprivate healthcare systems. Lack of treatment of dental cariesultimately may have serious systemic consequences. Mutansstreptococci have a panel of virulence factors important for their establishment in the complex microbial community of the dental biofilm and in the induction of caries. In this review we discuss the advancesin our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which underlie MStransmission, tooth colonization and virulence. Infection and diseasetake place in a milieu exposed to components of the mucosal andsystemic immune systems of the host. Thus, inducing host responses which target aspects of mutans streptococcal colonization and disease may provide additional measures to modify dental caries. This reviewalso describes current strategies for anti-caries vaccination efforts withregard to important bacterial targets, routes, adjuvants and deliverysystems for active and passive immunization.

Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries Introduction Dental caries as a transmissible infectious diseaseDental caries is an infectious disease that occurs because ofan imbalance in the homeostasis between the host and oral flora. This imbalance is created by the emergence of cariogenic microorganisms in the complex community knownas dental plaque (dental biofilm). Cariogenic organisms arethose able to cause tooth demineralization because of theircapacity to accumulate, produce and tolerate extremely lowpHs in the dental plaque, that account for demineralization of dental tissues. All host and environmental factors that favor transmission of cariogenic organisms, creatingecological advantages for their establishment in the dentalbiofilm may be defined as risk factors for caries development.For example, frequency and intensity of contact with alreadyinfected subjects are initial factors in the transmission of these organisms. Several additional host and environmental factors influence this transmission and caries development.These include conditions that interfere with salivary innateand adaptative immune defenses (e.g. general immunedeficiencies associated with malnutrition, inherited ormedication disorders, or other factors that affect salivary flow and saliva composition). Specific substrates mainly derived from diet (e.g. sucrose) can favor bacterialaccumulation in the dental biofilm. Other host factors arealso associated with a higher susceptibility of teeth to cariesdevelopment even in the absence of a highly cariogenicmicrobiota. These include developmental defects in enamel formation in primary and permanent teeth 1. The composition of the dental biofilm community also may be an importantobstacle to establishment of pathogenic organism, becauseof antagonisms and cooperative interactions that occuramong inter-genera and species during the dynamic processof microbial competition for establishment in oral niches. Thus, dental caries may be defined as a complex multifatorial disease in that a broad group of biological, socio-economicand cultural factors interact directly or indirectly in theestablishment and growth of cariogenic microorganismswithin the diverse microbial community of the dental biofilm. Mutans streptococci and dental caries. There is solid evidence that the principal organismsassociated with the onset and progression of dental cariesare the mutans streptococci (MS). The associations of theseorganisms with caries in clinical and epidemiological studieshas been extensively studied and significant advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms by which these \"cariogenic\" streptococci bring about disease.Mutans streptococci were initially isolated from caries lesionsof British children by Clarke 2, who referred them as \"mutans\" streptococci because of their atypical rod-like shaperesembling \"mutant\" was that mutans streptococci were demonstrated tobe transmissible infectious agents involved in the establishment of caries disease 3. Since then, many epidemiological studies have investigated the degree ofmutans streptococcal infection in populations worldwide andthe relationships between MS infection and development of dental caries lesions (for reviews see 4-10 Mutans streptococci account for 7 distinct and S. sobrinus are exclusively isolated from humans and S. mutans is the most prevalent species11. Other bacterial aciduric species, such as lactobacilli and veillonella12-13, and yeast8,14, may co-infect developing carious lesions. There is little evidence howeverthat these later organisms are implicated in the initiation ofcaries. Their presence may result from a favorable acidic environment and the retentive topography of caries lesions already initiated by mutans streptococci 12,14. streptococci have been identified in all populationsstudied worldwide 4,7,10, but differences were observed regarding frequency and intensity of infection andassociations with caries indices. Study comparisons have been made difficult because of variations in study design, age and number of subjects analyzed, socio-economicbackground of the studied populations, cultural traits relatedto self care habits and diet, genetic background and exposureto fluoride 8. Apart from these limitations, epidemiological and clinical studies have provided a number of key notions that strengthen the need to control mutans streptococcal infection in order to limit dental caries development andprogression. These studies can also provide clues aboutthe best strategies to achieve this goal.The earlier children are colonized by MS, the less thelikelihood to control infection and caries development. Clinical studies performed with young children have identified crucial aspects of MS colonization andpathogenesis. These studies influenced the development ofmethods to control infection by MS. Pioneer studiesanalyzing initial colonization of MS and its association tocaries were performed in Scandinavia. Alaluusua and Renkonen 15 first reported that children with detectable levels of MS at 2 years of age presented a caries incidence about11-fold higher than children not colonized by the same age.Later, K\u00f6hler et al. 16observed that children colonized by S. mutans before 2 years of age, during primary tooth eruption, when their commensal microbiota were still being establishmed, showed a mean caries score (mean dfs=5.0) about 6-fold higher than the dfs score of children colonizedin later ages (from 0.9 to 2.5). These early colonized childrenalso had a number of caries lesions about 10-fold higherthan the index of children not colonized at 4 years of age(mean dfs=0.3) 16. This group later described that an intense597program to reduce oral levels of MS (including daily application of 1% chlorhexidine gel for 2 weeks) in initially highly MS colonized mothers significantly delayed the colonization of their first born babies who were followedfrom one to month to seven years of age. This was in contrastto babies from a control group of mothers (received onlyroutine treatment and dental prophylaxis), who werecolonized significantly earlier and presented a significant higher caries incidence 17. The preventive measures applied to mothers were performed until children reached 3 years ofage. The benefits of this treatment (low levels of infectionand low caries incidence), however, continued to be observeduntil the end of the study, when children were 7-years-old 17- 18. Understanding the effects of this treatment on the maturing biofilm underlies the explanation for these observations. Studies of the initial colonization by mutans streptococciindicate that these bacteria require non-shedding toothsurfaces to become established in the oral cavity 19-20. More sensitive methods using DNA specific probes indicate thatthe retentive surfaces of the tongue dorsum may function as a reservoir for posterior tooth colonization 21. The molecular mechanisms by which MS colonize and accumulate in thebiofilm are not fully understood but the process involves aninitial adherence phase in which surface proteins (adhesins)specifically interact with salivary components adsorbed tothe surfaces of teeth. This is followed by an accumulationphase in which MS increase in number as a result of the production of an extracellular matrix of glucans synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase enzymes secreted bythese bacteria. MS are not considered good initial colonizersof tooth surfaces, probably because other non to the salivary components adsorbed to teeth 22-23. Also, these commensal species produce IgA1-proteases,which are not produced by MS species. These proteasesmay confer additional ecological advantages for thesepioneer streptococcal establishment in the biofilmcommunity 24. MS establish on dental surfaces much later than other oral streptococci25-26. In an American population, MS were detected in only 7% of children who hadonlyincisors erupted (mean age of 9.2 months). In contrast, allwere colonized by Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and 50% by Streptococcus sanguis 25. These latter two species are primary colonizers of tooth surfaces and out-compete MS during the initial establishment of the dental plaque microbiota22,26. These findings suggest that MS does not easily colonize andestablish in the dental biofilm, and that specific factors maybe required to favor MS colonization in relation to othercommensal species.The natural history of MS colonization was analyzed in a prospective study of 48 children from birth to 5 years of age whose mothers were heavily colonized by MS 27. In that studyit was observed that all children who acquired MS were colonized between the ages of 19 to 30 months, and that children who did not present detectable levels of this bacteria during this defined period were not colonized until the endof the study, when children were 5-years-old. This periodfrom 19 to 31 months of age was referred to as the window ofMS infectivity. The reasons that account for this window ofinfectivity are not fully understood, but may be associated with the eruption of molars which provide virgin and retentive occlusal surfaces for colonization. Later studies performedin American children have confirmed the notion of a windowof infectivity 28. On the other hand, initial acquisition of S. mutans may occur earlier than the period of 19-30 months when children are under high challenge resulting from an excessive intake of sucrose and frequent exposure to heavily infected subjects17,21,29-32. Other host and environmental factors may influence the time of MS acquisition10,32, one of which may be the status of immunological maturation33-34. Apart from variations in the period for the opening of the\"window of infectivity\", the finding that this window is closed by 30 months of age supports the notion first conveyed by K\u00f6hler and Andre\u00e9n 17, that preventive strategies that delay the transmission of this bacteria untilafter the non pathogenic commensal biofilm matures onerupted tooth surfaces (e.g., 30 months of age) mayeffectively prevent MS infection throughout childhood.Based on this concept, it is suggested that preventive measures to control MS colonization when permanent teeth erupt, may also reduce risks for caries development in laterages 35-6; however, further studies are needed to investigate this issue. This may be applicable even to those populationshighly exposed to sucrose and characterized by a very earlyMS infection 29, where it was found that MS achieve relatively stable levels after 2 years of age29. Several efforts to identify sources of MS infection have been performed usingphenotypic typing and DNA fingerprinting methods to trackS. mutans initial colonizers. In these studies it was determined that mothers are the main source of MS infection 37-40, although other individuals from the family may also transmit this bacteria39-40 Few studies have, however, analyzed populations where children has less contact with family members, as forexample children attending nursery schools 41-42 These studies are necessary since a significant part of the population usethese institutions for early child care in several developedand developing countries. There is data suggesting that horizontal transmission of MS may occur between children attending nurseries 42, or between children and caregivers21. Once MS establish in the oral biofilm, they are difficult tomodify, unless drastic modifications occur in sucroseconsumption and oral hygiene care. Strategies available tocontrol S. mutans levels in the oral cavity in public health programs are limited to attempts to change habits of sucrose consumption and periodic tooth cleaning through mechanicalBraz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries598and/or chemical control of biofilm17,43 These approaches, however, are significantly challenged by behavioral, educational and socio-economic problems. Furthermore, while fluoride was responsible for much of the decrease inthe caries lesion indexes in the last decades, this treatmentwas not sufficient to control the disease; thus, dental cariesremains a major public health problem. The experience ofBrazilian children in the city of Piracicaba, SP, is instructive in this regard. Piracicaba has fluoride in the drinking water at optimal levels (around 0.7 ppm) since 1971. In addition,beginning at 2 years of age, children attending public nurseryschools (Escolas Municipais de Ensino Infantil with fluoridated dentifrices by healthagents 29 However, despite this high exposure to fluoride, about 35% of children between one to three years of age present with caries lesions44-45; nearly three fourths of 12-18- month-old children have shown detectable levels of S. mutans , and 20% of this age group showed high oral levels of S. mutans (>100 cfu of mutans streptococci), a level of infection much higher than that observed in communities from the U.S.A, Japan and Sweden27,28,40,45-47. In these latter communities, infection with ultimately cariogenic S. mutans usually occurs during the ages of 18-36 months at whichtime the oral ecology and the level of mucosal immunedevelopment are likely to be significantly different from theearlier and generally more heavily infected Brazilian children.This abnormal infection rate has severe consequences. For example, we have shown that some children in this Brazilian population already have dental decay at 12 to 18 months ofage 44. A subsequent prospective study revealed that young children carrying heavy infection levels of S. mutans showed a high level of risk for dental caries, which was determinedas a 9-fold increase in risk for caries development when compared to children with lower levels of MS 29. The control of MS infection levels in young children andadults proved to be extremely difficult 30-31,48-50. Application of chlorhexidine to reduce MS currently is the mainalternative choice because of its substantivity and selectiveeffect on MS 49,51-53. However, intense treatment (frequent applications with gels of high concentration) are necessary for effective suppression of bacteria51,52. In addition, recolonization occurs within three to six months even afterintense suppression of MS by chlorhexidine treatment inadults 49 and in young children48. Thus a more effective strategy may include use of chlorhexidine for initial suppression of MS infection, coupled with additional measures which interfere with the ecological competitivenessof MS species.Because the detection of MS is very frequently associatedwith occurrence of caries lesions, the use of culture methodsto detect and quantify MS levels were applied in several populations in order to identify high risk subjects from adults and children, who could be targets for application of moreintense health care for caries prevention (for review see van Houte, 1993 7). However, it appears that quantitation of oral levels of MS is more efficient for detection of subjects that will not develop dental caries rather for identification of highcaries risk 7 This may be explained by the complex multifactorial nature of caries disease. Among youngBrazilian children from public nursery schools, it was foundthat children heavily colonized by MS developed a high mean of 4.6 new caries lesions per year 29 However, even among the heavily MS infected children, there were some childrenthat did not develop caries during the follow-up period,despite socio-economic, dietary and fluoride exposureconditions similar to those of high caries active children 29,45. These children experienced reduction in levels of MS after a one-year follow-up period. High fluctuations in MS initial infection levels were described in other populations28, and much still is to be learned about the host factors that mayinfluence susceptibility to the establishment of a pathogenicdental biofilm. Some socio-economic and cultural factorshave already been shown to relate to caries experience in Brazilian 54 and other populations1,41, but a complete understanding of host and bacterial factors involved ininfection and disease remain. For example, children who arebreast-feed for longer periods have lower caries prevalencethan children who are weaned early in life 44 Colostrum is known to provide a stimulus for accelerating mucosalmembrane closure in the gastrointestinal tract and to provide a stimulus for maturation of the mucosal immune system 55. Children who are not breast fed are deprived of milk-bornepassive immunity to a variety of bacterial antigens whichmay account for higher levels of infections 55. There is evidence of higher susceptibility to respiratory diseases, forexample, in children with transitory episodes of depressed immune response associated with reduced salivary levels of SIgA 55. However, the effect of low levels of SIgA in caries development is unclear56-58, probably because of the diversity in IgA specificity to virulence-relevant antigens59-61. In this regard, the immune response to MS during their initialestablishment in the oral cavity needs more study, especially in those populations showing heavy MS colonization. Moreover, the high genetic diversity already described withinthe MS species indicates that some bacterial clones may bemore virulent than others within a population. Largevariations in the expression of different virulence factorshave been described among clinical isolates of MS 62-64. Molecular Pathogenesis of disease Mutans streptococci produce several proteins important tothe pathogenesis of dental caries. These proteins areinvolved in the ability to colonize teeth and to impose theirecological advantage over other commensal organisms when the dental biofilm is under the environmental stress. For initial colonization, MS are able to adhere to saliva-coated toothBraz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries599surfaces by specific interactions with salivary components and with surface proteins of other bacterial species. Secondly, MS are able to increase in proportion within thebiofilm community through the synthesis and interactionwith an extracellular matrix of water-insoluble glucans.Sufficient accumulation of mutans streptococci in the plaqueallow them to decrease biofilm pH to less than 5.0 by virtue of the synthesis of lactic acid from fermentative metabolism of dietary sugars and from intracellular and extracellularreservoirs of saccharides. An additional virulence trait ofMS is their ability to tolerate extreme stress conditionsresulted from external environmental factors and from theown bacterial products, e.g., high osmotic pressure, relatively long periods of starvation and very low pHs. Extended exposure of the teeth to biofilm pH's of less than5.5 leads to tooth demineralization, and thus carious lesions.Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesisof these SM species has allowed investigators to identifytargets for controlling S. mutans infection and virulence. Important surface proteins are involved in initial adherence of S. mutans to saliva-coated teeth and are called adhesins. Oral streptococcal species express several adhesins thatspecifically bind proteins and glycoproteins from saliva,from epithelium, and also from dietary and microbialcomponents 65. The affinities and specificities of these interactions help to determine the distribution of microbiota on oral muccosa and saliva-coated tooth surfaces. The groupof surface adhesins expressed by S. mutans are variously termed antigen I/II (SpaP, Pac or P1) and in S. sobrinus, SpaA. This family of surface proteins was found to bind salivaryglycoproteins and other microorganisms 66, and seem to participate in virulence. Polypeptides from this family of protein have also been observed in other commensal speciesas Streptococcus gordonii 65. S. mutans also presents a cell wall-associated protein (WapA) that was suggested to bindsaliva-coated smooth surfaces and to participate in sucrose-dependent adherence, but its role in cariogenesis is not fully understood 67-68. Glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) have a crucial role in theaccumulation process of S. mutans in the biofilm, since they catalyze the synthesis of an extracellular matrix that produce glucans with distinct degrees of water-solubility, depending the proportion and type of glycosidic linkages. The synthesis of glucan has proven to beessential for the ability of this bacteria to adhere to smooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose in vitro and to induce dental caries in animal models, as shown by the fact thatknockout mutants of each gtfB, gtfC and gtfD gene were compromised in their ability to cause caries 72-74. S. sobrinussecretes 4 distinct Gtfs. Two other isotypesencoded by gtfT and gtfU that are involved in the synthesis of glucan with both kinds of glycosidic own Gtfs, generally they only weaklyadhere to smooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Thismay be related to the variation in the chemical structure ofglucan produced. For example, growth of S. sanguis in the presence of S. mutans Gtfs and sucrose increases the ability of S. sanguis to adhere to smooth surfaces 77. Although Gtfs from several oral streptococcal species show high sequencehomologies, the number of isotypes produced per speciesseems to be variable 78. Moreover, the mechanisms that control expression of the Gtf isozymes are distinct78-79. Gtfs have two functional domains, a catalytic domain located in the N-terminal third of the molecule, and a glucan-bindingdomain located in the carboxy-terminal third. The glucan-binding domain contain amino acid repeats that resembleligand-binding domains of various Gram-positive bacteria,and that were found to be also necessary for the catalytic activity 78. The number of repeats in this domain affects the structure of glucans, and thus may affect its adherenceproperties 78. The molecular interaction of S. mutans cells with the extracellular glucan matrix is not fully understood, but aheterogeneous group of proteins have been shown to bindglucans, and for that property were named Glucan- binding proteins (Gbps). S. mutans expresses at least 4 distinct Gbps, that are named GpbA, GbpB, GbpC and GbpD, based in theorder in that they were firstly described 78. Apart from their affinity for glucan, genetic and biochemical studies on eachprotein have indicated that the biological functions of Gbpsare variable 78. GbpA has homology with the glucan-binding domain of the S. mutans GtfB and GtfC. However, deletion of the gene encoding GbpA modified the morphology of thebiofilm in vitro , and caused an increase in virulence 80-81 GbpB shows no homology with other from othergram-positive organisms 63 Mutants of GbpB proved to be very unstable, suggesting that this protein has an essential role in S. mutans biology, probably because it plays a role in the maintenance of the cell wall integrity82-84 Production of GbpB appears to influence the ability of S. mutans genotypes to grow in a biofilm phase, and is over-expressed underosmotic stress 85. The thirth Gbp, GbpC, is also expressed under osmotic stress conditions, but differently from GbpA and GbpB which canbe presented in cell-associated or secreted forms, GbpC iscovalently linked to the cell wall through a LPxTG anchormotif targeted by a sortase transpeptidase 86. GbpC is important to S. mutans aggregation in the presence of glucanBraz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries600and dextran and adherence of S. mutans to saliva-coated teeth surfaces under stress conditions, which suggests itsparticipation on S. mutans cariogenicity 87 GbpD has recently been identified through the screening of putative proteins of the S. mutans genome88 that share homology with the glucan-binding domain of Gtfs and GbpA78. However, its role in the cariogenicity of S. mutans remains to be determined. S. sobrinus also has been shown to secrete several glucan-binding proteins89. One has been sequenced and defined as a dextransucrase inhibitor78. S. mutans can prevail in the cariogenic biofilm not only because of its ability to synthesize and interact with glucansfrom sucrose, but also because they present severalmechanisms to tolerate extreme and rapid pH drops (to pHslower than 4.0), a condition that is poorly The frequent drops in biofilm pH due to exposure to sugars andsubsequent synthesis of acids from glycolysis promotes theincrease in the proportion of S. mutans , lactobacilli, and other acid-tolerant organisms, within a microbial community 12. Commensal streptococcal species have mechanisms to raise environmental pH by the production of ammonia from deaminase activities90. However only S. mutans can produce acids from the fermentation of sugars at pH as low as 4.4 andgrow at pHs of about 4.8 91. S. mutans is the gram-positive species with the ability to metabolize the highest number ofcarbohydrates when compared to the gram-positive speciessequenced so far, and presents at least five sugar ABC transport systems, including the multiple sugar metabolism system (MSM) 88. The genome of UA159 contains the highest number of phosphoenol pyruvate systems (PTS) among Grampositive organisms, accounting for a large number of sugartransport systems encoded in their genome 88. Moreover, S. mutans can sustain acid production even during periods of fasting, because of the ability to store intracellular glycogen- like polyssacharides, a trait that has been considered to beimportant in virulence in animal models 92. Mutans streptococci also express surface attached dextransucrasesand fructanases that break extracellular polysaccharides forfurther uptake and metabolism 66. S. mutans have several mechanisms to maintain an acid tolerant phenotype (ATP). It was shown that acid shockpromotes up-regulation of 64 proteins within 30 minutes ofthe pH change to avoid damage to intracellular proteins andnucleic acids 93. One of these mechanisms includes a transmembrane proton-pumping F1F0-ATPase system, which occurs in other oral streptococci. This remains a fertile field for investigation (for review see Quivey et al., 2001 andBurne, 1997) 91,94. Finally, to survive and grow under all the stress conditionsto which the cariogenic biofilm is exposed, MS has to senseenvironmental changes and rapidly modify its physiology inorder to persist and grow in its ecological niche. It has become clear that expression of several virulence factors, includingadhesins, Gtfs, Gbps and proteins for acid-shock resistanceare all environmentally regulated 85,95-100. Recently, an inter- cell quorum-sensing communication system that involved secretion of pheromone-like peptides was characterized inS. mutans , and appears to be important to biofilm growth 97,100. Another two pheromone-like peptides were identified in theS. mutans genome, and may participate in an intra-species communication system 88. A further inter-species communication system seems to be also presented in its genome88. Blocking these communication systems could repress expression of a group of virulence factors101-102. The completed sequencing of the S. mutans genome, and recent progress in the sequencing of the S. sobrinus genome as well as of other commensal species of the dental biofilm103 coupled with new technologies for analysis of geneexpression and regulation has opened a broad field to betterunderstand the physiology of MS, their interaction tocommensal organisms and expression of virulence. Theseadvances will be very important to elucidate a variety ofmolecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenicity of these organisms within the complex dental biofilm community. Pathways to Protective Immunity The oral cavity is protected by a variety of innate andadaptive host mechanisms which enter via the major andminor salivary glands, gingival crevice, or perfuse throughthe oral epithelium. The principal adaptive immune component in saliva is secretory IgA antibody which is synthesized as a dimer by interstitial plasma cells andsecreted into the lumen through salivary epithelium.An additional referred to as secretorycomponent or poly-immunoglobulin receptor, is covalentlyadded to the IgA dimer during transit through the imparting proteolysis. IgG-rich gingival crevicular fluid contributes additionalantibody to the oral milieu to deal with infections. Modestamounts of IgG antibody may also be contributed by theminor salivary glands. Given that dental caries is the resultof infection, a significant effort has been mounted to engage one or more of these immune systems to intercept primary colonization and growth of the acidogenic microflora thathave been associated with this disease. Passive applicationof preformed antibody has also been employed to inhibit there-colonization of preexistent cariogenic organisms.Several strategies have been commonly pursued during the course of development of potential dental caries vaccines. Firstly, virtually all approaches targeted either Streptococcus mutans or S. sobrinus as the principal etiologic agents of the disease. Secondly, most investigators sought to preventinitial colonization rather than to remove cariogenicmicroorganisms from an established biofilm. Thirdly,Braz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries601investigators sought to use antibody to block one or more aspects of bacterial colonization or accumulation was sought, rather than inactivate metabolic pathways critical to the survival of the microorganism. The following sections willdescribe the development of these active and passive immuneapproaches in preclinical studies and humans clinical trials. Development of mucosal immunity: The development of effective dental caries vaccine approaches have paralleled the emergence our understanding of mucosal immuneontogeny. Although some immunological issues importantfor the application of a childhood dental caries vaccine areincompletely resolved, sufficient data are available toformulate reasonable strategies. For example, the natural history of mutans streptococcal infection described above indicates that a child's mucosal immune system needs to besufficiently mature by the end of the first year of life in orderfor a vaccine to induce an effective response. Since childrenof this age do not receive mucosal immunizations, knowledgeof the immunological responsiveness of the secretory immune system only comes from analysis of mucosal responses to infections with indigenous organisms. Thesestudies have shown that the oral immune environmentundergoes rapid, early development. Although secretory IgAantibody in saliva and other secretions is essentially absentat birth 104, exposure to bacterial, viral and food antigens causes a rapid expansion of IgA plasma cells in mucosal lamina propria105 Mature SIgA, i.e., dimeric IgA with bound secretory component, is the principal salivaryimmunoglobulin secreted by one month of age 106. Salivary IgA antibody to pioneer oral ( Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S. salivarius)59,60,107 microbiota appears within weeks of initial exposure. Salivary IgA antibody to tetanus toxoid and poliovirus also appears following pediatric immunization with these injected and oralvaccines 59. Salivary antibody to oral commensal microbiota can be detected in both IgA subclasses by nine months ofage 60,107. Also, although salivary IgA concentrations are significantly below adult levels at this age, salivary immunoglobulin is > 95% SIgA. Thus, the evidence suggests that significant maturation of the mucosal immune responsehas occurred by the end of the first year of life.The manner in which the child's immune system handlesinitial infection with mutans streptococci can also beinstructive. Natural exposure to mutans streptococci results in a mucosal immune response, which can often be observed in the second and third year of life. Western blot and ELISAanalyses reveal that the major responses appear to be directedprimarily to MS streptococcal components which areconsidered to be important in colonization and accumulation,such as antigen I/II, glucosyltransferase, and glucan binding protein(s) 28. Interestingly, in some children, antibody to mutans streptococcal antigens can also be detectedindependently of the ability to detect ongoing infection in the second year of life. As is the case with many bacterial challenges throughout the body, the threshold of immunological response is lower than that of persistentinfection; therefore it is not surprising to observe antibodyto S. mutans antigens in the absence of its colonization. Longitudinal studies suggest that antibody reactive withmutans streptococci results from contact with mutans streptococci, rather cross-reaction with earlier colonizing oral streptococci, since well-developed salivaryIgA antibody to pioneer oral streptococci can bedemonstrated prior to the detection of antibody reactive withmutans streptococci 108. However, significant individuality seems to occur in the rate, specificity, and intensity of response after mutans streptococcal infection. Even siblings may differ in the amount or specificity of salivary IgAantibody, despite being presumably challenged with the samematernal bacterial clonaltypes. Regardless of thesedifferences, the evidence does point to the ability of thechild to recognize infection with mutans streptococci by the formation of salivary IgA antibody. Bacterial Targets for Caries Vaccines: Targets associated with bacterial colonization andaccumulation: Following early demonstrations that immunization with intact mutans streptococci could induceprotective immune responses in experimental models for dental caries 109-110, investigators sought to refine vaccine targets to individual components. The first step in themolecular pathogenesis of the disease is the colonization ofthe tooth surface, or, more accurately, colonization of thepre-existing biofilm on the tooth surface, by cariogenicstreptococci through adhesin-mediated mechanisms. Abundant in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that antibody with specificity for S. mutans AgI/II or S. sobrinus SpaA can interfere with bacterial adherence and subsequentdental caries. Antibody directed to the intact antigen I/IImolecule or to its salivary-binding domain blocked adherenceof S. mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite 111. Furthermore, a variety of immunization approaches have shown that active immunization with intact antigen I/II112-113, or passive immunization with monoclonal114 or transgenic antibody115 to putative salivary binding domain epitopes within thiscomponent can protect rodents, primates or humans fromdental caries caused by S. mutans . Immunization of mice with synthetic peptides (residues 301-319) from the alanine- rich region of antigen I/II suppressed tooth colonization withS. mutans 116. Intranasal immunization with antigen I/II, coupled to cholera toxin B subunit, suppressed colonizationof mouse teeth by S. mutans 116. Fusion proteins containing this adhesin also were shown to inhibit sucrose-independent adhesion of S. J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries602protected rats from caries caused by S. sobrinus infection117. Thus, these streptococcal adhesins appear to be prime candidates for dental caries vaccine applications. Targets associated with bacterial accumulation: Sucrose-dependent accumulation of mutans streptococciwithin the dental biofilm have also been immunologicallytargeted in preclinical and clinical studies. Most effort has centered on a group of glucosyltransferase enzymes which catalyze the extracellular formation of alpha 1,3 and 1,6-linkedglucan from sucrose. These polysaccharides providemultiple binding sites for the accumulation of mutansstreptococci in the plaque as well as reservoirs ofcarbohydrate for cell metabolism. Given the central role of glucan formation in the molecular pathogenesis of dental caries, it is not surprising that Gtfs from S. mutans or S. sobrinus Gtf could induce protective immune responses in preclinical 110,118 or clinical studies in young adults119-120. Futhermore, passive administration of antibody to Gtf in thediet also protected rats from experimental dental caries 121. Thus, the presence of antibody to glucosyltransferase in the oral cavity prior to infection can significantly influencethe disease outcome, presumably by interference with oneor more of the functional activities of the enzyme.Immune responses to Gtf can also be directed to functionaldomains. A variety of biochemical, genetic and sequencealignment techniques have identified several residues within the N terminal region of Gtfs that appear to be associated with its catalytic activity 122-125. Other studies have shown that the repeating sequences in the C terminal third of Gtf areassociated with primer dependent glucan binding 126-129. This information has directed the design of Gtf subunit vaccines.For example, immunization with synthetic peptide constructs corresponded to sequence containing at least five different catalytically active residues or glucan binding domains havebeen shown to induce immune responses interfering withenzyme function and/or with the cariogenic activity ofmutans streptococcal infection 130-134. Glucan binding proteins have also received some attention in the search for effective antigens. Although several glucan binding proteins (Gbp) have been described only one, S. mutans GbpB135, has been reported to induce protective immunity in experimental systems136. Salivas of young children often contain IgA antibody to GbpB, indicating thatinitial infection with S. mutans can lead to natural induction of immunity to this protein 28. The gbpB gene, cloned and sequenced by Mattos-Graner and co-workers in 200163, indicates an expressed GbpB protein of 431 residues.Bioinformatic analysis of the GbpB sequence has revealedseveral sequences with potential MHC class II-bindingactivity. A synthetic peptide based on one of these sequences in the N terminal third of the molecule has been shown to induce protective immunity in a rat model for dentalcaries 137. The ability to induce protective immunity with subunitvaccines based on adhesin, Gtf or GbpB sequences has ledinvestigators develop constructs combining epitopes fromone or more proteins. Taubman and coworkers 134 have shown that the combination of peptides from the catalytic and glucan-binding domains of Gtf enhances the level ofexperimental the Gtf induce that inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis by S. mutans Gtf and also adhesion of S. mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads 84. DNA vaccines coding for one or more of the virulence associated proteins also have been shown to induceprotective responses 138. Incorporation of a Gtf catalytic domain peptide within a construct containing a GbpB sequence with MHC class II binding characteristics greatly enhanced antibody formation to the Gtf peptide. Thus thepotential exists to broaden the protective potential of thesubunit vaccine approach. Enhancements to Active Immunization Approaches: Routes: Although the basic principle of immune protection from dental caries caused by mutans streptococci has beenestablished in preclinical studies, refinements to the effectiveapplication of this approach to humans remain. One of theissues deals with the route of delivery. Early studies withmucosally applied caries vaccines used the oral or intragastric route for antigen delivery. Although significant effects on mutans streptococcal infection and disease were observedin animal 109,118 and human studies119-120, induction of immune responses by the oral route requires antigen passagethrough the gut prior to uptake in the gut associated lymphoidtissue (GALT). Since transit through the acidic stomach environment reduces the effective antigen stimulus, and the journey to GALT dilutes antigen concentration, inductionof protective immunity in mucosal sites that are in closeranatomical relationship to the oral cavity has been pursued.Intranasal installation (IN) of antigen, which targets the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), has been used to induce immunity to many bacterial antigens, including those associated with mutans streptococcal colonization andaccumulation. Protective immunity after infection withcariogenic mutans streptococci could be induced in rats bythe IN route with many S. mutans antigens or functional domains associated with these components. Protection could be demonstrated with S. mutans Ag I/II 113, the salivary binding region (SBR) of Ag I/II139, a 19 mer sequence within the SBR116, the glucan binding domain of S. GbpB-derived peptides137, and fimbrial preparations from S. mutans141, using antigen alone or in combination with mucosal adjuvants. Additional routes haveBraz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries603included exposure of antigen to tonsils or to minor salivary glands. Each has resulted in aspects of protection inanimals 142 and humans120. Adjuvants: Since mucosal application of soluble antigen is insufficient to sustain an immune response, several strategies have been employed. One of these has been totake advantage of the immunostimulating ability ofenterotoxins such as cholera toxin (CT) or the closely relatedserogroups I and II of E. coli heat labile enterotoxins (LT). CT could be shown to markedly enhance the protective potential of intragastrically or intranasally applied mutans streptococcal antigens 143-144. Adjuvant features of CT or LT for use in preclinical studies of dental caries vaccines werepreserved by removing the A1 subunit toxin domain fromthe CT complex 145, mutating residues in the A subunit domain,146or using the B subunit113. Antigen or functional domains therein, when mixed with detoxified adjuvant or chemically conjugated or genetically fused with adjuvantsubunits, dramatically increased salivary immune responsesresulting in protective immunity 116,147-149. Delivery systems: Targeting vaccine antigens to mucosal immune tissue or delivery in vehicles which prolong or promote exposure of antigen to inductive tissue have also been used successfully in preclinical studies. For example,intact adhesins 117, chimeric SBR-CTA2/B proteins150-152, were expressed in Salmonella , since these bacteria specifically bind to the epithelial cellswhich overlie mucosal lymphoid tissue. Such constructs,delivered in attenuated Salmonella expression vectors induced protective immune responses when administered intragastrically or intranasally. Incorporation of antigen inor on various types of microparticles or microspheres madeof poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or liposomes has also beenemployed in an attempt to increase uptake via antigenparticularization. These approaches have been shown to be useful in the delivery of dental caries vaccine antigens for protective responses in preclinical studies 154 or salivary antibody formation in humans155-157. Passive Immune Approaches As an alternative to strategies that require active immune responses in the host, antibody to critical S. mutans virulence factors can be passively introduced into the oral cavity forprotective effect (for a review, see Koga et al. 158, 2002). Pioneering studies in the 1970's by groups in the US andGreat Britain provided a theoretical basis for this approach.Michalek and McGhee 159 showed caries-protective effects in rat pups that suckled on IgA-rich milk from mothers who had previously been immunized with mutans streptococci.Lehner and coworkers 160 showed that intravenous infusion of rhesus monkeys with serum IgG antibody from monkeysthat had been injected with mutans cellsprotected the passively transferred animals from subsequentdental caries. Refinements in this approach occurred with respect to antibody specificity, antibody source, and method of introduction into the oral cavity. Antibody to intactstreptococci 161-162, antigen I/II114,163-166, Gtf121 or GbpB167 have each been reported to have a measure of success indecreasing colonization or recolonization of mutansstreptococci in experimental models or in small clinical trials in humans. Thus, although no direct comparisons have been performed, the bacterial components that induce protectiveimmunity by active immunization, also are useful for passiveimmune applications.The methods of practical delivery of antibody into the oralcavity include incorporating antibody into the diet or drinking water, or exposing to the teeth to antibody reagents via a variety of dental rinsing mechanisms. Earlier applicationswith mouse monoclonal antibody 114,163-164 have given way to the use of IgY antibody from chicken egg yolks in which thisIgG-like antibody is concentrated 121,161-162,167. Bovine milk antibody sources have also demonstrated a protective effect. For example, antibody to intact mutans streptococci in bovine milk, incorporated into the diet of gnotobiotic rats168 or used as a mouth rinse in humans169 interfered with the progress of infection or disease. More recently, immune milk containingantibody to a fusion protein containing the alanine-richsalivary binding region of antigen I/II and the glucan bindingdomain of Gtf was also used as a mouth rinse 166. Following cetylpyridinium treatment of the teeth of adults, and mouth rinsing with immune milk, significant reductions inrecolonizing mutans streptococci were observed.Building on the long term protection of humans from dentalcaries achieved after chlorhexidine treatment followed bytopical application with monoclonal to S. mutans Ag I/II adhesin epitopes 170, Ma and coworkers171 prepared immune reagent by transgenic synthesis of secretory IgA/Ghybrid monoclonal antibody of similar specificity in tobaccoplants. Application of this hybrid transgenic antibody tohumans under a similar three week protocol also resulted inprotection from oral colonization with mutans streptococci for at least four months 115. The basis for these long term protective effects after a relatively short topical antibodytreatment remain unclear but might be explained ecologicallyby the nature of the oral biofilm that recolonizes the teeth inthe presence of antibody after chlorhexidine treatment. Sumary: Clearly there is strong evidence that Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus are closely associated with dental caries. Fluoride treatment used abroad has successfullylimited caries progression, but was not sufficient to controlthis infectious disease, even when used together withprofessional tooth cleaning and dietary counseling in populations highly exposed to these cariogenic microbiota. As we increase our knowledge about the molecularBraz J Oral Sci. 3(11): 595-608 The vaccination approach to control infections leading to dental caries604mechanisms involved in establishment and emergence of MS in the dental biofilm, and the influence of the biofilm onbiochemical pathways leading to caries formation, newmethods to intervene with the establishment of a cariogenicflora should develop 172. Active or passive immunization strategies, which target key elements in the molecular pathogenesis of MS hold promise. Integrating theseapproaches into broad-based public health programs mayyet forestall dental caries disease experienced by many ofthe world's children, among whom those of high caries riskmight derive the greatest benefit.
