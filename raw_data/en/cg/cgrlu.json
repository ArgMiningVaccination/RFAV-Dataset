A letter from the secretary-treasurer It was heartwarming to see so many enthusiastic alumni at the 69th Biennial Meeting in Phoenix and Scottsdale in October. While alumni came from across the country, it was particularly nice to see the turnout from the West Coast and Southwest. The Scientific Program provided updates on innovation at all Mayo Clinic locations, including the multi - site medical school, online learning advances, proton beam therapy which debuts in Arizona this spring, and regenerative and individualized medicine. At the President's Gala, Dr. Juan Sarmiento passed the gavel to Dr. Susheela Bala. She'll bring energy and excitement to the role. Alumni who attend these meetings \u2014 whether they're regional, national or international \u2014 inevitably make connections they didn't anticipate with former colleagues and mentors or new friends. It was a particular pleasure to reconnect with one of our keynote speakers, Kenneth Nollet, M.D., Ph.D. (BIOC '93, MDPD '93, PATH '97, TRMED '98). He spoke on Healthcare at the intersection of danger and oppor - tunity: responding to Japan's earth - quake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. Dr. Nollet is the director of International Cooperation at the Radiation Medical Science Center of Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan \u2014 the site of the nuclear power plant crisis after the 2011 tsunami. I was vice chair of the Mayo Medical School admis - sion committee when Dr. Nollet was admitted, and we had met a few times during his student days. It is a wonderful experience to see our graduates travel so far and do so well. I encourage you to consider attending an upcoming meeting. In June the International Meeting is in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. And in fall 2017 the 70th Biennial Meeting will be in Jacksonville, Florida. No doubt you'll be glad you made the time to renew your Mayo connections. In 2001 Alumni Association President Dr. Christine Mroz-Baier (S '73, S '78) shared the benefit she got from attending her first Biennial Meeting, which I think sums up how many of us feel: \"... I was feeling the wear and tear of private practice. ... That visit with old friends and consultants completely stimulated my interest in learning again. I was reminded of the Mayo motto, 'The Needs of the Patient Come First,' which restored satisfaction and joy in my daily practice of medicine.\" Peter C.

INNOVATION CENTENNIAL Celebrating 100 years of alumni contributions Issue 4 2015 34 MAYO CLINIC ALUMNI There's reason for great optimism for Mayo Clinic and health care in the United States. A lot of chaos, too, but a lot of reason for hope.\" - Wyatt Decker, M.D.69TH BIENNIAL MEETING Historic changes in medicine amidst chaotic health care environment Outgoing Alumni Association President Juan Sarmiento, M.D., opened the Biennial Meeting.The 69th Biennial Meeting of the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association opened with outgoing President Juan Sarmiento, M.D. (SR '96, PRES '98, S '00, S-GI '02), of Emory University School of Medicine, thanking the meeting's host, Wyatt Decker, M.D. (MED '90, I '93), Mayo Clinic vice president and CEO of Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and recalling their meeting 19 years ago. \"In 1996 I had my first ER call in Rochester. I spoke little English, and the consultant in the ER was Dr. Decker,\" said Dr. Sarmiento. \"He welcomed me with a big smile. We were there for 12 hours overnight, and he had the same smile and was the same gentleman as the moment we met.\" Dr. Decker said he recalled being impressed with the young intern, who is now chief of surgery at Emory. Dr. Decker spoke to assembled alumni about the chaotic health care environment due to an aging population, fragmentation, variable quality, avoidable errors and physician burnout. He said, however, that people will look back on this period as one of historic change in medicine because of innovations including: Data mining to improve care and lower the cost of health care, including Mayo Clinic's Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery and partnership in OptumLabs. The power of genomics and how Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine is guiding treatment of cancer and other serious conditions, and is collaborating on applications for a soon-to-be introduced direct-to-consumer genomics product. In Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Medicine, engineering adult stem cells from a patient's own body to restore organ function or create new tissue. Redesign of medical school curriculum in collaboration with Arizona State University. Dr. Decker described Mayo Clinic's \"bold initiative\" to create a national medical school \u2014 one school with three campuses, one governance and one curriculum. Mayo Clinic in Arizona will feature a four-year campus of Mayo Medical School, with the first class of 50 students starting in July 2017. Medical students from Rochester will have the opportunity to spend their third and fourth years at Mayo Clinic in Florida starting in 2016. \"Since the Flexner Report more than 100 years ago led to a redesign of medical school, its basic design has changed little although health care has changed significantly,\" he said. Mayo Medical School will be the first medical school to span three states across the country. Scaling Mayo Clinic knowledge to provide credible, trustworthy health care information to millions of people around the world through mayoclinic.com and 35 Mayo Clinic Care Network affiliates. Mayo Clinic shares its knowledge and practices to make sure the organization is relevant for a broad swath of patients globally. \"It's an unbelievably exciting time for medicine, with individualized, personalized medicine and big data coming together for the patient,\" said Dr. Decker. \"Mayo Clinic is the most widely recognized brand in health care in the world and a leader in innovation in health care and its systems. We have a history of having smart, creative people such as Dr. Henry Plummer on staff, and that continues to be an important part of our organization today. \"There's reason for great optimism for Mayo Clinic and health care in the United States. A lot of chaos, too, but a lot of reason for hope.\" Left: Mayo Clinic in Arizona's Wyatt Decker, M.D., hosted the meeting and provided an overview of historic innovations occurring in medicine.

My sister is an obstetrician/gynecologist in London.\" Dr. Bala grew up in India, married her husband, gastroenterologist Kumar Bala, M.D. (GI '87, HEPAT '88), and moved to London, England, for medical training. There, she had her first child, Divya, now an attorney in Los Angeles, California. Dr. Bala and her husband moved to Rochester in 1995 for fellowships at Mayo Clinic. \"We were well aware of Mayo's great reputation in India and the U.K.,\" says Dr. Bala. \"It was an honor to train there and an incredible experience to see how the patient was always put first in ease of appointments that were given back to back and the time consultants spent in explaining to patients about their medical problems.\" Dr. Bala had her second daughter, Saranya Balasubramaniam, M.D. (I-1 '13, OPH '16), now a resident in ophthalmology at Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education, at the end of her fellowship in allergy and immunology. Dr. Bala worked as an associate consultant at Mayo Clinic while her husband completed his fellowship. Then the family moved to Southern California. Dr. Bala's career in allergy includes part-time private practice and working at the J.L. Pettis VA Medical Center. \"I've always enjoyed teaching, and practicing at the VA allows me to do that,\" she says. \"You always learn from your students.\" Having trained on three continents, Dr. Bala says she has a good perspective about how medicine works in different places. \"Mayo Clinic is a unique environment where everything revolves around the patient and, primary care and specialties work together to achieve that.\" Her interest in becoming involved in the Alumni Association stems from a regional meeting. \"My husband and I went to this meeting only because it was in Northern California. But then I felt a connection with the other alumni. We have so much in common,\" says Dr. Bala. \"That was the first step. Mayo Clinic has given far more to us than we can ever give back. I'm glad to be able to try to give back with my time.\" Additionally, Dr. Bala says being involved with the Alumni Association helps her stay current on Mayo Clinic. \"Mayo has changed through the years. I've always referred patients, family and friends. Knowing what's new helps me make better-informed referrals.\" 69TH BIENNIAL MEETING New Alumni Association President Susheela Bala, M.D. Fast 5 with Dr. Bala 1.

I became interested in pulmonary and critical care medicine as a subspecialty during my residency. I met an alumnus in that field and asked him to write a letter recommending me for a fellowship. When I went to Mayo Clinic I had no intention of staying. My wife and I are both from Kansas, and we planned to return there. I planned to join a big hospital in Kansas City. Then my wife met a woman whose husband worked in that hospital practice. She told my wife about a family drawing their son made in school. The drawing didn't show the father.

I've always been attracted to helping people. I was involved in Scouting from a young age and took on leadership roles, including tending to Scouts who got sick on camping trips. I was on a swim team with my sister when I was 16, and she had an epileptic seizure in the deep end of the pool. I gave her CPR. I was from a small town and went to college in a big city. The first year, my GPA wasn't good, so I set myself a goal to get into medical school. That set me on the right course.Know your board MAYO CLINIC ALUMNI ASSOCIATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS Provides leadership | Makes policy decisions | Decides strategic direction and vision Mayo Clinic offered an integrated practice that enabled a simple Kansas boy to develop a world- class practice and still be home for dinner.\" - Eric Edell, M.D. Issue 4 2015 19Brian Rodysill (CTSA '16, MED '18) Board Member, Executive Committee, Mayo Medical School Student Representative Medical School: Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota Undergraduate: University of Southern California Native of: Rochester, Minnesota Why did you decide to pursue medicine? I had a spinal cord injury at 21 and was treated at Mayo Clinic. The exposure to various aspects of health care and my experience as a patient emboldened a sense of purpose toward healing the sick and broken. I give Mayo a lot of the credit for rehabilitating me from my injury. I have been able to hike, why, the boy said, \"He's probably working.\" My wife shared the story. I promised her that if we stayed at Mayo Clinic, I'd be home for dinner every night. Mayo Clinic offered an integrated practice that enabled a simple Kansas boy to develop a world-class practice and still be home for dinner. What valuable lesson have you learned at Mayo Clinic? Practicing in a team of experts provides the best care because the members make each other better for the sake of the patient. Mayo Clinic's pyramid is configured correctly, with the patient at the top and research and education as a foundation to improve patient care. In Latin doctor means teacher. It's our job to teach patients what they need to know so they can take control of their health rather than us prescribing or telling them what to do. This takes more time and humility, but it's more effective, I think. How do you contribute to the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association? My career is oriented around how to preserve the team-based system that allows doctors to practice in the way described in the Mayo Model of Care. Whenever I meet external alumni, they talk about those principles. I try to reconnect with alumni, and reconnect them to Mayo. What do you do in your spare time? My wife and I like to visit New Mexico. I enjoy the outdoors and fishing and hunting, and spending time with family and friends. What would people be surprised to know about you? I've worn a bolo tie every Friday for the last two years. I had a patient from Wyoming who made a big impact on me. His prognosis was to live for three years, but he lived for 15. He and his wife were raising their two grandchildren, and he wanted to be there for them. He overcame more physical challenges than anyone I've seen in my practice. He was a cowboy. One day I visited him in the ICU in my cowboy-best bolo tie, and he sat up and gave me a big bear hug. Shortly thereafter, he decided to turn off his ventilator and he died. I connected with his spirit and respected his fight. I told his wife I'd celebrate his life by wearing bolo ties. The exposure to various aspects of health care and my experience as a patient emboldened a sense of purpose toward healing the sick and broken.\" - Brian Rodysill 20 MAYO CLINIC ALUMNIrun and dance at weddings again. When I was fortunate enough to be accepted to Mayo Medical School, it was a no-brainer where to train to be a physician and conduct research in regenerative neurobiology. What lesson have you learned at Mayo Clinic? I have learned through my experiences as a patient and my training about all the little things surrounding patient care that make a huge difference in terms of healing and in the comfort of the patient and their family. What do you contribute to the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association? I offer perspective as a medical student looking at the changing landscape of medicine, with different experiences growing up than many other members of the Alumni Association and with an ability to connect with the millennial generation. What do you do in your spare time? I love the outdoors \u2014 hiking, running, swimming, reading a book on a park bench. I have been to all of the state parks in Minnesota and completed hiking the Superior Hiking Trail from Two Harbors, Minnesota, to the Canadian border. Recently I've taken up playing the banjo. Leah Schmelkin (MED '17) Board Member, Executive Committee, Mayo Medical School Student Representative Medical School: Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota Undergraduate: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Native of: Buffalo Grove, Illinois Why did you decide to pursue medicine? I used to wear a pink Power Ranger uniform and would only respond to the name of this character, Kimberly. I thought I could fly but discovered the force of gravity after a 5-foot leap from playground equipment. Even in my Power Ranger suit, I could not defy the laws of physics. I was beyond discouraged. I needed a new career that did not necessitate superpowers. Even at age 4 I understood the importance of focus and drive. Soon thereafter I discovered a passion for service and science. I felt most fulfilled when addressing the needs of others and most intrigued during science in school. Still driven to be a superhero of sorts, I began to pursue a career in medicine. I was shaped by volunteer experiences in a special-education classroom, on the wards in a psychiatric hospital and within a research laboratory at my undergraduate institution. What was your initial impression of Mayo Clinic? I remember my interview at Mayo Medical School as if it were two days ago rather than two years ago. I remember calling my mom from the shuttle to the airport, saying, \"This is Disney World! I cannot believe I got an interview.\" The day I received an acceptance call remains one of the most exciting of my life. I have not lost that sense of wonder. I feel humbled and honored by the opportunity to learn at this institution. What do you do in your spare time? I watch guilty-pleasure TV shows at the gym. At least I get in a good workout. What would people be surprised to know about you? I can recite the alphabet backward in three languages \u2014 English, Hebrew and French. My linguistic talents end there.

This developed into a 25-year collaboration that resulted in more than $12 million in NIH funding.\" That same year Kenton Kaufman, Ph.D. (BIOM '89), began working on his thesis with Dr. An. \"He provided me with the training necessary to begin my career, which has produced more than 200 publications and more than $40 million in funding. He is a tremendous person who cares more about his fellows and staff than anyone else I know.\" A decade later Dr. Kaufman became co-director of the Biomechanics Laboratory, and Dr. An extended his mentorship to Chunfeng Zhao, M.D. (BIOM '98, OR '00), then a new research fellow. \"I was an orthopedic surgeon who practiced in China for 15 years,\" says Dr. Zhao. \"I started my research career studying spine biomechanics under Dr. An's direction, then joined him and Dr. Amadio in the soft tissue research group. I am now a career scientist and full professor in orthopedics and biomedical engineering. I hold five Mayo patents, have published more than 180 peer-reviewed publications and have three current NIH grants. Not only did Dr. An help me establish my professional career, but we have become lifelong friends.\" In August 2015 Drs. Amadio, Zhao and Kaufman honored their research mentor with the International Symposium in Recognition of Kai-Nan An, Ph.D. The symposium highlighted key biomechanics findings that were conceived in the Biomechanics Laboratory at Mayo Clinic. More than 100 alumni from 10 countries attended \u2014 including 66 former fellows \u2014 demonstrating Dr. An's influence. \"Mayo Clinic is well known in orthopedic surgery in part due to the research conducted in the Biomechanics Laboratory by Dr. An, his staff and fellows,\" says Dr. Amadio. Dr. An joined the lab \u2014 founded in 1971 by Edmund Y.S. Chao, Ph.D. (ORR '74) \u2014 in 1975, became its director in 1992 and the John and Posy Krehbiel Professor of Orthopedics in 1993. In 2015 he received the Muybridge Award, the most prestigious award given by the International Society of Biomechanics. \"He made countless seminal contributions to biomechanics and has had an enormous impact on the profession,\" says Dr. Kaufman, the W. Hall Wendel, Jr., Musculoskeletal Research Professor. \"In hand and upper extremity biomechanics, he is one of very few legendary figures to make classical biomechanics recognized and accepted by our medical counterparts. He has trained more than 300 fellows from six continents and has won every research award from every society he's been affiliated with.

The new Mayo Clinic Building Phoenix features the Integrated Cancer Center on the third floor, Breast Center on the first floor, and Integrative Medicine Program and Department of Radiation Oncology on the concourse level. \"We've offered a loose collection of integrative medicine services for about 10 years,\" says Denise Millstine, M.D. (WHLTH '13), Division of Women's Health Internal Medicine. \"Now we have a dedicated space that ultimately will serve the entire clinical practice. Initially we're focusing on the cancer practice, but our colleagues in every discipline are encouraged to refer patients for integrative medicine consultation, education and services.\" Essential component of health care Dr. Millstine, one of four integrative medicine fellowship-trained physicians in the practice, says Arizona has a strong culture for what was formerly called complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). A recent survey of patients and caregivers distributed at Mayo Clinic in Arizona's Living with Cancer Symposium revealed a significant desire for integrative medicine offerings in cancer care. Many patients seek the services elsewhere in the community, without guidance or knowledge of a provider's training, cost effectiveness or value. Often they get advice from Patients expect these services and consider them when choosing where to have cancer treatment. Integrative medicine is proving to be an essential component of health care.\" - Denise Millstine, M.D.Integrative medicine consultation in the Integrated Cancer CenterPatients asked, Mayo Clinic answered Issue 4 2015 27medicine is a cornerstone of the new and improved cancer wellness initiatives starting with the consolidation of the Integrated Cancer Center in Arizona in 2016. \"Dr. Millstine and Arizona's Cancer Center leadership team have designed a cancer wellness program for our patients that aims to address their needs above the traditional diagnosis and treatment of the cancer,\" says Dr. Mesa. \"An assessment will accompany the beginning of a cancer patient's journey at our Center, and we will implement resources and programs including integrative medicine, education, nutrition, social work, rehabilitation, chaplain services and resiliency training to try and bring recovery and wellness to our patients.\" Under the same roof Donald Northfelt, M.D. (HEMO '02), Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, says having colleagues who are specialty trained in integrative medicine under the same roof is a decided advantage. \"These are Mayo colleagues we know and trust. I'm confident that their expertise can provide value to my patients. the Internet and family members. Patients indicated they want trustworthy resources and information about integrative medicine services at Mayo Clinic. \"Patients expect these services and consider them when choosing where to have cancer treatment,\" says Dr. Millstine. \"Integrative medicine is proving to be an essential component of health care. Patients look to Mayo as the most trusted leader in medical care to point them to high-value services. Mayo Clinic leadership is forward thinking and has put strong support behind this initiative.\" Ruben Mesa, M.D. (MED '95, I '98, HEMO '02), deputy director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, says integrative Denise Millstine, M.D. (center), regularly confers with Cancer Center colleagues including Donald Northfelt, M.D. (left), and Samir Patel, M.D. (right), to provide cancer patients with integrative medicine consultations and services including acupuncture, exercise, yoga, nutrition, massage and resilience training.Unless we look beyong strict science to understand what can benefit patients, we're depriving them of useful strategies they can use in managing their cancer.\" - Donald Northfelt, M.D. 28 MAYO CLINIC ALUMNI\"As a fellowship-trained medical oncologist, I didn't receive training in nutritional or physical activity strategies or herbal and natural products to promote patients' well-being. I need to look beyond the boundaries of my subspecialty for other ways to help patients. There's a vast world of strategies cancer patients use to enhance their well-being. If I limit my patients' care to my repertoire, they may miss out on a huge swath of valuable strategies with a basis in science and practice. Now I can reach out to other specialists who have that training.\" Beyond strict science Dr. Northfelt says his feelings about integative medicine have evolved. \"Years ago when patients asked for nutritional strategies or herbal supplements, I told them I didn't know anything about them. After 25 years of cancer practice, I've matured. My humility has increased as I've realized I don't have all the answers people seek and sometimes fail to help cure patients. Physicians have to Mayo Clinic in Arizona Consultative Medicine physicians Larry Bergstrom, M.D. (I '83) (left), and Luciana Funtowicz, M.D. (I '05) (center), work closely with Cancer Center colleagues including Deputy Director Ruben Mesa, M.D. (right). acknowledge there are issues and concerns our patients have that are outside the scope of what science has taught us to date. Unless we look beyond strict science to understand what can benefit patients, we're depriving them of useful strategies they can use in managing their cancer. I have an obligation to learn about and incorporate integrative medicine and reach out to colleagues for help to complement patients' care.\" Dr. Northfelt says he's proud of Mayo Clinic's open- mindedness and innovation in incorporating integrative medicine into the practice. \"Our patients want integrative medicine. I'd much rather they find quality services at Mayo Clinic from skilled providers rather than leave our care for what they seek. I'm grateful to Mayo Clinic for having breadth of thinking. We take information and knowledge even when it's a little outside the scope of science-based medical practice and incorporate it into providing better care for our patients.\" He cites acupuncture as an example. \"In its purest form, acupuncture is based on a theory of health that's Issue 4 2015 29stressed and overwhelmed and have difficulty coping with their diagnosis and treatment. Many patients manifest these concerns in ways such as insomnia, psychosocial conflicts or decreased generalized well- being. In a two-hour consultation with Dr. Millstine, they can learn about coping mechanisms, exercise, relaxation and nutrition. I've found that patients who have diseases that require lengthy treatment are particularly interested in integrative medicine and pleased that we're providing them with a safe space to discuss alternatives.\" Dr. Patel says providing integrative medicine options enhances patients' already-positive impressions of Mayo Clinic and its comprehensive approach to care. \"Our integrative medicine colleagues understand both sides of medicine \u2014 traditional practice and other therapies \u2014 and reconcile the two, using scientific evidence.\" Mayo Clinic in Arizona radiation oncologist William Rule, M.D. (RADO '11), points out that most treatment is done to the patient. \"Treatment can really beat up patients. Integrative medicine can help empower them and make them feel more in control.separate from our scientific approach \u2014 the traffic of qi in the body governing health. I may not understand it from my limited science-based perspective, but I must acknowledge there's something valuable there. This theory of health and illness has existed for thousands of years and is as alive today as it was centuries ago. Typically things don't persist without some value. I may tell a patient I don't understand how it will help them, but I don't want to stand in their way. I'll encourage and support what my integrative medicine colleagues do.\" Samir Patel, M.D. (RADO '11), Department of Radiation Oncology, says oncology tends to be very focused on technical, clinical aspects of treatment. \"We don't always address patients' overall well-being and quality of life. Yet many cancer patients are highly We can't ignore the basics that patients want and need such as managing stress, finding the mind- body connection, eating healthy and incorporating movement into their lives.\" - Denise Millstine, M.D. Radiation oncologist William Rule, M.D. (left), pictured with Consultative Medicine colleague Paul Snyder Jr, M.D. (I '81), says cancer treatment takes a toll on patients, and integrative medicine can empower them to feel more in control. 30 MAYO CLINIC ALUMNIThe vision for integrative oncology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona is one in which every patient has access to information about nutrition, exercise and mind-body strategies including resilience training, natural products and supplements to enable them to: Experience healing care including complementary and integrative medicine when appropriate Understand how they can use complementary and integrative medicine to enhance their health for the rest of their lives Receive honest, reliable information about integrative medicine Research will be part of the integrative medicine practice, leading to greater understanding of complementary and integrative medicine therapies in health and healing. The integrative medicine practice offers cancer patients and their loved ones services including: Acupuncture Dietitian Exercise and yoga Massage for patients and caregivers Resilience/mindfulness training A vision for integrative oncology \"Patients have wanted this and have been doing it whether we knew about it or not. Many patients ask about supplements, and many of us have been willfully ignorant about them. Let's get them in with our colleagues who do know about integrative medicine and what is safe and will not interfere with their cancer treatment. If our integrative medicine colleagues are reasonably certain that an integrative therapy is not harmful, and it potentially brings value to patients, it's worth it. We're always striving to improve patients' quality of life in some way, shape or form.\" Full disclosure Dr. Millstine points out that while 64 to 81 percent of cancer survivors reportedly use supplements, many do not disclose their use of integrative medicine therapies because providers don't ask, patients anticipate they won't approve or patients think the information is irrelevant. \"It's important for us to know if patients are taking dietary supplements because some can interact negatively with treatment,\" she says. For example, popular antioxidants may affect treatment efficacy, and fish oil supplements may be associated with chemotherapy resistance. Back to basics Dr. Millstine says integrative medicine plays a supportive role in the disease journey and focuses on healing and facilitating health rather than curing or managing disease \u2014 with an array of approaches to accompany conventional treatment. \"Now, when patients are treated for cancer, our oncology specialists will still talk to them about chemotherapy, radiation therapy, medical oncology and surgery as they always have. But patients will also be offered a consultation with integrative medicine to help keep them healthy and mitigate the side effects of treatment. Services are evidence-informed and emphasize patient safety and value.\" Dr. Millstine applauds the arrival of sophisticated technology for cancer patients, such as the new proton beam therapy program, but says patients also want \"the basics.\" \"We can't ignore the basics that patients want and need such as managing stress, finding the mind-body connection, eating healthy and incorporating movement into their lives. We can give patients more \u2014 the latest and greatest as well as some essential aspects of care.\" Most health insurance plans cover integrative medicine physician consultations. For other services, patients pay out- of-pocket and can submit to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

The fourth quarter-century Issue 4 2015 35INNOVATION AND 1991-2015 TRANSFORMATIONNEW WAYS TO SERVE HUMANITY IN INCREASINGLY CONNECTED WORLD Mayo Clinic has continued to maintain the legacy of its founders while finding new ways to serve humanity with innovative practice models \u2014 including the Mayo Clinic Care Network and telemedicine \u2014 and alumni in increasingly diverse roles and nontraditional fields. Similar to the preceding 25 years, the most recent quarter-century saw dizzying change \u2014 connectivity to reach patients outside of conventional venues, individualized medicine, health care reform, greater emphasis on diversity, partnerships and changes in education. Despite all the change, the Alumni Association served as a unifying force and touchstone to its members. A change in the landscape In 1991 alumni were invited back to Rochester to witness significant changes in the physical landscape. Biennial Meeting General Chair Joseph Gibilisco, D.D.S. (OMS '56), said: ... we think our alumni family will find this return \"home\" particularly rewarding. At no time in our history has Mayo undergone such enormous physical change. Among these are the integration with Saint Marys and Rochester Methodist hospitals, the construction of new facilities as well as the addition of new buildings, and the expansions to Jacksonville and Scottsdale. Despite these many changes, Mayo has retained its oneness as a national and international health care resource. Gordon Moore, M.D. (I '64, P '67), then secretary- treasurer of the Alumni Association, said: In the last 150 years, particularly in Western society, most of us defined our goals and personal change in association with educational experiences. I suspect a collective desire to recall the defining experience at Mayo is the adhesive that binds together our association. The beneficial things we do as an association are a tangible acknowledgment of a very personal yet shared period of our lives. 36 MAYO CLINIC ALUMNIAll was not rosy and nostalgic. Looming in the decade were health care costs increasing at twice the rate of inflation. Sixteen percent of Americans were insured, and managed care was expanding to control costs. The 1991 meeting theme was \"Toward the 21st Century,\" and Keith Kelly, M.D. (PHYS '67, S '68), chair of the Department of Surgery, spoke to alumni about trends, including: Increase in group practices. A shorter work week \u2014 \"Young doctors want a more balanced lifestyle, and that's probably a good thing. But they must recognize that they will get less pay. And we must ensure that decreased hours or a shorter work week does not impair patient care.\" More women in surgery \u2014 Heidi Nelson, M.D. (CRS '88, S '89), the first woman surgeon at Mayo Clinic, joined the practice the previous year. Increase in subspecialization \u2014 No new surgical specialties had been certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties since the \"specialization era\" peaked in the '60s, but subspecialty certificates were emerging. Increasing technology \u2014 \"Twenty years ago when doing a liver resection, I used to ask the nurse for a scalpel. Today, Dr. [David] Nagorney [S '82] in our department asks for a $50,000 ultrasonic dissector and a $20,000 ultrasonic imaging device that shows exactly where the veins of the liver are during the dissection. Technology has allowed more complicated surgery that is faster and safer.\" Change in focus \u2014 Patients wanted to participate in decisions about their treatment and quality of life after surgery. 1991 Patient registrations grew by the fastest rate since 1975. However, one-half of the increase came from patients covered by Medicare, to whom services were provided \"below cost.\" For the first time in two decades, the number of new patient registrations increased. 1991 Mayo Clinic established the Office of Minority Student Affairs for the Department of Education Services to attract an ethnically diverse student and resident population. By 1996 underrepresented minority applications to Mayo Medical School would increase from fewer than 100 to 350, comprising 16 percent of the student body \u2014 compared to 11 percent for all U.S. medical schools. James Berens, M.D. President 19911993 Heidi Nelson, M.D. 1991 Mayo Graduate School admitted its first students into a neuroscience Ph.D. track. 1991 The Mayo Alumnus magazine name changed to Mayo Alumni explaining: \"It is a small but significant change, one which we think represents individuals, not merely an individual, and which better recognizes that those individuals are men and women.\" 1992 Mayo began to form Mayo Clinic Health System, a regional network of clinics and hospitals. A practice in Decorah, Iowa, was the first to join. 1991 1992 37Prevailing health care economics The economics of health care dominated conversation in the 1990s. At the 1993 Biennial Meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, Louis Rukeyser, economic commentator and host of the PBS program \"Wall Street Week,\" spoke at the President's Dinner. Secretary-Treasurer Stephen Harner, M.D. (ENT '73), reached out to alumni in 1994, beseeching them to act on health care reform: Mayo Foundation is attempting to influence legislation at the federal and state level with some success. I urge each of you to look at the opportunities that are available in your community. Each of us can write to our legislators; it does have an effect. In addition, communication with legislators and other officials at the state and federal level is important. Finally, financial support is imperative. For those of us who have benefited, we need to support legislators who have similar views, and institutions such as Mayo that will feel the effects of decreased funding [for education and research] in the future.Mayo Clinic and the Alumni Association continued to address the financial implications of changes in the health care environment. David Herman, M.D. (MMS '83, OPH '87), Scientific Program chair, noted the 1995 Biennial Meeting in San Diego, California, would be different, with education programs in the morning hours and afternoons free, to attract more alumni participation: \"With the changing reimbursement patterns in medicine, all of us are becoming more selective in how we spend our CME funds, and the Mayo Alumni Association is trying to provide a unique program for our alumni to consider.\" Mayo Clinic President and CEO Robert Waller, M.D. (I '67, OPH '70), addressed alumni at the meeting regarding bewildering changes: \"Someone has said that if you are not confused by what is happening in health care these days, you are not thinking clearly.\" He cited issues including possible federal and state legislation, the growth of business coalitions, managed care and for-profit medical organizations. Dr. Waller said by the year 2000 Mayo hoped to have further defined inpatient, outpatient and preventive home-health care practices, increased the number of managed-care networks and made hospital practices even more efficient. 1993 Mayo took possession of the Ozmun Building, former site of the Olmsted County Courthouse. Frank Gatchell, M.D. President 199319951993 The Generose Building was dedicated. Joseph Romness, M.D. President 199519971994 Construction began on a new outpatient care building located on the site of the Damon Parkade and attached to the Mayo Building. 1994 Mayo Clinic Scottsdale opened its Mayo Thunderbird Family Medicine Center with an electronic medical record (EMR). Mayo Clinic Jacksonville planned to roll out an EMR to its entire clinic soon thereafter. Mayo Clinic Rochester had projects underway to study EMRs dating back to 1966. 1995 The Alumni Association introduced an Internet presence and email address. 1993 1994 1995 38 At the 1997 Biennial Meeting in Rochester, Dr. Waller reminded alumni that it often takes decades for the nation to resolve issues of major social concern \u2014 citing civil rights and environmental legislation \u2014 and that it was still the relatively early stages of the health care debate. Alumni Association President Joseph Romness, M.D. (OR '55), of Arlington, Virginia, passed the gavel to Dr. Gordon Moore, who had interesting observations about the changes in health care and medical education: I hear some in the profession saying, \"Woe is me, how can we go on!\" But the way I see it, no one has stopped wanting doctors to take care of them. I see patients every day and listen to them. ... That fundamental relationship is not going to change. ... There was a time when, if you didn't cure the patient, you got your head cut off. So it's always had its hazards. No one wants to ban physicians. People just want some say in how it all works. ... [being a physician] is still a grand thing to do, if you do it for the right reasons.Arnold Relman, M.D., former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine and the 1995 Judd-Plummer lecturer, said that medicine faced problems that could be solved only by physicians, and he called upon them to assume leadership in determining what medicine would be like in the future: The practice of medicine is now truly under corporate contract. Physicians are being told what to do and are facing restraints in their practice. Moreover, insurance companies are increasingly limiting what they will and will not cover. ... The problem is that the task was not taken by the health care providers themselves, by doctors and their organizations; somebody else stepped in. That somebody else was industry. ... Now managed care is the single major factor in the American health care system. ... We have to ask ourselves what this means for the practice of medicine 10, 20 or 30 years from now. ... These are our problems. We are in hot water now because we have not realized our role. We have been too focused on our narrow, but profoundly important professional responsibilities. In a 1997 survey of alumni, many expressed their certainty that Mayo Clinic would prevail despite drastic changes in health care. Indicative of the comments was: \"Mayo will endure. There will be good and bad times from economic and government influences, but the Mayo tradition and character will outlast adversity.\" 1996 Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education had started 20 new residency and fellowship programs based at sites other than Rochester since 1992. Richard Hurt, M.D. 1996 Mayo School of Continuing Medical Education formally became a school to facilitate lifelong accessibility to medical education. Gordon Moore, M.D. President 199719991998 In the Minnesota tobacco trial, tobacco companies agreed to pay a record $6.6 billion in an out-of-court settlement that changed the way Americans viewed tobacco. Mayo Clinic's Richard Hurt, M.D. (I '76), was the first witness against the tobacco industry. This was the first lawsuit in the nation pitting tobacco companies as a group against taxpayers to go to trial. 1998 Mayo Clinic Hospital opened in Scottsdale, Arizona. 1996 1998 Issue 4 2015 39Recognition of changes in association makeup In 1998 the Alumni Association reflected on changes in its makeup. Secretary-Treasurer of the Alumni Association Dr. Stephen Harner said: The Mayo Alumni Association has a long and illustrious history. Originally founded by the fellows in the early part of the 20th century to maintain an educational link to Mayo, over time the organization has expanded to include all physicians who have completed a defined program at Mayo Foundation. In addition, graduates of Mayo Medical School and Mayo Graduate School are members. For those who think only of those programs in Rochester, it is important to remember the students completing their studies and training in Scottsdale, Jacksonville, Des Moines and St. Cloud. The alumni association office in Rochester has had to adapt to the challenges of Mayo's expanding educational activities while looking for innovative ways to achieve our mission. The decade concluded with the 1999 Biennial Meeting in Acapulco, Mexico \u2014 the first outside of the United States since the 1981 meeting in Montreal. The Judd-Plummer lecturer was Donato Alarcon-Segovia, M.D. (I '64, RHEU '65), of Mexico City. Members of the Mexican press were present throughout most of the meeting. President Dr. Moore said: Mayo Clinic has been international since its founders, Doctors Will and Charlie, fostered a world view by their travel, relationships with physicians outside the United States and support of training of international graduates. Through Mayo's International Activities Coordinating Committee, attempts are ongoing to offer a more complete understanding of Mayo at various international sites. ... These efforts are directed towards mutually beneficial relationships. ... The Mayo Alumni Association also is becoming more inter-national. Through our travel program, get-togethers with international alumni have occurred in Ireland, Italy, Australia, Scandinavia, Singapore, Bali, Germany and the Malaysian state of Sarawak in the last few years. The German- speaking and the European Mayo alumni associations have formed and are thriving entities, holding annual meetings. In other countries, alumni meet under less formal auspices. Dr. Harner noted that the alumni office fielded ongoing requests for Mayo-trained physicians around the world. He said there are few places where such requests cannot be accommodated, with more than 14,000 alumni in more than 60 countries. \"Their sheer numbers and extent of their worldwide distribution speak volumes about the prevalence of their global influence and the substantial contributions that they return to the institutions whose values they carry.\" Gerald Bechamps, M.D. President 19992001 1999 About 30 percent of patients at Mayo Clinic in Rochester were covered by managed care contracts.2000 The Stabile Building opened at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. 2000 Mayo Clinic's Genomics Task Force issued recommendations for strategies to integrate genomic research at Mayo and prepare staff and students for developments in medical genomics. 2000 The Transplant Center opened in the Charlton Building at Mayo Clinic in Rochester \u2014 the first multidisciplinary transplant center in the country. 1999 2000 40 2001 The bronze doors of the Plummer Building were closed Friday, Sept. 14 \u2014 the first time this century. The closing marked the National Day of Prayer and Remembrance in honor of the victims of the attacks on Sept. 11.New challenges in a new century In the 2000s Mayo Clinic faced managed care and health care reform, and genomics was big news in research. A shortage of some allied health care workers was evident, and Mayo expanded its education programs for graduate medical education and allied health care despite declining federal support for medical education. Patients increasingly became conscientious consumers of health care services \u2014 the result of growing personal accountability for health, an increasing demand for accurate, reliable health information and the public's increased awareness of medical errors. Mayo Clinic responded by reaffirming the Mayo Model of Care and its tenets \u2014 adequate time with the patient, a defined doctor in charge, multispecialty teamwork, a thorough explanation of diagnoses and therapies, and timely, comprehensive communication and coordination with the home physician. The first Alumni Association Biennial Meeting of the new century was in Atlanta, Georgia. President Christine Mroz-Baier, M.D. (S '73), of Memphis, Tennessee, reminded alumni of the value in reconnecting with Mayo roots: I have often said that the best years of my medical career have been those I spent as a fellow at Mayo Clinic Rochester. The total dedication to patient care, the quiet pride of being part of something special, the camaraderie with other fellows and the benefit of learning by example of admired consultants made this a truly rewarding experience. Ten years after I left the clinic in 1978, I was feeling the wear and tear of private practice, including managed care contracts, malpractice threats and the pressures of coordinating career and family. About that time, I went to my first International Meeting [Biennial Meeting] of the alumni association, which was held in Rochester. That visit with old friends and consultants completely stimulated my interest in learning again. I was reminded of the Mayo motto, \"The Needs of the Patient Come First,\" which restored satisfaction and joy in my daily practice of medicine. 2001 Mayo Clinic Health System had grown to encompass clinics, hospitals and nursing homes in 60 communities in southern Minnesota, northern Iowa and western Wisconsin. 2001 The 20-story Gonda Building opened at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, with special activities for alumni in attendance at grand opening events. The Alumni Association dedicated a piece of art to the building \u2014 a 63-foot double-panel mural titled \"My Brother and I,\" which presents the seasons of personal and professional life as experienced by the Mayo brothers.2001 Mayo Clinic introduced a modified three-shield logo that included the full Mayo Clinic name. Christine Mroz-Baier, M.D. President 200120032001 Mayo Clinic in Rochester welcomed its 6 millionth patient. 2002 A study showed Mayo Clinic's economic impact on the state of Minnesota in 2000 was $3.97 billion \u2014 1.3 percent of the total state economy. The study's author said Mayo Clinic's impact in Minnesota was bigger than the state impact of any other health care organization studied. The impact exceeded that of all Minnesota's professional sports and hospitality industries combined. 2002 Internal medicine alumni formed the Plummer Society to recognize and celebrate its specialty. 2001 2002 Issue 4 2015 41Sticking close to Mayo homes for meetings The 2003 Biennial Meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, began the location rotation among Mayo Clinic cities exclusively. Dr. Mroz-Baier handed the gavel to new president T. Paul O'Donovan, M.D. (I '66, CV '67), of Chicago, Illinois, and two new awards were established by the Alumni Association \u2014 the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association Professional Achievement Award and the Humanitarian Award. The first recipient of the Professional Achievement Award was Bernard Harris, M.D. (I '85), a former NASA astronaut and president and chief executive officer of a venture capital business accelerator for medical informatics and technology. The first recipients of the Humanitarian Award were Mayo Clinic's Kenneth Calamia, M.D. (I '78, RHEU '81), and William Fryda, M.D. (I '78, HEM '80), a Catholic priest. The 2005 Biennial Meeting was in Jacksonville, Florida, and then it was back to Rochester in 2007. Glenn Forbes, M.D. (R-D '77), CEO of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, welcomed alumni: Alumni are the expression of our principles to the outside world. We are pleased to have you here in Rochester where all of us, at one time or another, worked and learned the value of teamwork and the importance of putting patients at the center of all that we do. 2003 The most powerful magnet ever made for research into cellular proteins and DNA was installed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. 2003 Mayo Clinic created a single unifying name to represent its research and education programs \u2014 Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. T. Paul O'Donovan, M.D. President 200320052004 Alumni in dermatology formed the O'Leary Society.2004 Mayo Clinic in Rochester moved to EMRs for its 1.5 million annual outpatient visits \u2014 a technology milestone. 2005 The Mayo Clinic Multidisciplinary Simulation Center opened in Rochester. Scott Litin, M.D. President 20052007 2005 A new biomedical scientific facility that joined Mayo Clinic and the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in a unique strategic partnership opened on the Scottsdale campus of Mayo Clinic. 2003 2004 2005 42 A new era in leadership Mayo Clinic's change in leadership was manifest at the 2009 Biennial Meeting in Arizona. Denis Cortese, M.D. (I-1 '71, I '72, THD '76), outgoing president and CEO of Mayo Clinic, attended as did his successor, John Noseworthy, M.D. (N '90). Dr. Cortese, also the Judd-Plummer lecturer, addressed current efforts in health care reform. New Alumni Association President Mark Laney, M.D. (PDN '89), of St. Joseph, Missouri, said about Dr. Cortese's impact on Mayo Clinic: \"[He] established a road map for the future and helped make words like transformation, health care delivery and individualized medicine part of everyday language at Mayo Clinic.\" Dr. Laney continued, commenting on the Mayo principles: Mayo had a huge, lasting effect on me. I learned to practice team medicine and the advantages of a multispecialty group practice. I learned the importance of physician leadership in medicine and why the needs of the patient should come first. Mayo-trained physicians have influenced the practice of medicine and replicated the Mayo Model of Care around the world. I've applied the Mayo principles in building and maturing the practices I've been involved with. Mayo is a national treasure, and it has invested in me. Everyone who trained at Mayo takes a bit of it wherever they go. The values the brothers built the clinic on are alive and well around the world, through Mayo alumni. What a wonderful story. Scott Litin, M.D. President 200520072007 Mayo Clinic established a Center for Innovation to transform the way health care is experienced and delivered. David Teegarden, M.D. President 20072009 2008 Thirty-seven percent of Mayo's residents were women, compared to 9.8 percent in 1978. 2008 Mayo Clinic opened a new 214-bed hospital at its Jacksonville, Florida, campus, uniting hospital services, specialty care and physician visits in one location.2008 Mayo Clinic's commitment to education was demonstrated by these numbers: 1,469 clinical residents and fellows in the Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education; 271 predoctoral and other students in the Mayo Graduate School; 169 students in Mayo Medical School; and more than 1,400 students in Mayo School of Health Sciences. 2009 The Mayo brothers were inducted into the Healthcare Hall of Fame. Mark Laney, M.D. President 20092011 2007 2008 2009 43Looming reform just one more storm to weather Health care reform hadn't receded in prominence. In fact it was the centerpiece of a panel discussion at the 2011 Biennial Meeting at Mayo Clinic in Florida. Mary Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council in Washington, D.C., told alumni: \"Mayo is an example of what the health care system should be about. There's no problem we can't solve if we could just find a way to 'Mayo-ize' the entire system. There are many lessons we can learn from what Mayo has done and what is underway.\" Grealy commented that while health care reform had been viewed as a battle, it was really just a warmup of things to come. \"There is a battling over budgets in a way I have never seen before. Deficit reduction is a primary focus and is part of the debate every day. There's no question health care is going to play a significant role in these discussions. The question is whether the impact will be for the better or for worse.\"Back in Rochester for the 2013 Alumni Association Biennial Meeting, Judd-Plummer lecturer Marilyn Carlson Nelson, former chair and CEO of Carlson and a member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees, reassured alumni that Mayo would persevere because of its stalwart foundation: An organization's culture sees it through crises. Mayo was born of a stormy past. Organizations that hold tight to their foundations can weather storms. When patients acknowledge you and your expertise, it's because of 'the Mayo effect' \u2014 where you came from. 2010 Mayo Clinic established an Office of Diversity and Inclusion to build greater diversity into every level of the organization. 2010 A study showed that Mayo Clinic directly and indirectly supported more than 144,000 jobs throughout the United States, with an annual economic impact on the U.S. economy of $22 billion. 2011 The Mayo Clinic Care Network was established to improve the delivery of health care to patients and communities and provide Mayo's subspecialty care to patients without ever leaving home. 2011 Mayo Clinic launched the Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery to improve how health care is delivered; Center for Individualized Medicine to understand patients at a molecular level and to customize treatment; and Center for Regenerative Medicine to restore damaged tissues and organs, and offer hope for people with conditions beyond repair by conventional medicine. Eric Grigsby, M.D. President 20112013 2012 Approximately 11,000 patients participated in clinical trials at Mayo Clinic. The Institutional Review Board approved 2,686 new human studies. 2013 A new multidisciplinary simulation center opened at Mayo Clinic in Florida. 2013 Destination Medical Center, an innovative partnership, was established when the state of Minnesota agreed to support an estimated $5.6 billion in capital investments over 20 years. It was projected that this initiative would secure Mayo Clinic's and the state of Minnesota's position as a global medical destination. 2010 2011 2012 2013 44 REFLECTIONS OF A PAST PRESIDENT Mark Laney, M.D. (PDN '89) St. Joseph, Missouri President 20092011 Dr. Laney describes his presidency as a transitional time. \"We were moving from print to electronic communication for many matters, and we devoted a lot of time to what became the Alumni Association's website,\" he says. \"We focused on strategic planning for our very changing demographic. Different ages wanted different things from the association, and we took steps to remain relevant into the future.\"Dr. Laney, president of Heartland Health, reflects on his term as president: \"I wanted to do something that would give back to Mayo Clinic in appreciation for everything they did in my professional life. I got to see the inner workings of Mayo Clinic, got to know Dr. Noseworthy personally and attended the international meeting in Argentina. The more you put into the Alumni Association, the more you get out of it. It's a great way to stay close to Mayo Clinic, and it can help you meet amazing, brilliant people from all over the world who share your training.\" Juan Sarmiento, M.D. President 201320152014 Mayo Clinic celebrated its sesquicentennial with events throughout the year and a mobile exhibit that traveled the United States and Canada. 2014 Mayo Clinic achieved the highest honor in the 20142015 U.S. News & World Report ranking of top hospitals, with more number-one rankings than any other provider.2014 Saint Marys Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Rochester transitioned to a single licensed hospital and became known as Mayo Clinic Hospital Rochester. 2015 Mayo Clinic in Arizona debuted a new building to house its consolidated Cancer Center practice and its new proton beam therapy program. 2015 Mayo Clinic in Rochester began treating patients with proton beam therapy. 2015 Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education celebrated its centennial.
