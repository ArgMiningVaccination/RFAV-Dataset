Did also know that before children ever died from auto accidents, most died from infections? Now we have methods to prevent both. With steady improvements and newer technology, we can protect our children with the right car seats and vaccines. There's an interesting analogy between protecting your baby from an auto accident and choosing to vaccinate against diseases like the flu. While it's unlikely a random car ride to the grocery store or school will involve an auto accident, on the rare chance you need it, a car seat can save your child from major injury or death. The same applies for vaccines. Consider the influenza vaccine. Whether it's a child at school, a teen walking around the mall or an infant at home with their parents, chances are they will not be exposed or infected with these germs on any given day. But on the one day it does happen, no parent should ever have to after-the-fact regret missing the chance to vaccinate their child from a now vaccine-preventable disease. But some parents do not view vaccines like car seats. Unfortunately, each year, in the United States, healthy children die from seasonal influenza, which many disregard as a mild illness. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/features/flu/)(CDC) reported that in 2013, 90% of pediatric deaths were in unvaccinated children and as of March of that year, 105 children had died from a flu-related illness. Two main reasons why parents opt-out of getting their family vaccinated is the fear of short term mild illness as a vaccine side-effect and not fully understanding the severity of the flu virus. Short term worries, such as side-effects should be the least concerning part of getting vaccinated. It's important to focus on how severe the flu could be to your child in the long run if they were to get sick. The way I look at a parent's decision whether to vaccinate their child for the flu or any other illness is simple and the car seat analogy is perfect. Every once in a while, you may encounter a struggle from your infant or toddler about the car seat, or may accidentally pinch a leg when clicking the buckle (my kids can attest to this!). But with the potential rare short-term risk of getting a thigh pinched comes the added security knowing that I have done everything I can to ensure the safety of my child while driving on the roads. Giving myself and my family the flu vaccine isn't any different. It is the best way I know (in addition to good hygiene) of minimizing our risk of acquiring an illness that can cause us and others significant harm.
