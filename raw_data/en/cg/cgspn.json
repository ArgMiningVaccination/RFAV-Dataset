According to TCM, the human body is composed of energy pathways that flow through the body and connect to organs. Acupuncture is said to stimulate these energy pathways and restore balance in the body. A variety of health conditions can be treated with acupuncture, including pain, anxiety, fatigue, and menstrual cramps. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to the question, as the frequency of treatments will depend on the individual's health condition, the severity of their symptoms, and their overall health. However, here's a look into the realities of how often a person should get acupuncture. 1) The Schedule and Session Should Be Done Semi-Regularly Acupuncture has been shown to provide a wide range of benefits, but it's important to keep in mind that these benefits are not always immediate. In other words, you may not notice a difference after your first session. To ensure the most out of acupuncture, schedule semi-regular sessions. Around four to six sessions about one to two times a week are recommended. Afterward, going bi-weekly before transitioning to a monthly visit is the general arrangement. 2) Waiting Too Long Can Lessen Overall Effectiveness While it may be implied above, it's best to note that if you wait too long between acupuncture sessions, you may not get the full benefits of the treatment. This is because the effects of acupuncture are cumulative, meaning that each session builds on the last. On top of that, the lack of effectiveness is because the body will have already started to heal itself, and acupuncture will not be able to have the same effect. Thus, don't wait too long in between sessions to get the full benefits of the treatment. 3) Chronic Conditions Require Regular Appointments If you suffer from a chronic condition, it is best to see an acupuncturist on a more regular basis compared to others. This is because chronic conditions require long-term treatment, and acupuncture is most effective when it is received more frequently. On top of that, chronic conditions tend to flare up from time to time, and it is best to be prepared with regular acupuncture appointments. This way, you can prevent the flare-ups from happening or at least lessen their severity. 4) Frequency Should Be Adjusted Along the Seasons Another important factor to consider is the season. Acupuncture is most effective when it is adjusted according to the season. For example, in the spring, it is best to receive acupuncture more frequently to promote detoxification. In the summer, on the other hand, it is best to receive acupuncture less frequently to prevent the body from overheating. In the fall, acupuncture should be focused on boosting the immune system, and in the winter, it should be focused on warming the body. Conclusion Some people may need to get acupuncture several times a week, while others may only need it once a month if they've gone through sessions before. It is important to work with a qualified acupuncturist to determine the best course of treatment. In need of acupuncture services?
